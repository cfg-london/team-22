  <p>The storyteller and poet of our time, as in
  any other time, must be an entertainer of the spirit in the full
  sense of the word, not just a preacher of social or political
  ideals. There is no paradise for bored readers and no excuse for
  tedious literature that does not intrigue the reader, uplift him,
  give him the joy and the escape that true art always grants.
  Nevertheless, it is also true that the serious writer of our time
  must be deeply concerned about the problems of his generation. He
  cannot but see that the power of religion, especially belief in
  revelation, is weaker today than it was in any other epoch in
  human history. More and more children grow up without faith in
  God, without belief in reward and punishment, in the immortality
  of the soul and even in the validity of ethics. The genuine
  writer cannot ignore the fact that the family is losing its
  spiritual foundation. All the dismal prophecies of Oswald
  Spengler have become realities since the Second World War. No
  technological achievements can mitigate the disappointment of
  modern man, his loneliness, his feeling of inferiority, and his
  fear of war, revolution and terror. Not only has our generation
  lost faith in Providence but also in man himself, in his
  institutions and often in those who are nearest to him.<br>
  <br>
  In their despair a number of those who no longer have confidence
  in the leadership of our society look up to the writer, the
  master of words. They hope against hope that the man of talent
  and sensitivity can perhaps rescue civilization. Maybe there is a
  spark of the prophet in the artist after all.<br>
  <br>
  As the son of a people who received the worst blows that human
  madness can inflict, I must brood about the forthcoming dangers.
  I have many times resigned myself to never finding a true way
  out. But a new hope always emerges telling me that it is not yet
  too late for all of us to take stock and make a decision. I was
  brought up to believe in free will. Although I came to doubt all
  revelation, I can never accept the idea that the Universe is a
  physical or chemical accident, a result of blind evolution. Even
  though I learned to recognize the lies, the clich&eacute;s and the
  idolatries of the human mind, I still cling to some truths which
  I think all of us might accept some day. There must be a way for
  man to attain all possible pleasures, all the powers and
  knowledge that nature can grant him, and still serve God - a God
  who speaks in deeds, not in words, and whose vocabulary is the
  Cosmos.<br>
  <br>
  I am not ashamed to admit that I belong to those who fantasize
  that literature is capable of bringing new horizons and new
  perspectives - philosophical, religious, aesthetical and even
  social. In the history of old Jewish literature there was never
  any basic difference between the poet and the prophet. Our
  ancient poetry often became law and a way of life.<br>
  <br>
  Some of my cronies in the cafeteria near the Jewish Daily Forward
  in New York call me a pessimist and a decadent, but there is
  always a background of faith behind resignation. I found comfort
  in such pessimists and decadents as Baudelaire, Verlaine, Edgar
  Allan Poe, and Strindberg. My interest in psychic research made
  me find solace in such mystics as your Swedenborg and in our own
  Rabbi Nachman Bratzlaver, as well as in a great poet of my time,
  my friend Aaron Zeitlin who died a few years ago and left a
  literary inheritance of high quality, most of it in
  Yiddish.<br>
  <br>
  The pessimism of the creative person is not decadence but a
  mighty passion for the redemption of man. While the poet
  entertains he continues to search for eternal truths, for the
  essence of being. In his own fashion he tries to solve the riddle
  of time and change, to find an answer to suffering, to reveal
  love in the very abyss of cruelty and injustice. Strange as these
  words may sound I often play with the idea that when all the
  social theories collapse and wars and revolutions leave humanity
  in utter gloom, the poet - whom Plato banned from his Republic -
  may rise up to save us all.<br>
  <br>
  The high honor bestowed upon me by the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1978/singer-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> is also a recognition of the Yiddish language - a
  language of exile, without a land, without frontiers, not
  supported by any government, a language which possesses no words
  for weapons, ammunition, military exercises, war tactics; a
  language that was despised by both gentiles and emancipated Jews.
  The truth is that what the great religions preached, the
  Yiddish-speaking people of the ghettos practiced day in and day
  out. They were the people of The Book in the truest sense of the
  word. They knew of no greater joy than the study of man and human
  relations, which they called Torah, Talmud, Mussar, Cabala. The
  ghetto was not only a place of refuge for a persecuted minority
  but a great experiment in peace, in self-discipline and in
  humanism. As such it still exists and refuses to give up in spite
  of all the brutality that surrounds it. I was brought up among
  those people. My father's home on Krochmalna Street in Warsaw was
  a study house, a court of justice, a house of prayer, of
  storytelling, as well as a place for weddings and Chassidic
  banquets. As a child I had heard from my older brother and
  master, I. J. Singer, who later wrote <i>The Brothers
  Ashkenazi,</i> all the arguments that the rationalists from
  Spinoza to Max Nordau brought out against religion. I have heard
  from my father and mother all the answers that faith in God could
  offer to those who doubt and search for the truth. In our home
  and in many other homes the eternal questions were more actual
  than the latest news in the Yiddish newspaper. In spite of all
  the disenchantments and all my skepticism I believe that the
  nations can learn much from those Jews, their way of thinking,
  their way of bringing up children, their finding happiness where
  others see nothing but misery and humiliation. To me the Yiddish
  language and the conduct of those who spoke it are identical. One
  can find in the Yiddish tongue and in the Yiddish spirit
  expressions of pious joy, lust for life, longing for the Messiah,
  patience and deep appreciation of human individuality. There is a
  quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life,
  every crumb of success, each encounter of love. The Yiddish
  mentality is not haughty. It does not take victory for granted.
  It does not demand and command but it muddles through, sneaks by,
  smuggles itself amidst the powers of destruction, knowing
  somewhere that God's plan for Creation is still at the very
  beginning.<br>

  There are some who call Yiddish a dead language, but so was
  Hebrew called for two thousand years. It has been revived in our
  time in a most remarkable, almost miraculous way. Aramaic was
  certainly a dead language for centuries but then it brought to
  light the Zohar, a work of mysticism of sublime value. It is a
  fact that the classics of Yiddish literature are also the
  classics of the modern Hebrew literature. Yiddish has not yet
  said its last word. It contains treasures that have not been
  revealed to the eyes of the world. It was the tongue of martyrs
  and saints, of dreamers and Cabalists - rich in humor and in
  memories that mankind may never forget. In a figurative way,
  Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom of
  frightened and hopeful Humanity.</p>
