  <h1>Otto Warburg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="warburg.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Otto
  Heinrich Warburg</b> was born on October 8, 1883, in Freiburg,
  Baden. His father, the physicist Emil Warburg, was President of
  the Physikalische Reichsanstalt, Wirklicher Geheimer
  Oberregierungsrat. Otto studied chemistry under the great
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a>,
  and gained the degree, Doctor of Chemistry (Berlin), in 1906. He
  then studied under von Krehl and obtained the degree, Doctor of
  Medicine (Heidelberg), in 1911. He served in the Prussian Horse
  Guards during World War I. In 1918 he was appointed Professor at
  the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Berlin-Dahlem. Since
  1931 he is Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Cell
  Physiology, there, a donation of the Rockefeller
  Foundation to the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft, founded the
  previous year.<br>

  Warburg's early researches with Fischer were in the polypeptide
  field. At Heidelberg he worked on the process of oxidation. His
  special interest in the investigation of vital processes by
  physical and chemical methods led to attempts to relate these
  processes to phenomena of the inorganic world. His methods
  involved detailed studies on the assimilation of carbon dioxide
  in plants, the metabolism of tumors, and the chemical constituent
  of the oxygen transferring respiratory ferment. Warburg was never
  a teacher, and he has always been grateful for his opportunities
  to devote his whole time to scientific research. His later
  researches at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute have led to the
  discovery that the flavins and the nicotinamide were the active
  groups of the hydrogen-transferring enzymes. This, together with
  the iron-oxygenase discovered earlier, has given a complete
  account of the oxidations and reductions in the living world. For
  his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory
  enzyme, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to him in 1931. This
  discovery has opened up new ways in the fields of cellular
  metabolism and cellular respiration. He has shown, among other
  things, that cancerous cells can live and develop, even in the
  absence of oxygen.<br>

  In addition to many publications of a minor nature, Warburg is
  the author of <i>Stoffwechsel der Tumoren (1926)</i>,
  <i>Katalytische Wirkungen der lebendigen Substanz (1928)</i>,
  <i>Schwermetalle als Wirkungsgruppen von Fermenten (1946)</i>,
  <i>Wasserstoff&uuml;bertragende Fermente (1948)</i>, <i>Mechanism
  of Photosynthesis (1951)</i>, <i>Entstehung der Krebszellen
  (1955)</i>, and <i>Weiterentwicklung der zellphysiologischen
  Methoden (1962)</i>. In the last years he added to the problems
  of his Institute: chemotherapeutics of cancer, and the mechanism
  of X-ray's action. In photosynthesis he discovered with Dean Burk
  the I-quantum reaction that splits the CO<sub>2</sub>, activated
  by the respiration.<br>

  Otto Warburg is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society,
  London (1934) and a member of the Academies of Berlin, Halle,
  Copenhagen, Rome, and India. He has gained l'Ordre pour le
  M&eacute;rite, the Great Cross, and the Star and Shoulder Ribbon of
  the Bundesrepublik. In 1965 he was made doctor honoris causa at
  Oxford
  University.<br>
  <br>
  He is unmarried and has always been interested in equine sport as
  a pastime.</p>
