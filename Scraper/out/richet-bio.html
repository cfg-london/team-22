  <h1>Charles Richet - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="richet.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Charles
  Richet</b> was born on August 26, 1850, in Paris. He was the son
  of Alfred Richet, Professor of Clinical Surgery in the Faculty of
  Medicine, Paris, and his wife Eugenie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Renouard.
  He studied in Paris, becoming Doctor of Medicine in 1869, Doctor
  of Sciences in 1878 and Professor of Physiology from 1887 onwards
  in the Faculty of Medicine, Paris.<br>
  <br>
  For 24 years (1878-1902) he was Editor of the <i>Revue
  Scientifique</i>, and from 1917 he was co-editor of the
  <i>Journal de Physiologie et de Pathologie
  G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>. He has published papers on physiology,
  physiological chemistry, experimental pathology, normal and
  pathological psychology and numerous researches all done in the
  physiological laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine, Paris, where
  he tried to study normal and pathological facts together with
  each other.<br>
  <br>
  In physiology, he worked out the mechanism of the
  thermoregulation in homoiothermic animals. Before his researches
  (1885-1895) on polypnoea and shivering due to temperature little
  was known about the methods by which animals deprived of
  cutaneous transpiration can guard against overheating and how
  chilled animals can warm themselves again.<br>
  <br>
  In experimental therapeutics Richet showed that the blood of
  animals vaccinated against an infection protects against this
  infection (Nov. 1888). Applying this principle to tuberculosis,
  he did the first serotherapeutic injection done in man (Dec. 6,
  1890).<br>
  <br>
  In 1900, Charles Richet showed that feeding milk and raw meat
  (zomotherapy) might cure tuberculous dogs.<br>
  <br>
  In 1901 he established that by decreasing the sodium chloride in
  food, potassium bromide is rendered so effective for the
  treatment of epilepsy that the therapeutic dose falls from 10 g
  to 2 g.<br>
  <br>
  In 1913, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his researches on
  anaphylaxis. He invented this word to designate the sensitivity
  developed by an organism after it had been given a parenteral
  injection of a colloid or protein substance or a toxin (1902).
  Later he demonstrated the facts of passive anaphylaxis and
  anaphylaxis <i>in vitro</i>. The applications of anaphylaxis to
  medicine are extremely numerous. Already in 1913, over 4000
  memoirs had been published on this question and it plays an
  important part nowadays in pathology. He showed that in fact
  parenteral injection of protein substance modifies profoundly and
  permanently the chemical constitution of the body fluids. Most of
  Charles Richet's physiological works scattered in various
  scientific journals were published in the <i>Travaux du
  Laboratoire de la Facult&eacute; de M&eacute;decine de Paris</i>
  (Alcan, Paris, 6 vols. 1890-1911) (Works of the Physiological
  Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine, Paris).<br>
  <br>
  Among his other works are: <i>Suc Gastrique chez l'Homme et chez
  les Animaux</i>, 1878 (Gastric juice in man and in animals);
  <i>Le&ccedil;ons sur les Muscles et les Nerfs</i>, 1881 (Lectures
  on the muscles and nerves); <i>Le&ccedil;ons sur la Chaleur
  Animale</i>, 1884 (Lectures on animal heat); <i>Essai de
  Psychologie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>, 1884 (Essay on general
  psychology); <i>Souvenirs d'un Physiologiste</i>, 1933 (Memoirs
  of a physiologist). He was also the editor of <i>Dictionnaire de
  Physiologie</i>, 1895-1912 (Dictionary of Physiology), of which 9
  volumes appeared.<br>
  <br>
  Among his recreations were an interest in spiritualism and the
  writing of a few dramatic works.<br>
  <br>
  In 1877, Charles Richet married Am&eacute;lie Aubry. They had five
  sons, Georges, Jacques, Charles (who, like his father, was
  Professor in the Faculty of Medicine in Paris and was, in his
  turn, succeeded by his son Gabriel), Albert and Alfred, and two
  daughters, Louise (Mme Lesn&eacute;) and Ad&egrave;le (Mme le
  Ber).<br>
  <br>
  He died in Paris on December 4, 1935.</p>
