  <h1>Bernardo Houssay - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="houssay.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Bernardo
  Alberto Houssay</b> was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on April
  10, 1887, one of the eight children of Dr. Albert and Clara
  (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Laffont) Houssay, who had come to Argentina from
  France. His father was a barrister. His early education was at a
  private school, the Colegio Brit&aacute;nico. He then entered the
  School of Pharmacy of the University of Buenos Aires at the exceptionally
  early age of 14, graduating in 1904. He had already begun
  studying medicine and, in 1907, before completing his studies, he
  took up a post in the Department of Physiology. He began here his
  research on the hypophysis which resulted in his M.D.-thesis
  (1911), a thesis which earned him a University prize.<br>
  <br>
  In 1910 he was appointed Professor of Physiology in the
  University's School of Veterinary Medicine. During this time he
  had been doing hospital practice and, in 1913, became Chief
  Physician at the Alvear Hospital. In addition to this he was also
  in charge of the Laboratory of Experimental Physiology and
  Pathology in the National Department of Hygiene from 1915 to
  1919. In 1919 he became Professor of Physiology in the Medical
  School at Buenos Aires University. He also organized the
  Institute of Physiology at the Medical School, making it a centre
  with an international reputation. He remained Professor and
  Director of the Institute until 1943. In this year the Government
  then in power deprived him of his post, as a result of his
  voicing his opinion that there should be effective democracy in
  the country. Although receiving many invitations from abroad, he
  continued his work in an institute which he organized with the
  support of funds contributed by the Sauberan Foundation and other
  bodies. This was the <i>Instituto de Biolog&iacute;a y Medicina
  Experimental,</i> where he still remains as Director. In 1955 a
  new Government reinstated him in the University.<br>
  <br>
  He has worked in almost every field of physiology, having a
  special interest in the endocrine glands. He has made a lifelong
  study of the hypophysis and his most important discovery concerns
  the role of the anterior lobe of the hypophysis in carbohydrate
  metabolism and the onset of diabetes. He has worked on many other
  topics in physiology and pharmacology, including the physiology
  of circulation and respiration, the processes of immunity, the
  nervous system, digestion, and snake and spider venoms.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from his research, he has been active in promoting the
  advancement of university and medical education, and of
  scientific research, in Argentina.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Houssay is the author of over 500 papers and of several
  books. He has won many prizes ranging in time from that of the
  National Academy of Sciences, Buenos Aires, in 1923, to the Dale
  Medal of the Society of Endocrinology (London) in 1960.<br>
  <br>
  He holds honorary degrees of twenty-five universities and is a
  member of the Argentine National Academy of Medicine, the Academy
  of Letters, the National Academy of Sciences of Buenos Aires, the
  Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of Buenos Aires, and of
  the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He is honorary professor of
  15 universities, foreign associate of 11 academies or learned
  societies, member (honorary or correspondent) of 38 Academies, 16
  Societies of Biology, 11 of Endocrinology, 7 of Physiology and 5
  of Cardiology. He has been decorated by the governments of
  several countries.<br>
