  <h1>Baruch S. Blumberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="blumberg.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born in
  1925, in New York City, the second of three children of Meyer and
  Ida Blumberg. My grandparents came to the United States from
  Europe at the end of the 19th century. They were members of an
  immigrant group who had enormous confidence in the possibilities
  of their adopted country. I received my elementary education at
  the Yeshiva of Flatbush, a Hebrew parochial school, and, at an
  early age, in addition to a rigorous secular education, learned
  the Hebrew Testament in the original language. We spent many
  hours on the rabbinic commentaries on the Bible and were immersed
  in the existential reasoning of the Talmud at an age when we
  could hardly have realized its impact.<br>
  <br>
  After attending Far Rockaway High School I joined the U.S. Navy
  in 1943 and finished college under military auspices. I was
  commissioned as a Deck Officer, served on landing ships, and was
  the commanding officer of one of these when I left active duty in
  1946. My interest in the sea remained. In later years I made
  several trips as a merchant seaman, held a ticket as a Ships
  Surgeon, and, while in medical school, occasionally served as a
  semiprofessional hand on sailing ships. Sea experience placed a
  great emphasis on detailed problem solving, on extensive planning
  before action, and on the arrangement of alternate methods to
  effect an end. These techniques have application in certain kinds
  of research, particularly in the execution of field
  studies.<br>
  <br>
  My undergraduate degree in Physics was taken at Union College in
  upstate New York, and in 1946 I began graduate work in
  mathematics at Columbia University. My father, who was a lawyer,
  suggested that I should go to medical school, and I entered The
  College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in
  1947. I enjoyed my four years at the College immensely. Robert
  Loeb was the chairman of the Department of Medicine and exerted a
  marked influence on the entire college. There was a strong
  emphasis on basic science and research in the first two years (we
  hardly saw a patient till our third year), and we learned
  practical applications only in our last years.<br>
  <br>
  Between my third and fourth years, Harold Brown, our professor of
  parasitology, arranged for me to spend several months at Moengo,
  an isolated mining town, accessible only by river, in the swamp
  and high bush country of northern Surinam. While there we
  delivered babies, performed clinical services, and undertook
  several public health surveys, including the first malaria survey
  done in that region. Different people had been imported into the
  country to serve as laborers in the sugar plantations, and they,
  along with the indigenous American Indians, provided a richly
  heterogeneous population. Hindus from India, Javanese, Africans
  (including the Djukas, descendants of rebelled slaves who resided
  in autonomous kingdoms in the interior), Chinese, and a
  smattering of Jews descended from 17th century migrants to the
  country from Brazil, lived side by side. Their responses to the
  many infectious agents in the environment were very different. We
  were particularly impressed with the enormous variation in the
  response to infection with <i>Wuchereria bancroftia</i> (the
  filariad which causes elephantiasis), and my first published
  research paper was on this topic. This experience was recalled in
  later years when I became interested in the study of inherited
  variation in susceptibility to disease. Nature operates in a bold
  and dramatic manner in the tropics. Biological effects are
  profound and tragic. The manifestations of important variables
  may often be readily seen and measured, and the rewards to health
  in terms of prevention or treatment of disease can be great. As a
  consequence, much of our field work has been done in tropical
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  I was an intern and assistant resident on the First (Columbia)
  Division at Bellevue Hospital in lower New York from 1951 to
  1953. It is difficult to explain the fascination of Bellevue. In
  the days before widespread health insurance, many of the city's
  poor were hospitalized at Bellevue, including many formerly
  middle class people impoverished by the expenses of chronic
  illness. The wards were crowded, often with beds in the halls.
  Scenes on the wards were sometimes reminiscent of Hogarth's
  woodcuts of the public institutions of 18th century London.
  Despite this, morale was high. We took great pride that the
  hospital was never closed; any sick person whose illness
  warranted hospitalization was admitted, even though all the
  regular bed spaces were filled. A high scientific and academic
  standard was maintained. Our director, <a href=
  "../1956/index.html">Dickinson W. Richards</a>, and his
  colleague, <a href="../1956/index.html">Andr&eacute; F.
  Cournand</a>, received the Nobel Prize for their work on
  cardio-pulmonary physiology. Anyone who has been immersed in the
  world of a busy city hospital, a world of wretched lives, of hope
  destroyed by devastating illness, cannot easily forget that an
  objective of big-medical research is, in the end, the prevention
  and cure of disease.<br>
  <br>
  I spent the following two years as a Clinical Fellow in Medicine
  at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center working in the
  Arthritis Division under Dr. Charles A. Ragan. I also did
  experimental work on the physical biochemistry of hyaluronic acid
  with Dr. Karl Meyer. From 1955 to 1957, I was a graduate student
  at the Department of Biochemistry at Oxford University,
  England, and a member of Balliol College. I did my Ph.D. thesis
  with Alexander G. Ogston on the physical and biochemical
  characteristics of hyaluronic acid. Professor Ogston's remarkable
  combination of theory and experiment guided the scientific
  activity in his laboratory. He has served as a model to me on how
  to train students; I hope I have measured up to his standard.
  <a href="../1953/index.html">Sir Hans Krebs</a> was the chairman
  of the Department of Biochemistry. I have profited by
  conversations with him, particularly when (in 1972) I was a
  visiting fellow at Trinity College and we had opportunities to discuss
  our mutual interests in the history of science.<br>
  <br>
  Oxford science at that time was influenced by the 19th and 20th
  century British and European naturalists, scientists and
  explorers who went to the world of nature - often to distant
  parts of it - to make the observations which generated their
  hypotheses. Anthony C. Allison was then working in the Department
  of Biochemistry and introduced me to the concept of polymorphism,
  a term introduced by the lepidopterist E. B. Ford of the
  Department of Zoology. In 1957 I took my first West African trip
  (to Nigeria) and was introduced to the special excitement of that
  part of the world. I found the Nigerians warmhearted and friendly
  with a spontaneous approach to life. We collected blood specimens
  from several populations (including the nomadic pastoral Fulani
  and their domestic animals) and studied inherited polymorphisms
  of the serum proteins of milk and of hemoglobin. This approach
  was continued in many subsequent field trips, and it eventually
  led to the discovery of several new polymorphisms and, in due
  course, the hepatitis B virus.<br>
  <br>
  I worked at the National Institutes of Health from 1957 until 1964.
  This was during a period of rapid growth for the NIH, and I
  continued to develop my research on polymorphisms and their
  relation to disease. This led to the formation of the Section on
  Geographic Medicine and Genetics, which was eventually assigned
  to an epidemiology branch directed by Thomas Dublin, from whom I
  learned the methods of epidemiology. The NIH was a very exciting
  place, with stimulating colleagues including J. Edward Rall,
  Jacob Robbins, J. Carl Robinson, Kenneth Warren, Seymour Geisser,
  and many others. The most important connection I made, however,
  was with W. Thomas London (who later came to The Institute for
  Cancer Research), who has become a colleague, collaborator, and
  good friend with whom I have worked closely for fifteen years.
  Tom was an essential contributor to the work on Australia antigen
  and hepatitis B, and without him it could not have been
  done.<br>
  <br>
  I came to The Institute for Cancer Research in 1964 to start a
  program in clinical research. The Institute was, and is, a
  remarkable research organization. Our director, Timothy R.
  Talbot, Jr., has a deep respect for basic research and a
  commitment to the independence of the investigators. Above all,
  people are considered an end in themselves, and the misuse of
  staff to serve some abstract goal is not tolerated. Jack Schultz
  was a leading intellectual force in the Institute, and his
  foresighted, humane view of science, his honesty and his good
  sense influenced the activities of all of us. Another important
  characteristic is the dedication and intelligence of our
  administrative and maintenance staffs, which contributes to the
  strong sense of community which pervades our Institute.<br>
  <br>
  Over the course of the next few years we built up a group of
  investigators from various disciplines and from many countries
  (Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Venezuela, England, India,
  Korea, China, Thailand, Singapore) who, taken together, did the
  work on Australia antigen. Alton I. Sutnick (now Dean of the
  Medical College of Pennsylvania) was responsible for much of the
  clinical work at Jeanes Hospital. Some of the early workers
  included Irving Millman, Betty Jane Gerstley, Liisa Prehn,
  Alberto Vierucci, Scott Mazzur, Barbara Werner, Cyril Levene,
  Veronica Coyne, Anna O'Connell, Edward Lustbader, and others.
  There were many field trips during this period to the
  Philippines, India, Japan, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and
  Africa. It has been an exciting and pleasant experience
  surrounded by stimulating and friendly colleagues.<br>
  <br>
  At present, we are conducting field work in Senegal and Mali,
  West Africa, in collaboration with Professor Payet of Paris,
  formerly the Dean of the Medical School of Dakar, with Professor
  Sankal&eacute;, his successor in Dakar, and a group of other French
  and Sengalese colleagues, including Drs. Larouz&eacute; and
  Saimot.<br>
  <br>
  I am Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and attend ward
  rounds with house staff and medical students. I am also a
  Professor of Anthropology and have taught Medical Anthropology
  for eight years. I have learned a great deal from my
  students.<br>
  <br>
  My non-scientific interests are primarily in the out-of-doors. I
  have been a middle distance runner (very non-competitive) for
  many years and also play squash. We canoe on the many nearby
  lakes and rivers of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. I enjoy mountain
  walking and have hiked in many parts of the world on field trips.
  With several friends we own a farm in western Maryland which
  supplies beef for the local market. Shoveling manure for a day is
  an excellent counterbalance to intellectual work.<br>
  <br>
  My wife, Jean, is an artist who has recently become interested in
  print making. We have four children of whom I am very proud:
  Anne, George, Jane, and Noah. They are all individualists, which
  makes for a turbulent and noisy household, still we miss the two
  oldest who are now away at college. We live in the center of old
  Philadelphia, a few blocks from Independence Hall. The city has
  appreciated its recognition by the Nobel Award in our
  Bicentennial Year.</p>
