  <h1>Harold C. Urey - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="urey.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Harold Clayton Urey</b> was born in
  Walkerton, Indiana, on April 29, 1893, as the son of the Rev.
  Samuel Clayton Urey and Cora Rebecca Reinoehl, and grandson of
  pioneers who settled in Indiana. His early education in rural
  schools led to his graduation from high school in 1911 after
  which he taught for three years in country schools. In 1914 he
  entered the University of Montana and received his Bachelor of
  Science degree in Zoology in 1917. He spent two years as a
  research chemist in industry before returning to Montana as an
  instructor in Chemistry. In 1921 he entered the University of
  California to work under Professor Lewis and he was awarded the
  degree of Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1923. He spent the following year
  in Copenhagen at Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>'s Institute
  for Theoretical Physics as American-Scandinavian Foundation
  Fellow to Denmark and on his return to the United States he
  became an Associate in Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. In 1929 he was
  appointed Associate Professor in Chemistry at Columbia
  University and he became Professor in 1934; during the period
  1940-1945 he was also Director of War Research, Atomic Bomb
  Project, Columbia University. He moved to the Institute for
  Nuclear Studies, University of Chicago in 1945 as Distinguished
  Service Professor of Chemistry and became Martin A. Ryerson
  Professor in 1952. He was George Eastman Visiting Professor,
  University of
  Oxford, during 1956-1957 and in 1958 he took his present post
  as Professor-at-Large, University of California.<br>

  Professor's Urey's early researches concerned the entropy of
  diatomic gases and problems of atomic structure, absorption
  spectra and the structure of molecules. In 1931 he devised a
  method for the concentration of any possible heavy hydrogen
  isotopes by the fractional distillation of liquid hydrogen: this
  led to the discovery of deuterium. Together with the late Dr.
  E.W. Washburn, he evolved the electrolytic method for the
  separation of hydrogen isotopes and he carried out thorough
  investigations of their properties, in particular the vapour
  pressure of hydrogen and deuterium, and the equilibrium constants
  of exchange reactions. He later worked on the separation of
  uranium isotopes and, more recently, he has been concerned with
  the measurement of paleotemperatures, investigations into the
  origin of the planets, and the chemical problems of the origin of
  the earth.<br>
  <br>
  He is the author of the books <i>Atoms, Molecules and Quanta</i>
  (1930, with A.E. Ruark), and <i>The Planets</i> (1952). He was
  editor of the <i>Journal of Chemical Physics</i> during 1933-1940
  and he has written numerous papers on the structure of atoms and
  molecules, the discovery of heavy hydrogen and its properties,
  separation of isotopes, measurement of paleotemperatures and the
  origin of planets. These have been published in many different
  chemical journals.<br>

  Professor Urey received the Willard Gibbs Medal (American
  Chemical Society) in 1934; Davy Medal (Royal Society,
  London), 1940; Franklin Medal, 1943; Medal for Merit, 1946;
  Cordoza Award, 1954; Honor Scroll Award (American Institute of
  Chemists), 1954; Joseph Priestley Award, 1955; Alexander Hamilton
  Award, 1961; and the J. Lawrence Smith Award (National Academy of
  Sciences), 1962. He has received honorary Doctor of Science
  degrees of Montana, Princeton, Newark, Columbia, Oxford, Washington and
  Lee, McMaster, Yale, Indiana, Birmingham Universities, and of the
  Universities of Athens, Durham, and Saskatchewan; also honorary
  Doctor of Law degree from Wayne University and the University of California.
  He is a member of many of the more important scientific societies
  of the world, and is Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Society
  (London), the National Institute of Sciences of India and the
  Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel).<br>

  In 1926 he married Frieda Daum. They have three daughters and one
