  <h1>Sir Frederick Hopkins - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hopkins.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Frederick
  Gowland Hopkins</b> was born on June 20, 1861, at Eastbourne,
  England. His father, a bookseller in Bishopsgate Street, London,
  was much interested in science, but he died when Gowland was an
  infant. For the next ten years Gowland lived with his mother at
  Eastbourne, showing as a child literary rather than scientific
  tastes, although, when his mother gave him a microscope, he
  studied life on the seashore. But he read much and wrote rhymes,
  and in later life speculated as to whether he might not have
  become, if he had been encouraged to do so, a classical scholar
  or a naturalist. Later in his life, however, his literary ability
  added much to all his scientific papers and addresses.<br>
  <br>
  In 1871 his mother went to live at Enfield, and Hopkins went to
  the city of London School. He was a bright schoolboy in several
  subjects, and was given a first-class in chemistry in 1874.
  Later, as a result of an examination at the College of Preceptors
  he was given a prize for science, and, at the early age of 17,
  when he finally left school, he published a paper in <i>The
  Entomologist</i> on the bombardier beetle.<br>
  <br>
  After working for six months as an insurance clerk, Hopkins was
  articled to a consulting chemist, and subsequently, after taking
  a course in chemistry at the Royal School of Mines, South
  Kensington, London, he went to University College, London, where he took the
  Associateship Examination of the Institute of Chemistry, and did
  so well that Sir Thomas Stevenson, Home Office Analyst and expert
  on poisoning, engaged him as his assistant. He was then 22 years
  old, and he took part in several important legal cases. He then
  decided to take his London B.Sc. degree and graduated in the
  shortest possible time. In 1888, when he was 28, he went as a
  medical student to Guy's Hospital, London, and was immediately
  given the Sir William Gull Studentship there. He was awarded,
  during this period, a Gold Medal for Chemistry, and Honours in
  Materia Medica.<br>
  <br>
  In 1894, when he was 32 years old, he graduated in medicine and
  taught for four years physiology and toxicology at Guy's
  Hospital. For two years he was in charge of the Chemical
  Department of the Clinical Research Association. In 1896 he
  published, with H.W. Brook, work on the halogen derivatives of
  proteins, and in 1898, work with S. N. Pinkus on the
  crystallization of blood albumins. In 1898, when attending a
  meeting of the Physiological Society at Cambridge, he was invited
  by Sir Michael Foster to move to Cambridge to develop there the
  chemical aspects of physiology. Biochemistry was not, at that
  time, recognized as a separate branch of science and Hopkins
  accepted the appointment. Given a lectureship at a salary of
  &pound;200 a year, he added to his income by supervising
  undergraduates and giving tutorials, doing also for a few years,
  after the death of Sir Thomas Stevenson, part-time work for the
  Home Office. Later he was appointed Fellow and Tutor at Emmanuel College,
  Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 he was given a readership in biochemistry, and in 191O he
  became a Fellow of Trinity College, and an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel
  College. In 1914 he was elected to the Chair of Biochemistry at
  Cambridge
  University. During all this time he had to be content with,
  at first, one small room in the Department of Physiology, and
  later with accommodation in the Balfour Laboratory; but in 1925
  he was able to move his Department into the new Sir William Dunn
  Institute of Biochemistry which had been built to accommodate
  it.<br>
  <br>
  Among his outstanding contributions to science was his discovery
  of a method for isolating tryptophan and for identifying its
  structure.<br>
  <br>
  Subsequently he did the work which was to gain him in 1929,
  together with <a href="index.html">Christiaan Eijkman</a>, who
  had demonstrated the association between beriberi and the
  consumption of decorticated rice, the Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  Later, Hopkins worked with Walter Fletcher on the metabolic
  changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis.
  Hopkins supplied exact methods of analysis, and devised a new
  colour reaction for lactic acid, and the pioneer work then done
  laid the foundations for the work of the Nobel Laureates,
  <a href="../1922/index.html">A.V. Hill</a> and <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a>, and also for that of many
  other later workers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1921 he isolated a substance which he named glutathione, which
  is, he showed, widely distributed in the cells of plants and
  animals that are rapidly multiplying. Later he proved it to be
  the tripeptide of glutamic acid, glycine and cystein. He also
  discovered xanthine oxidase, a specific enzyme widely distributed
  in tissues and milk, which catalyzes the oxidation of the purine
  bases xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid. Hopkins thus
  returned to the uric acids of his earliest work, a method of
  determining uric acid in urine, which he first published in
  1891.<br>
  <br>
  Hopkins was knighted in 1925 and received the Order of Merit in
  1935.<br>
  <br>
  He was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London in
  1918, and its Copley Medal in 1926. From 1930 until 1935 he was
  President of the Royal Society, and found little time for
  research. During this period, however, he exerted great influence
  on his contemporaries.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 Hopkins married Jessie Anne Stevens. They had two
  daughters, one of whom Jacquetta Hawkes, is married to J. B.
  Priestley, the author.<br>
  <br>
  Hopkins died in 1947, at the age of 86.</p>
