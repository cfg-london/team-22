  <h2>The Current State of the Struggle against Tuberculosis</h2>

  <p>Twenty years ago, tuberculosis, even in its
  most dangerous form, consumption, was still not considered
  infectious. Of course, the work of Villemin and the experimental
  investigations by Cohnheim and Salomonsen had already provided
  certain clues which suggested that this conception was false. But
  it was only with the discovery of the tubercle bacillus that the
  aetiology of tuberculosis was placed on a firm footing, and the
  conviction gained that this is a parasitic disease, i.e. an
  infectious, but also avoidable one.</p>

  <p>In the first papers concerning the
  aetiology of tuberculosis I have already indicated the dangers
  arising from the spread of the bacilli-containing excretions of
  consumptives, and have urged moreover that prophylactic measures
  should be taken against the contagious disease. But my words have
  been un-heeded. It was still too early, and because of this they
  still could not meet with full understanding. It shared the fate
  of so many similar cases in medicine, where a long time has also
  been necessary before old prejudices were overcome and the new
  facts were acknowledged to be correct by the physicians.</p>

  <p>However, quite gradually the understanding
  of the infectious nature of tuberculosis then spread, taking root
  ever more deeply, and the more the conviction of the dangerous
  nature of tuberculosis made headway, the more was the necessity
  of protecting oneself against it thrust on people.</p>

  <p>First of all, efforts directed to this end
  attracted attention in papers giving information and warnings.
  Shortly after this there came into existence, provoked by the
  successes which Brehmer obtained with the dietetic-hygienic
  treatment of patients with lung complaints, sanatoria for
  consumptives, to which were added convalescent homes, seaside
  resorts, out-patient clinics and similar establishments. An
  extremely rich corporate activity developed. International
  congresses took place. In some places the obligation to give
  notice to the authorities was introduced, on an optional or
  compulsory basis. In some states and cities thoroughly worked-out
  laws were enacted against the tuberculosis menace. Hardly a
  country remains where, in one way or another, the struggle
  against tuberculosis has not been taken up, and it is
  extraordinarily gratifying to see how the campaign is now waged
  quite generally and with considerable vigour against this
  dangerous enemy.</p>

  <p>But taken as a whole, all these efforts
  were quite dissimilar in character, though they all pursued the
  same aim, but chose quite different approaches to it. In one
  country people wanted to achieve everything by instruction, in
  another they hoped to be able to remove tuberculosis by
  therapeutic measures, and again in another people turned
  exclusively against the supposed menacing dangers of bovine
  tuberculosis. Of late a certain adjustment has, indeed, made its
  appearance, in so far as individual countries no longer proceed
  in quite such a biased way as before, and one takes over from
  another whatever seems to be well tried in the way of means of
  defense. However, amidst the persistently great variety in the
  ways and means of combating tuberculosis, it is yet necessary to
  ask what measures do indeed best satisfy the scientific
  requirements and general findings in the fight against contagious
  disease.</p>

  <p>But, before we come to answer this
  question, we must make perfectly clear to ourselves how infection
  is brought about in tuberculosis, i.e. how the tubercle bacilli
  invade the human organism; for all prophylactic measures against
  an infectious disease can only be directed towards preventing the
  germs of disease from invading the body.</p>

  <p>In relation to tuberculosis infection so
  far only two possibilities have offered themselves: first,
  infection by tubercle bacilli which come from tuberculous people,
  and second, by those that are contained in the milk and meat of
  tuberculous cattle.</p>

  <p>As a result of investigations which I made
  together with Sch&uuml;tz into the relation between human and
  bovine tuberculosis, we can dismiss this second possibility, or
  look upon it as being so small that this source of infection is
  quite overshadowed by the other. We arrived in effect at the
  conclusion that human and bovine tuberculosis are different from
  one another, and that bovine tuberculosis cannot be transmitted
  to a human. With regard to this latter point, I would, however,
  like to add, so as to obviate misunderstandings, that I refer
  only to those forms of tuberculosis which are of some account in
  the fight against tuberculosis as an epidemic, namely to
  generalized tuberculosis, and, above all, to consumption. It
  would take us too far here, if I were to go more closely into the
  very lively discussion which has developed over this question; I
  must keep this for some other occasion. I would just like to
  observe in addition to this that the re-examination of our
  investigations, which was undertaken in the Imperial Department
  of Health in Berlin with the greatest care and over a wide area,
  has led to a confirmation of my view, and that the harmlessness
  for humans of the bacilli of "pearl disease" is directly proved,
  in addition, by inoculating humans with material from it, as was
  done by Spengler and Klemperer. Consequently, only the tubercle
  bacilli coming from humans are of consequence in the battle
  against tuberculosis.</p>

  <p>But the disease does not in all tuberculous
  patients take such forms that tubercle bacilli are discharged to
  a noteworthy extent. It is really only those suffering from
  tuberculosis of the larynx and lungs who produce and disseminate
  considerable quantities of tubercle bacilli in a dangerous way.
  But it is as well to note that not only is the secretion of the
  lung called sputum dangerous by reason of its bacillary content,
  but that, according to the investigations of Fl&uuml;gge, even
  the smallest drops of mucus expelled into the air by the patient
  when he coughs, clears his throat, and even speaks, contain
  bacilli and can cause infection.</p>

  <p>We come therefore to this fairly sharp
  demarcation, that only those tuberculous patients comprise an
  important danger to the people around them, who suffer from
  laryngeal or pulmonary tuberculosis and have sputum which
  contains bacilli. This type of tuberculosis is designated "open"
  as opposed to "closed", in which no tubercle bacilli are
  discharged into the environment.</p>

  <p>But even in patients with open tuberculosis
  there are still distinctions to be made regarding the degree of
  danger due to them.</p>

  <p>It can indeed very often be observed that
  such patients live for years with their families, without
  infecting any of them. Under some circumstances, in hospitals for
  consumptives infections among the nursing staff can be totally
  absent, or indeed so rare that it was even thought that in this
  was to be seen a proof of the non-contagiousness of tuberculosis.
  If, however, such cases are looked into more thoroughly, then it
  turns out that there are good reasons for the apparent lack of
  contagiousness. In such cases one is dealing with patients who
  are very careful where their sputum is concerned, who value the
  cleanliness of their home and their clothing, and in addition
  live in well-aired and well-lit rooms, so that the germs, taken
  up in air, can be rapidly carried away by the flow of air or
  killed by light. If these conditions are not fulfilled, then
  infection is not lacking in hospitals and the homes of the
  well-to-do, as experience teaches us every day. It becomes more
  frequent, the more unhygienically the patients handle their
  expectoration, the more there is a lack of light and air, and the
  more closely the sick are crowded together with the healthy. The
  risk of infection becomes particularly high if healthy people
  have to sleep with the sick in the same rooms, and especially, as
  still unfortunately happens with the poorer section of the
  population, in one and the same bed.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of careful observers, this sort
  of infection has acquired such importance that tuberculosis has
  been called plainly, and quite justly, a disease of
  accommodation.</p>

  <p>To recapitulate briefly, the circumstances
  relating to infection in tuberculosis are as follows.</p>

  <p>Patients with closed tuberculosis are to be
  regarded as quite harmless. Also people suffering from open
  tuberculosis are harmless as long as the tubercle bacilli
  discharged by them are prevented from causing infection by
  cleanliness, ventilation, etc. The patient only becomes
  dangerous, when he is on his own unclean, or when, as the result
  of advanced disease, he becomes so helpless that he can no longer
  see to the adequate disposal of the expectorated material. At the
  same time the risk of the healthy being infected increases with
  the impossibility of avoiding the immediate neighbourhood of the
  dangerous patient, thus in crowded rooms and most particularly
  when these are not only overfull, but are badly ventilated and
  inadequately illuminated as well.</p>

  <p>I now come to the problem of examining the
  measures currently in use to see to what extent they take account
  of the aetiological factors, as I have just described them. If I
  prefer to confine myself in this to the conditions in Germany,
  this is because these are the ones I know best, and because it
  would not be possible to carry out a survey of the factors in
  other countries in a single lecture.</p>

  <p>The starting-point in the fight against all
  contagious diseases is the obligation to report, because without
  this most cases of the disease remain unknown. So we must make
  this a requirement for tuberculosis as well. But in this
  particular disease, out of consideration towards the patients,
  there has been some reluctance to require the notification to be
  given by the doctors or those otherwise under an obligation to do
  so. However with the correct realization that it is not just a
  question of considerations applying to the sick here but also of
  the protection of the healthy, the obligation to notify has been
  introduced in several places, at first on an optional basis, and
  then, when it transpired that the disadvantages feared did not
  materialize, on a compulsory basis. Since, therefore, experience
  has already testified to the feasibility of registration in
  tuberculosis, it should be introduced everywhere. It can,
  however, without prejudicing the objective, be restricted to
  those cases which constitute a danger to their acquaintances and
  so to patients with open tuberculosis in hygienically
  unfavourable conditions.</p>

  <p>If we lay the responsibility for
  notification on doctors, then we must at the same time ensure
  that they can judge the cases in question correctly, in
  particular with respect to the presence of open tuberculosis.
  This can only happen with the establishment of centres where the
  patient's sputum is examined without cost for tubercle bacilli.
  These could exist independently, or, what is perhaps more
  practical, in association with hospitals, policlinics, or with
  social-welfare centres, which will be mentioned later. So far
  such places for investigations have already been established in
  some countries, but in far too small numbers. It will be
  necessary in future to take this need into consideration
  adequately.</p>

  <p>Now what is to happen to the patients who
  are to be regarded as dangerous, after they have been
  identified?</p>

  <p>If it would be possible to place all these
  people together in hospitals and thus make them relatively
  harmless, then tuberculosis would decrease very rapidly.</p>

  <p>But this, for the moment at least, is out
  of the question. The number of people with tuberculosis for whom
  hospital treatment would be necessary is in Germany, for example,
  estimated at more than 200,000. To place so many patients in
  institutions would require enormous funds.</p>

  <p>However, it is by no means necessary that
  all tuberculous patients should be brought into hospitals at
  once. We may count on a decrease in tuberculosis, albeit a slower
  one, if a considerable fraction of these patients are admitted
  into suitable institutions.</p>

  <p>In connection with this, let me remind you
  of the exceptionally instructive example of the fight against
  leprosy in Norway. Not all lepers were isolated in that country
  either, but only a fraction of them, among which, however, were
  just those who were especially dangerous; in this way they have
  obtained the result that the number of lepers, which amounted to
  nearly 3,000 in 1856, has declined to about 500 at the present
  time.</p>

  <p>One should proceed in the fight against
  tuberculosis along the lines suggested by this example. And, if
  it is not possible to deal with all consumptives, then as many as
  is humanly possible, including the most dangerous, i.e. those who
  are in the final stages of consumption, should be accommodated in
  hospitals.</p>

  <p>In this respect, however, already there is
  more happening in some places than is usually supposed. In the
  city of Berlin over the last decade more than 40% of consumptives
  have died in hospitals. The circumstances must be fairly
  favourable in Stockholm as well, since Carlsson states in his
  paper on the fight against tuberculosis in Sweden that 410
  consumptives were cared for in the hospitals in this city, which
  is no mean figure for a city of 300,000 inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The number of consumptives who are brought
  in this way into a situation where they can no longer spread
  infection, is indeed fairly considerable and cannot remain
  without influence on the progress of this infectious disease.</p>

  <p>In relation to this, I would like to draw
  your attention to a phenomenon which deserves the greatest
  consideration. This is the uniform and significant falling-off of
  the mortality due to consumption in several countries.</p>

  <p>In England this decrease has already been
  under way for about 40 years. Significantly it is less in
  Scotland, and completely lacking in Ireland. The decline of
  tuberculosis in Prussia is very pronounced. During the decade
  1876-1886 the mortality due to consumption still stood at a
  uniformly high level. Then from 1886 onwards, it fell from year
  to year, and has now dropped by more than 30%, i.e. by about a
  third. It has been calculated that, as a result of this, although
  the size of the population has risen in the meantime, each year
  about 20,000 fewer people will die of consumption in Prussia now
  than 20 years ago. In other countries, for example, Austria and
  Hungary, the mortality due to consumption has stayed at its
  former considerable level.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to say what has brought
  about this characteristic behaviour of tuberculosis in the
  countries named. One supposes that several factors have worked
  together. The improvement in the situation of the lower strata of
  society, in particular with regard to housing conditions, and the
  improved knowledge of the risk of infection, which dissuades the
  individual from exposing himself unsuspectingly to infection any
  more, have certainly played their part in bringing about the
  decline in tuberculosis. But I am firmly convinced that the
  better provision for consumptives in the terminal stages, namely
  their accommodation in hospitals, which is happening to a
  relatively large extent in England and Prussia, has contributed
  most to the improvement in the tuberculosis situation. I am
  strengthened in this opinion particularly by the behaviour of
  tuberculosis in Stockholm, where, as has been mentioned already,
  proportionately many consumptives are cared for in institutions
  and where also the mortality due to consumption has decreased in
  the course of recent decades by 38%.</p>

  <p>From this we must draw the lesson that the
  greatest emphasis must be placed on these measures in the fight
  against tuberculosis, namely on the accommodation of consumptives
  in suitable institutions, and much more care than before should
  be taken to insure that consumptives do not die in their homes,
  where they are moreover mostly in a helpless state, without
  adequate nursing.</p>

  <p>When consumptives are no longer turned
  away, as before, by the hospitals as incurable, and when, on the
  contrary, we afford the best treatment conceivable and free of
  charge, and can even offer the prospect of a cure in a few cases,
  when in addition provision is made for their families during the
  illness, then there will be no need for any compulsion at all to
  make many more of these unfortunate sick people come to the
  hospitals, than is already happening now.</p>

  <p>Now I am going to turn to the discussion of
  a measure which will combat tuberculosis in quite a different
  way. This is the matter of sanatoria. Sanatoria were established
  in the expectation that a great part, perhaps even the majority
  of consumptives can be cured in them. If this supposition were to
  be correct, then sanatoria would decidedly be one of the best
  weapons in the struggle against tuberculosis. But there is a good
  deal of argument as to the results of the sanatoria. By one side
  it is affirmed that they have had up to 70% of successful cures,
  while the other side disputes every success. Now it must be
  conceded that the 70% of successes does not refer to real cures,
  but only to the recovery of earning capacity. But from the
  standpoint of prophylaxis there is no gain in this, since a
  patient who is not completely cured but is only improved to the
  extent that he is capable of earning again for a while, later
  develops the condition of open tuberculosis, and succumbs to all
  its consequences, as were depicted earlier.</p>

  <p>The reason for the relatively small number
  of real cures obtained in the sanatoria evidently lies in the
  fact that the duration of the treatment in these institutions is
  much too short, and that very many of the patients accepted are
  in such a far-advanced stage that the dietetic-hygienic treatment
  is no longer sufficient to cure them. Many doctors in sanatoria
  have also correctly recognized this already. For this reason they
  take care that only such patients are accepted as are in an early
  stage of tuberculosis, and in addition to the sanatorial
  treatment they administer tuberculin preparations, in order to
  achieve swifter, and, in particular, more lasting cures. In this
  way considerably better results than before have already been
  obtained in several sanatoria, and it is to be supposed that
  sanatoria, if they go on in this way, will make quite a
  substantial contribution to the fight against tuberculosis, at
  least in Germany, where already about 30,000 patients are now
  getting treatment each year in over a 100 sanatoria.</p>

  <p>If in this way the greatest possible
  proportion of consumptives in an advanced state are taken care of
  by admission into the hospitals, and if the earliest stages of
  the disease are taken care of by the sanatoria, then there is
  still a large number of patients left, who must at all events be
  taken into account too. These are the ones in advanced stages of
  the disease who remain at home, and those consumptives whose
  illness has progressed too far for treatment in the sanatoria,
  but yet still not so far that they are incapable of working and
  have to go to a hospital. If these tuberculous people, whose
  numbers, as I have said, are truly considerable, are abandoned to
  their fate, then a great gap in the battle against tuberculosis
  would result from this.</p>

  <p>To have filled in this gap is the merit of
  Calmette, who had the happy idea of taking care of this category
  of patient with the out-patient clinics which he had organized.
  This stimulus provided by Calmette has met with approval
  everywhere, especially in Germany, where over 50 such
  establishments have been set up, and many towns are on the point
  of providing themselves with them too. It was in Germany also
  that the out-patient clinics, which were originally only intended
  to provide the working-classes with free advice, medical
  treatment, and material support as well, were substantially
  broadened in scope and completed under the guidance of
  P&uuml;tter and Kayserling. In their present form they are
  intended not only to serve a particular class, but to serve all
  helpless sufferers from tuberculosis in every way. The sick
  person is visited in his home, and he and his relations are given
  instruction and advice concerning cleanliness and how to deal
  with expectorations. If living conditions are bad, then money is
  granted in order to make it possible to arrange the separation of
  the sick person from the healthy relatives in his house either by
  renting a suitable room or by supplying different, more adequate
  accommodation, and in this way to make the dangerous patient
  relatively harmless. In addition poor families are supported by
  granting them appropriate food, fuel, etc. The institute itself
  does not take over the treatment of the sick, so as not to come
  into conflict with the medical practitioners; but it sees to it
  that they come under medical treatment, and, where appropriate,
  that they gain admission to a hospital, sanatorium or
  convalescent home. But a particularly important aspect of their
  work consists in watching over the relatives, in particular the
  children, and in investigating from time to time to see whether
  infection has resulted, so as to be able to bring help as early
  as possible.</p>

  <p>In such ways these institutes provide the
  poor consumptives with a true welfare service, and on this
  account, with full justification, they have been called "social
  welfare centers". I consider these arrangements to be one of the
  most powerful weapons, if not the most powerful, which we can
  bring into use against tuberculosis, and I believe that the
  social welfare centres, if, as is to be hoped, they spread over
  the country in a close network, are destined to exercise an
  extremely beneficial effect.</p>

  <p>The measures which have been mentioned so
  far, namely duty to registrate, hospitals, sanatoria, and social
  welfare centres, comprise the heavy artillery in the fight
  against tuberculosis. But besides these, other lighter weapons
  are available to us, which can not produce any such decisive
  effect on their own, but whose aid we cannot dispense with.</p>

  <p>Among these I mention in the first place
  all the efforts which have been directed at instructing the
  people on the danger of tuberculosis by means of popular
  publications, lectures, exhibitions and other media of that kind,
  and at keeping alive the interest of all social classes in the
  fight against tuberculosis. Later, when the social welfare
  centres are available in sufficient numbers, instruction will be
  dispensed on such a generous scale from these institutes, that we
  will hardly need special arrangements for this any more then; but
  for the present we cannot dispense with them.</p>

  <p>In addition the numerous societies and
  associations provide very valuable help, which participate in the
  fight against tuberculosis by supplying money with which to found
  sanatoria and convalescent homes, to endow free beds, and to
  support the families of poor consumptives, etc.</p>

  <p>We should not close our eyes to the fact
  that the fight against tuberculosis needs quite considerable
  financial resources. Basically it is only a question of money.
  The more free beds for consumptives that are endowed in
  well-equipped and well-run sanatoria and nursing-homes, the more
  adequately the families of the tuberculous are supported, so that
  the sick are not dissuaded from going into hospital out of
  concern for their relatives, and the more social welfare centres
  are set up, the more rapidly will tuberculosis decrease in
  importance as a wide-spread infectious disease.</p>

  <p>Since, however, it is hardly to be expected
  that communities, which have already now often made generous
  sacrifices on behalf of their tuberculous members, will be able
  to meet all the requirements in this respect in the immediate
  future, it follows that help coming from private quarters is much
  to be desired. But care must be taken that the funds raised by
  societies and associations, or made available by individual
  benefactors, do not find employment on matters of secondary
  importance, but that they should be used to further the most
  effective measures, above all the institutes for the
  accommodation of the sick and the social welfare centres.</p>

  <p>In the fight against tuberculosis, as it
  has been depicted so far, hardly anything remains to be done by
  the State, and yet, for its part, it can contribute to it in an
  effective way. This can happen by the State introducing
  legislation for compulsory registration for tuberculosis, which
  already is in force for all the other important wide-spread
  infectious diseases. In several countries this has already
  happened, and it is to be hoped that the other civilized
  countries will soon follow this example. Often a legislative
  foundation as well has been required for the compulsory isolation
  of such sick people, who are particularly dangerous to those
  surrounding them. According to my experience in the fight against
  contagious diseases we can, however, dispense with these stem
  measures. If we only make the admission of consumptives into
  suitable hospitals easier in the way indicated earlier, then we
  will achieve all we need.</p>

  <p>But the State can interfere particularly
  usefully in one respect, namely as regards the improvement of
  unfavourable housing conditions. Private action is virtually
  powerless against this nuisance, while the State can easily
  remedy the situation with suitable laws.</p>

  <p>If we look back on what has happened in
  recent years in the fight against tuberculosis as wide-spread
  infectious disease, then we cannot help but gain the impression
  that quite an important beginning has been made.</p>

  <p>The struggle against tuberculosis is not
  dictated from above, and has not always developed in harmony with
  the rules of science, but it has originated in the people itself,
  which has finally correctly recognized its mortal enemy. It
  surges forward with elemental power, sometimes in a rather wild
  and disorganized fashion, but gradually more and more finding the
  right paths.</p>

  <p>The struggle has caught hold along the
  whole line and enthusiasm for the lofty aim runs so high that a
  slackening is no longer to be feared.</p>

  <p>If the work goes on in this powerful way,
  then the victory must be won.</p>
