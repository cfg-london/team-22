  <h1>Ferid Murad - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="murad.jpg" class="bio-img"> My father, Jabir Murat Ejupi, was born
  in Albania in 1892 and was the oldest of four children. His
  mother died when he was 13 years old. He and his family were
  shepherds and he subsequently ran away from home to sell candy in
  the Balkan countries as a teenager for several years. Although he
  had less than a year of education, he learned to speak seven
  languages before he died at the age of 84 in 1976. He met a group
  of other teenagers in Austria and they immigrated to the United
  States. The immigration officer at Ellis Island, August, 1913,
  asked his name, after which the officer declared him to be John
  Murad and stamped his papers. It was not uncommon to have names
  changed and abbreviated upon immigration. After working briefly
  in the steel mills and factories in Cleveland and Detroit, he
  settled in Chicago where he had several friends. His career was
  quite diverse and although he never admitted it, I learned
  subsequently from some of his colleagues that he was quite a
  playboy with fancy automobiles, perhaps the reason for my love of
  nice cars.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Henrietta Josephine Bowman, was born in 1918 in Alton,
  Illinois and was the third of six surviving children of Elizabeth
  Lillian and Andrew Orvie Bowman. My grandmother was a kind and
  wonderful woman. Only six of her eleven children survived due to
  stillbirths and some died of diseases and other conditions of
  poverty. My mother went to grade school for several years before
  she too quit to help her mother and younger siblings while her
  mother and two older sisters went to work. My grandfather was a
  carpenter who generally worked part-time and frequently spent his
  modest paycheck at the local bars before going home. The
  childhood poverty of both my parents and their minimal education
  did much to influence me and my two younger brothers in our
  education and career choices. One brother became a dentist and
  the other a professor of anthropology with a PhD degree.<br>
  <br>
  My mother also ran away from home at 17 in 1935 to marry my
  father who was 39. I was born September 14, 1936 at home in their
  hot and small apartment over a bakery in Whiting, Indiana. My
  brothers John Abderhaman and Turhon Allen were born in 1938 and
  1944. We were raised in a four room aparttment behind my parents'
  restaurant in Whiting, Indiana. This small apartment undoubtedly
  influenced my desire for large expensive homes.<br>
  <br>
  The restaurant business had a profound effect on my future and
  that of my two brothers. When we were able to stand on a stool to
  reach the sink we washed dishes and later when we could see over
  the counter, we waited tables and managed the cash register. I
  did this throughout grade school and high school each evening and
  on weekends. I created a game from those chores and learned to
  memorize all of the customer's orders in our restaurant with a
  capacity of 28 customers and before they left I would tally their
  bills mentally and meet them at the cash register. I met a
  diverse and wonderful group of customers that ranged from
  laborers in the local refineries and steel mills to local
  bankers, businessmen, families and school teachers. My parents
  worked long hours as is typical of a family business,
  particularly a restaurant. My father worked 16 to 18 hours daily
  while my mother put in similar hours between the restaurant and
  raising three children. They owned the building that also
  included two other small apartments, another small business and
  21 sleeping rooms upstairs. Many of the tenants were old and
  retired and my mother would often care for them and prepare their
  meals when they were sick. I learned from my mother and
  grandmother Bowman about compassion and generosity for people and
  this in turn influenced my career choice in medicine. My father
  taught me some business skills and how to repair numerous items
  that were continually breaking down in this old building. He was
  quite good at remembering how he took anything apart in order to
  repair it and reassemble the pieces as I stood at his side as a
  youngster passing him tools.<br>
  <br>
  With this background I knew that I wanted considerable education
  so I wouldn't have to work as hard as my parents. Also, I knew at
  the age of 12 that I was going to become a doctor. My parents
  always encouraged us to get an education and establish a
  profession. However, my brothers and I grew up with considerable
  freedom whether it was saving or spending our tips from the
  restaurant or our career choices. This was also applied to our
  religious choices as my father was Muslim, my mother Baptist and
  we were raised in a Catholic community. Subsequently, my brothers
  became Catholic when they married Catholic wives and I was
  baptized Episcopalian in college. My wife of more than forty
  years is Presbyterian, two of our daughters married Jewish men
  and one married a Catholic man.<br>
  <br>
  In eighth grade the class was asked to write an essay of our top
  three career choices. My choices were 1) physician, 2) teacher
  and 3) pharmacist (in 1948 clinical pharmacology was not yet a
  discipline in medicine). Today I do just that, as I am a board
  certified physician and internist doing both basic and clinical
  research with considerable teaching in medicine, pharmacology and
  clinical pharmacology and with a PhD in pharmacology. While I am
  probably working much harder and longer hours than my parents, I
  certainly love my profession and have considerably more enjoyment
  and disposable income than they did. Until my graduation from
  high school only three of my cousins had finished high school and
  no relatives had ever gone to college. Grade school, middle
  school and high school were relatively easy for me and with
  little studying I was an honor student every semester graduating
  5th in my high school class. Fortunately several high school
  teachers, some of whom frequented our restaurant, Jack Taylor in
  Spanish and history, LaDonna Thue Elson in art, Bernard Quebeck
  in music, Jesse Allen in math, and coach Peter Kovachic convinced
  me I had some potential and were wonderful counselors and
  advisers. I lettered in track and cross country as a distance
  runner in the one and two mile events and music. I also played
  football and basketball but spent most of my time keeping the
  bench warm. I played offense and defense left guard at 5'11 " and
  140 pounds. After three monsters ran over the top of me I spent
  more of my energy with distance running in cross country. While I
  started to play golf in grade school, I stopped playing for many
  years during college and medical training and I continue to
  struggle with my game after I began playing again about 20 years
  ago.<br>
  <br>
  There was one notable friend since kindergarten, Ronald Delismon,
  who influenced me considerably. We competed constantly with
  everything: grades, chess, fencing, sports, etc. Today he is an
  aeronautical engineer recently retired from Boeing. His projects
  were always top secret such as the stealth bomber and some of the
  star war defense projects. He would never discuss his work with
  me for security reasons and often joked with me by saying, "if I
  told you, I would then have to kill you". After 57 years we
  remain the best of friends and still compete, generally at golf,
  skiing and more pleasant encounters. His recent comment was, "one
  Nobel to zero".<br>
  <br>
  The University of Chicago had a new program in the 1950s that
  accepted students after three years of high school and friends in
  the restaurant who were alumni from the University of
  Chicago encouraged me to apply. However, after considerable
  thought I decided not to enter college prematurely but rather
  completed my senior year in high school. In retrospect, this was
  the correct decision for me as my senior year in high school was
  wonderful. I coasted through the year with excellent grades and
  lots of fun participating in the school's chorus and took the
  lead in several operettas. This was probably the only year in
  school where I wasn't compulsive about grades and didn't study
  constantly.<br>
  <br>
  Since my parents couldn't afford to help me with my college
  costs, I looked for a school that offered the best scholarship. I
  considered the military programs at the Naval Academy and
  Westpoint, but I knew I wouldn't have received the biology
  training for medical school since these were primarily
  engineering programs with a requisite four years of military duty
  afterwards. I competed successfully for a Rector Scholarship at
  DePauw
  University in Greencastle, Indiana, a small and excellent
  liberal arts university and went there from 1954 to 1958 on a
  tuition scholarship. The first year my grades were okay but not
  great with several A's, one C and the rest B's due to the hazing
  and distractions of being a pledge in the fraternity. In
  subsequent years my grades progressively improved as I was
  developing more self confidence and better study habits. I lived
  in "annexes", or small apartments with other fraternity brothers
  since the fraternity couldn't accommodate all of us and I
  generally chose other premeds as roommates. We often studied
  together and competed for grades. I was the scholarship chairman
  of the fraternity and remained a premed major with a second major
  in chemistry as I enjoyed both biology and chemistry. Throughout
  college I waited tables, taught the anatomy and embryology labs
  and worked one and sometimes two jobs during the summers to cover
  my expenses. If I had only one summer job I would take additional
  classes at one of the local extensions of Indiana University
  for additional math or literature classes in order to take more
  courses in biology, chemistry, physics or Greek and Latin at
  DePauw. The Greek and Latin courses in high school and college
  were of great value subsequently in learning the root derivatives
  of many scientific words.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of my junior year in 1957 on spring break in Fort
  Lauderdale, Florida, I met Carol Ann Leopold, my wife to be. She
  and her family were from St. Louis. We were at DePauw together
  where she was an English and Spanish major planning to become a
  teacher. Although she dated many of my fraternity brothers, I had
  not met her previously. After spring break we began to date and I
  gave her my fraternity pin a month later. Our dates were
  primarily "study dates" at the library (the only thing I could
  afford) and after mostly A's in my senior year I was elected to
  Phi Beta Kappa. At Christmas we were engaged and married within
  several weeks of graduation from DePauw on June 21, 1958.<br>
  <br>
  During my senior year of college I began to apply to medical
  schools and planned to go to Washington University Medical School in St.
  Louis. However, my faculty advisor Forst Fuller, a professor in
  the biology department and also my mentor during an elective
  research project to understand how fish managed calcium
  metabolism without parathyroid glands, suggested that I consider
  a new MD-PhD program at Western Reserve University. A fraternity
  brother, Bill Sutherland, also advised that I consider this new
  combined degree program that his father <a href=
  "../1971/index.html">Earl Sutherland, Jr</a> initiated in
  Cleveland in 1957. The program paid full tuition for both degrees
  and provided a modest stipend of $2000 per year. I quickly
  applied and was interviewed on a Saturday morning in February of
  1958 by the entire Pharmacology Department. Needless to say, I
  was awed by the attention they gave me and decided immediately to
  accept their offer. Carol, my fianc&eacute;e, was somewhat
  concerned that I was now planning seven more years of education
  but she has always been understanding and supportive of my
  training, career path and numerous moves around the country. The
  game plan was to have Carol teach high school English as I went
  through the combined degree program. These plans abruptly changed
  within three months when Carol became pregnant. After teaching
  for only one semester, she was asked to resign when the pregnancy
  "began to show". Subsequently, she was a substitute teacher, part
  time secretary and hospital clinic coordinator as we progressed
  with our family; four girls, including a set of identical twins
  before I finished medical school and graduate school in 1965.
  Number five, the first boy, was born as I finished my residency
  in 1967. Fortunately, we didn't stop as planned after number four
  was born.<br>
  <br>
  As I entered the new combined degree program my mentors were Earl
  Sutherland, Jr. the chairman of the Pharmacology Department and
  Theodore Rall a new young assistant professor and collaborator of
  Sutherland's. The year before I arrived they had discovered
  cyclic AMP as a "second messenger" of epinephrine - and
  glucagon-mediated effects on glycogenolysis in liver
  preparations. My assignment was to show that the catecholamine
  effects on cyclic AMP formation were due to effects through the
  beta adrenergic receptor. Alquist had previously reported that
  adrenergic effects could be classified as alpha or beta depending
  on the relative potency of several catecholamines. The new and
  only beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, dichloroisoproterenol,
  had also been just described and was to become a useful
  antagonist in our work. We found that catecholamine effects on
  adenylyl cyclase activation in both heart and liver preparations
  were, indeed, due to beta adrenergic effects as shown by the
  relative potencies of l-isoproterenol, l-epinephrine and
  l-norepinephrine with inhibition by dichloroisoproterenol and
  failure of alpha blockers and agonists to have effects. I also
  found that acetylcholine and other cholinergic agents inhibited
  adenylyl cyclase preparations, the first description of hormones,
  inhibiting cyclic AMP formation. I then became interested in
  agents that could block the effects of cyclic AMP on
  phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase activation. This required
  some novel assays and an acquaintance with numerous cyclic AMP
  analogues and other nucleotides including cyclic GMP, cyclic IMP,
  cyclic CMP, etc. Many of these nucleotides and their analogues
  were synthesized by Theo Pasternak, a professor from Geneva who
  was on sabbatical collaborating with Sutherland and Rall. This
  work subsequently influenced my desire to work with cyclic GMP as
  described in my Nobel lecture. Later I again played organic
  chemist to make some nucleotides.<br>
  <br>
  I was first in my class every year in medical school and graduate
  school. This was a wonderful and exciting time in my life working
  with these mentors, watching a new area of biology develop and
  actively participating in the work. I loved research as Earl
  Sutherland was quite a visionary who was able to bring together
  multiple disciplines and areas to apply to his work. Ted Rall
  taught how to do those fool proof "Sunday experiments" as we came
  to call them. It was on Sundays that I could design and conduct
  those large and complex experiments with all of Ted's required
  controls such that the data were "publishable". We and others in
  the department were able to determine that multiple hormones
  including catecholamines, cholinergics, ACTH, vasopressin, etc.
  could increase or decrease adenylyl cyclase activity and cyclic
  AMP formation. Prior to this the view of Sutherland was that
  receptors and adenylyl cyclase were a single macromolecule or a
  tightly associated complex in cell membranes. My work as a
  student and the work of others questioned this hypothesis and
  suggested that different receptors for this growing list of
  hormones must be coupled to adenylyl cyclase in yet to be
  determined complex ways (see <a href=
  "../1994/index.html">Gilman</a>'s and <a href=
  "../1994/index.html">Rodbell</a>'s Nobel lecture of 1994 for a
  greater description of their subsequent work).<br>
  <br>
  I also enjoyed medical school and found myself learning
  everything presented before me. I knew that I couldn't determine
  what was to be true and important and many of our faculty
  acknowledged this as well. Since anything could be important, I
  began to learn everything taught. The new experimental integrated
  organ-system approach to medical education at Western Reserve
  permitted me to assimilate and integrate information more
  readily. I also thoroughly enjoyed my clinical rotations in
  medicine, surgery, OB-GYN, pediatrics, orthopedics, neurology,
  etc. There were few clinical rotations that I didn't think about
  as a possible discipline for my future academic career. I
  subsequently learned that I was at the top of the medical school
  and graduate school class each year and received prizes at
  graduation for both clinical medicine and research. I was in my
  element and loved it. There was no doubt in my mind about an
  academic career in medicine, research and teaching.<br>
  <br>
  In order to supplement my stipend with so many children, I
  moonlighted at the Cleveland Clinic working one or two nights per
  week on the OB-GYN service to follow mothers with pelvic exams as
  they progressed through labor, assisted in deliveries and
  Caesarian sections and then scrubbed tables and floors after each
  delivery. All of this for $20.00 per night for 12 hours of work
  from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. one or two nights per week for four
  years. On slow evenings I was able to study, analyze lab data and
  write research protocols. Some nights required that I work all
  night and then attend a full day of classes the next day. I
  continued this during my clinical clerkships requiring my absence
  from my family as often as 4 to 5 nights per week. However, I
  tried to have dinner with my family as often as my schedule
  permitted. My wife and children were very understanding. They
  grew up as wonderful children and adults in spite of my absence,
  obviously due to a devoted wife and mother. My current fetish is
  my 5 grandchildren who I try to spend as much time with as
  possible, undoubtedly due to my guilt as an absent father. I did
  manage to spend several weeks each summer with my family as we
  took them camping all over the U.S. to various scientific
  meetings. There are only a few states where we have not camped
  together as a family and they all became proficient swimmers at a
  young age.<br>
  <br>
  I decided to go to Massachusetts General Hospital for my
  internship and residency in medicine (1965-67). What a wonderful
  experience this was with some of the worlds' leading scientists,
  teachers and clinicians. Our group of 14 housestaff included
  exciting bright minds such as Tom Smith, Tony Gotto, Jim
  Willerson, Ed Scolnik and others that had considerable influence
  on me. My attendings and chief residents included Alex Leaf, Dan
  Federman, Roman DeSanctis, Frank Austen, Sam Thier, Ken Shine and
  others. As a resident Joe Goldstein and Mike Brown were two of
  our interns. I couldn't have asked for a greater introduction to
  medicine in spite of being on call every other night and weekend.
  I did, however, miss the laboratory and each spring I found
  myself in the library reading many of the abstracts of the
  Federation meeting (currently FASEB meeting) to see what I was
  missing in "second messengers and hormone signaling". I generated
  a notebook that contained numerous "obvious experiments" to be
  done. When I subsequently went to NIH as a clinical associate in
  the Heart Institute I was able to do many of the planned
  experiments in Martha Vaughan's laboratory. She too was an
  excellent mentor with a style different from either Sutherland or
  Rall. She gave me considerable freedom to pursue a number of
  areas related to cyclic AMP and hormonal regulation. Her husband,
  the late Jack Orloff, while superficially a gruff and tough man,
  was a sensitive person and talented scientist. I was indeed
  fortunate that they and many others at NIH influenced my thinking
  and career planning. I soon learned that I had numerous role
  models and attempted to extract the best features of each as I
  planned my career path and future.<br>
  <br>
  I remained at NIH for more than three years (1967-70) when the
  University of
  Virginia called to recruit me to develop a new Clinical
  Pharmacology Division in the Department of Medicine with an
  appointment as an Associate Professor in medicine and
  pharmacology. I couldn't resist the offer from Ed Hook, the new
  chairman of medicine and Joe Larner, the new chairman of
  pharmacology. Other faculty such as Tom Hunter, the Vice
  President of Medical Affairs, Ken Crispell the Dean, Bob Berne,
  Bob Haynes and others influenced my decision to leave NIH. I had
  known Larner, Berne and Haynes since they were faculty at Western
  Reserve when I was a student. Charlottesville was also an
  appealing place to raise my five children. Some colleagues around
  the country, particularly David Kipnis, another one of my role
  models, questioned me about going to Charlottesville. Just the
  previous year I called him to apply for a fellowship in
  endocrinology at Washington University. I was then 33 years old
  with 5 children and his advice was appropriate. He said, "Fred,
  time for you to get a job and support your family", and I took
  his advice to heart.<br>
  <br>
  I joined the faculty at the University of Virginia, September 1,
  1970 and nervously thought about how I could launch my own
  independent research career. I decided to work with cyclic GMP as
  it was beginning to emerge as a possible new "second messenger"
  to mediate hormone effects. This is detailed in my Nobel lecture.
  I remained at the University of Virginia from 1970 to 1981 where
  I was promoted as one of the youngest professors in 1975; I was
  also asked to become the Director of their Clinical Research
  Center in 1971 and the Director of Clinical Pharmacology in 1973.
  I built a research program with both clinical and basic studies
  and started to recruit many exciting students and fellows to work
  with me. Of the 82 fellows and students I have trained and
  collaborated with to date twenty are professors, chairmen,
  research directors and division chiefs around the world. I view
  them as offspring and keep in contact with most of them in my
  travels. There is no question that one of my greatest
  accomplishments is to have participated in the training of such
  successful scientists in my own laboratory and also influenced
  the careers of many talented medical students, graduate students
  and housestaff.<br>
  <br>
  After looking at many university positions around the country as
  a chair of medicine or pharmacology and industrial positions, I
  decided to go to Stanford in July 1981 as Chief of Medicine of the
  Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, a Stanford affiliated hospital. I
  was a professor of medicine and pharmacology and the associate
  chairman of medicine. While it was difficult to leave many
  friends and colleagues at the University of Virginia where we
  conducted the first experiments with the biological effects of
  nitric oxide, I couldn't turn down this exciting opportunity at
  Stanford. Ken Melmon was chairman of medicine and during our
  first three years together we recruited about 30 new young
  faculty. Inspite of the large administrative and clinical
  teaching demands, I continued to supervise a large and productive
  laboratory with about 15 students, fellows and staff. Trainees
  continued to come to our laboratory from all over the world. Some
  of my students and fellows subsequently went to medical school
  and after completing residencies have become very productive
  physician scientists at a number of institutions.<br>
  <br>
  After a stint as Acting Chairman of Medicine at Stanford
  (1986-88), I left to become a Vice President at Abbott
  Laboratories as I was becoming concerned about managed health
  care on the horizon and its possible effects on patient care,
  research and education. After considering several industrial
  positions, I chose Abbott primarily because of its president Jack
  Schuler, a sales and marketing person with an MBA from Stanford
  who also had considerable vision. We worked well together as he
  taught me many business principles and I taught him about drug
  discovery and development. I enjoyed the access to all of
  Abbott's resources, scientific staff, instrumentation and what
  initially seemed like an unlimited research budget. I eventually
  learned that one can never have enough resources when one looks
  for novel therapies of major diseases; it's an expensive
  undertaking. Nevertheless, in four years of directing their
  pharmaceutical discovery and development programs we were able to
  discover many novel drug targets and we brought forward about 24
  new compounds for clinical trials for various diseases. I
  continued to have a very productive lab with two NIH grants, some
  outside funding for fellows and about 20 scientists working with
  me on nitric oxide and cyclic GMP. The administrative demands and
  travel were considerable since I was a corporate officer, vice
  president and also overseeing many industrial collaborations
  around the world. When I left Abbott I was supervising about 1500
  scientists and staff and probably earned the equivalent of an MBA
  from the experience on the job plus periodic management courses
  required by the company. Before my arrival at Abbott the company
  had no postdoctoral fellows or extramural funding. When I left we
  had about $3.5 mill. per year of extramural grant support and
  about 35 fellows in pharmaceutical research. Unfortunately,
  Abbott reorganized its senior management and my business role
  models were asked to leave. As Abbott's senior scientist I found
  myself wedged between upper management, the marketing staff and
  the scientists and constantly was defending my decisions about
  the research programs. There were always considerable marketing
  pressures on me that in my opinion were often the wrong decisions
  to develop novel therapeutics for diseases without adequate
  therapy.<br>
  <br>
  I left Abbott in 1993 to be a founder, President and CEO of a new
  biotech company, Molecular Geriatrics Corporation. The plan was
  to create another intensive research-based biotech company.
  Unfortunately, my investment banker never raised the amounts of
  money promised and he eventually lost a major personal fortune
  with his leveraging tactics. I found myself skipping around the
  world to find investors and partners to keep the company afloat
  and pay the bills. After a partnership with a major
  pharmaceutical company and some more financing as a private
  company, I left to rejoin academics, hopefully much wiser.<br>
  <br>
  After considering a number of Vice President, Dean positions and
  Chairmanships, I realized that such positions would probably
  totally remove me from the laboratory, fellows and students,
  things I could not give up. In April 1997, I became the
  University of Texas-Houston's first chairman of a newly combined
  basic science department, Integrative Biology, Pharmacology and
  Physiology. I am also creating a new Division of Clinical
  Pharmacology jointly between our department and medicine. I plan
  to continue an active basic and clinical research program and
  will participate in clinical medicine and teaching again. Thus, I
  have come full circle. I am back in my academic element again and
  I love it. I also expect to continue some business adventures and
  exercise my entrepreneurial skills, areas that I also enjoy and
  view as lucrative hobbies. The freedom and intellectual
  environment of academic medicine and bright young students and
  fellows are exciting and a daily joy for me. After all, I hope to
  tell Ron Delismon some day "Two Nobels to zero".</p>
