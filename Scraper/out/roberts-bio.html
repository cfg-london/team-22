  <h1>Richard J. Roberts - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="roberts.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  1943, the only child of John and Edna Roberts (n&eacute;e Allsop)
  in Derby, England. My father was a motor mechanic and my mother a
  homemaker. We moved to Bath when I was four and so I consider
  myself a Bathonian. My elementary education was at Christ Church
  infant school and St. Stephen's junior school. At St. Stephen's I
  encountered my first real mentor, the headmaster Mr. Broakes. He
  must have spotted something unusual in me for he spent lots of
  time encouraging my interest in mathematics. He would produce
  problems and puzzles for me to solve and I still enjoy the
  challenge of crossword and logical puzzles. Most importantly, I
  learned that logic and mathematics are fun! After passing the
  "dreaded" 11 + exam I moved on to the City of Bath Boys (now
  Beechen Cliff) School.<br>
  <br>
  At this time I wanted to be a detective, where it seemed they
  paid you to solve puzzles. This changed quickly when I received a
  chemistry set as a present. I soon exhausted the experiments that
  came with the set and started reading about less mundane ones.
  More interesting apparatus like Bunsen burners, retorts, flasks
  and beakers were purchased. My father, ever supportive of my
  endeavors, arranged for the construction of a large chemistry
  cabinet complete with a formica top, drawers, cupboards and
  shelves. This was to be my pride and joy for many years. Through
  my father, I met a local pharmacist who became a source of
  chemicals that were not in the toy stores. I soon discovered
  fireworks and other concoctions. Luckily, I survived those years
  with no serious injuries or burns. I knew I had to be a
  chemist.<br>
  <br>
  I am a passionate reader, having been tutored very early by my
  mother. I avidly devoured all books on chemistry that I could
  find. Formal chemistry at school seemed boring by comparison and
  my performance was routine. In contrast, I did spectacularly well
  in mathematics and sailed through classes and exams with ease.
  During these years at school I also discovered chess, which I
  loved, and billiards and snooker, which became a consuming
  passion. At age 15, I easily passed the O-level examinations and
  then began to specialize in the sciences taking Mathematics,
  Physics and Chemistry. For exercise I discovered the sport of
  caving and would spend most weekends underground on the nearby
  Mendips.<br>
  <br>
  From age 16 on I found school boring and failed A-level Physics
  at my first attempt. This was necessary for University entrance
  and so I stayed an extra year to repeat it. This time I did
  splendidly and was admitted to Sheffield University, my first
  choice because of their excellent Chemistry Department. After
  Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics in the first year, I opted for
  Biochemistry as a subsidiary subject in the second year. I
  loathed it. The lectures merely required rote learning and the
  laboratory consisted of the most dull experiments imaginable. I
  was grateful when that year was over and could concentrate wholly
  on Chemistry. I graduated in 1965 with an upper second class
  honours degree.<br>
  <br>
  As an undergraduate, David Ollis, the Professor of Organic
  Chemistry, really caught my imagination. His course emphasized
  problem solving, not memorization - more puzzles! Fortunately, he
  accepted me as his Ph.D. student and I began to explore the
  neoflavonoids found in a piece of heartwood from a Brazilian
  tree. Two pieces of luck followed. My tree contained more than
  its fair share of interesting new compounds and I was put in a
  lab with an exceptional postdoctoral fellow, Kazu Kurosawa, who
  proved a gifted teacher. Not only did he suggest the right
  experiments he explained why they should be done. Within one year
  I had essentially enough for my thesis and an understanding of
  how to do research. I had the luxury of spending the next two
  years following my nose, reading and experimenting.<br>
  <br>
  During this time I came across a book, by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">John Kendrew</a>, that was
  to change the course of my research career. It described the
  early history of crystallography and molecular biology focussing
  on the MRC
  Laboratory in Cambridge. It was my first exposure to
  "molecular biology" and I became hooked. For postdoctoral
  studies, I looked for a laboratory doing biochemistry that might
  accept an organic chemist and provide a pathway into molecular
  biology. Luckily, Jack Strominger offered me a position, not in
  Wisconsin as I had thought, but at Harvard where he had just been
  appointed Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. It was
  on January 1st, 1969, that my family walked across the runway at
  Logan Airport with an outside temperature of 4&deg;F and a
  massive wind blowing, to start a new life.<br>
  <br>
  The next four years were wonderful. Mostly, I learned, although
  at first I was in a fog. Everyone spoke in acronyms: DNA, RNA,
  ATP, UDP, GlcNAc. Luckily two Australians, Aubrey Egan and Allen
  Warth, lived close to my apartment and we would drive in and out
  of the lab together each day. Those half hour commutes became my
  biochemistry classroom. Slowly I learned the jargon. A third
  Australian, Tom Stewart patiently guided me into the world of
  tRNAs since it was his project that I was to pick up. I was
  assigned the job of sequencing a tRNA that was involved in
  bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. In 1969, only a handful of
  tRNAs had been sequenced previously, mostly by chemical
  techniques introduced by Holly and his contemporaries. However,
  within a few months and much reading, I decided that a new
  method, being pioneered in <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1958/index.html">Fred Sanger</a>'s lab in
  Cambridge, was much better. In late 1970, I had succeeded in
  making enough pure tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to start sequencing and set
  off for a one month sojourn in Cambridge to learn the techniques.
  What a wonderful time! I don't remember sleeping, but I do
  remember the excitement of meeting Fred and the other famous
  researchers, many of whom had featured in Kendrew's book. This
  was a heady experience that validated my decision to be a
  molecular biologist.<br>
  <br>
  On my return to Harvard, my small sequencing operation was the
  first in the Boston area and many researchers came to learn the
  techniques. My own sequencing was successful and I managed two
  Nature papers during this postdoctoral period. When it came time
  to leave Harvard I wanted to return to the UK and applied for a
  job in Edinburgh. In the meantime, I was approached by Mark
  Ptashne, who told me that <a href="../1962/index.html">Jim
  Watson</a> ("the" Watson) was looking for someone to sequence
  SV40. I had not met Jim previously and I was over-awed when he
  offered me the job after a 10 minute meeting, during which I
  mainly listened! It was a challenging project made all the more
  exciting by Jim's description and his offer of a good salary,
  money to support a lab and all necessary set-up money. With a
  month to decide and no word from Edinburgh, I decided the offer
  was too good to turn down. In September, 1972, I moved to Cold
  Spring Harbor.<br>
  <br>
  Earlier in 1972, I attended a seminar at Harvard Medical
  School given by <a href="../1978/index.html">Dan Nathans</a>.
  He described an enzyme, Endonuclease R, that could cleave DNA
  into specific pieces. This was to shape much of my subsequent
  research career. Sanger had developed RNA sequencing because
  there were plenty of small RNA molecules to practice on, but no
  suitable DNA molecules. I realized that Nathans' restriction
  enzyme gave an immediate way to isolate small DNA molecules.
  Surely there must be more restriction enzymes with different
  specificities. DNA sequencing seemed within reach and I was
  exhilarated. Upon moving to Cold Spring Harbor, I set out to make preparations
  of Endonuclease R and the few other restriction enzymes known at
  the time. We also began a systematic search for new ones. I also
  made some DNA, since I had never worked with it before!<br>
  <br>
  A key factor in our restriction enzyme success was a highly
  talented technician, Phyllis Myers, who joined me in 1973. She
  became the keeper of our enzyme collection and a valuable
  resource to scientists around the world. We constantly sent
  samples to other researchers and were inundated with visitors.
  Every meeting at Cold Spring Harbor brought a few people carrying
  tubes of DNA to see if we had an enzyme that would cut it. Three
  quarters of the world's first restriction enzymes were discovered
  or characterized in my laboratory. I made a lot of friends in
  those days!<br>
  <br>
  Plans to sequence SV40 DNA were abandoned shortly after reaching
  Cold Spring Harbor. Instead we turned our attention to
  Adenovirus-2 DNA. Ulf Pettersson had brought this system to the
  laboratory shortly before my arrival and it seemed a good model
  system because it was similar in size to bacteriophage lambda,
  where many spectacular advances in prokaryotic molecular biology
  had taken place. We began to map the DNA. Similar work was being
  carried out in Joe Sambrook's lab at Cold Spring Harbor and
  eventually led to the only joint publication I have with <a href=
  "index.html">Phil Sharp</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1974, Richard Gelinas, whom I had first met at Harvard, joined
  my laboratory to characterize the initiation and termination
  signals for an Adenovirus-2 mRNA. The idea was to sequence the
  5'-end of an mRNA, map its location on a restriction fragment,
  and then sequence the upstream region. This would be the
  promoter. Shortly after beginning the project, mRNA caps were
  discovered and we developed an assay for capped oligonucleotides.
  All seemed well until we came up with the startling finding that
  all late mRNAs seemed to begin with the same capped
  oligonucleotide, which was not encoded on the DNA next to the
  main body of the mRNA. We had excellent biochemical evidence for
  this, but real proof was elusive. In March, 1977, I hit on the
  right experiment to show that our proposed split structure for
  Adenovirus-2 mRNAs was correct. Louise Chow and Tom Broker, two
  talented electron microscopists, agreed to collaborate with us on
  the crucial experiment. We hoped to visualize the split structure
  by hybridizing an intact mRNA to its two different coding
  regions. Based on a guess about the location of the coding region
  for the 5'-end, we made appropriate DNA fragments. The reason for
  our guess turned out to be wrong, but luckily the fragment worked
  anyway! Finally, by direct visualization we could see the split
  genes in the electron microscope.<br>
  <br>
  Our own work turned to an analysis of the sequences involved in
  RNA splicing. Joe Sambrook and Walter Keller cloned the common
  leader sequence at the 5'-end of late Adenovirus-2 mRNAs and
  Sayeeda Zain in my lab sequenced it. Later we undertook the
  complete sequence of Adenovirus-2 DNA. This required a lot of
  computer software development and I was fortunate to have Richard
  Gelinas and Tom Gingeras spearheading this effort. In 1978, this
  was still a relatively new activity and not considered
  particularly biological. I had trouble convincing Jim Watson that
  computers were essential for modern biology and for several years
  we operated remotely through Stony Brook University. Eventually,
  I managed to get funding from NIH (Phil Sharp was chairman of a site-visit
  team that reviewed this grant) and we are still active in this
  area. My most recent work has been in the area of DNA methylases
  as outlined in the Nobel Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  In 1992 I moved to New England Biolabs, a small private company
  of 150 individuals making research reagents, most notably
  restriction enzymes, and carrying out basic research. In 1974 I
  had tried unsuccessfully to convince Jim Watson that Cold Spring
  Harbor should start a company to manufacture and sell restriction
  enzymes. He declined, thinking there was no money to be made.
  Soon after this I met Don Comb, the president and founder of New
  England Biolabs, who had a small basement operation going with
  himself, his wife and one technician. They were about to start
  selling the first restriction enzyme. I told him about our
  rapidly growing collection and was appointed their chief
  consultant. I am now joint Research Director with my good friend,
  Ira Schildkraut.<br>
  <br>
  The main theme of my work in biology has centered on the belief
  that we must know the structure of the molecules we work with if
  we are to understand how they function. This means knowing the
  sequence of macromolecules and cataloguing any modifications such
  as methylation. For proteins, 3-dimensional structure and
  post-translational modification are crucial. This latter area is
  a target for my future work. Throughout my life in science I have
  been fortunate to have friends and family who will bring me back
  to earth and remind me that there is much in life to be savored
  besides Science. I enjoy music very much and love to collect and
  play games, especially video games. I am indebted to my wife
  Jean, and my children, Alison, Andrew, Christopher and Amanda who
  have been a source of great joy and comfort.</p>
