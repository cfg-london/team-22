  <h1>Wilhelm Conrad R&ouml;ntgen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rontgen.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Wilhelm
  Conrad R&ouml;ntgen</b> was born on March 27, 1845, at Lennep in
  the Lower Rhine Province of Germany, as the only child of a
  merchant in, and manufacturer of, cloth. His mother was Charlotte
  Constanze Frowein of Amsterdam, a member of an old Lennep family
  which had settled in Amsterdam.<br>
  <br>
  When he was three years old, his family moved to Apeldoorn in The
  Netherlands, where he went to the Institute of Martinus Herman
  van Doorn, a boarding school. He did not show any special
  aptitude, but showed a love of nature and was fond of roaming in
  the open country and forests. He was especially apt at making
  mechanical contrivances, a characteristic which remained with him
  also in later life. In 1862 he entered a technical school at
  Utrecht, where he was however unfairly expelled, accused of
  having produced a caricature of one of the teachers, which was in
  fact done by someone else.<br>
  <br>
  He then entered the University of Utrecht in 1865 to study physics. Not
  having attained the credentials required for a regular student,
  and hearing that he could enter the Polytechnic at Zurich by
  passing its examination, he passed this and began studies there
  as a student of mechanical engineering. He attended the lectures
  given by Clausius and also worked in the laboratory of Kundt.
  Both Kundt and Clausius exerted great influence on his
  development. In 1869 he graduated Ph.D. at the University of Zurich,
  was appointed assistant to Kundt and went with him to
  W&uuml;rzburg in the same year, and three years later to
  Strasbourg.<br>
  <br>
  In 1874 he qualified as Lecturer at Strasbourg University and in
  1875 he was appointed Professor in the Academy of Agriculture at
  Hohenheim in W&uuml;rttemberg. In 1876 he returned to Strasbourg as
  Professor of Physics, but three years later he accepted the
  invitation to the Chair of Physics in the University of
  Giessen.<br>
  <br>
  After having declined invitations to similar positions in the
  Universities of
  Jena (1886) and Utrecht (1888), he accepted it from the
  University
  of W&uuml;rzburg (1888), where he succeeded Kohlrausch and
  found among his colleagues Helmholtz and Lorenz. In 1899 he
  declined an offer to the Chair of Physics in the University of
  Leipzig, but in 1900 he accepted it in the University of
  Munich, by special request of the Bavarian government, as
  successor of E. Lommel. Here he remained for the rest of his
  life, although he was offered, but declined, the Presidency of
  the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt at Berlin and the Chair
  of Physics of the Berlin Academy.<br>
  <br>
  R&ouml;ntgen's first work was published in 1870, dealing with the
  specific heats of gases, followed a few years later by a paper on
  the thermal conductivity of crystals. Among other problems he
  studied were the electrical and other characteristics of quartz;
  the influence of pressure on the refractive indices of various
  fluids; the modification of the planes of polarised light by
  electromagnetic influences; the variations in the functions of
  the temperature and the compressibility of water and other
  fluids; the phenomena accompanying the spreading of oil drops on
  water.<br>
  <br>
  R&ouml;ntgen's name, however, is chiefly associated with his
  discovery of the rays that he called X-rays. In 1895 he was
  studying the phenomena accompanying the passage of an electric
  current through a gas of extremely low pressure. Previous work in
  this field had already been carried out by J. Plucker
  (1801-1868), J. W. Hittorf (1824-1914), C. F. Varley (1828-1883),
  E. Goldstein (1850-1931), Sir William Crookes (1832-1919), H.
  Hertz (1857-1894) and <a href="../1905/index.html">Ph. von
  Lenard</a> (1862-1947), and by the work of these scientists the
  properties of cathode rays - the name given by Goldstein to the
  electric current established in highly rarefied gases by the very
  high tension electricity generated by Ruhmkorff's induction
  coil - had become well known. R&ouml;ntgen's work on cathode rays
  led him, however, to the discovery of a new and different kind of
  rays.<br>
  <br>
  On the evening of November 8, 1895, he found that, if the
  discharge tube is enclosed in a sealed, thick black carton to
  exclude all light, and if he worked in a dark room, a paper plate
  covered on one side with barium platinocyanide placed in the path
  of the rays became fluorescent even when it was as far as two
  metres from the discharge tube. During subsequent experiments he
  found that objects of different thicknesses interposed in the
  path of the rays showed variable transparency to them when
  recorded on a photographic plate. When he immobilised for some
  moments the hand of his wife in the path of the rays over a
  photographic plate, he observed after development of the plate an
  image of his wife's hand which showed the shadows thrown by the
  bones of her hand and that of a ring she was wearing, surrounded
  by the penumbra of the flesh, which was more permeable to the
  rays and therefore threw a fainter shadow. This was the first
  "r&ouml;ntgenogram" ever taken. In further experiments,
  R&ouml;ntgen showed that the new rays are produced by the impact
  of cathode rays on a material object. Because their nature was
  then unknown, he gave them the name X-rays. Later, <a href=
  "../1914/index.html">Max von Laue</a> and his pupils showed that
  they are of the same electromagnetic nature as light, but differ
  from it only in the higher frequency of their vibration.<br>
  <br>
  Numerous honours were showered upon him. In several cities,
  streets were named after him, and a complete list of Prizes,
  Medals, honorary doctorates, honorary and corresponding
  memberships of learned societies in Germany as well as abroad,
  and other honours would fill a whole page of this book. In spite
  of all this, R&ouml;ntgen retained the characteristic of a
  strikingly modest and reticent man. Throughout his life he
  retained his love of nature and outdoor occupations. Many
  vacations were spent at his summer home at Weilheim, at the foot
  of the Bavarian Alps, where he entertained his friends and went
  on many expeditions into the mountains. He was a great
  mountaineer and more than once got into dangerous situations.
  Amiable and courteous by nature, he was always understanding the
  views and difficulties of others. He was always shy of having an
  assistant, and preferred to work alone. Much of the apparatus he
  used was built by himself with great ingenuity and experimental
  skill.<br>
  <br>
  R&ouml;ntgen married Anna Bertha Ludwig of Z&uuml;rich, whom he
  had met in the caf&eacute; run by her father. She was a niece of
  the poet Otto Ludwig. They married in 1872 in Apeldoorn, The
  Netherlands. They had no children, but in 1887 adopted Josephine
  Bertha Ludwig, then aged 6, daughter of Mrs. R&ouml;ntgen's only
  brother. Four years after his wife, R&ouml;ntgen died at Munich
  on February 10, 1923, from carcinoma of the intestine.</p>
