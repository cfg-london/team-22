  <h1>Geoffrey Wilkinson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wilkinson.jpg" class="bio-img">I was
  born in Springside, a village close to Todmorden in west
  Yorkshire on July 14th, 1921. The house where I was born and
  indeed most of the village has been demolished by the local
  council as being unfit for habitation. My father, and his father,
  also Geoffrey, were both master house painters and decorators,
  the latter, youngest of twelve children having migrated from
  Boroughbridge in Yorkshire about 1880. My mother's family were
  originally of hill farming stock but many of my relations were
  weavers in the local cotton mills and indeed my mother went into
  the mill at an early age. My first introduction to chemistry came
  at a quite early age through my mother's elder brother. A well
  known organist and choirmaster he had married into a family that
  owned a small chemical company making Epsom and Glauber's salt
  for the pharmaceutical industry. I used to play around in their
  small laboratory as well as go with my uncle on visits to various
  chemical companies.<br>
  <br>
  The oldest of three children, I was educated in the local council
  primary school and after winning a County Scholarship in 1932,
  went to Todmorden Secondary School. This small school has had an
  unusual record of scholarly achievement, including two Nobel
  Laureates within 25 years. I actually had the same Physics
  teacher as <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/index.html">Sir John
  Cockcroft</a>, but physics was never my favourite subject.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 I obtained a Royal Scholarship for study at the Imperial College of
  Science and Technology where I graduated in 1941. As it was
  wartime, I was directed to stay on and did some research under
  the supervision of my predecessor, Professor H.V.A. Briscoe. In
  late 1942, Professor F.A. Paneth was recruiting young chemists
  for the nuclear energy project which I joined. I was sent out to
  Canada in January 1943 and remained in Montreal and later Chalk
  River until I could leave in 1946. Having been attracted by the
  prospect of California, I wrote to, and was accepted by <a href=
  "../1951/index.html">Professor Glenn T. Seaborg</a>. For the next
  four years in Berkeley I was engaged mostly on nuclear taxonomy
  and made many new neutron deficient isotopes using the cyclotrons
  of the Radiation Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  On a visit in 1949 to England, Briscoe advised me that I was
  unlikely to get an academic position in England in nuclear
  chemistry so that when I went as Research Associate to the
  Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology in 1950, I began to return to my
  first interest as a student - transition metal complexes such as
  carbonyls and olefin complexes.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951 I was offered an Assistant Professorship at Harvard University,
  largely because of my nuclear background. I was at Harvard from
  September 1951 until I returned to England in December, 1955,
  with a sabbatical break of nine months in Copenhagen in Professor
  Jannik Bjerrum's laboratory as a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow. At
  Harvard, I still did some nuclear work on excitation functions
  for protons on cobalt but I had already begun to work on olefin
  complexes so that I was primed for the appearance of the
  celebrated Kealy and Pauson note on dicyclopentadienyliron in
  Nature in early 1952.<br>
  <br>
  In June 1955, I was appointed to the chair of Inorganic Chemistry
  at Imperial College in the University of London, which, at that time was
  the only established chair in the subject in the United Kingdom
  and took up the position in January 1956. I have been at the
  College ever since and have worked, with a relatively few
  students and postdoctoral fellows, almost entirely on the
  complexes of transition metals. I have been much interested in
  the complex chemistry of ruthenium, rhodium and rhenium, in
  compounds of unsaturated hydrocarbons and with metal to hydrogen
  bonds. The latter led to work on homogeneous catalytic reactions
  such as hydrogenation and hydroformylation of olefins.<br>
  <br>
  In 1952 I married Lise S&oslash;lver, only daughter of Professor
  and Mrs. Svend Aage Schou, lately Rector of Denmark's
  Pharmaceutical High School and we have two daughters.</p>
