  <h1>Yuan T. Lee - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lee.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Yuan Tseh Lee</b> was born on November 19,
 1936 in Hsinchu, Taiwan. His father is an accomplished artist and
 his mother a school teacher.<br>
 <br>
 He started his early education while Taiwan was under Japanese
 occupation - a result of a war between China and Japan in 1894.
 His elementary education was disrupted soon after it started
 during World War II while the city populace was relocated to the
 mountains to avoid the daily bombing by the Allies. It was not
 until after the war when Taiwan was returned to China that he was
 able to attend school normally as a third year student in grade
 school.<br>
 <br>
 His elementary and secondary education in Hsinchu was rather
 colorful and full of fun. In elementary school, he was the second
 baseman on the school's baseball team as well as a member of the
 ping-pong team which won the little league championship in
 Taiwan. In high school he played on the tennis team besides
 playing trombone in the marching band.<br>
 <br>
 Besides his interest in sports during this time, he was also an
 avid and serious reader of a wide variety of books covering
 science, literature, and social science. The biography of
 <a href="../1911/index.html">Madame Curie</a> made a strong
 impact on him at a young age. It was Madame Curie's beautiful
 life as a wonderful human being, her dedication toward science,
 her selflessness, idealism that made him decide to be a
 scientist.<br>
 <br>
 In 1955, with his excellent academic performance in high school,
 Lee was admitted to the National Taiwan University without having to
 take the entrance examination, a practice the Universities took
 to admit the best students. By the end of his freshman year he
 had decided chemistry was to be his chosen field. Although the
 facilities in the Taiwan University were less than ideal, the
 free and exciting atmosphere, the dedication of some professors,
 and the camaraderie among fellow students in a way made up for
 it. He worked under Professor Hua-sheng Cheng on his B.S. thesis
 which was on the separation of Sr and Ba using the paper
 electrophoresis method.<br>
 <br>
 After graduation in 1959, he went on to the National Tsinghua University to do his graduate
 work. He received his Master's degree on the studies of the
 natural radioisotopes contained in Hukutolite, a mineral of hot
 spring sediment under Professor H. Hamaguchi's guidance. After
 receiving his M.S. he stayed on at Tsinghua University as a
 research assistant of Professor C.H. Wong and carried out the
 x-ray structure determination of tricyclopentadienyl
 samarium.<br>
 <br>
 He entered the University of California at Berkeley as a graduate
 student in 1962. He worked under the late Professor Bruce Mahan
 for his thesis research on chemi-ionization processes of
 electronically excited alkali atoms. During his graduate student
 years, he developed an interest in ion-molecule reactions and the
 dynamics of molecular scattering, especially the crossed
 molecular beam studies of reaction dynamics.<br>
 <br>
 Upon receiving his Ph.D. degree in 1965, he stayed on in Mahan's
 group and started to work on ion molecule reactive scattering
 experiments with Ron Gentry using ion beam techniques measuring
 energy and angular distributions. In a period of about a year he
 learned the art of designing and constructing a very powerful
 scattering apparatus and carried out successful experiments on
 N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub> --&gt;
 N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> + H and obtained a complete product
 distribution contour map, a remarkable accomplishment at that
 time.<br>
 <br>
 In February 1967, he joined <a href="index.html">Professor Dudley
 Herschbach</a> at Harvard University as a post-doctoral fellow. He
 spent half his time working with Robert Gordon on the reactions
 of hydrogen atoms and diatomic alkali molecules and the other
 half of his time on the construction of a universal crossed
 molecular beams apparatus with Doug McDonald and Pierre LeBreton.
 Time was certainly ripe to move the crossed molecular beams
 method beyond the alkali age. With tremendous effort and valuable
 assistance from the machine shop foreman, George Pisiello, the
 machine was completed in ten months and the first successful non
 alkali neutral beam experiment on Cl + Br<sub>2</sub> --&gt; BrCl
 + Br was carried out in late 1967.<br>
 <br>
 He accepted the position as an assistant professor in the
 Department of Chemistry and the James Franck Institute of the
 University of
 Chicago in October 1968. There he started an illustrious
 academic career. His further development as a creative scientist
 and his construction of a new generation state-of-the-art crossed
 molecular beams apparatus enabled him to carry out numerous
 exciting and pioneering experiments with his students. He was
 promoted to associate professor in October 1971 and professor in
 January 1973.<br>
 <br>
 In 1974, he returned to Berkeley as professor of chemistry and
 principal investigator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the
 University of California. He became an American citizen the same
 year.<br>
 <br>
 In the ensuing years, his scientific efforts blossomed and the
 scope expanded. His world leading laboratory now contains seven
 very sophisticated molecular beams apparati which were specially
 designed to pursue problems associated with reaction dynamics,
 photochemical processes, and molecular spectroscopy. His
 laboratory has always attracted bright scientists from all over
 the world and they always seem to enjoy working together. He
 takes great pride in the fact that more than fifteen of his
 former associates are serving as professors in major
 universities, and many others are making great contributions at
 the national laboratories and in the private sector.<br>
 <br>
 Lee and his wife, Bernice Wu, whom he first met in elementary
 school have two sons, Ted (born in 1963), Sidney (born in 1966)
 and a daughter, Charlotte (born in 1969).</p>
