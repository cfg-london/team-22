  <h1>Otto Diels - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="diels.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Otto Paul Hermann Diels</b> was born
  in Hamburg, Germany, on January 23, 1876. When he was two years
  of age the family moved to Berlin, where his father was appointed
  to a professorship. His early education, from 1882 to 1895, was
  at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium, Berlin. In 1895 he went to
  Berlin University where he studied chemistry, together with other
  science subjects, under <a href="../1902/index.html">Emil
  Fischer</a>, graduating in 1899. He was at once appointed
  assistant at the Institute of Chemistry at Berlin University,
  becoming a lecturer in 1904. Promotion to Professor followed in
  1906, and he was appointed Head of Department in 1913. He became
  Professor at the University of Berlin in 1915 but, the following
  year, moved to the University of Kiel as Professor and Director of the
  Institute of Chemistry. There he remained until his retirement in
  1945.<br>
  <br>
  His earliest research was in the field of inorganic chemistry,
  where he was the discoverer of an oxide of carbon having some
  unusual properties - carbon suboxide. His subsequent work was in
  the domain of organic chemistry. He was responsible for
  introducing the use of selenium as a specific reagent for the
  dehydrogenation of hydroaromatic compounds (1927). This proved to
  be a very useful tool in elucidating chemical structures in the
  complicated steroid series, where his name is associated with the
  hydrocarbon 3'-methyl-1,2-cyclopentenophenanthrene. Diels
  obtained this skeletal steroid structure by dehydrogenating
  cholesterol, and other members of the series, with
  selenium.<br>
  <br>
  His best known work was done in collaboration with Kurt Alder on
  the chemical reaction which bears their joint names (1928). This,
  sometimes known also as the diene synthesis, consists in the
  reaction of a diene with a second component which has carbonyl or
  carboxyl groups adjoining an ethylenic bond, to give unsaturated
  cyclic compounds. As the two reactants can be varied widely
  within the scope of this definition, a very large range of new
  compounds can be prepared. The reaction takes place without the
  need for forcing conditions and, by its use, many complicated
  natural products, and modifications thereof, may be
  synthesized.<br>
  <br>
  Diels was the author of the <i>Einf&uuml;hrung in die organische
  Chemie</i> (1907), which went through fifteen editions. He had
  many papers published, mostly in German scientific periodicals
  such as <i>Liebigs Annalen der Chemie</i>.<br>
  <br>
  One of his earliest awards was in 1904, when he was awarded a
  Gold Medal at the St. Louis (USA) International Exhibition. He
  won the Adolf v. Baeyer Medallion in 1930 and the Grosskreuz des
  Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in 1952. He held
  the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine from the University of
  Kiel and was a member of the Academies of Halle, Munich, and
  G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
  <br>
  Diels married, in 1909, Paula Geyer. They had three sons and two
  daughters; two of their sons were killed in action during World
  War II. He was interested in reading, music, and travel for his
  recreation, and, in his younger days, he had been fond of
  mountaineering. He died on March 7, 1954.</p>
