  <h1>Klas Pontus Arnoldson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="arnoldson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Klas
  Pontus Arnoldson</b> (October 27, 1844-February 20, 1916), the
  Swedish journalist, pacifist, and proponent of Scandinavian
  unity, was a man of humble origin. Born at G&ouml;teborg, the son
  of a caretaker, he was obliged to discontinue his formal
  education in the public schools of G&ouml;teborg at the age of
  sixteen because of family financial difficulties after the death
  of his father in 1860. For the next twenty-one years he worked
  for a railroad, first as a clerk and then for ten years as a
  station inspector in Jonsered, &Auml;lgar&aring;s, and
  Tumba.<br>
  <br>
  During these years, Arnoldson continued his studies, reading
  widely in history, religion, and philosophy; observed the
  political events of his day, especially the
  Danish-Austrian-Prussian War of 1864 and the Franco-Prussian War
  of 1870-1871; and evolved the ideas on religion, politics, and
  peace that he developed in detail in his voluminous
  writings.<br>
  <br>
  Arnoldson was a liberal in theology. Familiar with the humanistic
  tenets of religious movements originating in the nineteenth
  century in Great Britain and in the New England section of the
  United States, he decried fanatic dogmatism and espoused
  essentially Unitarian views on truth, tolerance, freedom of the
  individual conscience, freedom of thought, and human
  perfectability. These views he published in the <i>Nordiska
  Dagbladet</i> [Northern Daily] which he edited for a short time
  in the early 1870's, and in <i>Sanningss&ouml;karen</i> [The
  Truth Seeker], a monthly journal devoted to the exposition of
  &laquo;practical Christianity&raquo;, as well as in books and
  pamphlets.<br>
  <br>
  Arnoldson was also a liberal in political philosophy, committed
  to the practical application of the principle of democracy and
  individualism. From 1882 to 1887, as an elected member of the
  Parliament, he introduced legislation to extend the franchise and
  when it failed to pass, supported legislation which later
  succeeded; favored the extension of religious freedom; pursued an
  antimilitaristic policy; drafted a controversial resolution
  asking the government to investigate the possibility of
  guaranteed neutrality for Sweden<a href=

  <br>
  Outside Parliament Arnoldson carried on work for peace even more
  vigorously. Originally attracted to pacifism because of his
  repugnance for the wars of 1864 and 1870-1871 and because of his
  religious beliefs, Arnoldson was one of those instrumental in
  founding the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Association in 1883,
  occupying the position of secretary of the society and becoming
  the editor of <i>Tiden</i> [The Times], a medium for peace
  information and free debate. Not at his best in a managerial
  capacity, Arnoldson resigned from <i>Tiden</i> in 1885 when it
  ran into financial difficulties, and from his office with the
  peace society in 1887 when he felt himself being overwhelmed by
  financial problems, the pressure of work, and emotional
  depression. Arnoldson edited <i>Fredsv&auml;nnen</i> [The Friend
  of Peace] from 1885 to 1888 and the <i>Nordsvenska Dagbladet</i>
  [North Sweden Daily] from 1892 to 1894. For the most part,
  however, he kept himself free of administrative and political
  duties, devoting his energies to speaking and writing on behalf
  of arbitration. In 1888 he mounted a campaign for a popular
  petition addressed to the king favoring arbitration agreements
  with foreign nations. Extending his agitation to Norway in 1890,
  he spoke to receptive audiences throughout the country and
  provided some of the impetus for the Norwegian Parliament's
  passage of a resolution on arbitration addressed to the
  king.<br>
  <br>
  In the political controversy of 1895 between Norway and Sweden
  and in the final constitutional crisis which resulted in
  dissolution of their Union, Arnoldson sympathized with Norway.
  This was not popular in Sweden. When Arnoldson was named a Nobel
  peace laureate in 1908, some Swedish newspapers were incensed,
  saying that the award was an &laquo;outrage&raquo; against Sweden,
  a disgrace to &laquo;every Swedish man who takes pride in his
  national honor&raquo;, and, to add injury to insult, was paid for
  with &laquo;Swedish money&raquo; given by a Swedish countryman. In
  reply, L&oslash;vland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,
  pointed out that Arnoldson's candidacy had been proposed by the
  unanimous vote of the Swedish Group of the Interparliamentary
  Union<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his life, Arnoldson complemented his day-to-day
  political activity by writing. In his early years he wrote mainly
  journalistic pieces; in the last three decades of his life, he
  produced some major works. An historical essay on international
  law, <i>&Auml;r v&auml;rldsfred m&ouml;jlig?</i> [Is World Peace
  Possible? translated into English under the title of <i>Pax
  mundi</i>], appeared in 1890; <i>Religionen i forskningens
  ljus</i> [Religion in the Light of Research] in 1891; a history
  of the pacifist idea, <i>Seklernas hopp</i> [The Hope of the
  Centuries], in 1901. He also wrote polemical fiction, putting his
  pacifist message into novelistic and dramatistic form.<br>
  <br>
  Although Arnoldson suffered from periods of illness throughout
  his life, he lived to be seventy-two, dying of a heart attack in
  Stockholm in 1916.</p>
