  <h1>Hjalmar Branting - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="branting.jpg" class="bio-img">The
  &laquo;father&raquo; of socialism in Sweden, <b>Karl Hjalmar
  Branting</b> (November 23, 1860-February 24, 1925) was born in
  Stockholm, the only child of Professor Lars Branting, one of the
  principal developers of the Swedish school of gymnastics. He was
  educated at the exclusive Beskow School in Stockholm, passing his
  matriculation examination at the age of seventeen, with a
  distinguished record in mathematics and Latin. After studying at
  the University of
  Uppsala for the next five years, concentrating on mathematics
  and astronomy, he accepted a position in 1882 as an assistant to
  the director of the Stockholm Observatory.<br>
  <br>
  But Branting was a social scientist as well as a natural
  scientist. By 1880 he had adopted liberal views, which had their
  origin in his studies and observations on social and cultural
  questions. In 1881 when he learned that the Stockholm Workers
  Institute, which provided lectures and courses of study for
  workingmen, had been denied financial support by the city, he
  contributed from his personal funds the amount necessary to keep
  the Institute open. For Branting the year of 1883 proved
  decisive. In Paris he heard the lectures of the French Socialist,
  Paul Lafargue; in Zurich he learned about German socialist
  doctrine from Eduard Bernstein, who was publishing <i>Der
  Sozial-Demokrat</i> while in self-imposed exile; wherever he went
  - including Russia - he tested his thinking in discussion with
  workingmen and social philosophers.<br>
  <br>
  Giving up his scientific career in 1884, Branting joined the
  staff of the radical Stockholm paper <i>Tiden</i> [The Times] as
  foreign editor. He became editor-in-chief the next year but, like
  his predecessor in that office<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>,
  was unable to solve the financial crises which periodically
  afflicted the paper. Upon its demise in 1886, Branting became
  chief editor of another socialist newspaper,
  <i>Socialdemokraten</i>, making this journal, in the course of
  his thirty-one years' association with it, a textbook for the
  education of the workers and a potent force in Swedish politics.
  Radical though Branting was, he taught evolution rather than
  revolution, believing that true democracy could not exist without
  the active involvement of the workingmen and that any socialist
  philosophy not based on the democratic concept was a mockery.
  Branting was not a utopian doctrinaire then or afterwards. Thirty
  years later, in 1918 for instance, he contended that socialism
  was an applied theory of democratic development and that
  communism, on the contrary, was an oligarchy, an enemy of
  democracy and an enticement to economic disaster in its demand
  for destruction of proprietary rights.<br>
  <br>
  Branting was not only the schoolmaster of the movement, he was
  also its recruiter and field marshal. He formed workingmen's
  clubs, helped to organize unions, supported strikes, directed
  strategy. In demand as a speaker at innumerable meetings, he
  became one of the most skillful speakers in the land, noted for
  his logical argument, precision of style, blunt honesty, warmth
  of personality.<br>
  <br>
  He was the directing genius behind the formation of the Social
  Democratic Labor Party in 1889, serving as its president from
  1907 until his death. To advance the aspirations of the
  workingman, political action should, he believed, be enmeshed
  with industrial action, not superimposed upon it.<br>
  <br>
  Elected to the Lower Chamber of the Parliament in 1896 from a
  workingmen's constituency in Stockholm, Branting was the sole
  Social Democrat to hold a seat until 1902. In Parliament he gave
  visibility to the rights of workers, decried legislation against
  unions, pled for universal suffrage, supported national defence,
  and advocated peaceful solution of the crisis between Sweden and
  Norway over the dissolution of the union in 1905. Meanwhile, the
  power of his party grew: in 1902 there were four Social Democrats
  out of a total membership of 230 in the Lower Chamber of the
  Parliament; in 1903, thirteen; in 1908, thirty-four; in 1911,
  sixty-four; in 1914, seventy-two; in 1921, a hundred and
  ten.<br>
  <br>
  By 1917, the Social Democrats were a strong third party in what
  had traditionally been a two-party system. In that year the
  Social Democrats joined the Liberals in a coalition government,
  with Branting as minister of finance. The coalition sponsored the
  constitutional reform of 1919, extending the franchise to all
  males (women receiving the vote in 1921 under Branting's
  government), but it was dissolved when the Liberals refused to
  support the Social Democrats' demands for tax reform,
  unemployment insurance, and nationalization.<br>
  <br>
  Branting then formed his first government, depending upon Liberal
  support since he did not command a majority in Parliament. When
  the power of the Liberal Party appeared to be diminishing, he
  dissolved the Parliament in October of 1920, but the ensuing
  elections went against him. He returned to the prime ministry in
  October, 1921, retaining the foreign affairs portfolio and
  departed in April, 1923, when faced by a combination of the
  Liberals and Conservatives. When the elections of 1924 gave the
  Social Democrats a majority over each of the other two parties,
  Branting, for the third time, became prime minister, resigning in
  January, 1925, when his health failed.<br>
  <br>
  Branting's lifelong interest in international affairs was
  intensified during and after World War I. He supported the Allied
  position but insisted upon Swedish neutrality, tried to preserve
  the international solidarity of the labor-union movement, served
  as Sweden's representative to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919,
  advocated adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations. He
  led the successful movement to bring Sweden into the League,
  served as the Swedish delegate to the League, and was named to
  the Council of the League in 1923. Branting was chairman of the
  Assembly's Committee on Disarmament in 1920-1921 and a member of
  the Council's Committee on Disarmament in 1924; he participated
  in the settlement of the Greek-Italian conflict of 1923 and
  served as &laquo;rapporteur&raquo; in the Mosul dispute between
  Britain and Turkey in 1924; he was involved in the drafting of
  the Geneva Protocol, a proposed international security system
  requiring arbitration between hostile nations.<br>
  <br>
  Branting was a &laquo;constitutional pacifist&raquo;. He believed
  that security should be based on functional principles of
  justice, that truth in dispute could best be found through
  arbitration by a judicial body, not through survival in trial by
  combat.<br>
  <br>
  By the age of sixty-five, through his continuous and exacting
  labors, he had worn out a powerful physique bequeathed to him by
  heredity and strengthened by the discipline of gymnastics. He
  died in February, 1925, and was buried in Stockholm.</p>
