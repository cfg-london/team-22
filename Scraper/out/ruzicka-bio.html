  <h1>Leopold Ruzicka - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ruzicka.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Leopold Stephen Ruzicka</b><a href=
  "#anchor1164534">*</a> was born on September 13, 1887, in Vukovar, a small Croatian 
              town on the Danube, somewhat east of its confluence with the Drava. 
              His father, Stjepan Ruzicka, was a cooper; his mother's maiden name 
              was Ljubica Sever. His great-grandparents included a Czech, from 
              whom the name Ruzicka stems, an Upper Austrian and his wife from 
              Wurtemberg, the other five being Croats. His ancestors were artisans 
              or farmers, who had enjoyed at most a few years of schooling. After 
              the early death of his father in 1891, he returned with his mother 
              to her birthplace, Osijek, on the Drava somewhat west of its junction 
              with the Danube. There he attended the primary school and the classical 
              gymnasium where the Croatian language was used. He was a fairly 
              good pupil in a general way, but really interested only in physics 
              and mathematics. The other subjects, including the purely descriptive 
              sciences, left him cold. There was no chemistry in the curriculum 
              but, nevertheless, he decided to study this subject out of his interest 
              in the composition of natural products.<br>
              <br>
              He wanted to study at the Zurich Polytechnic Institute but found 
              to his dismay that an entrance examination was required not only 
              in chemistry but also in "descriptive geometry". He decided to go 
              instead to Germany, where anyone with a completed secondary school 
              education was acceptable as a student at a University or Technical 
              Institute without having to undergo additional entrance examinations. 
              He chose the Technische Hochschule at Karlsruhe, where he began 
              his chemical studies in 1906. This step proved to be decisive for 
              his future. Only later did he discover that in Zurich the curriculum, 
              including practical work, was organized on a very rigid basis; still 
              in 1906 attendance at the lectures was or could be checked. In Karlsruhe, 
              on the other hand, there was considerable freedom. He completed 
              his laboratory courses in 1 3 /4 years and then immediately started 
              his doctoral work on ketenes with Professor <a href=
  "../1953/index.html">Staudinger</a>, who was, at 27, only 6 1/2 years older. 
              There were few bureaucratic formalities; he had attended the prescribed 
              lectures neither in chemical technology nor, unfortunately, in physical 
              chemistry and physics.<br>
              <br>
              After two years of research work Ruzicka was a "Dipl. Ing", and 
              two weeks later "Dr. Ing". Staudinger appointed him as his assistant, 
              and they together entered the quite unexplored field of the active 
              constituents - named by them pyrethrins - of Dalmatian insect powder, 
              a plant product, toxic to insects and other coldblooded animals. 
              They thus opened a new chapter of alicyclic chemistry, which was 
              then as unfamiliar to Ruzicka as it was to Staudinger.<br>
              <br>
              In October 1912 he followed Staudinger who became <a href=
  "../1915/index.html">Willst&auml;tter</a>'s successor at the newly dubbed "Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule" (ETH, Swiss Federal 
              Institute of Technology) at Zurich. In Switzerland he found not 
              only a second homeland but also a peaceful and convivial environment 
              that brought with it all the conditions for uninterrupted research. 
              In 1917 he acquired Swiss citizenship.<br>
              <br>
              In the previous year he had already started independent work and 
              this decision initiated the most fruitful and happy decade of his 
              life, when he could work at the laboratory bench from morning to 
              night, on problems of his own choosing, with no teaching responsibilities, 
              except one hour weekly from 1918 onward. During the years 1920-1924 
              he laid the fundaments of all his future work.<br>
              <br>
              For the accomplishment of his Habilitation work (necessary to become 
              a "Privatdozent") in 1916-1917 he was glad of the support of the 
              oldest perfume manufacturers in the world, Haarman &amp; Reimer, 
              of Holzminden in Germany. The starting-point for their collaboration 
              was the Tiemann formula for drone; the results were the total synthesis 
              of fenchone and the extension and interpretation of the Wagner rearrangement 
              (this term was then introduced by him). After his habilitation in 
              1918 the firm of Ciba, Basle, became interested in his work on the 
              preparation of quinine-like compounds. With various co-workers, 
              the first synthesis of <font face="Symbol">b</font>-collidine and 
              of linalool, the partial synthesis of pinene, and a series of investigations 
              in the monoterpene field were carried out.<br>
              <br>
              In 1921, the Geneva perfume manufacturers Chuit, Naef &amp; Firmenich, 
              asked him to collaborate with them. By this time the investigations 
              that were to lead to the elucidation of the constitutional formulas 
              of the higher terpenes has already been started. In the perfumery 
              and sesquiterpene domain the total syntheses of nerolidol and farnesol 
              were carried through. The structure of jasmone was established, 
              Tiemann's irone formula corrected, and synthetic work in these fields 
              undertaken. But by far the most important fruits collected in the 
              perfumery garden were the elucidations of the structures of the 
              naturally occurring musk perfumes, civetone and muscone. Following 
              these discoveries Ruzicka and his co-workers were able to prepare 
              the whole series of alicyclic ketones with 9 to over 30 carbon atoms 
              as ring members, compounds that had previously been believed to 
              be incapable to existence.<br>
              <br>
              Most of the years 1925-1926 he spent with his friends in Geneva. 
              From October 1926 till 1929 he was Professor of Organic Chemistry 
              at the University of Utrecht. Although he was very happy in Holland, 
              he decided to accept the invitation of the ETH to return to Zurich. 
              The main reason for this decision was the strength of the Swiss 
              organic chemical industry, especially its pharmaceutical and perfumery 
              branches, which required the skill and energy of a whole army of 
              chemists with a thorough training in modern organic chemistry. This 
              circumstance was not only a challenge to the teaching and research 
              abilities of the professors; it also encouraged students to acquire 
              the necessary understanding of the theories and methods to equip 
              them for a career in these industries. The three-fold community 
              of professors, students and industry was thus bound together by 
              bonds of common interest.<br>
              <br>
              In 1930, the Ciba renewed the contact with his laboratory. This 
              association led in a few years to scientifically as well as industrially 
              important successes in the field of the male sex hormones. From 
              1937 the Rockefeller Foundation generously provided financial backing 
              for the research on natural compounds, especially the triterpenes 
              and steroids, free from any special conditions. With the two industries, 
              there was thus formed a strong group of constant supporters of his 
              research team which had grown much in the meantime.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Ruzicka holds eight honorary doctorates (4 Science, 2 
              Medicine, 1 Natural Sciences, 1 Law) 7 prizes and medals, 24 honorary 
              memberships of chemical, biochemical and other scientific societies, 
              18 honorary, ordinary and foreign memberships of scientific academies. 
              The circle of his friends is very wide, not only geographically 
              but also spiritually, including the Vatican City as well as Moscow. 
              He feels that the honours which he has won should be distributed 
              among the whole team of his co-workers, and that, to mention only 
              one example, the laudation of his 1936 honorary Doctor diploma of 
              Harvard (tercentenary celebration 
              of the oldest USA university) should more realistically be read 
              in the plural form "... to the team of chemists, daring in their 
              attacks, brilliant in their methods, successful in their interpretations 
              of the architecture of nature's baffling compounds", since every 
              member of the team helped to transform the youthful dreams of its 
              oldest member into reality.<br>
              <br>
              Ruzicka married Anna Hausmann in 1912, and Gertrud Acklin in 1951. 
              He has no children, and lives in Zurich. His hobbies are old Dutch 
              and Flemish paintings and alpine plants gardening.</p>
