  <p>Distinguished Academicians,<br>
  <br>
  My old friend and mentor P&iacute;o Baroja - who did not receive
  the Nobel Prize because the bright light of success does not
  always fall on the righteous - had a clock on his wall. Around
  the face of that clock there were words of enlightenment, a
  saying that made you tremble as the hands of the clock moved
  round. It said "Each hour wounds; the last hour kills". In my
  case, many chimes have been rung in my heart and soul by the
  hands of that clock - which never goes back - and today, with one
  foot in the long life behind me and the other in hope for the
  future, I come before you to say a few words about the spoken
  word and to reflect in a spirit of goodwill and hopefully to good
  avail on liberty and literature. I do not rightly know at what
  point one crosses the threshold into old age but to be on the
  safe side I take refuge in the words of Don Francisco de Quevedo
  who said: "We all wish to reach a ripe old age, but none of us
  are prepared to admit that we are already there".<br>
  <br>
  However one cannot ignore the obvious. I also know that time
  marches inexorably onwards. So I will say what I have to say here
  and now without resorting to either inspiration or improvisation,
  since I dislike both.<br>
  <br>
  Finding myself here today, addressing you from this dais which is
  so difficult to reach, I begin to wonder whether the glitter of
  words - my words in this case - has not dazzled you as to my real
  merit which I feel is a poor thing compared to the high honour
  you have conferred upon me. It is not difficult to write in
  Spanish; the Spanish language is a gift from the gods which we
  Spaniards take for granted. I take comfort therefore in the
  belief that you wished to pay tribute to a glorious language and
  not to the humble writer who uses it for everything it can
  express: the joy and the wisdom of Mankind, since literature is
  an art form of all and for all, although written without
  deference, heeding only the voiceless, anonymous murmur of a
  given place and time.<br>
  <br>
  I write from solitude and I speak from solitude. Mateo
  Alem&aacute;n in his <i>Cuzm&aacute;n de Alfarache</i> and Francis
  Bacon in his essay <i>Of Solitude</i>, - both writing more or
  less at the same period - said that the man who seeks solitude
  has much of the divine and much of the beast in him. However I
  did not seek solitude. I found it. And from my solitude I think,
  work, and live - and I believe that I write and speak with almost
  infinite composure and resignation. In my solitude I constantly
  keep in mind the principle expounded by Picasso, another old
  friend and mentor, that no lasting work of art can be achieved
  without great solitude. As I go through life giving the
  impression that I am belligerent, I can speak of solitude without
  embarrassment and even with a certain degree of thankful, if
  painful, acceptance.<br>
  <br>
  The greatest reward is to know that one can speak and emit
  articulate sounds and utter words that describe things, events
  and emotions.<br>
  <br>
  When defining man, philosophers have traditionally used the
  standard medium of close genus and specific difference that is to
  say reference to our animal status and the origin of differences.
  From Aristotle's <i>zoon politikon</i> to Descartes' <i>res
  cogitans</i> such reference has been an essential means of
  distinguishing man from beast. But however much moral
  philosophers may challenge what I'm going to say, I maintain that
  it would not be difficult to find abundant evidence identifying
  language as the definitive source of human nature which, for
  better or worse, sets us apart from all other animals.<br>
  <br>
  We are different from other animals, although since Darwin we
  know that we have evolved from them. The evolution of language is
  thus a fundamental fact which we cannot ignore.<br>
  <br>
  The phylogenesis of the human species covers a process of
  evolution in which the organs that produce and identify sounds
  and the brain which makes sense of those sounds develop over a
  long period of time which includes the birth of Mankind. No
  subsequent phenomena, neither <i>El Cantar de M&iacute;o Cid</i>
  nor <i>El Quijote</i>, nor quantum theory, can compare in
  importance to the first time that the most basic things were
  given a name. However for obvious reasons I am not going to dwell
  here on the evolution of language in its primeval and fundamental
  sense. Rather I will deal with its secondary and accidental but
  relatively more important meaning for those of us who were born
  into a society whose tradition is more literary than
  secular.<br>
  <br>
  Ethnologists such as the distinguished A. S. Diamond believe that
  the history of language, of all languages, follows a pattern in
  which at the very beginning sentences are simple and primitive
  but go on to become more complicated in terms of syntactic and
  semantic variations. By extrapolating from this historically
  verifiable trend, it can be deduced that this increasing
  complexity evolves from the initial stage where communication
  relies mainly on the verb, building up to the present situation
  where it is nouns, adjectives and adverbs that give flavour and
  depth to the sentence. If this theory is correct and if we apply
  a little imagination, we might conclude that the first word to be
  used was a verb in its most immediate and urgent tense, namely
  the imperative.<br>
  <br>
  And indeed the imperative still retains considerable importance
  in communication. It is a difficult tense to use. It must be
  handled with care since it requires a highly detailed knowledge
  of the rules of the game which are not always straightforward. A
  badly-placed imperative can bring about the exact opposite of the
  desired objective. John Langshaw Austin's famous triple
  distinction (locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary
  language) is an erudite demonstration of the thesis that
  perlocutionary language tends to provoke specific behaviour on
  the part of the interlocutor. It is useless to issue an order if
  the person to whom it is addressed dissembles and ends up doing
  whatever he likes.<br>
  <br>
  Thus from <i>zoon politikon</i> to <i>res cogitans</i> sufficient
  distinctions have been drawn between the beast that grazes and
  the man that sings albeit not always in well-measured
  tones.<br>
  <br>
  In Plato's <i>Dialogue</i> which bears his name, Cratylus hides
  Heraclitus among the folds of his tunic. The philosopher
  Democritus through his interlocutor Hermogenes speaks of the
  concepts of fullness and emptiness. The same can be said of
  Protagoras the anti-geometrician who irreverently maintained that
  "Man is the measure of all things": what they are and how they
  are, what they are not and how they are not.<br>
  <br>
  Cratylus was concerned with language - what it is and what it is
  not - and developed those ideas at some length in his discourse
  with Hermogenes. Cratylus believes that what things are called is
  naturally related to what they are. Things are born or created or
  are discovered or invented. From their very beginning they
  contain essentially the exact term which identifies them and
  distinguishes them from everything else. He seems to be trying to
  tell us that this distinction is unique and comes from the same
  ovum as the thing itself. Except in the reasoned world of the
  etymologist, a dog has always been a dog in all the ancient
  languages and love has been love since first it was felt. The
  boundaries of paradox in the thoughts of Cratylus in contrast to
  Heraclitus' hypotheses are hidden in the dovetailed
  indivisibility or unity of opposites, their harmony (day and
  night), the constant movement and reaffirmation of their
  substance. The same is true of words as things in their own right
  (there is no dog without the cat and no love without hate).<br>
  <br>
  Conversely Hermogenes thought that words were mere conventions
  established by humans for the reasonable purpose of understanding
  one another. Man is confronted with things or they are presented
  to him. Faced with something new, man gives it a name. The
  significance of things is not the spring in the woods but the
  well dug by man. The parabolic frontier of the senses, and of
  expression, as expounded by Hermogenes and concealed by
  Democritus and at times by Protagoras, comes up time and again:
  is man who measures and designates all things generic or
  individual? Is the measurement of those things a mere
  epistemological concept? Are things only physical matter or are
  they also feelings and concepts? By reducing being to illusion,
  Hermogenes kills off truth in the cradle; the contradictory
  conclusion that the only possible propositions are those which
  man formulates by himself and to himself, renders real what is
  true and what is not true. You will recall that according to
  Victor Henry's famous aporia man can give a name to things but he
  cannot take them over; he can change the language but he cannot
  change it any way he wishes. Referring in perhaps overcautious
  terms to the exactitude of names Plato seems to sympathise
  obliquely with Cratylus' position: things are called what they
  have to be called (an organic and valid theory that is on the
  verge of being acknowledged in pure reason as a principle) and
  not what man decides they should be called according to which way
  the wind is blowing at any given time (this being a changing or
  even fluctuating corollary, dependent on the changing
  suppositions present at the same time as, or prior to, a given
  thing).<br>
  <br>
  This attitude, originally romantic and consequently demagogical,
  was the starting point for the Latin poets, headed by Horace. It
  gave rise to all the ills which have afflicted us in this field
  since that time and which we have not been able to remedy. <i>Ars
  Poetica</i>, verses 70 to 72, sings of the prevalence of usage in
  the evolution of language (not always a welcome development):</p>

  <blockquote><p>
    Multa renascentur quae iam cecidere cadentque<br>
    quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,<br>
    quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This time-bomb, however pleasing in its
  charity, had several complex consequences leading finally to the
  supposition that language is made by the people - and inevitably
  by the people alone - and that it is futile to try and subject
  language to the precise and reasonable rules of logic. This
  dangerous assertion by Horace that usage determines what is right
  and acceptable in language created a rubbish-dump clogged with
  overgrown efforts in which the shortcut became the highway along
  which man progressed bearing the banner of language blowing
  freely and trembling in the breeze, obstinately continuing to
  confuse victory with the subservience inherent in its very
  image.<br>
  <br>
  While Horace was partly right (and we should not deny that), he
  was also wrong in a number of ways and we should not try to hide
  that either. But we should also acknowledge the contribution of
  Cratylus and Hermogenes by refining their principles. Cratylus'
  position falls within what is referred to as natural or ordinary
  or spoken language, which is the product of the constant use of a
  historical and psychological path, while Hermogenes' proposition
  fits into what we understand as artificial or specialized
  language or jargon, deriving from a more or less formal
  arrangement or from some formal method based on logic but with no
  historical or psychological tradition behind it - at least at the
  time it is conceived. The first Wittgenstein, the author of the
  <i>Tractatus</i>, is a celebrated modern exponent of Hermogenes'
  proposition. Thus in that sense it would not be illogical to talk
  of Cratylian or natural or human language and of Hermogenean or
  artificial or parahuman language. Like Horace my point of
  reference is obviously the former, the language of life and
  literature, without technical or defensive obstacles. Max Scheler
  - and indeed phenomenologists generally - is also referring to
  what I will now call Cratylian language when he talks about
  language as an indication or announcement or expression, as is
  Karl B&uuml;hler when he classifies the three functions of
  language as symptom, signal and symbol.<br>
  <br>
  It goes without saying that Hermogenean language naturally
  accommodates its original artificiality. On the other hand
  Cratylian language does not adapt to extraneous territory where
  there are often hidden pitfalls alien to its essential
  transparency.<br>
  <br>
  It is dangerous to admit that in the final analysis natural,
  Cratylian language is the offspring of a magical marriage between
  the people and chance. Because people do not create language they
  determine its development. We can say, albeit with considerable
  reservations, that people solve to a certain extent the puzzle of
  language by giving names to things; but they also adulterate and
  hybridize it. If people were not subject to those hidden pitfalls
  referred to earlier this issue would be much more urgent and
  linear. What is not put forward but which nevertheless lies
  hidden within the true heart of the matter is one and the same
  and already determined; and neither I nor anyone else can change
  that.<br>
  <br>
  The Cratylian language, the structure or system described by
  Ferdinand de Saussure as "langue", is the common language of a
  community (or rather more <i>in</i> than of <i>a</i> community),
  is formed and authenticated by writers and regulated and
  generally orientated by Academies. These three estates - the
  community, the writer and the Academies - do not always fulfil
  their respective duties. Very often they invade and interfere in
  other areas. It would appear that neither the Academies, nor the
  writers nor the community are happy with their own roles. While
  not competent to do so they prefer to define the role of others
  which, perhaps even rightly in principle, will always be unclear
  and ill-defined and, even worse, end up dissipating and obscuring
  the subject of their attention, namely the language and the verb
  which should be essentially transparent. The algebraic and mere
  instrument with no value other than its usefulness, in the final
  analysis as in Unamuno's Love and Pedagogy.<br>
  <br>
  The final determining factor, the State, which is neither the
  community nor the writers nor the Academies, conditions and
  constrains everything, intervenes in a~thousand different ways
  (administrative jargon, government pronouncements, television,
  etc.) compounding, more by bad example than by inhibition,
  disorder and disarray, chaos and confusion.<br>
  <br>
  But no-one says anything about popular, literary, academic, state
  and other excesses. Language evolves not in its own way which in
  principle would be appropriate, but is rather pushed around by
  the opposing forces surrounding it.<br>
  <br>
  The community to whom Horace's lines are recited eventually
  believe that this is how a language should evolve and tries to
  incorporate phrases, styles and expressions that are neither
  intuitive nor the product of their subconscious - which at least
  might produce something valid or plausible - but rather
  deliberately and consciously invented, or, even worse, imported
  (at the wrong time and against sound common sense).<br>
  <br>
  Writers, obviously with some exceptions, follow the often
  defective usage in their own environment and introduce and
  sanction expressions that are cumbersome and, worse still,
  divorced from the essential spirit of the language.<br>
  <br>
  The Academies' problems stem from the basis on which they
  operate: as institutions they tend to be conservative and afraid
  of being challenged.<br>
  <br>
  The erosion of the Cratylian language by Hermogenean influences
  is becoming more pronounced and there is a danger that it will
  desiccate that living language and render the natural language
  artificial. As I have already said, this threat is caused by
  invented, gratuitously incorporated or inopportunely resurrected
  or revitalised language.<br>
  <br>
  There seems to be some political reason behind the impetus that
  now leads, as it has in the past, gaily to abandon the principles
  of a language in the face of a blunt attack by those besieging
  it. In my view the risks outweigh the possible benefits - which
  are somewhat Utopian - that might accrue at some future
  unspecified date. While I am far from being a purist, I would
  like to call on writers in the first instance and then on
  Academies and on States to a lesser degree to put an end to the
  chaos. There is undoubtedly a continuity in language that
  supersedes any classifications we wish to establish but that does
  not constitute grounds for tearing down the natural frontiers of
  language. If we allow that we would be admitting to a defeat that
  has not yet taken place.<br>
  <br>
  Let us rally our genius in defence of language, all languages,
  and let us never forget that confusing procedure with the rule of
  Law, just as observing the letter rather than the spirit of the
  Law, always leads to injustice which is both the source and
  consequence of disorder.<br>
  <br>
  Thought is intrinsically linked to language. Moreover, freedom is
  also probably linked to certain linguistic and conceptual
  patterns. Together they provide the broad framework for all human
  endeavour; those that seek to explore and expand human frontiers,
  also those that seek to undermine the status of man. Thought and
  liberty are found in the minds of heroes and villains
  alike.<br>
  <br>
  But this generalisation obscures the need for greater precision
  if we are to arrive at an understanding of the real meaning of
  what it is to think and to be free. Insofar as we are able to
  identify the phenomena that take place in the mind, thinking for
  man means thinking about being free. There has been much argument
  regarding the extent to which this freedom or liberty is
  something concrete or whether it is just another slick phenomenon
  produced by the human mind. But such argument is probably futile.
  A wise Spanish philosopher has pointed out that the illusion and
  the real image of freedom are one and the same thing. If man is
  not free, if he is bound by chains that psychology, biology,
  sociology and history seek to identify, as a human being he also
  carries within himself the idea, which may be an illusion but
  which is absolutely universal, that he is free. And if we wish to
  be free we will organise our world in much the same way as we
  would if we were free.<br>
  <br>
  The architectural design on which we have tried to build
  successfully or otherwise the complex framework of our societies,
  contains the basic principle of human freedom and it is in the
  light of that principle that we value, exalt, denigrate,
  castigate and suffer: the aura of liberty is the spirit enshrined
  in our moral codes, political principles and legal systems.<br>
  <br>
  We know that we think. We think because we are free. The link
  between thought and freedom is like a fish biting its own tail or
  rather a fish that wants to get hold of its own tail; because
  being free is both a direct consequence of and an essential
  condition for thought. Through thought man can detach himself as
  much as he wants from the laws of nature; he can accept and
  submit to those laws, for example like the chemist who has gone
  beyond the boundaries of phlogiston theory will base his success
  and prestige on such acceptance and submission. In thought
  however, the realms of the absurd lie side by side with the
  empire of logic because man does not think only in terms of the
  real and the possible. The mind can shatter its own machinations
  into a thousand pieces and rearrange them into a totally
  different image.<br>
  <br>
  Thus one can have as many rational interpretations of the world
  based on empirical principles as the thinker wishes primarily on
  the basis of the promise of freedom. Free thinking in this narrow
  sense is that antithesis of the empirical world and finds
  expression in the fable. Thus the capacity to create fables would
  appear to be the third element in the human status - the others
  being thought and freedom - and this capacity can turn things
  round in such a way that things which before they became the
  subject of a fable were not even untruths become truths.<br>
  <br>
  Through the process of thought man begins to discover hidden
  truth in the world, he can aim to create his own different world
  in whatever terms he wishes through the medium of the fable. Thus
  truth, thought, freedom and fable are interlinked in a
  complicated and on occasion suspect relationship. It is like a
  dark passageway with several side-turnings going off in the wrong
  direction; a labyrinth with no way out. But the element of risk
  has always been the best justification for embarking on an
  adventure.<br>
  <br>
  The fable and scientific truth are not forms of thought. They are
  rather heterogeneous entities which cannot possibly be compared
  with one another since they are subject to completely different
  rules and techniques. Consequently, it is not appropriate to
  brandish the standard of literature in the struggle to free men's
  minds. Literature should rather be regarded as a counterweight to
  the newfound slavish submission to science. I would go further
  and say that I believe that a prudent and careful distinction
  must be drawn between those forms of science and literature which
  join together to confine man within rigid limits which deny all
  ideas of freedom, and that we must be daring and offset those
  forms by other scientific and literary experiences aimed at
  engendering hope. By unreservedly trusting in the superiority of
  human freedom and dignity, rather than suspect truths which
  dissolve in a sea of presumption, would be an indication that we
  have progressed. However in itself it is not enough. If we have
  learned anything it is that science is incapable of justifying
  aspirations to freedom and that on the contrary it rests on
  crutches that tilt it in exactly the opposite direction. Science
  should be based solely on the most profound exigencies of human
  freedom and will. That is the only means of enabling science to
  break away from utilitarianism which cannot withstand the
  pitfalls of quantity and measurement. This leads us to the need
  to recognise that literature and science although heterogeneous
  cannot remain isolated in a prophylactic endeavour to define
  areas of influence and this for two reasons, namely the status of
  language (that basic instrument of thought) as well as the need
  to define the limits of and distinguish between that which is
  commendable and laudable and that which must be denounced by all
  committed individuals.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that literature as an instrument for creating fables is
  founded on two basic pillars which provide it with strength to
  ensure that literary endeavour is worthwile. Firstly aesthetics,
  which impose a requirement on an essay, poem, drama or comedy to
  maintain certain minimum standards which distinguish it from the
  sub-literary world in which creativity cannot keep pace with the
  readers' emotions. From socialist reality to the innumerable
  inconstancies of would-be experimentalists, wherever aesthetic
  talent is lacking the resulting sub-literature becomes a
  monotonous litany of words incapable of creating a genuine
  worthwhile fable.<br>
  <br>
  The second pillar on which literary endeavour rests is ethics
  which complements aesthetics and which has a lot to do with all
  that has been said up to now regarding thought and freedom. Of
  course ethics and aesthetics are in no way synonymous nor do they
  have the same value. Literature can balance itself precariously
  on aesthetics alone - art for art's sake - and it could be that
  aesthetics in the long run may be a more comprehensive concept
  than ethical commitment. We can still appreciate Homer's verses
  and medieval epic canticles although we may have forgotten or at
  least no longer automatically link them with ethical behaviour in
  ancient Greek cities or in feudal Europe. However art for art's
  sake is by definition an extremely difficult undertaking and one
  which always runs the risk of being used for purposes which
  distort its real meaning.<br>
  <br>
  I do believe that ethical principle is the element which makes a
  work of literature worthy of playing the noble role of creating a
  fable. But I must explain clearly what I mean because the
  literary fable as a means of expressing the links between man's
  capacity to think and the perhaps Utopian idea of being free
  cannot be based on just any kind of ethical commitment. My
  understanding is that a work of literature can only be subject to
  the ethical commitment of the person, the author, to his own idea
  of freedom. Of course no-one, not even the cleverest and most
  balanced literary author, can ever (or rather cannot always)
  overcome his humanity; anyone can have a blind spot and freedom
  is a suffficiently ambiguous concept and many blinding errors can
  be committed in its name. Nor can an aesthetic sense be acquired
  from a textbook. Thus, the literary fable must be based on both a
  sense of ethics and a commitment to aesthetics. That is the only
  way it can acquire a significance that will transcend ephemeral
  fashions or confused appreciation that can quickly change. The
  history of man is changing and tortuous. Consequently, it is
  diffficult to anticipate ethical or aesthetic sensibilities.
  There are writers who are so tuned in to the feeling of their
  time that they become magnificent exponents of the prevailing
  collective trend and whose work is a conditional reflex. Others
  take on the thankless and not suffciently applauded task of
  carrying freedom and human creativity further along the road,
  even if in the end that too may lead nowhere.<br>
  <br>
  This is the only way in which literature can fulfil its role of
  closely identifying its commitment to the human status and, if we
  wish to be absolutely precise in this thesis, the only endeavour
  that can unreservedly be called true literature. However, human
  society cannot be linked to geniuses, saints and heroes
  alone.<br>
  <br>
  In this task of seeking out freedom, the fable has the benefit of
  the well-known characteristic of the intrinsic malleability of the
  literary story. The fable does not need to subject itself to
  anything that might restrict its scope, novelty and element of
  surprise. Thus, unlike any other form of thought it can wave the
  Utopian banner high. Perhaps that is why the most avid authors of
  treatises of political philosophy have opted to use the literary
  story to convey Utopian propositions that would not have found
  ready acceptance outside the realms of fiction at the time they
  were written. There are no limits to the Utopianism that the
  fable can express since by its very nature the fable itself is
  based on Utopianism.<br>
  <br>
  However, the advantages of literary expression are not confined
  to the ease with which it can convey Utopian propositions. The
  intrinsic plasticity of the story, the malleability of the
  situations, personalities and events it creates provide a superb
  foundry from which one can, without undue risk, set up an entire
  factory, or, to put it another way, a laboratory in which men
  conduct experiments on human behaviour in optimum conditions. But
  the fable does not restrict itself to expressing the Utopian. It
  can also analyse carefully what it means and what its
  consequences are in the myriad different alternative situations
  ranging from learned prediction to the absurd that creative
  thought can produce.<br>
  <br>
  The role of literature as an experimental laboratory has been
  often highlighted in science fiction; speculation about the
  future that has subsequently been realised. Critics have heaped
  praise on novelists who have a talent for predicting in their
  fables the basic coordinates which subsequently have been
  substantiated. But the real usefulness of the fable as a
  test-tube lies not in its anecdotal capacity for accurately
  predicting something technical but as a means of conveying in a
  timely, direct or negative fashion all possible facets of a world
  that may be possible now or in the future. It is the search for
  human commitment, for tragic experiences, that can shed light on
  the ambiguity of blindly choosing options in the face of the
  demands placed upon us by our world, now or in the future, that
  turns the fresco of literature into an experimental laboratory.
  The value of literature as a means of carrying out experiments on
  behaviour has little to do with prediction since human behaviour
  only has a past, present and future in a very specific, narrow
  sense. There are, however, basic aspects of our nature which have
  an impressive permanency about them and which cause us to be
  deeply moved by an emotional story from a completely different
  age to the one we live in. It is this "universal man" that is the
  most prized figure in literary fable, an experimental workshop in
  which there are no frontiers and no ages. It is the Quixotes, the
  Othellos, the Don Juans that illustrate to us that the fable is a
  game of chess played over and over again, a thousand times with
  whatever pieces destiny throws up at any given time.<br>
  <br>
  In absolute terms it might appear that this detracts from the
  so-called freedom I am advocating and indeed that would be the
  case if one did not take account of the role of that imperfect,
  voluble and confused personality, the author, the man. The magic
  of Shylock would never have emerged without the genius of Bard,
  whose unreliable memory was of course far more inconsistent than
  that of the characters to whom he gave life and to whom in the
  end he denied death. And what of those anonymous scholars and
  jugglers whom we remember only for the result produced by their
  talents. There is undoubtedly something that must be remembered
  over whatever sociology or history tries to impose upon us and
  that is that thus far and insofar we can conceive of the future
  of mankind, works of literature are very much subject to the
  needs of the author; that is to say to a single source of those
  ethical and aesthetic insights I referred to earlier, an author
  who acts as a filter for the current which undoubtedly emanates
  from the whole surrounding society. It is perhaps this link
  between Man and Society that best expresses the very paradox of
  being a human being proud of his individuality, and at the same
  time tied to the community that surrounds him and from which he
  cannot disengage himself without risking madness. There is a
  moral here; the limitations of literature are precisely those of
  human nature and they show us that there is another status,
  identical in other ways, which is that of gods and demons. Our
  mind can imagine demiurges and the ease with which human beings
  invent religions clearly demonstrates that this is so. Our
  capacity to create fables provides a useful literary means of
  illustrating those demiurges, as indeed we have done constantly
  since Homer wrote his verses. But even that cannot lead us to
  mistake our nature or put out once and for all the tenuous flame
  of freedom that burns in the innermost being of the slave who can
  be forced to obey but not to love, to suffer and die but not to
  change his most profound thoughts.<br>
  <br>
  When the proud, blind rationalist renewed in enlightened minds
  the biblical temptation, the last maxim of which promised "You
  will be as gods" he did not take account of the fact that Man had
  already gone much further down that road. The misery and the
  pride that for centuries had marked Man's efforts to be like the
  gods had already taught Man a better reason; that through effort
  and imagination they could become Men. For my part, I must say
  proudly that in this latter task, much of which still remains to
  be accomplished, the literary fable has always been, and in all
  circumstances proved to be, a decisive tool; a weapon that can
  cleave the way forward in the endless march to freedom.</p>
