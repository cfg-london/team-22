  <h1>Douglas D. Osheroff - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="osheroff.jpg" class="bio-img">Ethnically, I come from a mixed
  family. My father was the son of Jewish immigrants who left
  Russia shortly after the turn of the century, and my mother was
  the daughter of a Lutheran minister whose parents were from what
  is now Slovakia. Mostly, however, I grew up in a medical family.
  My father's father and all his children either became physicians
  or married them. My parents had met in New York where my father
  was a medical intern and my mother was a nurse. At the end of
  World War II, my parents settled in Aberdeen, a small logging
  town on the west coast of Washington State, where medical doctors
  were in short supply. Surrounded by natural beauty, it was a
  perfect place to raise a family, and I was the second of five
  children.<br>
  <br>
  To this day I grow pale at the sight of blood, and never for a
  moment considered a career in medicine. Despite this, my father,
  who was usually engrossed in his medical career, inspired in me
  passions for both photography and gardening, which were his
  hobbies when time permitted, as they are mine. Natural science
  interested me intensely from a very early age. When I was six I
  began tearing my toys apart to play with the electric motors.
  From then on, my free hours were occupied by a myriad of
  mechanical, chemical and electrical projects, culminating in the
  construction of a 100 keV X-ray machine during my senior year in
  high school.<br>
  <br>
  My projects often involved an element of danger, but my parents
  never seemed too concerned, nor did they inhibit me. Once a
  muzzle loading rifle I had built went off in the house, putting a
  hole through two walls. On another occasion a make-shift
  acetylene 'miners' lamp blew up on my chemistry bench in the
  basement, embedding shards of glass in the side of my face,
  narrowly missing my right eye. With blood running down my face, I
  came up the stairs cupping my hands to keep the blood off the
  carpet. My mother was by then at the top of the stairs. Knowing
  my propensity for practical jokes, she exclaimed loudly "If
  you're kidding I'll kill you! " As usual, my father lectured me
  about safety as he sewed the larger wounds closed, and there was
  always an unspoken understanding that that particular phase of my
  experimentation was over.<br>
  <br>
  In high school I was a good student, but only really excelled in
  physics and chemistry classes. While I liked physics much more
  than chemistry, the chemistry teacher, William Hock, had spent
  quite a bit of time telling us what physical research was all
  about (as opposed to my experimentation), and that effort made a
  deep impression on my young mind. My interest in experimentation
  helped me to develop excellent technical skills, but I did not
  feel motivated to do independent reading in those areas of
  physics or chemistry associated with my projects. I was
  intellectually rather lazy, and in high school I would always
  take one free class period so that I could get my homework out of
  the way, freeing the evenings for my many projects.<br>
  <br>
  My parents were generous, and the home for me was filled with
  scientific toys and gadgets. In addition, their children were
  allowed to attend any university to which they could get
  admitted. I chose Caltech
  over Stanford to avoid a
  continuing comparison of my academic record with that of my older
  brother, then a Stanford undergraduate.<br>
  <br>
  It was a good time to be at Caltech, as <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">Feynman</a> was teaching his famous
  undergraduate course. This two-year sequence was an extremely
  important part of my education. Although I cannot say that I
  understood it all, I think it contributed most to the development
  of my physical intuition. The Feynman problem sets were very
  challenging, but I had the good fortune to know Ernest Ma, who
  was an undergraduate one year ahead of me. Ernest would never
  tell me how to solve problems, but would give obscure hints when
  I got stuck, at least they seemed obscure to me at the
  time.<br>
  <br>
  It was a shock to suddenly have to work so hard in my studies. I
  had the most trouble in math, and only through considerable
  trauma did I gradually improve my performance from a grade of C+
  to A+ over a three-year period. Years later, when Caltech was
  offering me a faculty position, I confided that I did not have a
  very illustrious career as an undergraduate. To this remark the
  division chair replied "That's OK Doug, we are not hiring you to
  be an undergraduate."<br>
  <br>
                The pressure at Caltech was extreme, and I am not sure I would 
                have survived had I not joined a group of undergraduates working 
                with Gerry Neugebauer on his famous infra-red star survey during 
                my junior year. This experience made me recognize how satisfying 
                research could be, and how different it was from doing endless 
                problem sets. In my senior year, in order to get out of a third 
                term of senior physics lab, I also began working in David Goodstein's 
                low temperature lab (David was in Italy). Two professors, Don 
                McCullum from U.C. Riverside 
                and Walter Ogier from Pamona College, were spending their sabbatical 
                leaves there trying to reach a temperature of 0.5K by pumping 
                on a helium bath in which the superfluid film had been carefully 
                controlled. They filled my mind with the wonders of the low temperature 
                world, and I decided I would go into solid state physics.<br>
  <br>
  I chose to attend Cornell
  for graduate school largely because it was so far away from the
  Pasadena smog. In the end, it was a good choice, and a good time
  to be at Cornell. Soon after my arrival I met two people who were
  to become very important in my life. While still looking for
  housing, I met Phyllis Liu, a pretty young woman from Taiwan, who
  had also just arrived in Ithaca. We dated a bit, but then she
  found herself too busy with her studies for such diversions. We
  met again three years later, and were married in August, 1970,
  two weeks after she obtained her Ph.D. The other person was
  <a href="index.html">David Lee</a>, the head of the low
  temperature laboratory at Cornell and the professor under whom I
  was to work as a teaching assistant my first year. Dave seemed to
  think that I was bright, and encouraged me to join the low
  temperature group.<br>
  <br>
  Low temperature physics seemed even more exciting at Cornell than
  it had been at Caltech. New technologies and interesting physics
  made the field easy to choose, and I found myself thoroughly
  enjoying every minute of my work. In the spring of my fourth year
  Dave Lee asked me to talk to the Bell Labs recruiter, who came to
  campus in the fall and spring of each year. I was not ready to
  graduate, but we talked a bit, especially about making tiny
  electrical plugs to be used throughout the Bell Telephone system.
  It seemed interesting to me, although not really physics. In the
  fall, Dave suggested I start interviewing in earnest. I first
  talked with General Electric, who seemed to have no jobs
  whatsoever. I then talked to Bell Labs again, but this time to a
  new recruiter, Venky Narayanamurti, who had recently received his
  Ph.D. in physics at Cornell. Venky was enthusiastic about what I
  was doing, and felt that I might be able to get a postdoc doing
  Raman spectroscopy. I didn't confess that I knew nothing about
  the subject.<br>
  <br>
  We discovered our mysterious phase transitions in my Pomeranchuk
  cell in November 1971, and almost by magic, Venky called me up in
  early December with good news. The hiring freeze which had been
  in place for almost two years at Bell had been lifted. How soon
  could I be ready to come down for a job interview? I told Venky
  that we had stumbled on to something that was pretty exciting,
  and we fixed the date: January 6, 1972.<br>
  <br>
  At Bell Labs, a job interview began with a thesis defence, and it
  could at times turn nasty. I was lucky that no one questioned my
  association of the A and B features with the solid. In
  particular, Dick Werthamer was in the audience, and he had done
  early work on the p-wave BCS state soon to be associated with the
  B phase. I think my enthusiasm carried the day, and ultimately
  Bell Labs offered me not a postdoc position in Raman
  spectroscopy, but a permanent position which would allow me to
  continue my studies on <sup>3</sup>He.<br>
  <br>
  Phyllis and I moved to New Jersey in September, 1972; Phyllis to
  a postdoc position at Princeton University, and I to
  Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill. This was the golden era at Bell
  Labs. The importance of the transistor, invented in the research
  area there, made management extremely supportive of basic
  research. The only requirement was that work done should be 'good
  physics' in that it changed the way we thought about nature in
  some important way. I joined the Department of Solid State and
  Low Temperature Research under the direction of C. C. Grimes, and
  began purchasing the equipment I would need to continue what I by
  then knew were studies of superfluidity in <sup>3</sup>He. Some
  instrumentation was even purchased before I arrived in New
  Jersey. Yet I knew it would take at least a year to set up my
  laboratory, and I feared that most of the important pioneering
  work would be done before my own lab became operational.<br>
  <br>
  I was surprised to find that by the time my laboratory did become
  operational, few of the studies that interested me had been done.
  Indeed, there seemed to be some question as to whether or not
  these new phases were all p-wave BCS states. In addition,
  theorists <a href="../1977/index.html">Phil Anderson</a> and Bill
  Brinkman at Bell Labs had become interested in the theory of
  superfluid <sup>3</sup>He. This set the stage for what was to be
  an extremely productive period in my career. Over a five year
  period, beginning in 1973, we measured many of the important
  characteristics of the superfluid phases which helped identify
  the microscopic states involved. We found the superfluid phases
  to be almost unbelievably complex, and at the same time extremely
  well described by the BCS theory and extensions to that theory
  developed during that period.<br>
  <br>
  In about 1977 I began to feel pressure from Bell Laboratories
  management to go on to study other physical systems. I decided to
  study solid <sup>3</sup>He, my original thesis topic, and at the
  same time Gerry Dolan and I began a modest program to test some
  of the ideas that <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/thouless-facts.html">David Thouless</a> had discussed on electron
  localization in disordered one-dimensional systems. This latter
  study had to fit within the extremely slow time scale of the
  solid <sup>3</sup>He work. By late 1979, both of these efforts
  had succeeded beyond my wildest expectations. We discovered
  antiferromagnet resonance in nuclear spin ordered solid
  <sup>3</sup>He samples which we grew from the superfluid phase
  directly into the spin-ordered solid phase. At the same time, the
  low temperature group at the University of Florida also discovered
  these resonances, but because we cooled our samples by adiabatic
  nuclear demagnetization of copper rather than Pomeranchuk
  cooling, only we were able to form and study single crystals, and
  could thus identify the allowed magnetic domain orientations. In
  the end, Mike Cross, Daniel Fisher and I were able to determine
  the symmetry of the magnetic sub-lattice structure, and correctly
  guessed the precise ordered structure, later confirmed by
  polarized neutron scattering. The frequency shifts resulting from
  this antiferromagnetic resonance have made solid <sup>3</sup>He
  an extremely useful model magnetic system, and to understand them
  theoretically, we had borrowed some of the same formalism which
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2003/index.html">Leggett</a> used to
  understand the frequency shifts in superfluid
  <sup>3</sup>He.<br>
  <br>
  At almost the same time that Cross, Fisher and I made our
  breakthrough in our solid <sup>3</sup>He studies, Dolan and I
  discovered the log(T) temperature dependence to the electrical
  resistivity in disordered 2D conductors which Phil Anderson and
  his 'gang of four' had just predicted would exist, as a result of
  what they termed 'weak localization'. I did not continue the work
  on weak localization, as I only had one cryostat, and to do so
  would have meant that I could not continue my studies on nuclear
  spin ordering in solid <sup>3</sup>He, since the two sets of
  experiments would have vastly different time scales. Somewhat
  ironically, I got a second cryostat two years later.<br>
  <br>
  In 1987, after fifteen years, I left Bell Laboratories to accept
  a position at Stanford University. I had received informal offers
  of university positions periodically while at Bell Labs, but
  always found Bell to be the ideal place to do research. The
  combination of in-house support for basic science and first rate
  collaborators made Bell Labs unbeatable as an environment for
  doing research. However, my wife recognized in me a teacher
  waiting to be born. In addition, she was not happy with her job
  in New Jersey, and we agreed that she would apply for positions
  elsewhere. When she received offers from two biotech companies in
  California, Amgen and Genentech, I suggested that she accept the
  Genentech offer and that I would start talking to Stanford and
  U.C. Berkeley. Stanford,
  which has a small physics department, had just begun a search for
  a low temperature physicist. Ultimately, I received offers from
  both institutions, and chose Stanford because we liked the
  atmosphere better, and it was a better commute for Phyllis.<br>
  <br>
  At Stanford my students and I have continued work on superfluid
  and solid <sup>3</sup>He, studying how the B superfluid phase is
  nucleated from the higher temperature A phase and diverse
  properties of magnetically ordered solid <sup>3</sup>He in two
  and three dimensions. In addition, we have developed a program to
  study the low temperature properties of amorphous solids. Our
  work has shown that interactions between active defects in these
  systems create a hole in the density of states vs. local field,
  just as is seen in spin-glasses. In amorphous materials, it may
  be possible to measure the size of coupled clusters of such
  defects, something which has been difficult in
  spin-glasses.<br>
  <br>
  I have thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of university life, except
  for having to apply for research support. In particular, I have
  been fortunate to have had excellent graduate students, and to be
  able to teach bright undergraduates. Of course, with
  undergraduates one always has a few students who do not
  appreciate the professor's efforts. In 1988, after teaching my
  first large lecture course, one student wrote in his course
  evaluation: "Osheroff is a typical example of some lunkhead from
  industry who Stanford University hires for his expertise in some
  random field." Despite this minority opinion, in 1991 Stanford
  presented me their Gores Award for excellence in teaching. From
  1993-1996 I served as Physics Department chair, and stepped down
  in September 1996, hoping to spend more time with my graduate
  students. The day I learned I was to receive the Nobel Prize,
  after just two and a half hours sleep the night before, I taught
  my class on the physics of photography, although the lecture was
  not on photographic lenses, but the discovery of superfluidity in
  <sup>3</sup>He.</p>
