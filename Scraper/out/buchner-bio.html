  <h1>Eduard Buchner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="buchner.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Eduard
  Buchner</b> was born in Munich on May 20, 1860, the son of Dr.
  Ernst Buchner, Professor Extraordinary of Forensic Medicine and
  physician at the University, and Friederike <i>n&eacute;e</i>
  Martin.<br>
  <br>
  He was originally destined for a commercial career but, after the
  early death of his father in 1872, his older brother Hans, ten
  years his senior, made it possible for him to take a more general
  education. He matriculated at the Grammar School in his
  birth-place and after a short period of study at the Munich
  Polytechnic in the chemical laboratory of E. Erlenmeyer senior,
  he started work in a preserve and canning factory, with which he
  later moved to Mombach on Mainz.<br>
  <br>
  The problems of chemistry had greatly attracted him at the
  Polytechnic and in 1884 he turned afresh to new studies in pure
  science, mainly in chemistry with <a href=
  "../1905/index.html">Adolf von Baeyer</a> and in botany with
  Professor C. von Naegeli at the Botanic Institute, Munich.<br>
  <br>
  It was at the latter, where he studied under the special
  supervision of his brother Hans (who later became well-known as a
  bacteriologist), that his first publication, <i>Der Einfluss des
  Sauerstoffs auf G&auml;rungen</i> (The influence of oxygen on
  fermentations) saw the light in 1885. In the course of his
  research in organic chemistry he received special assistance and
  stimulation from T. Curtius and H. von Pechmann, who were
  assistants in the laboratory in those days.<br>
  <br>
  The Lamont Scholarship awarded by the Philosophical Faculty for
  three years made it possible for him to continue his
  studies.<br>
  <br>
  After one term in Erlangen in the laboratory of Otto Fischer,
  where meanwhile Curtius had been appointed director of the
  analytical department, he took his doctor's degree in the
  University of Munich in 1888. The following year saw
  his appointment as Assistant Lecturer in the organic laboratory
  of A. von Baeyer, and in 1891 Lecturer at the University.<br>
  <br>
  By means of a special monetary grant from <a href=
  "../1905/index.html">von Baeyer</a>, it was possible for Buchner
  to establish a small laboratory for the chemistry of fermentation
  and to give lectures and perform experiments on chemical
  fermentations. In 1893 the first experiments were made on the
  rupture of yeast cells; but because the Board of the Laboratory
  was of the opinion that "nothing will be achieved by this" - the
  grinding of the yeast cells had already been described during the
  past 40 years, which latter statement was confirmed by accurate
  study of the literature - the studies on the contents of yeast
  cells were set aside for three years.<br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1893 Buchner took over the supervision of the
  analytical department in T. Curtius' laboratory in the University of Kiel
  and established himself there, being granted the title of
  Professor in 1895.<br>
  <br>
  In 1896 he was called as Professor Extraordinary for Analytical
  and Pharmaceutical Chemistry in the chemical laboratory of H. von
  Pechmann at the University of T&uuml;bingen.<br>
  <br>
  During the autumn vacation in the same year his researches into
  the contents of the yeast cell were successfully recommenced in
  the Hygienic Institute in Munich, where his brother was on the
  Board of Directors. He was now able to work on a larger scale as
  the necessary facilities and funds were available.<br>
  <br>
  On January 9, 1897, it was possible to send his first paper,
  <i>&Uuml;ber alkoholische G&auml;rung ohne Hefezellen</i> (On
  alcoholic fermentation without yeast cells), to the editors of
  the <i>Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In October, 1898, he was appointed to the Chair of General
  Chemistry in the Agricultural College in Berlin and he also held
  lectureships on agricultural chemistry and agricultural chemical
  experiments as well as on the fermentation questions of the sugar
  industry. In order to obtain adequate assistance for scientific
  research, and to be able to fully train his assistants himself,
  he became habilitated at the University of Berlin in 1900.<br>
  <br>
  In 1909 he was transferred to the University of Breslau and from
  there, in 1911, to W&uuml;rzburg. The results of Buchner's discoveries
  on the alcoholic fermentation of sugar were set forth in the book
  <i>Die Zymaseg&auml;rung</i> (Zymosis), 1903, in collaboration
  with his brother Professor Hans Buchner and Martin Hahn. He was
  awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907 for his biochemical
  investigations and his discovery of non-cellular
  fermentation.<br>
  <br>
  Buchner married Lotte Stahl in 1900. When serving as a major in a
  field hospital at Folkschani in Roumania, he was wounded on
  August 3, 1917. Of these wounds received in action at the front,
  he died on the 13th of the same month.</p>
