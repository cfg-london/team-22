  <h1>Otto Loewi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="loewi.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Otto
  Loewi</b> was born on June 3, 1873, in Frankfurt-am-Main,
  Germany, the son of Jacob Loewi, a merchant, and Anna
  Willst&auml;tter.<br>
  <br>
  After having attended the humanistic Gymnasium (grammar school)
  in his native town, he entered in 1891 the Universities of Munich and Strassburg (at
  that time part of Germany) as a medical student. Apart from his
  attendance at the inspiring anatomy courses of Gustav Schwalbe,
  however, he seldom went to the medical lectures, being more
  inclined towards those held at the philosophical faculty. Only in
  the summer of 1893 did he seriously prepare for his
  &laquo;Physicum&raquo;, the first medical examination, which he
  just managed to pass. It was not until the autumn of 1894 that
  his indifference to medicine suddenly gave way to almost
  enthusiastic interest. In 1896 he took his doctor's degree at
  Strassburg University, his thesis dealing with a subject
  suggested by Professor Oswald Schmiedeberg, the famous
  &laquo;Father of Pharmacology&raquo;. Also responsible for his
  medical education were: Bernhard Naunyn, distinguished clinician
  and experimental pathologist, Oscar Minkowski, and Adolph
  Magnus-Levy.<br>
  <br>
  After his graduation he followed a course in inorganic analytical
  chemistry with Martin Freund, in Frankfurt, and afterwards spent
  a few months working in the biochemical institute of Franz
  Hofmeister in Strassburg. During 1897-1898 he was assistant to
  Carl von Noorden, clinician at the City Hospital in Frankfurt.
  Soon, however, after seeing the high mortality in countless cases
  of far-advanced tuberculosis and pneumonia, left without any
  treatment because of lack of therapy, he decided to drop his
  intention to become a clinician and instead to carry out research
  in basic medical science, in particular pharmacology. In 1898 he
  succeeded in becoming an assistant of Professor Hans Horst Meyer,
  the renowned pharmacologist at the University of
  Marburg-an-der-Lahn, from 1904 Professor of Pharmacology in
  Vienna. In 1905 Loewi became Associate Professor at Meyer's
  laboratory, and in 1909 he was appointed to the Chair of
  Pharmacology in Graz.<br>
  <br>
  During his first years in Marburg, Loewi's studies were in the
  field of metabolism. As a result of his work on the action of
  phlorhizin, a glucoside provoking glycosuria, and another one on
  nuclein metabolism in man, he was appointed
  &laquo;Privatdozent&raquo; (Lecturer) in 1900. Two years later he
  published his paper &laquo;&Uuml;ber Eiweiss-synthese im
  Tierk&ouml;rper&raquo; (On protein synthesis in the animal body),
  proving that animals are able to rebuild their proteins from
  their degradation products, the amino acids - an essential
  discovery with regard to nutrition.<br>
  <br>
  That same year he also published the first part of a series of
  papers about experimental contributions to the physiology and
  pharmacology of kidney function.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 Loewi also spent some months in Starling's laboratory, in
  London, where he also worked with W. M. Bayliss, Starling's
  brother-in-law. And it was in this laboratory that he first met
  his lifelong friend Henry Dale, who was later to share the Nobel
  Prize with him.<br>
  <br>
  After his return to Marburg in 1902 Loewi continued to study the
  function of the kidney and the mechanism of the action of
  diuretics. On his arrival in Vienna in 1905 he again took up the
  problems connected with carbohydrate metabolism. He proved
  thereby that preference for fructose rather than glucose is not
  only characteristic of pancreatectomized dogs, as earlier
  demonstrated by Minkowski, but also of dogs deprived of their
  glycogen by other means, e.g. by phosphorus poisoning. He also
  proved that the heart in contrast to the liver, cannot utilize
  fructose. And finally that epinephrine injections into rabbits
  completely depleted of their liver glycogen by starvation brought
  the glycogen back to almost normal values in spite of continued
  starvation. His other investigations in Vienna, done jointly with
  Alfred Fr&ouml;hlich, dealt with the vegetative nervous system
  (stimulated by the discovery made by Gaskell and Langley of the
  existence of two divisions of this nervous system, and also as a
  result of his coming into contact with T.R. Elliott in Cambridge, where the
  latter was conducting his final experiments on the action of
  epinephrine). His classic paper in this field was published in
  1905, the best-known result of these studies being the
  observation that small doses of cocaine potentiate the responses
  of sympathetically innervated organs to epinephrine and
  sympathetic nerve stimulation.<br>
  <br>
  It was as Professor in Graz that Loewi cultivated his gifts as a
  lecturer. A number of his associates during this period came from
  the U.S.A. Loewi continued his studies of carbohydrate
  metabolism, investigating among other things the conditions
  responsible for epinephrine hyperglycaemia.<br>
  <br>
  In 1921 Loewi discovered the chemical transmission of nerve
  impulses the research of which was greatly developed by him and
  his co-workers in the years following, culminating ultimately in
  his demonstration that the parasympathetic substance
  (&laquo;Vagusstoff&raquo;) is acetylcholine and that a substance
  closely related to adrenaline played a corresponding role at the
  sympathetic nerve endings. It was for these researches that he
  received the Nobel Prize in 1936, jointly with Sir Henry Dale.
  This and other discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics,
  and pharmacology have since then led to a complete renewal of the
  concepts of the sympathetic nervous system.<br>
  <br>
  When the Germans invaded Austria in 1938, Loewi was forced to
  leave his homeland. (But only after he had been compelled to
  instruct the Swedish bank in Stockholm to transfer the Nobel
  Prize money to a prescribed Nazi-controlled bank.)<br>
  <br>
  After spending some time as Visiting Professor at the Universit&eacute; Libre
  in Brussels, and at the Nuffield Institute, Oxford, Loewi accepted an
  invitation to join the College of Medicine, New York University, as
  Research Professor of Pharmacology, and to work in George
  Wallace's Laboratory. He arrived in the United States in 1940. In
  America Loewi came into close contact with many outstanding
  biologists from all over the world and here he found much
  inspiration for his work.<br>
  <br>
  Loewi held honorary degrees from New York University, Yale University, and
  from the Universities of Graz and Frankfurt.
  He was recipient of the Physiology Prize of the Royal Academy of
  Sciences of Bologna, of the Lieben Prize of the Academy of
  Vienna, and of the Cameron Prize of the University of
  Edinburgh (1944). He was an Honorary Member of the Physiological Society
  (London), of the Harvey Society (New York), and of the
  Societ&agrave; Italiana di Biologia Sperimentale; he was also
  Corresponding Member of the Society of Physicians in Vienna, of
  the Viennese Biological Society, and of the Society for the
  Advancement of Natural Sciences in Marburg-an-der-Lahn; and was
  Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, in
  Halle. In 1954 he was appointed Foreign Member of the Royal
  Society.<br>
  <br>
  Since his schooldays, Loewi showed keen interest in the
  humanities. He always enjoyed music, architecture, and painting,
  and in his younger years seldom missed an opportunity to visit
  museums and exhibitions.<br>
  <br>
  In 1908 he married Guida Goldschmiedt, daughter of Dr. Guido
  Goldschmiedt, then Professor of Chemistry in Prague, and later in
  Vienna. They had three sons, Hans, Victor, Guido; and one
  daughter, Anna. Professor Loewi became an American citizen in
  1946. He died December 25, 1961.</p>
