  <p><br>Your Majesties, Members of the Norwegian
  Nobel Committee, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I
  accept this prize. I am grateful to my wife Rosalynn, to my
  colleagues at The Carter Center, and to many others who continue
  to seek an end to violence and suffering throughout the world.
  The scope and character of our Center's activities are perhaps
  unique, but in many other ways they are typical of the work being
  done by many hundreds of nongovernmental organizations that
  strive for human rights and peace.</p>

  <p>Most Nobel Laureates have carried out our
  work in safety, but there are others who have acted with great
  personal courage. None has provided more vivid reminders of the
  dangers of peacemaking than two of my friends, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/index.html">Anwar Sadat</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Yitzak Rabin</a>, who gave their lives
  for the cause of peace in the Middle East.</p>

  <p>Like these two heroes, my first chosen
  career was in the military, as a submarine officer. My shipmates
  and I realized that we had to be ready to fight if combat was
  forced upon us, and we were prepared to give our lives to defend
  our nation and its principles. At the same time, we always prayed
  fervently that our readiness would ensure that there would be no
  war.</p>

  <p>Later, as President and as
  Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces, I was one of those who
  bore the sobering responsibility of maintaining global stability
  during the height of the Cold War, as the world's two superpowers
  confronted each other. Both sides understood that an unresolved
  political altercation or a serious misjudgment could lead to a
  nuclear holocaust. In Washington and in Moscow, we knew that we
  would have less than a half hour to respond after we learned that
  intercontinental missiles had been launched against us. There had
  to be a constant and delicate balancing of our great military
  strength with aggressive diplomacy, always seeking to build
  friendships with other nations, large and small, that shared a
  common cause.</p>

  <p>In those days, the nuclear and conventional
  armaments of the United States and the Soviet Union were almost
  equal, but democracy ultimately prevailed because of commitments
  to freedom and human rights, not only by people in my country and
  those of our allies, but in the former Soviet empire as well. As
  president, I extended my public support and encouragement to
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/index.html">Andrei Sakharov</a>, who,
  although denied the right to attend the ceremony, was honored
  here for his personal commitments to these same ideals.</p>

  <p>The world has changed greatly since I left
  the White House. Now there is only one superpower, with
  unprecedented military and economic strength. The coming budget
  for American armaments will be greater than those of the next
  fifteen nations combined, and there are troops from the United
  States in many countries throughout the world. Our gross national
  economy exceeds that of the three countries that follow us, and
  our nation's voice most often prevails as decisions are made
  concerning trade, humanitarian assistance, and the allocation of
  global wealth. This dominant status is unlikely to change in our
  lifetimes.</p>

  <p>Great American power and responsibility are
  not unprecedented, and have been used with restraint and great
  benefit in the past. We have not assumed that super strength
  guarantees super wisdom, and we have consistently reached out to
  the international community to ensure that our own power and
  influence are tempered by the best common judgment.</p>

  <p>Within our country, ultimate decisions are
  made through democratic means, which tend to moderate radical or
  ill-advised proposals. Constrained and inspired by historic
  constitutional principles, our nation has endeavored for more
  than two hundred years to follow the now almost universal ideals
  of freedom, human rights, and justice for all.</p>

  <p>Our president, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson,</a> was honored here for
  promoting the League of Nations, whose two basic concepts were
  profoundly important: "collective security" and
  "self-determination." Now they are embedded in international law.
  Violations of these premises during the last half-century have
  been tragic failures, as was vividly demonstrated when the Soviet
  Union attempted to conquer Afghanistan and when Iraq invaded
  Kuwait.</p>

  <p>After the second world war, American
  Secretary of State <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1945/index.html">Cordell Hull</a> received this
  prize for his role in founding the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United Nations</a>. His
  successor, General George C. Marshall, was recognized because of
  his efforts to help rebuild Europe, without excluding the
  vanquished nations of Italy and Germany. This was a historic
  example of respecting human rights as the international
  level.</p>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen:<br>
  <br>
  Twelve years ago, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1990/index.html">President
  Mikhail Gorbachev</a> received your recognition for his
  preeminent role in ending the Cold War that had lasted fifty
  years.</p>

  <p>But instead of entering a millennium of
  peace, the world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place.
  The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched
  by equal understanding and mutual respect. There is a plethora of
  civil wars, unrestrained by rules of the Geneva Convention,
  within which an overwhelming portion of the casualties are
  unarmed civilians who have no ability to defend themselves. And
  recent appalling acts of terrorism have reminded us that no
  nations, even superpowers, are invulnerable.</p>

  <p>It is clear that global challenges must be
  met with an emphasis on peace, in harmony with others, with
  strong alliances and international consensus. Imperfect as it may
  be, there is no doubt that this can best be done through the
  United Nations, which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1950/index.html">Ralph Bunche</a> described
  here in this same forum as exhibiting a "fortunate flexibility" -
  not merely to preserve peace but also to make change, even
  radical change, without violence.</p>

  <p>He went on to say: "To suggest that war can
  prevent war is a base play on words and a despicable form of
  warmongering. The objective of any who sincerely believe in peace
  clearly must be to exhaust every honorable recourse in the effort
  to save the peace. The world has had ample evidence that war
  begets only conditions that beget further war."</p>

  <p>We must remember that today there are at
  least eight nuclear powers on earth, and three of them are
  threatening to their neighbors in areas of great international
  tension. For powerful countries to adopt a principle of
  preventive war may well set an example that can have catastrophic
  consequences.</p>

  <p>If we accept the premise that the United
  Nations is the best avenue for the maintenance of peace, then the
  carefully considered decisions of the United Nations Security
  Council must be enforced. All too often, the alternative has
  proven to be uncontrollable violence and expanding spheres of
  hostility.</p>

  <p>For more than half a century, following the
  founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the Middle East conflict
  has been a source of worldwide tension. At Camp David in 1978 and
  in Oslo in 1993, Israelis, Egyptians, and Palestinians have
  endorsed the only reasonable prescription for peace: United
  Nations Resolution 242. It condemns the acquisition of territory
  by force, calls for withdrawal of Israel from the occupied
  territories, and provides for Israelis to live securely and in
  harmony with their neighbors. There is no other mandate whose
  implementation could more profoundly improve international
  relationships.</p>

  <p>Perhaps of more immediate concern is the
  necessity for Iraq to comply fully with the unanimous decision of
  the Security Council that it eliminate all weapons of mass
  destruction and permit unimpeded access by inspectors to confirm
  that this commitment has been honored. The world insists that
  this be done.</p>

  <p>I thought often during my years in the
  White House of an admonition that we received in our small school
  in Plains, Georgia, from a beloved teacher, Miss Julia Coleman.
  She often said: "We must adjust to changing times and still hold
  to unchanging principles."</p>

  <p>When I was a young boy, this same teacher
  also introduced me to Leo Tolstoy's novel, "War and Peace." She
  interpreted that powerful narrative as a reminder that the simple
  human attributes of goodness and truth can overcome great power.
  She also taught us that an individual is not swept along on a
  tide of inevitability but can influence even the greatest human
  events.</p>

  <p>These premises have been proven by the
  lives of many heroes, some of whose names were little known
  outside their own regions until they became Nobel laureates:
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1960/index.html">Albert John
  Lutuli</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/index.html">Norman
  Borlaug</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1984/index.html">Desmond
  Tutu</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1986/index.html">Elie
  Wiesel</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/index.html">Aung San
  Suu Kyi</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1997/index.html">Jody
  Williams</a> and even <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/index.html">Albert Schweitzer</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/index.html">Mother Teresa</a>. All
  of these and others have proven that even without government
  power - and often in opposition to it - individuals can enhance
  human rights and wage peace, actively and effectively.</p>

  <p>The Nobel prize also profoundly magnified
  the inspiring global influence of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/index.html">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>,
  the greatest leader that my native state has ever produced. On a
  personal note, it is unlikely that my political career beyond
  Georgia would have been possible without the changes brought
  about by the civil rights movement in the American south and
  throughout our nation.</p>

  <p>On the steps of our memorial to Abraham
  Lincoln, Dr. King said: "I have a dream that on the red hills of
  Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former
  slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of
  brotherhood."</p>

  <p>The scourge of racism has not been
  vanquished, either in the red hills of our state or around the
  world. And yet we see ever more frequent manifestations of his
  dream of racial healing. In a symbolic but very genuine way, at
  least involving two Georgians, it is coming true in Oslo
  today.</p>

  <p>I am not here as a public official, but as
  a citizen of a troubled world who finds hope in a growing
  consensus that the generally accepted goals of society are peace,
  freedom, human rights, environmental quality, the alleviation of
  suffering, and the rule of law.</p>

  <p>During the past decades, the international
  community, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, has
  struggled to negotiate global standards that can help us achieve
  these essential goals. They include: the abolition of land mines
  and chemical weapons; an end to the testing, proliferation, and
  further deployment of nuclear warheads; constraints on global
  warming; prohibition of the death penalty, at least for children;
  and an international criminal court to deter and to punish war
  crimes and genocide. Those agreements already adopted must be
  fully implemented, and others should be pursued aggressively.</p>

  <p>We must also strive to correct the
  injustice of economic sanctions that seek to penalize abusive
  leaders but all too often inflict punishment on those who are
  already suffering from the abuse.</p>

  <p>The unchanging principles of life predate
  modern times. I worship Jesus Christ, whom we Christians consider
  to be the Prince of Peace. As a Jew, he taught us to cross
  religious boundaries, in service and in love. He repeatedly
  reached out and embraced Roman conquerors, other Gentiles, and
  even the more despised Samaritans.</p>

  <p>Despite theological differences, all great
  religions share common commitments that define our ideal secular
  relationships. I am convinced that Christians, Muslims,
  Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and others can embrace each other in a
  common effort to alleviate human suffering and to espouse
  peace.</p>

  <p>But the present era is a challenging and
  disturbing time for those whose lives are shaped by religious
  faith based on kindness toward each other. We have been reminded
  that cruel and inhuman acts can be derived from distorted
  theological beliefs, as suicide bombers take the lives of
  innocent human beings, draped falsely in the cloak of God's will.
  With horrible brutality, neighbors have massacred neighbors in
  Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>

  <p>In order for us human beings to commit
  ourselves personally to the inhumanity of war, we find it
  necessary first to dehumanize our opponents, which is in itself a
  violation of the beliefs of all religions. Once we characterize
  our adversaries as beyond the scope of God's mercy and grace,
  their lives lose all value. We deny personal responsibility when
  we plant landmines and, days or years later, a stranger to us -
  often a child &#8211; is crippled or killed. From a great
  distance, we launch bombs or missiles with almost total impunity,
  and never want to know the number or identity of the victims.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of this new millennium I
  was asked to discuss, here in Oslo, the greatest challenge that
  the world faces. Among all the possible choices, I decided that
  the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm
  between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the
  ten wealthiest countries are now seventy-five times richer than
  those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is
  increasing every year, not only between nations but also within
  them. The results of this disparity are root causes of most of
  the world's unresolved problems, including starvation,
  illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict, and
  unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to
  HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <p>Most work of The Carter Center is in remote
  villages in the poorest nations of Africa, and there I have
  witnessed the capacity of destitute people to persevere under
  heartbreaking conditions. I have come to admire their judgment
  and wisdom, their courage and faith, and their awesome
  accomplishments when given a chance to use their innate
  abilities.</p>

  <p>But tragically, in the industrialized world
  there is a terrible absence of understanding or concern about
  those who are enduring lives of despair and hopelessness. We have
  not yet made the commitment to share with others an appreciable
  part of our excessive wealth. This is a potentially rewarding
  burden that we should all be willing to assume.</p>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen:<br>
  <br>
  War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how
  necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn
  how to live together in peace by killing each other's
  children.</p>

  <p>The bond of our common humanity is stronger
  than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices. God gives us
  the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We
  can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes
  - and we must.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
