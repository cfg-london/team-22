  <h1>Baruj Benacerraf - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="benacerraf.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was
  born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 29, 1920 of Spanish-Jewish
  ancestry. My father, a self-made business man, was a textile
  merchant and importer. He was born in Spanish Morocco, whereas my
  mother was born and raised in French Algeria and brought up in
  the French culture. When I was five years old, my family moved to
  Paris where we resided until 1939. My primary and secondary
  education was in French which had a lasting influence on my life.
  The second World War caused our return to Venezuela, where my
  father continued to have a thriving business. It was decided that
  I should pursue my education in the United States, and we moved
  to New York in 1940. I registered at Columbia
  University in the School of General Studies, and graduated
  with a Bachelor of Science Degree in 1942, having also completed
  the pre-medical requisites for admission to Medical School. By
  that time, I had elected to study biology and medicine, instead
  of going into the family business, as my father would have
  wanted. I did not realize, however, that admission to Medical
  School was a formidable undertaking for someone with my ethnic
  and foreign background in the United States of 1942. In spite of
  an excellent academic record at Columbia, I was refused admission
  by the numerous medical schools I applied to and would have found
  it impossible to study medicine except for the kindness and
  support of George W. Bakeman, father of a close friend, who was
  then Assistant to the President of the Medical
  College of Virginia in Richmond. Learning of my difficulties,
  Mr. Bakeman arranged for me to be interviewed and considered for
  one of the two remaining places in the Freshman class. I was
  accepted and began my medical studies in July 1942. While in
  medical school, I was drafted into the U.S. Army with the other
  medical students, as part of the wartime training program, and
  naturalized American citizen in 1943. I greatly enjoyed my
  medical studies, which at the Medical College of Virginia were
  very clinically oriented. I received what I considered to be an
  excellent medical education in the relatively short time of three
  war years. This busy time was rendered very happy by my marriage
  in 1943 to Annette Dreyfus, a French student, also a refugee from
  Paris, whom I had met at Columbia University. I trained as an
  intern at Queens General Hospital in New York City in 1945 and
  was commissioned First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Medical Corps
  in 1946. After the usual six weeks of basic training at Fort Sam
  Houston, Texas, I was shipped to Germany with several thousand
  other physicians. I was happy to be assigned to France, first in
  Paris, then in Nancy, where my wife had joined me. I stayed there
  nearly two years, as the head of a medical unit where I enjoyed
  practising what today would be called community medicine. I was
  discharged in 1947 and, motivated by intellectual curiosity,
  decided upon a career in medical research at a time when such a
  choice was not fashionable. My interest was directed, from my
  medical student days, to Immunology, and particularly to the
  mechanism of hypersensitivity. I had suffered from bronchial
  asthma as a child and had developed a deep curiosity in allergic
  phenomena. I sought the advice of many scientists, among whom
  Ren&eacute; Dubos at Rockefeller University, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/index.html" target="_blank">John
  Enders</a> at Harvard Medical School, and Jules Feund at the
  Public Health Research Institute in New York, to whom I had been
  recommended by members of the faculty in Richmond. I was strongly
  urged to work with a dynamic young immunochemist, Elvin Kabat,
  whose laboratories were at the Neurological Institute, Columbia
  University School of Physicians and Surgeons. Following an
  interview with Elvin Kabat, who offered me a Fellowship in his
  laboratory, I started my research career in February, 1948.
  Training with Elvin Kabat was one of the significant experiences
  in my development as a scientist. Elvin Kabat is a hard
  task-master with rigorous standards and an absolute respect for
  the quantitative approach to science. He felt that if a
  phenomenon could not be quantitated, it did not deserve to be
  studied. He taught me Immunochemistry and basic Immunology, but
  more importantly, I learned the significance of experimental
  proof, the need for intellectual honesty and scientific
  integrity. I was fortunate also that my first two years as a
  scientist were very productive and my initial goal of
  understanding experimental hypersensitivity mechanisms was in
  part fulfilled. My life for the next six years was very much
  influenced by family considerations. A daughter, Beryl, was born
  in 1949, and my parents had returned from Venezuela to their home
  in Paris. My father had suffered a severe stroke and was now a
  cripple. My wife's family also lived in Paris. The attraction of
  moving to France and settling close to our respective families
  was very strong. Accordingly, we moved to Paris in mid-1949 and I
  accepted a position in Bernard Halpern's laboratory at the
  Broussais Hospital. This position permitted me also to make
  frequent trips to Venezuela where my father's business interests
  now required my personal involvement. During this period I was
  privileged to form a close relationship with a young Italian
  scientist who had also joined Halpern's laboratory, Guido Biozzi.
  For six years we operated as a team and engaged in the study of
  reticuloendothelial function in relation to immunity. We
  developed the techniques to study the clearance of particulate
  matter from the blood by the RES, and formulated the equations
  that govern this process in mammalian organisms. After six years
  in Paris, I began to realize that as a foreigner to France, in
  spite of my French education, I would experience continuous
  difficulties in pursuing a scientific career and establishing an
  independent laboratory. This was made painfully clear to me by
  the chief of the laboratory, Dr. Halpern. The significance of
  this message was heightened by my unhappy discovery that I could
  not find another laboratory in Paris in 1956 that would give me a
  chance to work and establish myself. I decided therefore to
  return to the United States. I am deeply grateful to Lewis Thomas
  who offered me an appointment as Assistant Professor of Pathology
  at New York
  University School of Medicine and helped me develop my own
  laboratory and research support. I returned to my earlier studies
  on hypersensitivity mechanisms, but this time also developed an
  interest in cellular as well as humoral hypersensitivity. From
  1956 to 1961, I worked on cellular hypersensitivity with Philip
  Gell, immune complex diseases with Robert McCluskey and Pierre
  Vassalli, anaphylactic hypersensitivity with Zoltan Ovary, tumor
  specific immunity with Lloyd Old, and the structure of
  antibodies, in relation with their specificity, with <a href=
  "../1972/index.html">Gerald Edelman</a>. The years at New York
  University were very happy ones, and it was soon apparent that I
  had made the correct choice in returning to the United States.
  The scientific atmosphere at New York University during that
  period was particularly favorable to the development of
  Immunology. Numerous immunologists worked enthusiastically and
  interacted profitably: among these were Jonathan Uhr, Jeanette
  Thorbecke, Edward Franklin, Victor Nussenzweig, in addition to
  Robert McCluskey and Zoltan Ovary mentioned earlier. This is the
  time when I started to teach research fellows and students and
  realized that the training of young scientists was one of my most
  valuable and rewarding experiences. Later I chose "The Training
  of Scientists" as the topic of my presidential address to The
  American Association of Immunologists. Among the young
  immunologists with whom I had the pleasure and privilege to work
  at New York University are Lloyd Old, William Paul, Ira Green,
  Victor Nussenzweig, Michael Lamm, Pierre Vassalli, Stanley Cohen, Jeanette Thorbecke, Fred
  Kantor, Gregory Siskind, Stuart Schlossman, Kurt Bloch, Bernard
  Levine, Francois Kourilsky, Ted Brunner, and Takeshi Yoshida.
  During this period also I managed a New York bank, the Colonial
  Trust Company, which had been bought by my family and associates
  from Venezuela. However, the success of my laboratory made me
  realize that I had to choose between a scientific career and my
  business interests. I made the decision to devote myself solely
  to my laboratory and my students and to curtail my business
  career, as I felt the challenges were far greater in my chosen
  profession. This is precisely the time when I initiated the
  studies in Immunogenetics that resulted in my being awarded the
  Nobel Prize in Medicine. I made the observation that random bred
  animals immunized with antigens with restricted heterogeneity,
  such as hapten conjugates of poly L-lysine distribute themselves
  into two groups, responders and nonresponders. I sensed that this
  was an important phenomenon. I determined that responsiveness to
  these or other similar antigens is controlled by dominant
  autosomal genes termed immune response (Ir) genes. This was the
  beginning of a long and complex story that led to our
  understanding of the manner in which these genes, located in the
  major histocompatibility complex of mammals, exercise their
  function and determine immune responsiveness. By then I had
  become Professor of Pathology at New York University. The
  opportunity, however, arose at the request of John Seal to assume
  the Directorship of the Laboratory of Immunology of the National
  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, where I
  moved in 1968 together with William Paul and Ira Green. Such a
  laboratory offered very attractive facilities and precious inbred
  guinea pig strains essential to my work in immunogenetics. Much
  of the insight on the mechanism of Ir gene function has indeed
  been obtained in that laboratory, from experiments of William
  Paul, Ira Green, Alan Rosenthal, Ethan Shevach, and Ronald
  Schwartz, with the systems I developed.<br>
  <br>
  In 1970, Dean Robert Ebert offered me the Chair of Pathology at
  Harvard Medical School. I moved to Harvard because I missed the
  University environment and more particularly the stimulating
  interaction with the eager, enthusiastic, and unprejudiced young
  minds of the students and fellows. At Robert Ebert's request, we
  initiated an interdepartmental immunology graduate program at
  Harvard Medical School which has developed very successfully
  under the stewardship of my colleague, Emile Unanue. At Harvard,
  I have continued my work on immune response genes and their role
  in the regulation of specific immunity with David Katz, Martin
  Dorf, Judith Kapp, Carl Pierce, Ronald Germain and Mark Greene.
  We also determined the role of immune response genes in the
  control of immune suppression phenomena with the help of Patrice
  Debr&eacute;, Judith Kapp, and Carl Waltenbaugh; we analyzed the
  specificity of cytolytic T lymphocyte in relation to Ir gene
  function with Steven Burakoff and Robert Finberg and demonstrated
  how alloreactivity arises as a consequence of the commitment of T
  lymphocytes to recognize antigen in the context of autologous MHC
  gene products.<br>

  While reaching these scientific goals, I was elected President of
  the American Association of Immunologists in 1973, President of
  the American Society for Experimental Biology and medicine in
  1974, President of the International Union of Immunological
  Societies in 1980. I was elected to the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences in 1972, the National Academy of Science, U.S.A. in 1973, and
  I was appointed President of the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute in
  1980.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a><br>

      My work has been generously and continuously supported since 1957
      by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and
      for the last decade also by the National Cancer Institute. I am very grateful
      for their enlightened support to me and my associates, which made
      our work possible. I am also particularly indebted to my many
      students and associates who have contributed so much to our
      common goal and whom I hold responsible in the largest measure
      for my achievements.</p>
