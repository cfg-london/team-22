  <h2>On the Laws of Thermal Radiation</h2>

  <p>The kind recognition which my work on
  thermal radiation has received in the views of your ancient and
  famous Academy of Sciences gives me particular pleasure to speak
  to you about this subject which is again attracting the attention
  of all physicists because of the difficulty of the problems
  involved. As soon as we step beyond the established boundaries of
  pure thermodynamic theory, we enter a trackless region
  confronting us with obstacles which even the most astute of us
  are almost at a loss to tackle.</p>

  <p>If, as is the custom, I speak mainly about
  my own researches, I must say that I was fortunate in finding
  that not everything had yet been gleaned in the field of general
  thermodynamic radiation theory. Using known physical laws it was
  possible to derive a general law of radiation theory which has,
  under the name of the displacement law, been acclaimed by fellow
  workers. In applying thermodynamics to the theory of radiation,
  we make use of the ideal processes which have been found so
  fruitful elsewhere. These are mental experiments whose
  realization is frequently impracticable and which nevertheless
  lead to reliable results. Such deliberations can only be
  undertaken if all the processes on which, governed by laws, the
  mental experiments are based, are known, so that the effect of
  any change can be stated accurately and completely. Further, to
  be allowed to idealize, we must neglect all non-essential
  secondary phenomena, while considering only everything
  indissolubly connected with the processes under examination. In
  the application of mechanical heat theory, this method has proved
  to be extremely fruitful. Helmholtz used it in the theory of
  concentration flows, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/index.html">Van 't Hoff</a> used it in
  applying thermodynamics to the theory of solutions. It is
  necessary, in these deliberations, to presuppose the existence of
  a so-called semi-permeable membrane which permits the solvent to
  pass, but not the substance dissolved. Although it is impossible
  to prepare membranes which strictly satisfy this requirement, we
  can assume them as possible in the ideal processes, because the
  laws of Nature set no limit to approximation to semipermeability.
  The conclusions drawn from these assumptions have in any case
  always been in agreement with experience. In radiation theory,
  analogous deliberations can be made if we assume perfectly
  reflecting bodies as possible in the ideal processes. Kirchhoff
  used them for proving his famous theorem of the constancy of the
  ratio of emission and absorption power. This theorem has become
  one of the most general of radiation theory and expresses the
  existence of a certain temperature equilibrium for radiation.
  According to it, there must exist, in a cavity surrounded by
  bodies of equal temperature, a radiation energy that is
  independent of the nature of the bodies. If in the walls
  surrounding this cavity a small aperture is made through which
  radiation issues, we obtain a radiation which is independent of
  the nature of the emitting body, and is wholly determined by the
  temperature. The same radiation would also be emitted by a body
  which does not reflect any rays and which is therefore designated
  as completely black, and this radiation is called the radiation
  of a black body or black-body radiation.</p>

  <p>The Kirchhoff theorem is not limited to
  radiation caused by thermal processes. It seems to be valid for
  most, if not all luminous processes. That the temperature concept
  can be applied to all luminous processes is beyond doubt. Since
  we can produce all types of light by means of hot bodies, we can
  ascribe, to the radiation in thermal equilibrium with hot bodies,
  the temperature of these bodies, and thus every radiation, even
  that issuing from a phosphorescent body, has a certain
  temperature for every colour. This temperature has however no
  connection whatever with that of the body, nor is it possible as
  yet to state how e.g. a phosphorescent body comes into
  equilibrium with radiation. These conditions are bound to be very
  complicated, in particular in the case of bodies which convert
  the absorbed radiation and emit it after a long interval of
  time.</p>

  <p>Again using ideal processes and assuming
  radiation pressure, which at that time had been deduced from the
  electromagnetic theory of light, Boltzmann derived from
  thermodynamics the law, previously empirically formulated by
  Stefan, that the radiation of a black body is proportional to the
  fourth power of the absolute temperature.</p>

  <p>This did not exhaust the conclusions to be
  drawn from thermodynamics. There remained the determination of
  the changes undergone by the colours present in radiation with
  changes of temperature. Computation of this change is again based
  on an ideal process. For this, we must assume wholly reflecting
  bodies as possible that scatter all incident radiation and which
  can therefore be described as completely white. If we allow the
  radiation coming from a black body to enter a space of this kind,
  it will in the end propagate exactly as if the walls of the space
  were themselves radiant and had the same temperature as the black
  body. If we then seal off the black body from the white space, we
  obtain the unrealisable case of a radiation permanently
  reciprocated between mirroring walls. In our thoughts, we
  continue the experiment. We imagine the volume of our space to be
  reduced by movement of the walls, so that the entire radiation is
  concentrated in a smaller space. Since radiation exercises a
  certain pressure, the pressure of light, on the walls it strikes,
  it follows that some work must have been expended in size
  reduction, as if we had compressed a gas. Because of the low
  magnitude of the pressure of light, this work is very small, but
  it can be computed accurately, which is all that matters in the
  case under discussion. In accordance with the principle of the
  conservation of energy, this work cannot be lost, it is converted
  into radiation, which further increases the radiation
  concentration. This change of radiation density due to the
  movement of the white walls is not the only change to which the
  radiation is subjected. When a light ray is reflected by a moving
  mirror, it undergoes a change of the colour dictated by the
  oscillation frequency. This change in accordance with the
  so-called Doppler principle plays a substantial part in
  astrophysics. The spectrum line emitted by an approaching
  celestial body appears to be displaced in the direction of
  shorter wavelengths in the ratio, its velocity: the velocity of
  light. This is also the case when a ray is reflected by a moving
  mirror, except that the change is twice as great. We are
  therefore able to calculate completely the change undergone by
  the radiation as a result of the movement of the walls. The
  pressure of light which is essential to these deliberations was
  demonstrated at a much later date, Lebedev being the first to do
  so. Arrhenius used it to explain the formation of comet tails.
  Before that, it was only a conclusion drawn from Maxwell's
  electromagnetic theory. We now calculate both the change of
  radiation density due to movement, and the change of the various
  wavelengths. From this mental experiment, we can draw an
  important conclusion. We can conclude from the second law of
  mechanical heat theory that the spectral composition of the
  radiation which we have changed by compression in the space with
  mirror walls is exactly the same as it would be had we obtained
  the increased density of radiation by raising the temperature,
  because we would otherwise be able to produce, by means of colour
  filters, unequal radiation densities in the two spaces, and to
  generate work from heat without compensation. Since we can
  calculate the change of individual wavelengths due to
  compression, we can also derive the manner in which the spectral
  composition of black-body radiation varies with temperature.
  Without discussing this calculation in detail, let me give you
  the result: the radiation energy of a certain wavelength varies
  with changing temperature so that the product of temperature and
  wavelength remains constant.</p>

  <p>Using this displacement law it is easy to
  calculate the distribution of the intensity of thermal radiation
  over the various wavelengths for any temperature, as soon as it
  is known for one temperature.</p>

  <p>The shift of the maximum of intensity in
  particular is directly accessible to observation. Since the
  wavelength at which the maximum intensity lies also defines the
  principal area of the wavelength which is most intense at this
  temperature, we can, by changing the temperature, shift the
  principal area of radiation in the direction of short or long
  wavelengths of any desired magnitude. Of the other derivations of
  the displacement law, I shall only mention that by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">H.A. Lorentz</a>. If, in the
  electromagnetic equations of Maxwell, we imagine all spatial
  dimensions as being displaced in time in the same ratio, these
  equations show that the electromagnetic energy must decrease in
  proportion to the fourth power of displacement. Since, according
  to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, energy increases with the fourth
  power of absolute temperature, the linear dimensions must vary
  inversely proportionately to the absolute temperature. Each
  characteristic length must vary in this ratio, from which the
  displacement law follows.</p>

  <p>From the displacement law, we can calculate
  the temperature of the sun if we are entitled to assume that the
  radiation of the sun must be ascribed to heat, and if we know the
  position of the maximum of the energy of solar radiation.
  Different figures are given for this position by different
  observers, i.e. 0.532 <font face="Symbol">m</font> according to
  Very, and 0.433 <font face="Symbol">m</font> according to Abbot
  and Fowle. Depending on the figure used, the temperature of the
  sun works out at 5,530&deg; and 6,790&deg;. However much the
  observers may differ, there can be no doubt that the maximum of
  solar radiation is situated in the visible range of wavelengths.
  This is to say that the temperature of the sun is the most
  favourable utilization of the radiant energy of a black body for
  our illumination and that, in our artificial light sources which
  utilize thermal radiation we must aim at achieving this
  temperature, from which we are admittedly far removed as yet.</p>

  <p>I wish to discuss yet another application
  of the displacement law, i.e. the possibility of calculating the
  wavelength of X-rays. As we know, X-rays are produced by the
  impact of electrons on solid bodies, and their wavelength must be
  a function of the velocity of the electrons. According to the
  kinetic theory of gases, the mean kinetic energy of a molecule is
  a measure of absolute temperature. If, as is done in the theory
  of electrons, we assume that this is also valid for the kinetic
  energy of the electrons, the electric energy of the cathode rays
  would be a measure of their temperature. If we substitute the
  temperature thus calculated in the displacement law, we find that
  the wavelength of the maximum of the intensity indicates a
  wavelength range of X-rays which agrees well with the wavelengths
  found by other arguments. It might be objected that we must not
  ascribe a temperature to the electrons. The permissibility of our
  procedure can however be justified by an inversion of the above
  argument. Radiation in an enclosed space must necessarily release
  electrons whose velocity according to Einstein's law is
  proportional to the oscillation frequency. The energy maximum of
  radiation generates electrons whose velocity is so great that
  their kinetic energy comes very close to the temperature
  associated with the maximum of energy.</p>

  <p>The displacement law exhausts the
  conclusions that can be drawn from pure thermodynamics with
  respect to radiation theory. All these conclusions have been
  confirmed by experience. The individual colours present in the
  radiation are mutually wholly independent. The manner in which at
  a given temperature the intensity of radiation is distributed
  over the individual wavelengths cannot be determined from
  thermodynamics. For this, one must examine the mechanism of the
  radiation process in detail. Similar conditions obtain in the
  theory of gases. Thermodynamics can tell us nothing about the
  magnitude of the specific heat of the gases; what is required, is
  to examine molecular motion. But the kinetic theory of gases
  which is based on probability calculations has made much greater
  progress than the corresponding theory of radiation. The
  statistical theory of gases has set itself the task of accounting
  also for the laws of thermodynamics. I do not wish to discuss
  here the extent to which the task may be considered as having
  been solved, and whether we are entitled to consider the
  reduction of the second law to probability as a wholly
  satisfactory theory. It has in any case been very successful, in
  particular since a theoretical explanation has been found of the
  deviations from the thermodynamic state of equilibrium, the
  so-called fluctuations, e.g. in Brownian movement. None of the
  statistical theories of radiation has however as yet even
  attempted to derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the displacement
  law, which must always be introduced into theory from outside.
  Quite apart from this, we are as yet far removed from a
  satisfactory theory to account for the distribution of radiation
  energy over the individual wavelengths.</p>

  <p>I myself made the first attempt in this
  direction. I endeavoured to bypass the problem of applying
  probability calculation to radiation theory by imagining
  radiation as resulting from gas molecules moving according to
  laws of probability. Instead of these we could also imagine
  electrons generating radiation on striking molecules. What is
  essential is the further assumption that such a particle will
  only emit radiation of a certain wavelength dictated by velocity,
  and that the velocity distribution of the particles obeys
  Maxwell's law. With the assistance of the radiation laws derived
  from thermodynamics we obtain a radiation law which shows good
  agreement with experience for a wide range of wavelengths, i.e.
  for the range in which the product of temperature and wavelength
  is not unduly large.</p>

  <p>Imperfect as this first attempt was, a
  formula had been obtained which considerably deviates from
  reality for large wavelengths only. Since observations however
  establish these deviations beyond doubt, it was clear that the
  formula had to be modified.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Lord Rayleigh</a> was the
  first to approach the problem from an entirely different angle.
  He made the attempt to apply to the radiation problem a very
  general theorem of statistical mechanics, i.e. the theorem of the
  uniform distribution of energy over the degrees of freedom of the
  system in the state of statistical equilibrium. The meaning of
  this theorem is as follows:</p>

  <p>In the state of thermal equilibrium, all
  movements of the molecules are so completely irregular that there
  exists no movement which would be preferred over any other. The
  position of the moving parts can be established by geometrical
  parameters which are mutually independent and in the direction of
  which the movement falls. These are called the degrees of freedom
  of the system. As regards the kinetic energy of movement, no
  degree of freedom is preferred over another, so that each
  contains the same amount of the total energy.</p>

  <p>Radiation present in an empty space can be
  represented so that a given number of degrees of freedom is
  allocated to it. If the waves are reflected back and forth by the
  walls, systems of standing waves are established which adapt
  themselves to the distances between two walls. This is most
  easily understood if we consider a vibrating string which can
  execute an arbitrary number of individual vibrations, but whose
  half wavelengths must be equal to the length of the string
  divided by an integer.</p>

  <p>The individual standing waves possible
  represent the determinants of the processes and correspond to the
  degrees of freedom. If we allocate to each degree of freedom its
  proper amount of energy, we obtain the Rayleigh radiation law,
  according to which the emission of radiation of a given
  wavelength is directly proportional to the absolute temperature,
  and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.
  The law agrees with observation at exactly the point where the
  law discussed above failed, and it was at first considered to be
  a radiation law of limited validity. But if the process of
  radiation obeys the general laws of electromagnetic theory or of
  the theory of electrons, we must necessarily arrive at Rayleigh's
  radiation law, as Lorentz has shown. Viewed as a general
  radiation law, it directly contradicts all experience, because,
  according to it, energy would have to accumulate increasingly at
  the shortest wavelengths. The possibility that we are not dealing
  in reality with a true state of equilibrium of radiation, but
  that it very gradually approaches the state where all energy is
  only present in the shortest wavelengths, is also contradicted by
  experience. In the case of the visible rays, to which the
  Rayleigh formula no longer applies at attainable temperatures, we
  can easily calculate, according to the Kirchhoff law, that the
  state of equilibrium must be attained in the shortest time, which
  state however remains far removed from the Rayleigh law. We thus
  obtain an inkling of the extraordinary difficulties which
  confront exact definition of the radiation formula. The knowledge
  that current general electromagnetic theory is insufficient, that
  the theory of electrons is inadequate, to account for one of the
  most common of phenomena, i.e. the emission of light, remains
  purely negative as yet. We only know how the thing cannot be
  done, but we lack the signposts that would enable us to find our
  way. We do however know that none of the models whose mode of
  action is based on purely electromagnetic principles can lead to
  correct results.</p>

  <p>It is the merit of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck</a> to have
  introduced new hypotheses which enable us to avoid Rayleigh's
  radiation law. For long waves, this law is undoubtedly correct,
  and the right radiation formula must have a form such that, for
  very long waves, it passes into Rayleigh's law, and for short
  waves into the law formulated by me. Planck therefore retains as
  starting point the distribution of energy over the degrees of
  freedom of the system, but he subjects this distribution of
  energy to a restriction by introducing the famous hypothesis of
  elements of energy, according to which energy is not infinitely
  divisible, but can only be distributed in rather large quantities
  which cannot be divided further. This hypothesis would probably
  have been accepted without difficulty, if unchangeable particles,
  e.g. atoms of energy had been involved. It is an assumption that
  has proved inevitable for matter and electricity. The energy
  elements of Planck are however no atoms of energy; on the
  contrary, the displacement law requires that they are inversely
  proportional to the wavelength of a given vibration. This
  represents great difficulty for the understanding of these energy
  elements. Once we accept the hypothesis, we arrive at an entirely
  different distribution of energy over the radiating centres, if
  we search for them according to the laws of probability. This
  does not however give us the radiation law. All we know is how
  much energy the radiating molecules possess on average at a
  certain temperature, but not how much energy they emit. To derive
  emission at a given energy, we need a definite model which emits
  radiation. We can only construct such a model on the foundation
  of the known electromagnetic laws, and it is at this early point
  that the difficulty of the theory starts. On the one hand we
  relinquish the electromagnetic laws by introducing the energy
  elements; on the other hand we make use of these same laws for
  discovering the relationship between emission and energy. It
  could admittedly be argued that the electromagnetic laws are only
  valid for mean values taken over extended periods, whereas the
  energy elements relate to the elementary radiation process
  itself. An oscillator radiating in accordance with the
  electromagnetic laws will indeed have little similarity with the
  real atoms. Planck however rightly argues that this does not
  matter precisely because radiation in the equilibrium state is
  independent of the nature of the emitting bodies. It will however
  be required of a model which is to stand for the real atoms that
  it should lack none of the essential characteristics of the event
  under consideration. Every body that emits thermal rays has the
  characteristic that it is able to convert thermal rays of one
  wavelength into thermal rays of a different wavelength. It is on
  this that there rests the possibility of a specific spectral
  composition being established in the radiation at all times. The
  Planck oscillator lacks this ability, and doubts are bound to be
  raised as to whether it can properly be used for establishing the
  relationship between energy and emission. This difficulty can be
  avoided, and the oscillator can be done without, if, with Debye,
  we decompose the radiation energy in a hollow cube into Planck
  energy elements and distribute these energy elements over the
  oscillation frequencies of the standing waves formed in the cube
  according to the laws of probability. The logarithm of this
  probability will then be proportional to entropy, and the law of
  radiation results, if we search for the maximum of this entropy.
  This result is proof of the extremely general nature of Planck's
  concepts.</p>

  <p>There are however further difficulties. The
  energy elements increase with decreasing wavelength, and an
  oscillator exposed to incident radiation will, at low intensity,
  need a very long time before it absorbs a full energy element.
  What happens if the incident radiation ceases, before an entire
  energy element has been absorbed? The difficulties implicit in
  answering this question have recently induced Planck to
  reformulate his original theory. He now assumes of emission only
  that it can occur exclusively by whole energy elements.
  Absorption is assumed to occur continuously according to the
  electromagnetic laws, and the energy content of an oscillator is
  assumed to have energy values capable of continuous change. The
  difficulty of the long absorption time is indeed avoided in this
  manner. On the other hand the close relationship between emission
  and absorption for the elementary process is relinquished, and
  this relationship now becomes valid statistically only. Every
  atom which only emits whole energy elements and absorbs
  continuously would therefore in the event of emission suddenly
  expend energy from its own reserve and would supplement this but
  little in the event of short irradiation. The special hypothesis
  must be made that, taken as a whole for many atoms in the
  stationary state, the absorbed energy after all becomes equal to
  that emitted. Whereas in the original form of the Planck theory
  the introduction of the hypothesis of energy elements was
  sufficient to permit the radiation laws to be derived, the new
  theories include uncertainties which can only be removed by
  further hypotheses. On the other hand the new fundamental
  hypothesis provides the possibility of further application, e.g.
  to electron emission.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the few observations I
  am able to offer in this context how great are the difficulties
  that remain in radiation theory. But the reference to these
  difficulties which it is the duty of the scientific approach to
  emphasize must not prevent us from paying tribute to the great
  positive achievements which the Planck theory has already
  accomplished.</p>

  <p>It has produced a law of radiation which
  accommodates all observed data and includes the Rayleigh formula
  and my own formula as limiting cases. In addition, it has thrown
  unexpected light on an entirely different subject, i.e. the
  theory of specific heats.</p>

  <p>It has long been known that the specific
  heats do not strictly obey the Dulong-Petit law and that they
  decrease at low temperatures. Diamonds do not obey the
  Dulong-Petit law even at normal temperatures. This law can be
  derived from the theorem of the distribution of kinetic energy
  over the degrees of freedom and states that, in solid bodies,
  every atom possesses, in accordance with its three degrees of
  freedom, three times the amount of energy, and, because of the
  potential energy, altogether six times the amount of energy of a
  degree of freedom. If however we apply Planck's distribution of
  energy by energy elements, we obtain, according to Einstein, a
  formula for the specific heat which does in fact show the drop of
  temperature. This result is characteristic of the Planck theory.
  This theory of specific heats is not derived from the radiation
  formula, but from the formula for the mean energy of an
  oscillator which is based directly on the hypothesis of the
  energy elements. Unfortunately, difficulties are beginning to
  appear. The exact measurements of specific heats at low
  temperatures made in Nernst's laboratory have shown that the
  Einstein formula does not agree with observation. The formula
  which satisfies the experimental data contains half energy
  elements in addition to the whole energy elements, which cannot
  be interpreted satisfactorily as yet. There can however be no
  doubt that the Planck radiation theory provides the first step to
  the theory of specific heats.</p>

  <p>That the theory should remain in many
  respects incomplete and provisional, is in the nature of the
  problem which is perhaps the most difficult which has ever
  confronted theoretical physics. What is involved is to leave
  behind the laws of theoretical physics confirmed by direct
  observation, which alone have been applied in the past, and to
  enter areas which are beyond the reach of direct observation.</p>

  <p>The difficulties which beset radiation
  theory also emerge in an entirely different approach. Einstein
  investigated the fluctuations to which radiation is continuously
  subjected even in the state of equilibrium as a result of the
  irregularities of the thermal processes. If we imagine a small
  plate in a cavity filled with radiation, this plate will be
  subjected to a radiation pressure which is the same on average on
  both sides of the plate. Since the radiation must contain
  irregularities, the pressure will alternately be greater on one
  or the other side so that the plate will execute small irregular
  movements, similar to the Brownian movement of a dust particle
  suspended in a liquid. These fluctuations can be derived from
  probability calculations. According to the Boltzmann theorem
  there is a simple relationship between entropy and probability.
  The entropy of radiation is known from the radiation law, so that
  the probability of state is also known, from which the
  fluctuations can be calculated. The mathematical expression for
  these fluctuations consists, in a peculiar manner, of two
  members. The first is readily understandable: it is due to
  irregularities which arise as a result of the mutual interference
  of the many independent beams which meet in one point. Where the
  density of radiation energy is high, this term alone
  predominates; it corresponds to the radiation range that obeys
  Rayleigh's law.</p>

  <p>The other term, which cannot be directly
  explained by the undulation theory, predominates at low density
  of radiation energy, where the radiation obeys the law formulated
  by me. It would be understandable if the radiation consisted of
  the Planck energy elements which would be localized even in an
  empty space. We cannot however pursue this line of thought. We
  cannot shake the undulation theory of light, which is one of the
  most firmly established constructions in the whole of physics.
  Moreover, the term to be explained by localized energy elements,
  is not present by itself, and it is <i>a priori</i> impossible to
  introduce a dualistic approach into optics, e.g. to assume
  simultaneously Huyghens' wave theory and Newton's emanation
  theory. All we can do is to relinquish the Boltzmann method of
  applying probability calculations to this type of fluctuations,
  or to assume that a new irregularity is introduced into radiation
  with the process of reflection.</p>

  <p>In view of the magnitude of the
  difficulties it is natural that opinions about the path to be
  pursued should differ greatly. Some are of the opinion that the
  fundamental principles of electrodynamics must be changed. And
  yet, previous theory embraces a vast range of facts, it accounts
  for events even in the most rapid movements of the <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-rays, it has proved itself in the most precise
  optical measurements. In my view, all the signs suggest that the
  deviations from current theory are due to events within the atom.
  None of the processes in which the interior of the atom
  participates are amenable to current theory.</p>

  <p>Sommerfeld made an attempt in this
  direction: He would ascribe to the constant <i>h</i> of the
  radiation law, which together with the oscillation frequency
  dictates the magnitude of the energy element, a simple
  significance for the interior of the atom. It is alleged to
  determine the period in which an electron entering the atom comes
  to a stop, as a function of its velocity. On this view, the
  constant <i>h</i> expresses a universal characteristic of the
  atoms. This theory permits calculation of the wavelength of
  X-rays, and it connects two previously independent attempts made
  by me to carry out this calculation. One method is based on the
  Planck theory of energy elements in that it assumes that the
  energy of the so-called secondary electrons released by Xrays is
  dictated by the energy element. The second method is based on the
  theory of electrons by means of which it calculates the energy
  radiated in the X-rays by sudden braking of an electron. From the
  determination of the energy of the cathode rays and the X-rays we
  can then calculate the brake path of the electrons and
  consequently the wavelength of the X-rays. The Sommerfeld theory
  connects these two theories. It has the great advantage of
  explaining the generation of X-rays with the aid of
  electromagnetic theory. A number of conclusions can then be drawn
  from this which are in complete agreement with observation, e.g.
  the polarisation of X-rays, the diversity of emission and of
  hardness in various directions.</p>

  <p>The Sommerfeld theory has the great
  advantage that it attempts to invest the universal constant
  <i>h</i> of the Planck radiation theory with physical
  significance. It has the disadvantage that it has been applied so
  far only to electron emission and absorption, but cannot yet
  solve the problem of thermal radiation.</p>

  <p>We must admit that the result of radiation
  theory todate is not a very good one for theoretical physics. As
  we have seen, only the general thermodynami theories have proved
  satisfactory as yet. The theory of electrons has come to grief
  over the radiation problem, the Planck theory has not yet been
  brought into a definite form. Research is faced with exceptional
  difficulties and we cannot discern when and how they can be
  overcome. In science, the redeeming idea often comes from an
  entirely different direction, investigations in an entirely
  different field often throw unexpected light on the dark aspects
  of unresolved problems. We must base our hope in the future in
  the expectation that the present era which has proved so fruitful
  for physics may not pass without a complete solution being found
  for the problem of thermal radiation. Far-reaching and new
  thoughts will have to set to work, but the result will be great,
  because we shall obtain a profound insight into the world of the
  atom and the elementary processes within it.</p>
