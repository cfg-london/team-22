  <h1>Yitzhak Rabin - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesty the King,<br>
  Your Royal Highness,<br>
  Esteemed Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,<br>
  Honorable Prime Minister, Madame Gro Harlem Brundtland,<br>
  Ministers,<br>
  Members of the Parliament and Ambassadors,<br>
  Fellow Laureates,<br>
  Distinguished Guests,<br>
  Friends,<br>
  Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  At an age when most youngsters are struggling to unravel the
  secrets of mathematics and the mysteries of the Bible; at an age
  when first love blooms; at the tender age of sixteen, I was
  handed a rifle so that I could defend myself - and also,
  unfortunately, so that I could kill in an hour of danger.</p>

  <p>That was not my dream. I wanted to be a
  water engineer. I studied in an agricultural school and I thought
  that being a water engineer was an important profession in the
  parched Middle East. I still think so today. However, I was
  compelled to resort to the gun.</p>

  <p>I served in the military for decades. Under
  my command, young men and women who wanted to live, wanted to
  love, went to their deaths instead. Under my command, they killed
  the enemy's men who had been sent out to kill us.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>In my current position, I have ample
  opportunity to fly over the State of Israel, and lately over
  other parts of the Middle East, as well. The view from the plane
  is breathtaking: deep-blue lakes, dark-green fields, dun-colored
  deserts, stone-gray mountains, and the entire countryside
  peppered with whitewashed, red-roofed houses.</p>

  <p>And cemeteries. Graves as far as the eye
  can see.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of cemeteries in our part of the
  Middle East - in our home in Israel - but also in Egypt, in
  Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. From the plane's window, from
  thousands of feet above them, the countless tombstones are
  silent. But the sound of their outcry has carried from the Middle
  East throughout the world for decades.</p>

  <p>Standing here today, I wish to salute loved
  ones - and foes. I wish to salute all the fallen of all the
  countries in all the wars; the members of their families who bear
  the enduring burden of bereavement; the disabled whose scars will
  never heal. Tonight I wish to pay tribute to each and every one
  of them, for this important prize is theirs, and theirs
  alone.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>I was a young man who has now grown fully
  in years. And of all the memories I have stored up in my
  seventy-two years, what I shall remember most, to my last day,
  are the silences.</p>

  <p>The heavy silence of the moment after, and
  the terrifying silence of the moment before.</p>

  <p>As a military man, as a commander, I issued
  orders for dozens, probably hundreds of military operations. And
  together with the joy of victory and grief of bereavement, I
  shall always remember the moment just after making the decision
  to mount an action: the hush as senior officers or cabinet
  ministers slowly rise from their seats; the sight of their
  receding backs; the sound of the closing door; and then the
  silence in which I remain alone.</p>

  <p>That is the moment you grasp that as a
  result of the decision just made, people will be going to their
  deaths. People from my nation, people from other nations. And
  they still don't know it.</p>

  <p>At that hour, they are still laughing and
  weeping; still weaving plans and dreaming about love; still
  musing about planting a garden or building a house - and they
  have no idea these are their last hours on earth. Which of them
  is fated to die? Whose picture will appear in a black border in
  tomorrow's newspaper? Whose mother will soon be in mourning?
  Whose world will crumble under the weight of the loss?</p>

  <p>As a former military man, I will also
  forever remember the silence of the moment before: the hush when
  the hands of the clock seem to be spinning forward, when time is
  running out and in another hour, another minute, the inferno will
  erupt.</p>

  <p>In that moment of great tension just before
  the finger pulls the trigger, just before the fuse begins to
  burn; in the terrible quiet of that moment, there's still time to
  wonder, alone: Is it really imperative to act? Is there no other
  choice? No other way?</p>

  <p>And then the order is given, and the
  inferno begins.</p>

  <p>"God takes pity on kindergarteners", wrote
  the poet Yehudah Amichai, who is here with us tonight,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">"God takes pity on kindergarteners,<br>
    Less so on schoolchildren,<br>
    And will no longer pity their elders,<br>
    Leaving them to their own.<br>
    And sometimes they will have to crawl on all fours<br>
    Through the burning sand<br>
    To reach the casualty station<br>
    Bleeding."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For decades God has not taken pity on the
  kindergarteners in the Middle East, or the schoolchildren, or
  their elders. There has been no pity in the Middle East for
  generations.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>I was a young man who has now grown fully
  in years. And of all the memories I have stored up in my
  seventy-two years, I now recall the hopes.</p>

  <p>Our peoples have chosen us to give them
  life. Terrible as it is to say, their lives are in our hands.
  Tonight, their eyes are upon us and their hearts are asking: How
  is the authority vested in these men and women being used? What
  will they decide? What kind of morning will we rise to tomorrow?
  A day of peace? Of war? Of laughter or of tears?</p>

  <p>A child is born into an utterly
  undemocratic world. He cannot choose his father and mother. He
  cannot pick his sex or color, his religion, nationality, or
  homeland. Whether he is born in a manor or a manger, whether he
  lives under a despotic or democratic regime, it is not his
  choice. From the moment he comes, close-fisted, into the world,
  his fate lies in the hands of his nation's leaders. It is they
  who will decide whether he lives in comfort or despair, in
  security or in fear. His fate is given to us to resolve - to the
  Presidents and Prime Ministers of countries, democratic or
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>Just as no two fingerprints are identical,
  so no two people are alike, and every country has its own laws
  and culture, traditions and leaders. But there is one universal
  message which can embrace the entire world, one precept which can
  be common to different regimes, to races which bear no
  resemblance, to cultures alien to each other.</p>

  <p>It is a message which the Jewish people has
  borne for thousands of years, a message found in the Book of
  Books, which my people has bequeathed to all civilized men:
  <i>"V'nishmartem me'od lnafshoteichem"</i>, in the words in
  <i>Deuteronomy</i>; "Therefore take good heed to yourselves" -
  or, in contemporary terms, the message of the Sanctity of
  Life.</p>

  <p>The leaders of nations must provide their
  peoples with the conditions - the "infrastructure", if you will -
  which enables them to enjoy life: freedom of speech and of
  movement; food and shelter; and most important of all: life
  itself. A man cannot enjoy his rights if he is not among the
  living. And so every country must protect and preserve the key
  element in its national ethos: the lives of its citizens.</p>

  <p>To defend those lives, we call upon our
  citizens to enlist in the army. And to defend the lives of our
  citizens serving in the army, we invest huge sums in planes, and
  tanks, in armored plating and concrete fortifications. Yet
  despite it all, we fail to protect the lives of our citizens and
  soldiers. Military cemeteries in every corner of the world are
  silent testimony to the failure of national leaders to sanctify
  human life.</p>

  <p>There is only one radical means of
  sanctifying human lives. Not armored plating, or tanks, or
  planes, or concrete fortifications.</p>

  <p>The one radical solution is peace.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>The profession of soldiering embraces a
  certain paradox. We take the best and bravest of our young men
  into the army. We supply them with equipment which costs a
  virtual fortune. We rigorously train them for the day when they
  must do their duty - and we expect them to do it well. Yet we
  fervently pray that that day will never come - that the planes
  will never take flight, the tanks will never move forward, the
  soldiers will never mount the attacks for which they have been
  trained so well.</p>

  <p>We pray it will never happen because of the
  Sanctity of Life.</p>

  <p>History as a whole, and modern history in
  particular, has known harrowing times when national leaders
  turned their citizens into cannon fodder in the name of wicked
  doctrines: vicious Fascism and fiendish Nazism. Pictures of
  children marching to the slaughter, photos of terrified women at
  the gates of crematoria must loom before the eyes of every leader
  in our generation, and the generations to come. They must serve
  as a warning to all who wield power:</p>

  <p>Almost all the regimes which did not place
  Man and the sanctity of Life at the heart of their world view,
  all those regimes have collapsed and are no more. You can see it
  for yourselves in our own day.</p>

  <p>Yet this is not the whole picture. To
  preserve the Sanctity of Life, we must sometimes risk it.
  Sometimes there is no other way to defend our citizens than to
  fight for their lives, for their safety and sovereignty. This is
  the creed of every democratic state.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>In the State of Israel, from which I come
  today; in the Israel Defense Forces, which I have had the
  privilege to command, we have always viewed the Sanctity of Life
  as a supreme value. We have gone to war only when a fearful sword
  was poised to cut us down.</p>

  <p>The history of the State of Israel, the
  annals of the Israel Defense Forces are filled with thousands of
  stories of soldiers who sacrificed themselves - who died while
  trying to save wounded comrades; who gave their lives to avoid
  causing harm to innocent people on the enemy's side.</p>

  <p>In the coming days, a special Commission of
  the Israel Defense Forces will finish drafting a Code of Conduct
  for our soldiers. The formulation regarding human life will read
  as follows, and I quote:</p>

  <p>"In recognition of its supreme importance,
  the soldier will preserve human life in every way possible and
  endanger himself, or others, only to the extent deemed necessary
  to fulfill this mission.</p>

  <p>The Sanctity of Life, in the view of the
  soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, will find expression in
  all their actions; in considered and precise planning; in
  intelligent and safety-minded training and in judicious
  implementation, in accordance with their mission; in taking the
  professionally proper degree of risk and degree of caution; and
  in the constant effort to limit casualties to the scope required
  to achieve the objective." End quote.</p>

  <p>For many years ahead - even if wars come to
  an end, after peace comes to our land - these words will remain a
  pillar of fire which goes before our camp, a guiding light for
  our people. And we take pride in that.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>We are in the midst of building the peace.
  The architects and engineers of this enterprise are engaged in
  their work even as we gather here tonight, building the peace
  layer by layer, brick by brick, beam by beam. The job is
  difficult, complex, trying. Mistakes could topple the whole
  structure and bring disaster down upon us.</p>

  <p>And so we are determined to do the job well
  - despite the toll of murderous terrorism, despite fanatic and
  scheming enemies.</p>

  <p>We will pursue the course of peace with
  determination and fortitude.</p>

  <p>We will not let up.</p>

  <p>We will not give in.</p>

  <p>Peace will triumph over all our enemies,
  because the alternative is grim for us all.</p>

  <p>And we will prevail.</p>

  <p>We will prevail because we regard the
  building of peace as a great blessing for us, and for our
  children after us. We regard it as a blessing for our neighbors
  on all sides, and for our partners in this enterprise - the
  United States, Russia, Norway, and all mankind.</p>

  <p>We wake up every morning, now, as different
  people. Suddenly, peace. We see the hope in our children's eyes.
  We see the light in our soldier's faces, in the streets, in the
  buses, in the fields.</p>

  <p>We must not let them down.</p>

  <p>We will not let them down.</p>

  <p>I do not stand here alone, today, on this
  small rostrum in Oslo. I am the emissary of generations of
  Israelis, of the shepherds of Israel, just as King David was a
  shepherd, of the herdsmen and dressers of sycamore trees, as the
  Prophet Amos was; of the rebels against the establishment, like
  the Prophet Jeremiah, and of men who go down to the sea, like the
  Prophet Jonah.</p>

  <p>I am the emissary of the poets and of those
  who dreamed of an end to war, like the Prophet Isaiah.</p>

  <p>I am also the emissary of sons of the
  Jewish people like Albert Einstein and Baruch Spinoza; like
  Maimonides, Sigmund Freud, and Franz Kafka.<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>And I am the emissary of the millions who
  perished in the Holocaust, among whom were surely many Einsteins
  and Freuds who were lost to us, and to humanity, in the flames of
  the crematoria.</p>

  <p>I am here as the emissary of Jerusalem, at
  whose gates I fought in days of siege; Jerusalem which has always
  been, and is today, the eternal capital of the State of Israel
  and the heart of the Jewish people, who pray toward it three
  times a day.</p>

  <p>And I am also the emissary of the children
  who drew their visions of peace; and of the immigrants from Saint
  Petersburg and Addis Ababa.</p>

  <p>I stand here mainly for the generations to
  come, so that we may all be deemed worthy of the medallion which
  you have bestowed on me today.</p>

  <p>I stand here as the emissary of our
  neighbors who were our enemies. I stand here as the emissary of
  the soaring hopes of a people which has endured the worst that
  history has to offer and nevertheless made its mark - not just on
  the chronicles of the Jewish people but on all mankind.</p>

  <p>With me here are five million citizens of
  Israel - Jews and Arabs, Druze and Circassians - five million
  hearts beating for peace - and five million pairs of eyes which
  look to us with such great expectations for peace.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>I wish to thank, first and foremost, those
  citizens of the State of Israel, of all generations and political
  persuasions, whose sacrifices and relentless struggle for peace
  bring us steadier closer to our goal.</p>

  <p>I wish to thank our partners - the
  Egyptians, Jordanians, Palestinians, and the Chairman of the
  Palestinian Liberation Organization, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Mr. Yasser Arafat</a>, with
  whom we share this Nobel Prize - who have chosen the path of
  peace and are writing a new page in the annals of the Middle
  East.</p>

  <p>I wish to thank the members of the Israeli
  government and above all my colleague <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Mr. Shimon Peres</a>, whose
  energy and devotion to the cause of peace are an example to us
  all.</p>

  <p>I wish to thank my family for their
  support.</p>

  <p>And, of course, I wish to thank the members
  of the Nobel Committee and the courageous Norwegian people for
  bestowing this illustrious honor on my colleagues and myself.</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>Allow me to close by sharing with you a
  traditional Jewish blessing which has been recited by my people,
  in good times and in bad, from time immemorial, as a token of
  their deepest longing:</p>

  <p>"The Lord will give strength to his people;
  the Lord will bless his people - all of us - with peace."</p>
