  <h1>Richard Zsigmondy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="zsigmondy.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Richard Adolf Zsigmondy</b>
  was born in Vienna on April 1, 1865. His father, doctor Adolf
  Zsigmondy, had done a great deal to promote dentistry in Austria,
  had invented several surgical instruments and devices, and had
  published several scientific and medical works. He encouraged his
  four children's interest in the natural sciences. He died when
  Zsigmondy was only 15 years old. Zsigmondy's mother, Irma von
  Szakmary, encouraged her children to lead an outdoor life, to
  take an interest in the arts and to follow their own
  inclinations. Zsigmondy and his brothers spent much of their time
  climbing, mountaineering, swimming and diving.<br>
  <br>
  Zsigmondy's interest in chemistry and physics developed at an
  early age; he studied Stoeckhardt's textbook <i>Schule der
  Chemie</i> and carried out many of the experiments mentioned
  there in his own small laboratory in his home. He was also
  influenced by Roscoe-Schorlemmer's and Berzelius's textbooks on
  chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Under the guidance of Professor E. Ludwig of the Medical Faculty
  in Vienna he learnt the basic facts about quantitative analysis.
  He then studied at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna and in 1887 went to
  Munich to read organic chemistry under Professor W. von Miller.
  After taking his doctorate, he remained as Professor von Miller's
  assistant and later accepted a similar position as assistant to
  the physicist Professor Kundt in Berlin. In 1893 he qualified as
  lecturer at the Technische Hochschule in Graz and also accepted a
  teaching post there. His work on lustre colours for glass and
  china induced him to study more closely the chemistry of
  colloids, and led to an appointment with the glass works Schott
  und Genossen in Jena, where he remained until 1900. He left in
  order to exclusively pursue scientific research. During this
  period he discovered how to prepare reproducibly gold hydrosols
  and also developed the slit-ultramicroscope in joint
  collaboration with Siedentopf.<br>
  <br>
  In 1907 Zsigmondy was appointed Professor and Director of the
  Institute of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen, where he remained until his retirement in
  February 1929. Following the First World War, especially in 1922
  and 1923, the Institute suffered severe shortages of the most
  simple chemical materials and scientific research work became
  very difficult. In 1925 Zsigmondy was awarded the Nobel Prize for
  Chemistry for his work on the heterogeneous nature of colloidal
  solutions. This made it possible for him to overcome, with deep
  gratitude, most of the difficulties he had encountered in the
  previous years. Apart from his <i>Lehrbuch der Kolloidchemie</i>,
  Zsigmondy published a book <i>&Uuml;ber das kolloide Gold</i> in
  collaboration with P.A. Thiessen. His son-in-law, Dr. Erich
  Huckel, who was also one of his co-workers, contributed a book on
  the theories of adsorption for Zsigmondy's collected papers
  <i>Kolloidforschung in Einzeldarstellungen</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Zsigmondy married Laura Luise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> M&uuml;ller, the
  daughter of Professor Wilhelm M&uuml;ller, lecturer in
  pathological anatomy in Jena, in 1903. Two daughters, Annemarie
  and K&auml;the, resulted from this marriage. In 1925 Annemarie
  married Dr. Erich Huckel of G&ouml;ttingen, who in Zurich was
  assistant to Professor <a href="../1936/index.html">Debye</a>,
  and later became lecturer there.<br>
  <br>
  He died in G&ouml;ttingen on September 24, 1929.</p>
