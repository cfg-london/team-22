  <h1>Charles Glover Barkla - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="barkla.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Charles Glover Barkla</b> was born on
  June 7, 1877 at Widnes, Lancashire, England, where his father,
  J.M. Barkla, was Secretary to the Atlas Chemical Company. He was
  educated at the Liverpool Institute and entered University
  College, Liverpool, in 1894 to study mathematics and physics, the
  latter under Oliver Lodge. He graduated with First Class Honours
  in Physics in 1898 and in the following year he obtained his
  master's degree. Also in 1899, he was awarded a research
  scholarship by the Royal Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851
  and he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, to work in the Cavendish
  Laboratory with <a href="../1906/index.html">J. J. Thomson</a>.
  He migrated to King's College during 1900 and in 1902 returned to
  Liverpool as Oliver Lodge Fellow. From 1905 to 1909 he was
  successively demonstrator, assistant lecturer in physics and
  special lecturer in advanced electricity at the University, and
  in 1909 he succeeded H. A. Wilson as Wheatstone Professor of
  Physics in the University of London. In 1913, Barkla accepted the
  Chair in Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh and he held this
  position until his death.<br>

  Barkla's first researches concerned the velocity of electric
  waves along wires but in 1902 he commenced his investigations on
  R&ouml;ntgen radiation which were to occupy almost his whole
  life. His discovery of homogeneous radiations characteristic of
  the elements showed that these elements had their characteristic
  line spectra in X-ray and he was the first to show that secondary
  emission is of two kinds, one consisting of X-rays scattered
  unchanged, and the other a fluorescent radiation peculiar to the
  particular substance. He discovered the polarisation of X-rays,
  an experimental result of considerable importance for it meant
  that X-radiation could be regarded as similar to ordinary light.
  Barkla made valuable contributions to present knowledge on the
  absorption and photographic action of X-rays and his later work
  demonstrated the relation between the characteristic X-radiation
  and the corpuscular radiation accompanying it. He has also shown
  both the applicability and the limitation of the quantum theory
  in relation to R&ouml;ntgen radiation. The results of his
  findings are recorded in various papers which have appeared
  mainly in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society.
  He had a considerable reputation as an examiner in physics.</p>

  <p>Barkla, a Fellow of the Royal Society, had
  several honorary degrees. He was appointed Bakerian Lecturer
  (Royal Society) in 1916 and he was awarded the Hughes Medal in
  the following year.</p>

  <p>Charles Glover Barkla married Mary Esther,
  the eldest daughter of John T. Cowell of Douglas,
  Receiver-General of the Isle of Man, in 1907. They had two sons
  and one daughter. Their youngest son, Flight Lieutenant Michael
  Barkla, a brilliant scholar, was killed in action in 1943.
  Barkla's chief recreation was singing - he had a powerful
  baritone voice and he was a member of the King's College Chapel
  Choir, 1901-1902. Latterly, he had also become fond of golf.</p>

  <p>Barkla died at his home, Braidwood,
  Edinburgh, on October 23, 1944.</p>
