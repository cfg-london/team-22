  <h1>Erwin Neher - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="neher.jpg" class="bio-img">

  Buchloe is a small town in Bavaria,
  situated in a rolling countryside in view of the Alps, 70 km west
  from Munich. This is where I grew up and spent most of my life
  until 1963, when I entered university. I was born in Landsberg,
  another town close by on the 20th of March 1944. My father, Franz
  Xaver Neher, was involved in the administration of a dairy
  company. Fortunately, this was considered to be of importance for
  food supply during the wartime, such that he was spared from
  military service. My mother Elisabeth (n&eacute;e Pfeiffer), who
  had received an education as a teacher in the early 1930s, was
  caring for the family of five, which included my two older
  sisters. Thus, in spite of the difficulties of the postwar
  period, I had the privilege to grow up in an intact family. Our
  family home was situated in a big, park-like garden, in which I
  spent hours by myself, watching plants and animals, and where I
  knew almost every pebble.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of 10, I entered the 'Maristenkolleg' at Mindelheim.
  Mindelheim is another nearby town, and the local 'Gymnasium' is
  operated by a catholic congregation, the
  'Maristenschulbr&uuml;der'. The big advantage of this school was
  that our teachers - both those belonging to the congregation and
  others - were very dedicated and were open not only to the
  subject matter but also to personal issues. During my years at
  the Gymnasium (1954 to 1963) I found out that, next to my
  interest in living things, I also could immerse myself in
  technical and analytical problems. In fact, pretty soon, physics
  and mathematics became my favourite subjects. At the same time,
  however, new concepts unifying these two areas had seeped into
  the literature, which was accessible to me. I eagerly read about
  cybernetics, which was a fashionable word at that time, and
  studied everything in my reach on the 'Hodgkin-Huxley theory' of
  nerve excitation. By the time of my Abitur - the examination
  providing access to university - it was clear to me that I should
  become a 'biophysicist'. My plan was to study physics, and later
  on add biology.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1963, I took up the study of physics at the
  'Technische Hochschule' in Munich. The Technische
  Hochschule, in some contrast to typical German universities had a
  pretty tight schedule with quite an amount of problem-oriented
  course work supplementing ordinary lectures. Such training was of
  great help for many aspects of my subsequent research work.<br>
  <br>
  In 1966, I won a Fulbright Scholarship to study in the US. I had
  applied for this with the idea, that it might provide access to
  biophysics. This was, indeed, the case. During my year at the
  University of
  Wisconsin at Madison, I was fully integrated into a
  biophysics laboratory involved in low angle X-ray scattering. My
  own project, directed by Prof. W.W. Beeman, was an early attempt
  at producing molecular beams of macromolecules for mass
  spectrometry. In a little more than a year I earned a 'Master of
  Science' degree. With this formal conclusion of a physics
  education I felt ready for switching to biology. I returned to
  Munich in 1967 and looked around for some PhD project in
  biophysics, preferably related to nerve excitation. Fortunately,
  my search led me to the Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r
  Psychiatrie, where H.D. Lux was investigating synaptic
  mechanisms in motoneurones and ion currents in snail neurones. We
  readily agreed on a project on voltage-clamping snail neurones.
  To circumvent space-clamp problems Dieter Lux suggested to use
  suction pipettes for local measurement of current density.<br>
  <br>
  During my years in Dr. Lux's laboratory I met <a href=
  "index.html">Bert Sakmann</a>, who did his PhD project in the
  same institute. Bert was very interested in the basic neuronal
  mechanisms that we were studying, we had many lively discussions,
  and became friends. Following his interests Bert decided to go to
  London to work in the biophysics laboratory of <a href=
  "../1970/index.html">Sir Bernhard Katz</a>. We met again in
  G&ouml;ttingen in 1973, where I had joined a physical chemistry
  laboratory to get experience with single channel recording in
  artificial membranes. Bert brought with him the experience on the
  neuromuscular junction and it required only little discussion to
  agree on a collaboration, aiming at the measurement of single
  channel currents. In 1976, we published the first single channel
  records while I spent a year in the laboratory of Charles F.
  Stevens at Yale
  University. Afterwards, our heads of department, Hans Kuhn
  and Otto D. Creutzfeldt, established independent 'Young
  Investigator Laboratories' for us. This was very helpful for
  close collaboration, and allowed us to attract a number of
  excellent postdoctoral fellows: Joseph P. Patlak, Fred Sigworth,
  Alain Marty and Owen P. Hamill. Together we perfected the
  technique, and developed the different recording configurations.
  I feel very much indebted to these collaborators as well as to
  colleagues who later joined the laboratory. After 1983, my
  interests shifted away from the channels themselves to processes
  they initiate inside cells, eventually leading to a cellular
  response-like secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters.<br>
  <br>
  Just before starting to assemble my own laboratory I met my wife,
  Eva-Maria - in the laboratory, of course. We married in 1978,
  such that my family at home, and my 'research family' grew in
  parallel. We now have five children: Richard (12), Benjamin (11),
  Carola (10), Sigmund (7), and Margret (4). My wife has given up
  her own scientific career and given me constant support for the
  benefit of my research.</p>
