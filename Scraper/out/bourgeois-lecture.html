  <h2>The Reasons for the League of Nations</h2>

  <p>Some weeks ago,<a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1921/index.html"> Mr. Branting</a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> went to Oslo to fulfill the
  obligation incumbent upon every Nobel Peace Prize laureate. I
  wish to offer my apologies for not having been able to do the
  same this last year. The state of my health has not permitted me
  to make the journey to Norway, and this has caused me the most
profound regret.</p>

  <p>Your Chairman informed me that you would
  permit me to address you in writing. I now send you my sincere
  gratitude and an account of certain ideas of mine, which I would
  much prefer to have offered you in person. Gentlemen, please
  accept my heartfelt thanks.</p>


    <p align="center">I</p>
 

  <p>I am in full agreement with the views Mr.
  Branting expressed to you last June. With great perspicacity, he
  analyzed and placed in proper perspective "the great
  disillusionment" which the Great War of 1914-1918 had engendered
  in the minds of men. Certainly, this sudden unleashing of a
  cataclysm unequalled in the past, appeared to be the direct
  negation of the hopes which Nobel had nurtured when he founded
  the Peace Prize. But in place of the discouragement which had
  taken hold of the public, Mr. Branting offered reasons for
  believing that we could still derive confidence from the
  catastrophe. He showed that, under the ruins left behind by the
  bitter times we have just experienced, there were to be found far
  too many signs of rejuvenation to allow us to discount the
  present years as a period of regression.</p>

  <p>The victory had been, above all, a victory
  for law and order, and for civilization itself. The collapse of
  three great monarchies based largely upon military power had
  given birth to a number of young nations, each representing the
  right of peoples to govern themselves, as well as to enjoy the
  benefits of democratic institutions which, by making peace
  dependent on the will of the citizens themselves, infinitely
  reduced the risk of conflict in the future.</p>

  <p>The same movement had brought not only the
  resurrection of oppressed nations, but also the reintegration in
  political unity of races hitherto torn apart by violence.</p>

  <p>Finally, one singularly important fact had
  succeeded in giving true significance to the victory of free
  nations. Out of the horror of four years of war had emerged, like
  a supreme protest, a new idea which was implanting itself in the
  minds of all people: that of the necessity for civilized nations
  to join together for the defense of law and order and the
  maintenance of peace. The League of Nations, heralded in 1899 and
  1907 by the Hague Peace Conferences, became, through the
  Covenant<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> of June 28, 1919, a
  living reality.</p>

  <p>But, can it furnish us at last with a
  stable instrument of peace? Or shall we again encounter, at the
  very moment when we think we are reaching our goal, the same
  obstacles which for centuries have blocked the way of those
  pilgrims of every race, creed, and civilization who have
  struggled in vain toward the ideal of peace?</p>

 
    <p align="center">II</p>


 

  <p>To answer this question, which touches upon
  all the anguish of the human race, and to understand the causes
  of the upheavals which have beset mankind, we must delve not only
  into the history of peoples but into that of man himself, into
  the history of the individual, whose passions are no different
  from those of his community and in whom we are certain to find
  all propensities, good or bad, enlarged as in a mirror.</p>

  <p>Human passions, like the forces of nature,
  are eternal; it is not a matter of denying their existence, but
  of assessing them and understanding them. Like the forces of
  nature, they can be subjected to man's deliberate act of will and
  be made to work in harmony with reason. We see them at work in
  the strife between nations just as we see them in struggles
  between individuals, and we realize at last that only by using
  the means for controlling the latter can we control the
  former.</p>

  <p>To assert that it is possible to establish
  peace between men of different nations is simply to assert that
  man, whatever his ethnical background, his race, religious
  beliefs, or philosophy, is capable of reason. Two forces within
  the individual contribute to the development of his conscience
  and of his morality: reason and sensitivity.</p>

  <p>His sensitivity is twofold. At first, it is
  merely an expression of the instinct of self-preservation,
  springing from the need of all beings to develop at the expense
  of their surroundings, to the detriment of other beings whose
  death seems essential to their very existence. But there is also
  another manifestation of the instinct, which makes him sensitive
  to the suffering of others: it is this which creates a moral bond
  between mother and child, then between father and son, and later
  still between men of the same tribe, the same clan. It is this
  instinct of sympathy which enables man to fight against and to
  control his brutish and selfish instincts.</p>

  <p>A great French philosopher, criticizing the
  doctrine according to which "one could wish no more for a race
  than that it should attain the fullest development of its
  strength and of its capacity for power", has pointed out that
  this is only an incomplete concept of what man is. "This is to
  place man in isolation and to see in him a noble animal, mighty
  and formidable. But to be seen as a complete whole, man must be
  viewed in the society which developed him: The superior race is
  the one best adapted to society and to communal progress."</p>

  <p>In this respect, goodness, the need for
  sociability, and, to a higher degree, a sense of honor, are
  spontaneous attributes, valuable beyond all other instincts but
  just as natural. Now these feelings are present in a national
  community just as they are in the individuals who compose it. To
  place them above the gratification of individual egotism is the
  task of civilization. Never should the power of an individual be
  allowed to impede the progress of the rest of the nation; never
  should the power of a nation be allowed to impede the progress of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Man has a sensitivity which can be either
  selfish or altruistic; but it is <i>reason</i> which is his
  essence. It is not his violent and contradictory impulses, but
  rather his reason which, at first hesitant and fragile in
  childhood, then growing in strength, finally brings man to
  reconcile the two sides of his sensitivity in conscious and
  lasting harmony. It is reason which, from the beginning of
  history, has led mankind little by little in the course of
  successive civilizations to realize that there is a state
  preferable to that of the brutal struggle for life, not only a
  less dangerous state, but the only one capable of conforming to
  the dictates of conscience; and that is, in its ever increasing
  complexity and solidity, the truly social state.</p>

  <p>The rise of man from the animal to the
  human level was prolonged by the necessity of rising from a state
  of barbarism and violence to one of order and peace. In this
  process too, it was <i>reason</i> that finally persuaded man to
  define, under the name of law, some limits within which each
  individual must confine himself if he wishes to be worthy of
  remaining in the social state.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At first, laws evolved out of religious
  doctrines. It followed that they were recognized only when
  advantageous to those who practiced the same religion and who
  appeared equals under the protection of the same gods. For the
  members of all other cults, there was neither law nor mercy. This
  was the age of implacable deities, of Baal and of Moloch; it was
  also the age of Jehovah, preaching to his people the
  extermination of the conquered.</p>

  <p>The torch of <i>reason</i> was first held
  up to the world by Greek philosophy, which led to the stoicism
  according to which all men are equal and "are the members of a
  single body", and in which the human will, regulated by law, is
  regarded as the guiding mechanism of man's activity.</p>

  <p>This doctrine of the human will was
  expressed in Roman law of the Imperial Age by that admirable
  theory of obligations which, in private law, makes the validity
  of contracts dependent upon the free consent of the
  contractors.</p>

  <p>What a gulf there still exists between
  these affirmations of private law and the recognition of the same
  law as the guiding force for the policies of nations!</p>

  <p>Then came Christianity which gave to man's
  natural capacity for sympathy a form and a forcefulness hitherto
  unknown. The doctrine of Christ enjoins men, all brothers in His
  eyes, to love one another. It condemns violence, saying: "He who
  lives by the sword shall die by the sword."<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>It preaches a Christian communion
  superseding all nationalities and offering to the Gentiles - in
  other words, to all nations of the earth - the hope of a better
  life in which justice will finally rule.</p>

  <p>The Middle Ages, on the whole, embodied the
  history of the development of this doctrine, and for several
  centuries the efforts of the Papacy reflected a persistent desire
  to bring to the world, if not justice itself, which seemed still
  to be beyond the human grasp and which was generally left "in the
  hands of God", at least a temporary, relative state of peace,
  "the Truce of God"<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, which
  gave unhappy humanity a respite from its suffering, a brief
  moment of security.</p>

  <p>But a new period of conflict arrived in its
  turn to upset Europe with religious wars<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>. These were perhaps the more. cruel
  because they obliged the conscience itself to repudiate
  compassion and seemed to incite conflict between the two forces
  which had hitherto shared the world between them:
  <i>sensitivity</i> and <i>reason</i>. Not until the eighteenth
  century were they finally reconciled.</p>

  <p>The Declaration of the Rights of
  Man<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> at last set down for all
  of mankind the principles of justice without which it would never
  be possible to lay any foundations for true and lasting
  peace.</p>

  <p>But how much suffering, how much blood had
  to be squandered for more than a century before we could finally
  hope to see the application of the truly humanitarian, moral
  principles proclaimed by the French Revolution! It has been
  necessary, as Taine<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> says,
  "to multiply ideas, to establish earlier thinking in the
  conscious mind, to marshal thoughts around accepted precepts: in
  a word, to reshape, on the basis of experience, the interior of
  the human head".</p>

  <p>Was not the greatest revolution in history
  that which allowed reason to regard the whole of humanity as
  being subject to law and to acknowledge the status of "man" in
  every human being?</p>

  <p>All men equal in rights and duties, all men
  equally responsible for the destiny of mankind - what a
  dream!</p>

  <p>Will the concept of law as mistress of the
  world finally make reason reasonable?</p>


    <p align="center">III</p>


  <p>Have we arrived at a stage in the
  development of universal morality and of civilization that will
  allow us to regard a League of Nations as viable? If its
  existence is feasible, what characteristics and what limitations
  should it have in order to adapt itself to the actual state of
  affairs in the world?</p>

  <p>Certainly, immense progress has already
  been made in the political, social, and moral organization of
  most nations.</p>

  <p>The spreading of public education to nearly
  every corner of the globe is producing a powerful effect on many
  minds.</p>

  <p>The prevalence of democratic institutions
  is evident in every civilized nation.</p>

  <p>We are witnessing a weakening of the class
  prejudice so obstructive to social progress and we see, even in
  Russia, a rejection of Communist systems that seek to stifle
  personal liberty and initiative.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is an increasing number of
  social institutions offering assistance, insurance, and
  fellowship, whose object is the protection of the rights of the
  individual and, in a broader sense, the propagation of the
  concept of an increasingly humanitarian justice under which the
  individual's responsibility for his conduct will no longer be
  dissociated from that of society itself.</p>

  <p>In every nation, all these factors are
  preparing the way for the intellectual revolution of which we
  speak, a revolution that will lead people to appreciate and to
  understand the superiority, indeed the absolute necessity, of
  having international organizations which will recognize and apply
  the same principles.</p>

  <p>It is true, of course, that there still
  remain outside the movement to bring civilization to this
  superior state of conscience, vast territories whose populations,
  held for centuries in slavery or servitude, have not yet felt the
  stir of this awakening influence and for whom a period, and
  undoubtedly a long one at that, of moral and intellectual growth
  is imperative.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is a new and significant
  fact that the civilized nations, alert to "the sacred trust of
  civilization", have, within the terms of Article 22 of the
  Covenant of the League of Nations, undertaken the task of
  educating the backward peoples so that they may become "able to
  stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern
  world".</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Progress has been made not only in terms of
  institutions, organizations, and customs, but also in a purely
  political way from the standpoint of the map of Europe and of the
  world itself.</p>

  <p>When the Hague Peace Conference of 1899,
  meeting at the instigation of the Czar, set before the civilized
  world the problem of disarmament and of peace, and for the first
  time mentioned the name "League of Nations", it was a
  <i>priori</i> certain that the problem could not be solved at
  that time. The political geography of Europe was far too firmly
  founded on violations of the rights of peoples. How could anyone
  use it as a basis for organizing peace in the face of this
  fact?</p>

  <p>Today, war has served to eliminate most of
  the injustices of that time. In Europe, Alsace-Lorraine has been
  returned to France; Poland has been restored as an independent
  entity; and the Czechoslovaks, Danes, Belgians, Slavs, and Latins
  have regained their respective rights of self-government or have
  been returned to their homelands.</p>

  <p>Even in Asia a great effort is being made
  right now to find, in legality and in peace, a durable balance
  between the historic rights of the various races.</p>

  <p>Does this mean, then, that in Europe or,
  for that matter, in other parts of the world all sources of
  trouble have disappeared? We are far from being blindly confident
  of the future; indeed, we have before our very eyes signs of
  trouble too obvious and too certain for us even to dream of
  denying them.</p>

  <p>In the first place, certain powers that
  were defeated in the Great War have not been wholehearted in
  their acceptance of the moral disarmament which is the primary
  condition for any peace. Some turbulent minorities of uncertain
  character, too weak to form a state of their own but resistant to
  the majority in the societies of which they are a part, are
  seeking support outside the natural frontiers within which
  communal life thrives, thus threatening to create areas of
  friction and violence where there should be mutual tolerance and
  trust.</p>

  <p>In the second place, artificial movements
  are springing up which seek to cross national boundaries, and to
  bring together in inorganic bodies the most varied of peoples.
  Movements such as the Pan-Germanic, Pan-Islamic, or Pan-Negro
  justify themselves on the basis of their common language,.or
  their common religion, or their color. But since the undefined
  masses involved in these movements lack the essential and real
  unity of background or community of purpose, they become a grave
  danger to general peace.</p>

  <p>Yet all this may be of transient
  significance, for it seems to be mainly part of the last tremors
  of the cataclysm that has shaken the world.</p>

  <p>But there is something more profound that
  must be taken into account about any international organization.
  Mr. Branting, in his speech to you a few months ago, showed that
  there was a world of difference between the International of the
  classes as envisaged by certain Socialist congresses and the true
  International of nations, and that only through the latter could
  peace be truly established among men, instead of being merely
  longed for against all reasonable hope.</p>

  <p>The concept of patriotism is not
  incompatible with that of humanity; on the contrary, let me state
  emphatically that he who best serves pacifism, serves patriotism
  best. The nation is and can be no more than the vital basic unit
  of any international league. Just as the formation of the family
  is basic to the formation of the state, so the states themselves
  are the only units that can form the basic constitution of a
  viable international organization.</p>

  <p>The 1914-1918 War, being a war of
  liberation of nationalities, could not help overstimulating
  nationalistic sentiment. It gave greater impetus to the moral and
  intellectual tendencies conducive to patriotism; it made this
  feeling, as well-founded as any other, more zealous. As a result,
  the proposed international organization must, in the final
  analysis, be based not only on the intangible sovereignty of each
  nation, but also on the equality of rights of them all,
  regardless of their strength, weakness, or relative size. It is
  only among properly constituted states that the reign of law and
  order can be established.</p>

  <p>For these same reasons, it was impossible
  even to dream of any organization being forced on the nations
  from without. The idea of a "superstate" whose will could be
  imposed on the governing bodies of each nation might have brought
  about a revolt of patriotism. What was and is necessary and at
  the same time sufficient, is that each nation understand that
  mutual consent to certain principles of law and to certain
  agreements, acknowledged to be equally profitable to the
  contracting parties, no more implies a surrender of sovereignty
  than a contract in private business implies a renunciation of
  personal liberty. It is, rather, the deliberate use of this very
  liberty itself and an acknowledged advantage for both parties.
  But what, then, is the fundamental condition necessary for such
  an agreement, what is the indispensable condition that insures
  consent without reservation, that gives confidence to all sides
  that nothing essential, no vital interest, will be sacrificed by
  any of the contracting parties?</p>

  <p>There must be a paramount rule, a sovereign
  standard, by which each settlement may be measured and checked,
  just as in the scientific world, man, distrusting his own
  fallible senses, refers for comparison and evaluation of
  phenomena to the evidence of standardized instruments free of
  personal error.</p>

  <p>On a moral plane it is law, devoid of
  individual or national bias and immune to the fluctuations of
  opinion which will be the instrument, the unprejudiced registrar
  of claims and counterclaims. By its absolute impartiality and its
  authoritative evidence, the law will appease passions, disarm ill
  will, discourage illusory ambitions, and create that climate of
  confidence and calm in which the delicate flower of peace can
  live and grow.</p>

  <p>Does such a sovereign and unassailable law
  in fact exist? The history of the past centuries suggests an
  affirmative answer.</p>

  <p>Now and henceforth there exists an
  international law whose doctrine is firm and whose jurisprudence
  is not contested by a single civilized nation. The nineteenth
  century, which introduced the Hague Peace Conferences and
  generated numerous international conferences on a variety of
  subjects, also brought an increasing number of applications of
  international law. If this law was all too obviously violated in
  1914 and during the war years, the victory has righted the wrong
  done. Should such violations ever happen again, then indeed we
  must despair of the future of mankind.</p>

  <p>Of a purely theoretical and doctrinal
  nature at first, international law is gradually being enriched by
  numerous conventions containing essential obligations of a
  judicial order, which can be precisely defined and codified and
  made legally binding and subject to sanctions. The scope of these
  conventions grows continuously, gradually embracing moral
  concepts which constitute what I have called in a recent study,
  international ethics; it concerns everything that touches on the
  life, the health, and the well-being, material and spiritual, of
  all human beings.</p>

  <p>International law does in fact exist.</p>

  <p>But, can we hope that a juridical body
  vested with such sovereignty will ever constitute a faithful
  interpreter of the law as unbiased and dispassionate as the law
  itself?</p>

  <p>The recent course of the deliberations in
  the League of Nations and the creation of the Court of
  International Justice<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> enable
  us to say yes once again !</p>


    <p align="center">IV</p>


  <p>Let us summarize the three conditions
  necessarily basic to any international organization which would
  be in step with contemporary civilization.</p>

  <p>In the first place, there must exist among
  the associated states a community of thought and feeling and a
  development of ideas which, if not actually identical, should at
  least be sufficiently analogous to allow a common understanding
  of the principles of international order and to produce general
  agreement on the laws which give them effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Second, each one of these laws must have
  received the free and unqualified consent of each state; and if
  sanctions have been proclaimed in the event of the violation of
  such a law, these sanctions should have been agreed upon by all
  in the same way that the laws themselves were, so that no nation
  can claim to have been forced into participating in a collective
  action to which it would not have given its consent at the
  outset.</p>

  <p>Finally, there should be a centrally
  located tribunal to define for each individual case the findings
  of international law and to rule on their application. Such a
  tribunal must be one of unquestionable impartiality which compels
  recognition of its moral authority by virtue of the expert
  ability and moral caliber of the judges who occupy its
  benches.</p>

  <p>If these three conditions are met - and it
  will be immediately apparent that all three are in effect
  contained in one primary condition: the freely given consent of
  each of the participants - if these conditions are met, then the
  League of Nations will be able to function, on the one hand with
  a flexibility which will allow its members to feel secure and at
  ease within its authority and, on the other hand with the kind of
  moral force that will preclude the members from even thinking of
  evading its decisions.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We talk of moral force. But this does not
  mean that we exclude the use of material force when necessary in
  extreme cases against nations found guilty of violating the
  Covenant. We regard it, however, as a last and if these cases do
  arise, we are convinced that such force must not be employed
  until it can be established beyond doubt that an act of violence
  or aggression has been committed, and then only when the guilt of
  the alleged aggressor is universally acknowledged.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the meaning of Article 10 and of
  Articles 12, 13, 15, and 16 of the Covenant of the League of
  Nations in no way contradicts the interpretation we have placed
  upon them. Our American friends have voiced the fear that Article
  10 could involve their country in military operations to which it
  would not have given its consent. To be sure, Article 10 provides
  a general guarantee preserving the integrity of the territories
  of each nation<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>. But none of
  the articles that follow permits us to conclude that any nation
  could find itself suddenly involved against its will in a
  military operation without the explicit consent of the agencies
  which embody its national sovereignty.</p>

  <p>In connection with the difficult problem of
  limitation of armaments neither the Council nor the Assembly has
  ever believed it possible to enact relevant statutes without the
  express support of every nation. Each nation remains free to
  define and determine the conditions necessary to its internal or
  external security. In the same way, each nation remains free to
  give or to withhold its consent to any concerted military action.
  In the final analysis, the one penalty which can result from the
  provisions of the Covenant is the loss of the benefits of
  membership in the League of Nations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We may be sure that nations will not become
  attuned in one day to the basic truths which we have tried to
  define. This will take time and unceasing propaganda, as well as
  clear evidence of the advantages of association.</p>

  <p>We are concerned here with the only kind-of
  propaganda which is truly successful, which - to borrow an
  expression which has often been used in an execrable sense, and
  which we would now like to restore to its better and more
  edifying connotation - might be called: the propaganda of fact.
  The fact which we have to impress upon everyone's mind, a fact
  powerful enough to triumph over prejudice, to overcome all
  resistance and disarm any ill will, is the actual fact of
  international life itself.</p>

  <p>Even now there exists in the world an
  international way of life so powerful and so complex that nobody
  can avoid its effects. The protection of public health, the
  provision of transport facilities, the lowering of customs
  barriers, the creation of an international credit organization -
  all these are aspects of internationalism from which no nation,
  however powerful, can claim to be dissociated. In spite of her
  size, her extensive industrial and commercial influence, America
  has suffered no less from unemployment than have the nations of
  Europe. We have only to recall the terrible effects of
  speculation on the currency exchange to see how impossible it now
  is to set up anywhere in the world a watertight bulkhead against
  the flow of international movements.</p>

  <p>Exemplifying the necessity of the
  international way of life by devising instruments for such a
  life, learning to live together with men of different nations and
  different races, and highlighting the universal phenomenon of the
  solidarity of nations and of men - these will constitute the
  best, the most effective, and the most persuasive lesson it is
  possible to imagine.</p>

  <p>A lesson concerned with such facts would be
  invaluable. It is not, however, irrelevant to add another.
  Propaganda must be organized in all civilized countries to
  impress upon public opinion the true purpose of the League of
  Nations, the limitations of its power, the true respect which it
  holds for the laws and the sovereignty of states, that is to say,
  for the nations themselves, and at the same time the great moral
  power it wields in the world through the certitude of its
  principles.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there are already in nearly
  all nations large associations which disseminate these teachings
  far and wide, cutting through political bias to the very heart of
  popular sentiment.</p>

  <p>One of the latest creations of the League
  of Nations bears this significant title: intellectual
  cooperation<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. A committee
  composed of the most eminent scholars, men of vast learning and
  brilliant intellect, was set up at one of our recent sessions.
  Its name is full of promise.</p>

  <p>What is intellectual cooperation if not the
  pooling of all intellectual resources for mutual and equitable
  exchange, just as material and political interests are pooled?
  All living organisms must have a driving force, a moving spirit.
  From all these diverse forces arising from nations and races, is
  it not possible to give birth to a communal soul, to a common
  science for a communal life, associating but not absorbing the
  traditions and hopes of every country in a concerted thrust for
  justice?</p>

  <p>To climb by all roads originating from all
  points of the world to the pinnacle where the law of man itself
  holds sway in sovereign rhythm - is this not the ultimate end of
  mankind's painful and centuries-long ascent of Calvary?</p>

  <p>To be sure, many years of trial must yet
  elapse, and many retrogressions yet occur before the rumble of
  human passions common to all men yields to silence; but if the
  road toward the final goal is clearly marked, if an organization
  like the League of Nations realizes its potential and achieves
  its purpose, the potent benefits of peace and of human solidarity
  will triumph over evil. This at least we may dare to hope for;
  and, if we will consider how far we have come since the dawn of
  history, then our hope will gather strength enough to become a
  true and unshakable faith.</p>
