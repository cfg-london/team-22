  <h1>Max Theiler - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="theiler.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Max
  Theiler</b> was born on January 30, 1899, in Pretoria, South
  Africa, one of the four children of Sir Arnold and Emma
  (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jegge) Theiler. His father was a well-known
  veterinary scientist. He attended local schools except for one
  year in Basle, Switzerland (his father was of Swiss origin), then
  went on to Rhodes
  University College, Grahamstown and the University of
  Capetown Medical School (1916-1918). He then went to England to
  study at St. Thomas' Hospital and at the London School of
  Tropical Medicine, receiving his medical degree in 1922. In
  the same year he became a Licentiate of the Royal College of
  Physicians and a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
  <br>
  In 1922 he joined the Department of Tropical Medicine at the
  Harvard
  Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, first as an assistant,
  then being appointed instructor. In 1930 he joined the staff of
  the International Health Division of the Rockefeller
  Foundation, becoming, in 1951, Director of Laboratories of
  the Rockefeller Foundation's Division of Medicine and Public
  Health, New York.<br>
  <br>
  His early work, at Harvard, dealt with amoebic dysentery and rat
  bite fever. He also worked on the problem of yellow fever, a
  subject in which he had become interested whilst still in London.
  This was to become his major interest. By 1927 he and his
  colleagues had proved that the cause of yellow fever was not a
  bacterium but a filterable virus. He also demonstrated that the
  disease could be readily transmitted to mice. Previously,
  laboratory work on this topic had been done using monkeys as
  experimental animals; the use of mice enabled the cost of such
  research to be greatly reduced. In 1930, when he joined the
  Rockefeller Foundation, that body was engaged in a broad attack
  on the problem of yellow fever. Here, Theiler and his colleagues
  worked on vaccines against the disease and eventually developed a
  safe, standardized vaccine, 17D, one advantage of which was its
  ready adaptability to mass production.<br>
  <br>
  His other work for the Institute has been connected with the
  causes and immunology of certain disorders which include Weil's
  disease. He has also been engaged in research on dengue fever and
  Japanese encephalitis. The problem of poliomyelitis has been of
  great interest to him and he discovered an apparently identical
  disorder in laboratory mice which is now sometimes called
  Theiler's disease (encephalomyelitis).<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Theiler has been a contributor to two books, <i>Viral and
  Rickettsial Infections of Man</i> (1948) and <i>Yellow Fever</i>
  (1951). He has also written numerous papers in <i>The American
  Journal of Tropical Medicine</i> and <i>Annals of Tropical
  Medicine and Parasitology.</i><br>
  <br>
  Honours awarded to him include the Chalmer's Medal of the Royal
  Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (London, 1939), the
  Flattery Medal (Harvard, 1945), and the Lasker Award of the
  Lasker Foundation (1949).<br>
  <br>
  He married Lillian Graham in 1928. They have one daughter.</p>
