  <h1>Marshall W. Nirenberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nirenberg.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Marshall Warren Nirenberg</b> was born
  in New York City on April 10th, 1927, the son of Harry and
  Minerva Nirenberg. The family moved to Orlando, Florida in 1939.
  He early developed an interest in biology. In 1948 he received a
  B. Sc. degree, and in 1952, a M. Sc. degree in Zoology from the
  University of
  Florida at Gainesville. His dissertation for the Master's
  thesis was an ecological and taxonomic study of caddis flies
  (Trichoptera).<br>
  <br>
  During this period he became interested in biochemistry. He
  continued studies in this field at the University of
  Michigan, Ann Arbor, and in 1957 received the Ph. D. degree
  from the Department of Biological Chemistry. Nirenberg's thesis,
  performed under the guidance of Dr. James Hogg, was a study of a
  permease for hexose transport in ascites tumor cells.<br>
  <br>
  From 1957 to 1959 he obtained postdoctoral training with DeWitt
  Stetten Jr., and with William Jakoby at the National Institutes of
  Health as a fellow of the American Cancer society. During the next year
  he held a Public Health Service Fellowship and in 1960 became a
  research biochemist in the Section of Metabolic Enzymes, headed
  by Dr. Gordon Tompkins, at the National Institutes of
  Health.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959 he began to study the steps that relate DNA, RNA and
  protein. These investigations led to the demonstration with H.
  Matthaei that messenger RNA is required for protein synthesis and
  that synthetic messenger RNA preparations can be used to decipher
  various aspects of the genetic code.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 he became head of the Section of Biochemical Genetics at
  the National Institutes of Health.<br>
  <br>
  Nirenberg holds honorary degrees from the University of Michigan,
  Yale
  University, University of Chicago, University of
  Windsor (Ontario) and Harvard University. Other honours include:
  The Molecular Biology Award, National Academy of Sciences, 1962;
  Paul Lewis Award in Enzyme Chemistry, American Chemical Society,
  1964; The National Medal of Science, 1965; The Research
  Corporation Award, 1966; the Hildebrand Award, 1966; the Gairdner
  Foundation Award of Merit, 1967; The Prix Charles Leopold Meyer,
  French Academy of Sciences, 1967; the Joseph Priestly Award,
  1968; and the Franklin Medal, 1968. The Louisa Gross Horwitz
  Prize, Columbia University, and the Lasker Award were shared with
  <a href="index.html">H. G. Khorana</a> in 1968. He is a member of
  the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  He was married in 1961 to Perola Zaltzman, a chemist from the
  University of
  Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. She is now a biochemist at the
  National Institutes of Health.</p>
