  <h1>Giorgos Seferis - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="seferis.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Giorgos Seferis</b> was born in Smyrna,
  Asia Minor, in 1900. He attended school in Smyrna and finished
  his studies at the Gymnasium in Athens. When his family moved to
  Paris in 1918, Seferis studied law at the University of Paris and
  became interested in literature. He returned to Athens in 1925
  and was admitted to the Royal Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs
  in the following year. This was the beginning of a long and
  successful diplomatic career, during which he held posts in
  England (1931-1934) and Albania (1936-1938 ). During the Second
  World War, Seferis accompanied the Free Greek Government in exile
  to Crete, Egypt, South Africa, and Italy, and returned to
  liberated Athens in 1944. He continued to serve in the Ministry
  of Foreign Affairs and held diplomatic posts in Ankara
  (1948-1950) and London (1951-1953). He was appointed minister to
  Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq (1953-1956), and was Royal Greek
  Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1961, the last post
  before his retirement in Athens. Seferis received many honours
  and prizes, among them honorary doctoral degrees from the
  universities of Cambridge (1960), Oxford (1964), Salonika (1964), and Princeton
  (1965).<br>

  His wide travels provide the backdrop and colour for much of
  Seferis's writing, which is filled with the themes of alienation,
  wandering, and death. Seferis's early poetry consists of
  <i>Strophe</i> (Turning Point), 1931, a group of rhymed Lyrics
  strongly influenced by the Symbolists, and <i>E Sterna</i> (The
  Cistern), 1932, conveying an image of man's most deeply felt
  being which lies hidden from, and ignored by, the everyday world.
  His mature poetry, in which one senses an awareness of the
  presence of the past and particularly of Greece's great past as
  related to her present, begins with <i>Mythistorema</i>
  (Mythistorema), 1935, a series of twenty-four short poems which
  translate the Odyssean myths into modern idiom. In <i>Tetradio
  Gymnasmaton</i> (Book of Exercises), 1940, <i>Emerologio
  Katastromatos</i> (Logbook I), 1940, <i>Emerologio Katastromatos
  B</i> (Logbook II), 1944, <i>Kihle</i> (Thrush), 1947, and
  <i>Emerologio Katastromatos C</i> (Logbook III), 1955, Seferis is
  preoccupied with the themes he developed in <i>Mythistorema</i>,
  using Homer's Odyssey as his symbolic source; however, in "The
  King of Asine" (in Logbook I), considered by many critics his
  finest poem, the source is a single reference in the <i>Iliad</i>
  to this all-but-forgotten king. The recent book of poetry,
  <i>Tria Krypha Poiemata</i> (Three Secret Poems), 1966, consists
  of twenty-eight short lyric pieces verging on the
  surrealistic.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to poetry, Seferis has published a book of essays,
  <i>Dokimes</i> (Essays), 1962, translations of works by <a href=
  "../1948/index.html">T.S. Eliot</a>, and a collection of
  translations from American, English, and French poets entitled
  <i>Antigrafes</i> (Copies), 1965. Seferis's collected poems
  (1924-1955) have appeared both in a Greek edition (Athens, 1965)
  and in an American one with translations <i>en face</i>
  (Princeton, 1967).</p>
