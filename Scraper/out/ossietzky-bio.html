  <h1>Carl von Ossietzky - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ossietzky.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Carl
  von Ossietzky</b> (October 3, 1889-May 4, 1938) was born in
  Hamburg, though his father, a civil servant, had originally come
  from a village near the German-Polish border. Seven years after
  Ossietzky's father died in 1891, his mother married Gustav
  Walther, a Social Democrat, who was influential in shaping
  Ossietzky's later political attitudes.<br>
  <br>
  Ossietzky's academic achievement being uneven, he left school at
  the age of seventeen to become an administrative civil servant in
  his native city. He soon turned to journalism, the profession in
  which he was to make a career, his first work appearing in <i>Das
  Freie Volk</i> [The Free People], the weekly organ of the
  Demokratische Vereinigung [Democratic Union]. On July 5, 1913, an
  article by Ossietzky criticizing a pro-military court decision in
  Erfurt drew charges of &laquo;insult to the common good&raquo; from
  the Prussian War Ministry. When Ossietzky was called to make a
  court appearance some time after his marriage on May 22, 1914, to
  the Englishwoman Maud Woods, his young wife secretly made
  arrangements to pay his fine.<br>
  <br>
  Though Ossietzky's health was poor, he was called up for military
  service in June, 1916, with the Bavarian Pioneer Regiment. After
  the war, Ossietzky, now a confirmed pacifist as well as democrat,
  returned to Hamburg where he stirred public opinion by speeches
  on his doctrine of educating people to a &laquo;peace
  mentality&raquo;, became president of the local chapter of the
  German Peace Society, and founded <i>Der Wegweiser</i> [The
  Signpost], an enterprise which soon failed because of lack of
  financial backing.<br>
  <br>
  Ossietzky then accepted an appointment as secretary of the German
  Peace Society, with headquarters in Berlin. There he created the
  monthly <i>Mitteilungsblatt</i> [Information Sheet], which
  appeared first on January 1, 1920, and became a regular
  contributor to <i>Monisten Monatsheften</i> [Monists' Monthly],
  using the pseudonym &laquo;Thomas Murner&raquo;<sup><a href=
  "#not_1">1</a></sup>. A man of intense temperament, Ossietzky
  soon tired of the office work of the German Peace Society and
  accepted the post of foreign editor on the staff of the
  <i>Berliner Volkszeitung</i> [Berlin People's Paper], a paper
  whose editorial policy was nonpartisan, democratic, and
  antiwar.<br>
  <br>
  Ossietzky had a brief flirtation with politics in 1923-1924 when
  the entire editorial staff of the <i>Berliner Volkszeitung</i>
  became involved in the founding of a new party, the Republican
  Party. After the defeat which the party suffered in the Reichstag
  election of May, 1924, Ossietzky joined the political weekly
  <i>Tagebuch</i> [Journal], revealing in his contributions to that
  periodical a disillusionment with his own political efforts and
  some skepticism about the wisdom of the masses<sup><a href=
  "#not_2">2</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1926 Siegfried Jacobsohn, founder and editor of <i>Die
  Weltb&uuml;hne</i> [The World Stage], offered Ossietzky a
  position on his editorial staff. Jacobsohn had already become
  involved in efforts to uncover and publicize the secret
  rearmament of Germany, and Carl von Ossietzky was to continue
  this unpopular editorial policy, for Jacobsohn died unexpectedly
  in December, 1926, and shortly thereafter his widow named
  Ossietzky editor-in-chief. In March, 1927, <i>Die
  Weltb&uuml;hne</i> published an article by Berthold
  Jacob<sup><a href="#not_3">3</a></sup> which criticized the
  Reichswehr for condoning paramilitary organizations. Ossietzky,
  as the editor responsible, was tried for libel, found guilty, and
  sentenced to one month in prison.<br>
  <br>
  Refusing to be intimidated, he published in March, 1929, an
  article by Walter Kreiser which was, in effect, part of a
  campaign by Ossietzky of opposition to secret German rearmament
  in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. At a hearing in August,
  1929, Ossietzky was charged with betrayal of military secrets,
  was tried in November, 1931, found guilty, sentenced to eighteen
  months in Spandau Prison, and released after seven months in the
  Christmas amnesty of 1932.<br>
  <br>
  By early 1933, Ossietzky, more clear-sighted than his optimistic
  colleagues' recognized the gravity of the political situation in
  Germany, but he refused to leave the country, saying that a man
  speaks with a hollow voice from across the border. On February
  28, 1933, the morning after the Reichstag fire, Ossietzky was
  apprehended at home by the secret police, sent to a Berlin
  prison, then to concentration camps, first at Sonnenburg and
  later at Esterwegen-Papenburg. In these camps, according to
  reports from fellow prisoners, he was mistreated, even forced to
  perform heavy labor although he had already sustained a heart
  attack.<br>
  <br>
  Ossietzky's candidacy for the Peace Prize was first suggested in
  1934. Berthold Jacob, a companion in many a cause, may have been
  the first to formulate an actual plan to secure the nomination.
  The idea was taken up by his colleagues in the German League for
  Human Rights<sup><a href="#not_4">4</a></sup>, by Hellmut von
  Gerlach, a former associate on <i>Die Weltb&uuml;hne</i> who
  undertook a letterwriting campaign from Paris, by organizations
  and famous people in many parts of the world. The nomination for
  1934 arrived too late; the prize for 1935 was reserved in that
  year but in 1936 was voted to Ossietzky.<br>
  <br>
  At this point, Ossietzky, ill with tuberculosis, had little time
  left to live, but the government refused to release him from the
  concentration camp and demanded that he decline the Nobel Prize,
  a demand that Ossietzky did not honor. The German Propaganda
  Ministry declared publicly that Ossietzky was free to go to
  Norway to accept the prize, but secret police documents indicate
  that Ossietzky was refused a passport, and, although allowed to
  enter a civilian hospital, was kept under constant surveillance
  until his death in May, 1938.<br>
  <br>
  The German press was forbidden to comment on the granting of the
  prize to Ossietzky, and the German government decreed that in the
  future no German could accept any Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  Ossietzky's last public appearance was at a short court hearing
  at which his lawyer was sentenced to two years at hard labor for
  embezzling most of Ossietzky's prize money.</p>
