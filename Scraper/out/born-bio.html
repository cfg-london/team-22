  <h1>Max Born - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="born.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Max Born</b> was born in Breslau on
  the 11th December, 1882, to Professor Gustav Born, anatomist and
  embryologist, and his wife Margarete, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kauffmann,
  who was a member of a Silesian family of industrialists.<br>
  <br>
  Max attended the K&ouml;nig Wilhelm's Gymnasium in Breslau and
  continued his studies at the Universities of Breslau (where the
  well-known mathematician Rosanes introduced him to matrix
  calculus), Heidelberg, Zurich (here he was deeply impressed by
  Hurwitz's lectures on higher analysis), and G&ouml;ttingen. In
  the latter seat of learning he read mathematics chiefly, sitting
  under Klein, Hilbert, Minkowski, and Runge, but also studied
  astronomy under Schwarzschild, and physics under Voigt. He was
  awarded the Prize of the Philosophical Faculty of the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen for his work on the stability of elastic wires
  and tapes in 1906, and graduated at this university a year later
  on the basis of this work.<br>
  <br>
  Born next went to Cambridge for a short time, to study under
  Larmor and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J.
  Thomson</a>. Back in Breslau during the years 1908-1909, he
  worked with the physicists Lummer and Pringsheim, and also
  studied the theory of relativity. On the strength of one of his
  papers, Minkowski invited his collaboration at G&ouml;ttingen but
  soon after his return there, in the winter of 1909, Minkowski
  died. He had then the task of sifting Minkowski's literary works
  in the field of physics and of publishing some uncompleted
  papers. Soon he became an academic lecturer at G&ouml;ttingen in
  recognition of his work on the relativistic electron. He accepted
  Michelson's invitation to lecture on relativity in Chicago (1912)
  and while there he did some experiments with the Michelson
  grating spectrograph.<br>
  <br>
  An appointment as professor (extraordinarius) to assist <a href=
  "../1918/index.html">Max Planck</a> at Berlin University came to
  Born in 1915 but he had to join the German Armed Forces. In a
  scientific office of the army he worked on the theory of sound
  ranging. He found time also to study the theory of crystals, and
  published his first book, <i>Dynamik der Kristallgitter</i>
  (Dynamics of Crystal Lattices), which summarized a series of
  investigations he had started at G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
  <br>
  At the conclusion of the First World War, in 1919, Born was
  appointed Professor at the University of Frankfurt-on-Main, where a
  laboratory was put at his disposal. His assistant was <a href=
  "../1943/index.html">Otto Stern</a>, and the first of the
  latter's well-known experiments, which later were rewarded with a
  Nobel Prize, originated there.<br>
  <br>
  Max Born went to G&ouml;ttingen as Professor in 1921, at the same
  time as <a href="../1925/index.html">James Franck</a>, and he
  remained there for twelve years, interrupted only by a trip to
  America in 1925. During these years the Professor's most
  important works were created; first a modernized version of his
  book on crystals, and numerous investigations by him and his
  pupils on crystal lattices, followed by a series of studies on
  the quantum theory. Among his collaborators at this time were
  many physicists, later to become well-known, such as <a href=
  "../1945/index.html">Pauli</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a>, Jordan,
  <a href="../1938/index.html">Fermi</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a>, Hund, Hylleraas,
  Weisskopf, Oppenheimer, Joseph Mayer and <a href=
  "../1963/index.html">Maria Goeppert-Mayer</a>. During the years
  1925 and 1926 he published, with Heisenberg and Jordan,
  investigations on the principles of quantum mechanics (matrix
  mechanics) and soon after this, his own studies on the
  statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics.<br>
  <br>
  As were so many other German scientists, he was forced to
  emigrate in 1933 and was invited to Cambridge, where he taught
  for three years as Stokes Lecturer. His main sphere of work
  during this period was in the field of nonlinear electrodynamics,
  which he developed in collaboration with Infeld.<br>
  <br>
  During the winter of 1935-1936 Born spent six months in Bangalore
  at the Indian Institute of Science, where he worked with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1930/index.html">Sir C.V. Raman</a> and his
  pupils. In 1936 he was appointed Tait Professor of Natural
  Philosophy in Edinburgh, where he worked until his retirement in
  1953. He is now living at the small spa town, Bad Pyrmont.<br>
  <br>
  Max Born has been awarded fellowships of many academies -
  G&ouml;ttingen, Moscow, Berlin, Bangalore, Bucharest, Edinburgh,
  London, Lima, Dublin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Washington, and
  Boston, and he has received honorary doctorates from Bristol,
  Bordeaux, Oxford, Freiburg/Breisgau, Edinburgh, Oslo, Brussels
  Universities, Humboldt University Berlin, and Technical
  University Stuttgart. He holds the Stokes Medal of Cambridge, the
  Max Planck Medaille der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft
  (i.e. of the German Physical Society); the Hughes Medal of the
  Royal Society, London, the Hugo Grotius Medal for International
  Law, and was also awarded the MacDougall-Brisbane Prize and the
  Gunning-Victoria Jubilee Prize of the Royal Society, Edinburgh.
  In 1953 he was made honorary citizen of the town of
  G&ouml;ttingen and a year later was granted the Nobel Prize for
  Physics. He was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit with Star of the
  Order of Merit of the German Federal Republic in 1959.<br>
  <br>
  The year 1913 saw his marriage to Hedwig, <i>n&eacute;e</i>
  Ehrenberg, and there are three children of the marriage.</p>
