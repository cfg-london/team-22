  <h2>The Rare Gases of the Atmosphere</h2>

  <p>The discoveries which have gained for me
  the supreme honour of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry appear to me
  to have been the result of causes only partially within my
  control; and as it is one of the rules of the Academy, of which I
  have to thank you for admitting me to the membership, to require
  a curriculum vitae, it has appeared to me not inopportune if, in
  giving a sketch of my work on the rare gases of the atmosphere, I
  trace the sequence of events which led to their
  investigation.</p>

  <p>My grandfather on my father's side, William
  Ramsay, was a chemical manufacturer in Glasgow; he came of a long
  line of dyers, who carried on their work in Haddington, a small
  country town in the east of Scotland. He was the first, I
  believe, to distil wood for the production of pyroligneous acid;
  and he purified it by "torrefying" the acetate of lime formed by
  its neutralization, and distilling with oil of vitriol. He also
  was the first to manufacture bichrome; and for many years, he and
  his partners, the Messrs. Turnbull, made "Turnbull's blue".</p>

  <p>My mother's father was a medical man,
  practising in Edinburgh. He was the author of a series of
  textbooks for medical students, one of which was entitled
  Colloquia Chymica. Hence, I inherited the taste for chemistry
  from my ancestors on both sides of the family.</p>

  <p>While I was an assistant in Glasgow University,
  in 1879, it occurred to me that an easy method of determining the
  volumes of liquids at their boiling points and consequently their
  molecular volumes would be to use their own vapours, coming from
  the liquids boiling under atmospheric pressure, as a means of
  securing the desired temperature. A simple modification of this
  plan made it possible to obtain a range of temperatures by
  altering the pressure under which the liquid boiled. This device
  led to a study of the critical phenomena of liquids; for by
  employing vapours as heating agents, great uniformity of
  temperature could be secured. In this work, which was carried out
  at Bristol, where I was Professor of Chemistry from 1880 till
  1887, my assistant and collaborator was Sydney Young. On my
  removal to London in that year, the problem of the adiabatic
  behaviour of liquids and gases suggested itself; the ratio of the
  specific heat at constant volume to that at constant pressure was
  measured in the year 1892, with the assistance of Dr. E. Perman;
  but an account of the results was not published till 1896; the
  method employed, that of Kundt and Warburg, gave adiabatic curves
  for ethyl ether, both in the liquid and the gaseous state.</p>

  <p>Before leaving Bristol, I had carried out
  some experiments in connection with the combination of gaseous
  nitrogen with hydrogen and with oxygen, with the aid of platinum
  as a catalysing agent; the results of the research were negative,
  and were not published. But I must have read the well-known
  account of Cavendish's classical experiment on the combination of
  the nitrogen and the oxygen of the air at that date; for in my
  copy of Cavendish's life, published by the Cavendish Society in
  1849, opposite his statement that on passing electric sparks
  through a mixture of nitrogen with excess of oxygen, he had
  obtained a small residue, amounting to not more than 1/125th of
  the whole, I find that I had written the words "look into this ".
  It must have been the latent memory of this circumstance which
  led me, in 1894, to suggest to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Lord Rayleigh</a> a reason
  for the high density which he had found for "atmospheric
  nitrogen".</p>

  <p>With the discovery and properties of argon
  I do not propose to deal. Hence, I pass on to the discovery of
  terrestrial helium and of its congeners.</p>

  <p>One of the most characteristic properties,
  or rather want of properties of argon is its forming no
  compounds; a circumstance which led to the choice of its name. It
  had been observed by Dr. Hillebrand, one of the chemists to the
  Geological Survey of the United States, that certain minerals,
  notably those containing uranium, gave off a gas when heated with
  dilute sulphuric acid. I was told recently that the investigators
  of this gas observed in its spectrum certain unknown lines; but
  they were deterred by the criticism of their colleagues from
  attaching much importance to the observation. The spectrum
  contained the usual bands of nitrogen, and they contended
  themselves with chronicling this observation. The evolution of
  this gas from a rare mineral struck me as likely to afford a clue
  to the direction in which to seek for a compound of argon; for it
  appeared not unlikely that the gas examined by Hillebrand might
  turn out to be argon, mixed with nitrogen. But on examining the
  gas, a brilliant yellow line was observed, nearly, though not
  quite identical in position with the double line of sodium.
  Reference to a list of spectrum lines established the coincidence
  of the new line with a line which had been first observed in the
  solar spectrum by P.J.C Janssen, during an eclipse of the sun, to
  observe which an expedition had been sent to India in 1868. It
  was suspected by Frankland and Lockyer that the line was due to
  hydrogen; but no means was found of causing that element to show
  such a line. They therefore came to the conclusion that it must
  be due to the presence in the solar atmosphere of an element
  unknown on the earth; and they gave it the name "helium", to
  suggest its solar origin. Shortly afterwards, Langlet, working in
  Cleve's laboratory, discovered helium independently.</p>

  <p>Helium, like argon, is a gas, sparingly
  soluble in water, withstanding the action of oxygen in presence
  of caustic soda, under the influence of the electric discharge,
  as well as of red-hot magnesium. Like argon, the ratio of its
  specific heat at constant volume to that at constant pressure
  shows it to be a monatomic element, the atom and the molecule
  being the same; and its density was found both by Langlet and
  myself to be nearly 2; it is therefore the lightest gas known,
  with the exception of hydrogen. These properties in common made
  it evident that helium and argon belong to the same natural
  family; and it was also obvious that there must exist at least
  three other elements of the same class; this is evident on
  inspection of the periodic table where the following elements are
  in apposition: In the belief that these elements would be
  discovered, I predicted, in the Presidential Address which I gave
  to the Chemical Section of the British Association when it met in
  Canada in 1897, the discovery of " a new element". I thought it
  well to be on the safe side; and the necessity of an element with
  the atomic weight 20 was evident, although it might have been
  maintained with almost equal probability that two other awaited
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Dr. Travers, then my assistant, now my
  successor in the Bristol chair, was kind enough to lend his help
  in the search for this new gas. We made a plan of campaign which
  was strictly adhered to, and which resulted in success. First, we
  investigated the gases evolved from every mineral which we could
  obtain; and the authorities of the British Museum were so good as
  to place a large number of specimens at our disposal. Second,
  various meteorites were heated, and their gases examined
  spectroscopically, after removing those gases which could be
  induced to enter into combination. Third, Dr. Travers and I made
  an expedition to Cauterets in the Pyrenees, and I collected gases
  from the hot springs in Iceland, and in addition, gases from
  various English and Scottish mineral springs were investigated.
  Fourth, about four litres of helium were prepared from
  fergusonite; and this gas was fractionally diffused during about
  three months, in the hope of obtaining heavier fractions, which
  might contain the looked-for gases; for they would certainly
  betray themselves by their spectra, if present. Fifth, a similar
  set of diffusions was carried out with argon, though not to the
  same extent; for by that time we had other facilities. Sixth,
  about 15 litres of argon was prepared, with the intention of
  submitting it to fractional distillation; for, in the meantime,
  Dr. Hampson was working at his excellent machine for liquefying
  air, and he kept me informed of his progress.</p>

  <p>The carrying out of this long programme
  occupied me a large part of the years 1896 and 1897; the 15
  litres of argon was prepared after Christmas, 1897. The results
  of these attempts to detect a new gas may be disposed of in a few
  words. First, those minerals which contain the elements uranium
  and thorium yielded helium in small quantity; but in no case were
  we certain of a new line in the spectrum of that element, with
  which, it may be remarked, we became almost painfully familiar.
  The only mineral which yielded a gas containing argon was
  malacone, a silicate of zirconium. Second, only one meteorite,
  from Augusta County, Virginia, U.S.A., gave inactive gases; both
  argon and helium were found. Third, the Cauterets gases contained
  both helium and argon; but although they were fractionated,
  nothing new could be discovered. It has since turned out,
  however, that the water from the Bath springs contains neon.
  Fourth, the diffusion of helium yielded a small residue in which
  only the familiar lines of argon could be detected; but again,
  the use of liquid hydrogen has made it possible to cool a large
  quantity of helium to a very low temperature, and the condensed
  portion has been found to exhibit the spectrum of krypton. Fifth,
  the diffusion of argon resulted in the accumulation of two
  fractions, one of which was slightly more dense than the other;
  and this, although we now know that the difference must have been
  due to errors of experiment, afforded us at the time a little
  encouragement.</p>

  <p>While the 15 litres of argon was being
  purified, Dr. Hampson had succeeded in perfecting his machine;
  and he placed at our disposal about a litre of liquid air. After
  "playing" with it, so as to familiarize ourselves with its
  properties, there remained in the vessel about 100 cubic
  centimetres. I suggested that we should allow this portion to
  evaporate almost entirely away, and that we should collect the
  last 10 cubic centimetres by allowing it to boil off into a
  gas-holder. This was done; and after removal of oxygen and
  nitrogen, there remained 26 cubic centimetres of a gas which
  showed, besides the spectrum of argon, a bright yellow and a
  bright green line, of wavelengths 5571 and 5570.5, respectively.
  Although the density of the new gas, which we named "krypton" or
  "hidden" was found to be only 22.5, we conjectured that, when
  purified, it would turn out to be forty times as heavy as
  hydrogen, implying the atomic weight 80, for our early
  experiments established the fact that, like argon, its molecular
  and atomic weights were identical.</p>

  <p>An account of this discovery was
  communicated to the Royal Society on June 3rd, 1898; and no time
  was lost in examining the argon by liquefaction and fractional
  distillation. On June 13th, we were able to announce that the
  lower boiling portions of the 15 litres of argon contained a gas
  which we called "neon " or "new"; it showed a spectrum
  characterized by a brilliant flame-coloured light, consisting of
  many red, orange, and yellow lines. A preliminary determination
  of its density yielded the number 14.7, and after one
  fractionation, the density decreased to 13.7. We were at this
  time misled in supposing that a second gas was present, showing a
  spectrum different from that of argon, but possessing almost the
  same density; we regarded it as bearing to argon the same
  relation as that of nickel to cobalt; and we christened it
  "metargon". This gas subsequently turned out to be argon in the
  main, but to contain carbon monoxide, owing to the use of an
  impure specimen of phosphorus containing carbon in removing the
  oxygen; but it gave us a great deal of trouble to make sure that
  it was not a new individual.</p>

  <p>Kellas, working in my laboratory, and
  Schloesing, in Paris, had independently determined the amount of
  argon in the air; they found almost identical numbers - 0.01183
  (Schloesing) and 0.01186 (Kellas) part by volume in 1 part of
  "atmospheric" nitrogen.</p>

  <p>The separation of the lighter and heavier
  gases from argon gave occasion for a re-determination of the
  density of argon, using a pure sample. While the crude argon
  prepared by withdrawing the nitrogen from "atmospheric" nitrogen
  by the electric flame was found to have the density 19.94, and by
  the use of red-hot magnesium 19.941, the density of the purified
  sample gave the number 19.95. The refractivity, however, shows a
  greater difference; for the admixture of helium and neon in the
  crude sample lowers the refractivity from 0.9665 for the pure gas
  to 0.961 or 0.960.</p>

  <p>In September, 1898, the discovery of
  another gas was announced; it was separated from krypton by
  fractionation, and possessed a still higher boiling point. We
  named it "xenon" or the "stranger". And during the next two
  years, Travers and I prepared a larger quantity of these gases,
  and purified them by fractionation; while Baly erected an
  apparatus for the accurate determination of the wavelengths of
  their spectral lines.</p>

  <p>We procured from the "Brin" Oxygen Company
  one of Hampson's airliquefiers, and from the Whitehead Torpedo
  Company, one of their compressors; the latter was driven
  electrically, by means of a S-horse-power motor. The motor has
  since been replaced by a more powerful one; but the compressor
  and liquefier have given no trouble, and still work as
  satisfactorily as when first purchased. In ten minutes after
  starting, without any preliminary cooling, liquid air begins to
  run; and the yield is over a litre an hour. By help of this
  machine, air was so fractionated as to furnish portions rich in
  the gases which we wished to investigate. The process was as
  follows. The air-liquefier furnished a supply of liquid air; the
  gas escaping from the liquefier consisted largely of nitrogen;
  this mixture was liquefied under pressure in a bulb cooled by the
  liquid air boiling under reduced pressure. When the bulb had been
  filled with liquid nitrogen, a current of air was blown through
  the liquid until some of the gas had evaporated. That gas was
  collected separately, and deprived of oxygen by passage over
  red-hot copper; it contained the major part of the neon and
  helium present in the air. The remainder of the nitrogen was
  added to the liquid air used for cooling the bulb in which the
  nitrogen was condensed. Having obtained a considerable quantity
  of this light nitrogen, it was purified from that gas in the
  usual manner, and the argon containing neon and helium was
  fractionated. By fractional distillation, it was possible to
  remove the greater portion of the helium and neon from this
  mixture of gases, leaving the argon behind.</p>

  <p>The air used in these fractionations was
  allowed to evaporate in vacuum vessels, during the operations;
  but care was always taken to save the dregs, and collect them in
  a gas-holder. In this way, a large quantity of the heavier
  portions of the air was accumulated; we estimated the quantity of
  air thus concentrated as not less than 30 litres of liquid. After
  removal of oxygen and nitrogen, the argon was separated for the
  most part by fractional distillation, and the residue of crude
  krypton and xenon purified by repeated fractionation. While
  krypton has a considerable vapour pressure at the temperature of
  boiling air, the vapour pressure of xenon is hardly appreciable;
  hence their separation, although tedious, presented no particular
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>It was otherwise with neon. It soon
  transpired that the neon was contaminated with helium, and many
  attempts were made to effect a separation, before they were
  crowned with success. Among these, was fractional solution in
  oxygen, followed by a systematic diffusion of the two gases; but
  it was not found possible to raise the density of the neon above
  the number 9-16, and its spectrum still showed helium lines.
  Neither neon nor helium can be liquefied by cooling with liquid
  air, and it soon became evident that without the aid of liquid
  hydrogen, no further progress could be made.</p>

  <p>Dr. Travers therefore undertook, with the
  assistance of Mr. Holding, the laboratory mechanic, to construct
  an apparatus for liquefying hydrogen; and in doing this, he had
  to start from first principles, for no account had been published
  of the process. After two months' work, a machine was produced,
  in which the hydrogen, after preliminary cooling with liquid air,
  entered a chamber in which air boiled at low pressure, at a
  temperature of -205&deg;. This degree of cold was sufficient to
  carry it below the critical temperature for the development of
  the positive Joule-Thomson effect; so that, when it was allowed
  to expand, after traversing a regenerative coil it ran out in the
  liquid form.</p>

  <p>With this powerful agent to help us, the
  separation was effected in less than an hour. The mixture of
  helium and neon, compressed into a bulb cooled with liquid
  hydrogen, deposited the neon in the liquid, or more probably in
  the solid state; the vapour pressure of liquid neon at that low
  temperature is not more than 17 millimetres of mercury; while
  helium is permanently gaseous. It was easy, therefore, to purify
  the neon from helium; though it would have been a difficult task
  to purify the helium from neon.</p>

  <p>That these are all monatomic gases was
  proved by determining the ratio of their specific heats by
  Kundt's method; and accurate determinations were made of their
  refractivities, their densities, their compressibilities at two
  temperatures, 11.2&deg; and 237.3&deg;; and the vapour
  pressures of argon, krypton, and xenon were determined, as well
  as their volumes at their boiling points, in the liquid state.
  The critical temperatures and pressures of the last three were
  also determined. It may be stated in general terms that these
  gases show a regular gradation of properties, from helium to
  xenon; and that they fill the gaps in the periodic table below
  and above argon, with the atomic weights: neon, 20; krypton, 82;
  and xenon, 128.</p>

  <p>The amounts of neon and helium in air have
  since been measured; the former is contained in air in the
  proportion of I volume in 81,000; the latter, I volume in
  245,000; the amounts of krypton and xenon are very much smaller -
  not more than 1 part of krypton by volume can be separated from
  20,000,000, of air; and the amount of xenon in air by volume is
  not more than 1 part in 170,000,000.</p>

  <p>In June, 1903, Mr. Baly published an
  account of his determination of the wavelengths of the lines in
  the spectra of neon, krypton, and xenon, photographed by help of
  a concave Rowland's grating of ten feet radial curvature. In all,
  the positions of 2,400 lines were accurately measured.</p>

  <p>The discovery that uranium emits "rays"
  capable of discharging an electroscope and impressing a
  photographic plate, made in 1896, was followed by the separation
  from pitchblende, the chief ore of uranium, of that remarkable
  element, radium, by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Madame Curie</a>, in 1898.
  In 1899, Giesel and Meyer and Schweidler in Germany and Austria,
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Becquerel</a>
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">P. Curie</a> in
  France, found almost simultaneously that certain rays from
  radium, later called the <font face="Symbol">b</font>-rays, could
  be deviated by a magnetic field; and these rays have since been
  shown to be identical with the cathode rays, proceeding from the
  cathode of a highly exhausted tube. These rays possess great
  penetrating power, for they pass through considerable thicknesses
  of metal without absorption. It was not till 1900 that Madame
  Curie threw out the suggestion that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays, which were stopped by small thicknesses
  of metal or glass, proceeding from polonium, might be of the
  nature of small particles, projected with great velocity, but
  which lost their energy in passing through matter. Strutt, in
  1901, made the same suggestion for the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays from radium, which are not deviable except
  in a very powerful magnetic field. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Rutherford</a>, in 1902,
  determined the deviation of these rays in a known magnetic field,
  and also in an electrostatic field, and arrived at an estimate of
  the value of the ratio of mass to electric charge for each
  particle; and on the supposition that the charge is the same as
  that carried by an ion of say hydrogen, he arrived at an estimate
  of the mass of each particle. Calculation showed it to
  approximate to twice that of an atom of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>After Schmidt and Madame Curie's discovery
  in 1898 that compounds of thorium and the minerals containing it
  possessed properties similar to those of uranium, Owens found
  that the power of discharging an electroscope could be greatly
  modified by blowing a current of air over the specimen. And in
  I900, Rutherford proved that this was due to the fact that the
  thorium evolves a radioactive gas. This gas was investigated by
  Rutherford and Soddy, who made numerous experiments with the view
  of elucidating its chemical nature. They found that it resisted
  the action of all oxidizing agents, and also of magnesium at a
  red heat. From these observations they concluded that the
  emanation "is an inert gas, analogous in nature to the members of
  the argon family". The emanation was found to decompose after a
  few minutes, losing its radioactivity, while it evolved rays a
  large proportion of which was of the kind termed a, and bearing
  in mind that the mass of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle was probably of the same magnitude as
  that of helium, and also recalling the observation that those
  minerals which yield helium when heated almost invariably contain
  uranium or thorium or both, they continued: "The speculation
  naturally arises whether the presence of helium in minerals and
  its invariable association with radium and thorium may not be
  connected with their radioactivity."</p>

  <p>Mr. Soddy came to work in my laboratory in
  the spring of 1903; and we at once began to investigate the
  properties of the radium emanation; for its life is so much
  longer than that of the thorium emanation (in the proportion
  463,000 to 87) that it is possible to deal with it by ordinary
  physical methods. The emanation from about 60 milligrams of
  radium bromide was collected during eight days; it was introduced
  into a minute measuring tube, and its volume determined; it was
  found to be a self-luminous gas, obeying Boyle's law ; and its
  volume slowly contracted during four weeks, until at the end of
  that time only the smallest visible bubble remained, which
  nevertheless still appeared as a brilliant speck of light; and on
  heating the tube which had contained the gas, a gas was evolved
  from the walls, possessing three and a half times the volume of
  the emanation, which showed the spectrum of helium. It had
  doubtless been projected with a velocity considerable enough to
  cause the molecules to imbed themselves in the glass of tube,
  from which they were expelled at a red heat.</p>

  <p>Other experiments showed that it is easy,
  by heating a radium salt which has been prepared for some time,
  to expel the helium which has accumulated; this result has been
  repeatedly confirmed, not only by Mr. Soddy and myself, but also
  by other observers.</p>

  <p>Much work remains to be done on these
  emanations. In conjunction with Dr. Collie, my colleague, the
  spectrum of the radium emanation has been mapped. It resembles
  generally speaking those of the inert gases; and although its
  density has not been accurately determined, it appears to be
  approximately 80, which would imply a molecular weight of 160;
  and if it is a monatomic gas, its atomic weight would also be
  160. It might then be an unstable member of the argon family;
  there is a vacant place for an element with atomic weight about
  162. The rate of diffusion of the thorium emanation is even less
  satisfactorily determined; but it also appears to be high. It is
  still more unstable, and might perhaps have the atomic weight
  215, for which there is a gap. And it is not inconceivable that
  the still more unstable emanation from the matter named actinium
  by Debierne and emanium by Giesel may be found to possess an even
  higher atomic weight than uranium; judging by the phenomenon of
  brilliant illumination when a preparation of emanium is held
  above a screen of zinc sulphide, the impression is formed that a
  very dense matter is falling down on the screen.</p>

  <p>But I am leaving the regions of fact, which
  are difficult to penetrate, but which bring in their train rich
  rewards, and entering the regions of speculation, where many
  roads lie open, but where a few lead to a definite goal. I will
  therefore content myself with thanking you for the kind attention
  with which you have listened to my discourse.</p>
