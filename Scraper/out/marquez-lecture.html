  <h2><br>The Solitude of Latin America</h2>

  <p>Antonio Pigafetta, a Florentine navigator
  who went with Magellan on the first voyage around the world,
  wrote, upon his passage through our southern lands of America, a
  strictly accurate account that nonetheless resembles a venture
  into fantasy. In it he recorded that he had seen hogs with navels
  on their haunches, clawless birds whose hens laid eggs on the
  backs of their mates, and others still, resembling tongueless
  pelicans, with beaks like spoons. He wrote of having seen a
  misbegotten creature with the head and ears of a mule, a camel's
  body, the legs of a deer and the whinny of a horse. He described
  how the first native encountered in Patagonia was confronted with
  a mirror, whereupon that impassioned giant lost his senses to the
  terror of his own image.<br>
  <br>
  This short and fascinating book, which even then contained the
  seeds of our present-day novels, is by no means the most
  staggering account of our reality in that age. The Chronicles of
  the Indies left us countless others. Eldorado, our so avidly
  sought and illusory land, appeared on numerous maps for many a
  long year, shifting its place and form to suit the fantasy of
  cartographers. In his search for the fountain of eternal youth,
  the mythical Alvar N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca explored the
  north of Mexico for eight years, in a deluded expedition whose
  members devoured each other and only five of whom returned, of
  the six hundred who had undertaken it. One of the many unfathomed
  mysteries of that age is that of the eleven thousand mules, each
  loaded with one hundred pounds of gold, that left Cuzco one day
  to pay the ransom of Atahualpa and never reached their
  destination. Subsequently, in colonial times, hens were sold in
  Cartagena de Indias, that had been raised on alluvial land and
  whose gizzards contained tiny lumps of gold. One founder's lust
  for gold beset us until recently. As late as the last century, a
  German mission appointed to study the construction of an
  interoceanic railroad across the Isthmus of Panama concluded that
  the project was feasible on one condition: that the rails not be
  made of iron, which was scarce in the region, but of gold.<br>
  <br>
  Our independence from Spanish domination did not put us beyond
  the reach of madness. General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna,
  three times dictator of Mexico, held a magnificent funeral for
  the right leg he had lost in the so-called Pastry War. General
  Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Moreno ruled Ecuador for sixteen years as an
  absolute monarch; at his wake, the corpse was seated on the
  presidential chair, decked out in full-dress uniform and a
  protective layer of medals. General Maximiliano Hern&aacute;ndez
  Mart&iacute;nez, the theosophical despot of El Salvador who had
  thirty thousand peasants slaughtered in a savage massacre,
  invented a pendulum to detect poison in his food, and had
  streetlamps draped in red paper to defeat an epidemic of scarlet
  fever. The statue to General Francisco Moraz&acute;n erected in
  the main square of Tegucigalpa is actually one of Marshal Ney,
  purchased at a Paris warehouse of second-hand sculptures.<br>
  <br>
  Eleven years ago, the Chilean <a href="../1971/index.html">Pablo
  Neruda</a>, one of the outstanding poets of our time, enlightened
  this audience with his word. Since then, the Europeans of good
  will - and sometimes those of bad, as well - have been struck,
  with ever greater force, by the unearthly tidings of Latin
  America, that boundless realm of haunted men and historic women,
  whose unending obstinacy blurs into legend. We have not had a
  moment's rest. A promethean president, entrenched in his burning
  palace, died fighting an entire army, alone; and two suspicious
  airplane accidents, yet to be explained, cut short the life of
  another great-hearted president and that of a democratic soldier
  who had revived the dignity of his people. There have been five
  wars and seventeen military coups; there emerged a diabolic
  dictator who is carrying out, in God's name, the first Latin
  American ethnocide of our time. In the meantime, twenty million
  Latin American children died before the age of one - more than
  have been born in Europe since 1970. Those missing because of
  repression number nearly one hundred and twenty thousand, which
  is as if no one could account for all the inhabitants of Uppsala.
  Numerous women arrested while pregnant have given birth in
  Argentine prisons, yet nobody knows the whereabouts and identity
  of their children who were furtively adopted or sent to an
  orphanage by order of the military authorities. Because they
  tried to change this state of things, nearly two hundred thousand
  men and women have died throughout the continent, and over one
  hundred thousand have lost their lives in three small and
  ill-fated countries of Central America: Nicaragua, El Salvador
  and Guatemala. If this had happened in the United States, the
  corresponding figure would be that of one million six hundred
  thousand violent deaths in four years.<br>
  <br>
  One million people have fled Chile, a country with a tradition of
  hospitality - that is, ten per cent of its population. Uruguay, a
  tiny nation of two and a half million inhabitants which
  considered itself the continent's most civilized country, has
  lost to exile one out of every five citizens. Since 1979, the
  civil war in El Salvador has produced almost one refugee every
  twenty minutes. The country that could be formed of all the
  exiles and forced emigrants of Latin America would have a
  population larger than that of Norway.<br>
  <br>
  I dare to think that it is this outsized reality, and not just
  its literary expression, that has deserved the attention of the
  <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/marquez-lecture-e.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy of Letters</a>. A reality not of paper, but one that
  lives within us and determines each instant of our countless
  daily deaths, and that nourishes a source of insatiable
  creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and
  nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by
  fortune. Poets and beggars, musicians and prophets, warriors and
  scoundrels, all creatures of that unbridled reality, we have had
  to ask but little of imagination, for our crucial problem has
  been a lack of conventional means to render our lives believable.
  This, my friends, is the crux of our solitude.<br>
  <br>
  And if these difficulties, whose essence we share, hinder us, it
  is understandable that the rational talents on this side of the
  world, exalted in the contemplation of their own cultures, should
  have found themselves without valid means to interpret us. It is
  only natural that they insist on measuring us with the yardstick
  that they use for themselves, forgetting that the ravages of life
  are not the same for all, and that the quest of our own identity
  is just as arduous and bloody for us as it was for them. The
  interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own,
  serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever less free, ever
  more solitary. Venerable Europe would perhaps be more perceptive
  if it tried to see us in its own past. If only it recalled that
  London took three hundred years to build its first city wall, and
  three hundred years more to acquire a bishop; that Rome labored
  in a gloom of uncertainty for twenty centuries, until an Etruscan
  King anchored it in history; and that the peaceful Swiss of
  today, who feast us with their mild cheeses and apathetic
  watches, bloodied Europe as soldiers of fortune, as late as the
  Sixteenth Century. Even at the height of the Renaissance, twelve
  thousand lansquenets in the pay of the imperial armies sacked and
  devastated Rome and put eight thousand of its inhabitants to the
  sword.<br>
  <br>
  I do not mean to embody the illusions of Tonio Kr&ouml;ger, whose
  dreams of uniting a chaste north to a passionate south were
  exalted here, fifty-three years ago, by <a href=
  "../1929/index.html">Thomas Mann</a>. But I do believe that those
  clear-sighted Europeans who struggle, here as well, for a more
  just and humane homeland, could help us far better if they
  reconsidered their way of seeing us. Solidarity with our dreams
  will not make us feel less alone, as long as it is not translated
  into concrete acts of legitimate support for all the peoples that
  assume the illusion of having a life of their own in the
  distribution of the world.<br>
  <br>
  Latin America neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn
  without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that
  its quest for independence and originality should become a
  Western aspiration. However, the navigational advances that have
  narrowed such distances between our Americas and Europe seem,
  conversely, to have accentuated our cultural remoteness. Why is
  the originality so readily granted us in literature so
  mistrustfully denied us in our difficult attempts at social
  change? Why think that the social justice sought by progressive
  Europeans for their own countries cannot also be a goal for Latin
  America, with different methods for dissimilar conditions? No:
  the immeasurable violence and pain of our history are the result
  of age-old inequities and untold bitterness, and not a conspiracy
  plotted three thousand leagues from our home. But many European
  leaders and thinkers have thought so, with the childishness of
  old-timers who have forgotten the fruitful excess of their youth
  as if it were impossible to find another destiny than to live at
  the mercy of the two great masters of the world. This, my
  friends, is the very scale of our solitude.<br>
  <br>
  In spite of this, to oppression, plundering and abandonment, we
  respond with life. Neither floods nor plagues, famines nor
  cataclysms, nor even the eternal wars of century upon century,
  have been able to subdue the persistent advantage of life over
  death. An advantage that grows and quickens: every year, there
  are seventy-four million more births than deaths, a sufficient
  number of new lives to multiply, each year, the population of New
  York sevenfold. Most of these births occur in the countries of
  least resources - including, of course, those of Latin America.
  Conversely, the most prosperous countries have succeeded in
  accumulating powers of destruction such as to annihilate, a
  hundred times over, not only all the human beings that have
  existed to this day, but also the totality of all living beings
  that have ever drawn breath on this planet of misfortune.<br>
  <br>
  On a day like today, my master <a href=
  "../1949/index.html">William Faulkner</a> said, "I decline to
  accept the end of man". I would fall unworthy of standing in this
  place that was his, if I were not fully aware that the colossal
  tragedy he refused to recognize thirty-two years ago is now, for
  the first time since the beginning of humanity, nothing more than
  a simple scientific possibility. Faced with this awesome reality
  that must have seemed a mere utopia through all of human time,
  we, the inventors of tales, who will believe anything, feel
  entitled to believe that it is not yet too late to engage in the
  creation of the opposite utopia. A new and sweeping utopia of
  life, where no one will be able to decide for others how they
  die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and
  where the races condemned to one hundred years of solitude will
  have, at last and forever, a second opportunity on earth.</p>
