  <h1>Gerhard Herzberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="herzberg.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Gerhard
  Herzberg</b> was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 25 December, 1904.
  He was married in 1929 to Luise Herzberg <i>ne&eacute;</i>
  Oettinger and has two children. He was widowed in 1971.<br>
  <br>
  Herzberg received his early training in Hamburg and subsequently
  studied physics at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology where in
  1928 he obtained his Dr.Ing. degree under H. Rau (a pupil of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/index.html">W. Wien</a>). From
  1928 to 1930 he carried out post-doctorate work at the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1925/index.html">James Franck</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/index.html">Max Born</a> and the
  University of
  Bristol. In 1930 he was appointed Privatdozent (lecturer) and
  senior assistant in the Physics Department of the Darmstadt
  Institute of Technology.<br>
  <br>
  In August 1935 Herzberg was forced to leave Germany as a refugee
  and took up a guest professorship at the University of
  Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Canada), for which funds had been
  made available by the Carnegie Foundation. A few months later he
  was appointed research professor of physics, a position he held
  until 1945. From 1945 to 1948 Herzberg was professor of
  spectroscopy at the Yerkes Observatory of the University of
  Chicago. He returned to Canada in 1948 and was made Principal
  Research Officer and shortly afterwards Director of the Division
  of Physics at the National Research Council. In 1955, after the
  Division had been divided into one in pure and one in applied
  physics, Herzberg remained Director of the Division of Pure
  Physics, a position which he held until 1969 when he was
  appointed Distinguished Research Scientist in the recombined
  Division of Physics.<br>
  <br>
  Herzberg's main contributions are to the field of atomic and
  molecular spectroscopy. He and his associates have determined the
  structures of a large number of diatomic and polyatomic
  molecules, including the structures of many free radicals
  difficult to determine in any other way (among others, those of
  free methyl and methylene). Herzberg has also applied these
  spectroscopic studies to the identification of certain molecules
  in planetary atmospheres, in comets, and in interstellar
  space.<br>
  <br>
  Herzberg has been active as President or Vice President of
  several international commissions dealing with spectroscopy. He
  was also Vice President of the International Union of Pure and
  Applied Physics from 1957 to 1963. He held the offices of
  President of the Canadian Association of Physicists for the year
  1956-57 and President of the Royal Society of Canada for the year 1966-67.<br>
  <br>
  Herzberg was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in
  1939 and of the Royal Society of London in 1951. He was Bakerian
  Lecturer of the Royal Society of London in 1960 and received a
  Royal Medal from the Society in 1971. He was George Fischer Baker
  Non-Resident Lecturer in Chemistry at Cornell University
  in 1968, and Faraday Medallist and Lecturer of the Chemical
  Society of London in 1970. He is Honorary Member or Fellow of a
  number of scientific societies, including the American Academy of
  Arts and Sciences, the Optical Society of America and the
  Chemical Society. He is also a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
  Sciences in Washington and a member of the Pontifical Academy
  of Sciences. He is a Companion of the Order of Canada. He has
  received many other medals and awards and holds Honorary Degrees
  from a number of universities in Canada and abroad, including one
  from the University of Stockholm.</p>
