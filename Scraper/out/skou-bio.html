  <h1>Jens C. Skou - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="skou.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on the 8th of October 1918
  into a wealthy family in Lemvig, a town in the western part of
  Denmark. The town is nicely situated on a fjord, which runs
  across the country from the Kattegat in East to the North Sea in
  West. It is surrounded by hills, and is only 10 km, i.e.
  bicycling distance, from the North Sea, with its beautiful
  beaches and dunes. My father Magnus Martinus Skou together with
  his brother Peter Skou were timber and coal merchants.<br>
  <br>
  We lived in a big beautiful house, had a nice summer house on the
  North Sea coast. We were four children, I was the oldest with a
  one year younger brother, a sister 4 years younger and another
  brother 7 years younger. The timber-yard was an excellent
  playground, so the elder of my brothers and I never missed
  friends to play with. School was a minor part of life.<br>
  <br>
  When I was 12 years old my father died from pneumonia. His
  brother continued the business with my mother Ane-Margrethe Skou
  as passive partner, and gave her such conditions that there was
  no change in our economical situation. My mother, who was a tall
  handsome woman, never married again. She took care of us four
  children and besides this she was very active in the social life
  in town.<br>
  <br>
  When I was 15, I went to a boarding school, a gymnasium (high
  school) in Haslev a small town on Zealand, for the last three
  years in school (student exam). There was no gymnasium in
  Lemvig.<br>
  <br>
  Besides the 50-60 boys from the boarding section of the school
  there were about 400 day pupils. The school was situated in a big
  park, with two football fields, facilities for athletics, tennis
  courts and a hall for gymnastics and handball. There was a scout
  troop connected to the boarding section of the school. I had to
  spend a little more time preparing for school than I was used to.
  My favourites were the science subjects, especially mathematics.
  But there was plenty of time for sports activities and scouting,
  which I enjoyed. All the holidays, Christmas, Easter, summer and
  autumn I spent at home with my family.<br>
  <br>
  After three years I got my exam, it was in 1937. I returned to
  Lemvig for the summer vacation, considering what to do next. I
  could not make up my mind, which worried my mother. I played
  tennis with a young man who studied medicine, and he convinced me
  that this would be a good choice. So, to my mother's great
  relief, I told her at the end of August that I would study
  medicine, and started two days later at the University of
  Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
  The medical course was planned to take 7 years, 3 years for
  physics, chemistry, anatomy, biochemistry and physiology, and 4
  years for the clinical subjects, and for pathology, forensic
  medicine, pharmacology and public health. I followed the plan and
  got my medical degree in the summer of 1944.<br>
  <br>
  I was not especially interested in living in a big town. On the
  other hand it was a good experience for a limited number of years
  to live in, and get acquainted with the capital of the country,
  and to exploit its cultural offers. Art galleries, classical
  music and opera were my favourites.<br>
  <br>
  For the first three years I spent the month between the semesters
  at home studying the different subjects. For the last 4 years the
  months between the semesters were used for practical courses in
  different hospital wards in Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
  It was with increasing anxiety that we witnessed to how the
  maniac dictator in Germany, just south of our border, changed
  Germany into a madhouse. Our anxiety did not become less after
  the outbreak of the war. In 1914 Denmark managed to stay out of
  the war, but this time, in April 1940 the Germans occupied the
  country. Many were ashamed that the Danish army were ordered by
  the government to surrender after only a short resistance.
  Considering what later happened in Holland, Belgium and France,
  it was clear that the Danish army had no possibility of stopping
  the German army.<br>
  <br>
  The occupation naturally had a deep impact on life in Denmark in
  the following years, both from a material point of view, but
  also, what was much worse, we lost our freedom of speech. For the
  first years the situation was very peculiar. The Germans did not
  remove the Danish government, and the Danish government did not
  resign, but tried as far as it was possible to minimize the
  consequences of the occupation. The army was not disarmed, nor
  was the fleet. The Germans wanted to use Denmark as a food
  supplier, and therefore wanted as few problems as possible.<br>
  <br>
  The majority of the population turned against the Germans, but
  with no access to weapons, and with a flat homogeneous country
  with no mountains or big woods to hide in, the possibility of
  active resistance was poor. So for the first years the resistance
  only manifested itself in a negative attitude to the Germans in
  the country, in complicating matters dealing with the Germans as
  far as possible, and in a number of illegal journals, keeping
  people informed about the situation, giving the information which
  was suppressed by the German censorship. There was no
  interference with the teaching of medicine.<br>
  <br>
  The Germans armed the North Sea coast against an invasion from
  the allied forces. Access was forbidden and our summer house was
  occupied. My grandmother had died in 1939, and we four children
  inherited what would have been my father's share. For some of the
  money my brother and I bought a yacht, and took up sailing, and
  this has since been an important part of my leisure time life.
  After the occupation the Germans had forbidden sailing in the
  Danish seas except on the fjord where Lemvig was situated, and
  another fjord in Zealand.<br>
  <br>
  The resistance against the Germans increased as time went on, and
  sabotage slowly started. Weapons and ammunition for the
  resistance movement began to be dropped by English planes, and in
  August 1943 there were general strikes all over the country
  against the Germans with the demand that the Government stopped
  giving way to the Germans. The Government consequently resigned,
  the Germans took over, the Danish marine sank the fleet and the
  army was disarmed. An illegal Frihedsr&aring;d (the Danish
  Liberation Council) revealed itself, which from then on was what
  people listened to and took advice from.<br>
  <br>
  Following this, the sabotage against railways and factories
  working for the Germans increased, and with this arrests and
  executions. One of our medical classmates was a German informer.
  We knew who he was, so we could take care. He was eventually
  liquidated by unknowns. We feared a reaction from Gestapo against
  the class, and stayed away from the teaching.<br>
  <br>
  The Germans planned to arrest the Jews, but the date, the night
  between the first and second October 1943 was revealed by a high
  placed German. By help from many, many people the Jews were
  hidden. Of about 7000, the Germans caught 472, who were sent to
  Theresienstadt where 52 died. In the following weeks illegal
  routes were established across the sea, &Oslash;resund, to Sweden,
  and the Jews were during the nights brought to safety. From all
  sides of the Danish society there were strong protests against
  the Germans for this encroachment on fellow-countrymen.<br>
  <br>
  In May and June 1944, we managed to get our exams. A number of
  our teachers had gone underground, but their job was taken over
  by others. We could not assemble to sign the Hippocratic oath,
  but had to come one by one at a place away from the University
  not known by others.<br>
  <br>
  I returned to my home for the summer vacation. The Germans had
  taken over part of my mother's house, and had used it for housing
  Danes working for the Germans. This was extremely unpleasant for
  my mother, but she would not leave her house and stayed. I
  addressed the local German commander, and managed to get him to
  move the "foreigners" from the house at least as long as we four
  children were home on holiday.<br>
  <br>
  The Germans had forbidden sailing, but not rowing, so we bought a
  canoe and spent the holidays rowing on the fjord.<br>
  <br>
  After the summer holidays I started my internship in a hospital
  in Hj&oslash;rring in the northern part of the country. I first
  spent 6 months in the medical ward, and then 6 months in the
  surgical ward. I became very interested in surgery, not least
  because the assistant physician, next in charge after the senior
  surgeon, was very eager to teach me how to make smaller
  operations, like removing a diseased appendix. I soon discovered
  why. When we were on call together and we during the night got a
  patient with appendicitis, it happened--after we had started the
  operation--that he asked me to take over and left. He was then on
  his way to receive weapons and explosives which were dropped by
  English planes on a dropping field outside Hj&oslash;rring. I found
  that this was more important than operating patients for
  appendicitis, but we had of course to take care of the patients
  in spite of a war going on. He was finally caught by the Gestapo,
  and sent to a concentration camp, fortunately not in Germany, but
  in the southern part of Denmark, where he survived and was
  released on the 5th of May 1945, when the Germans in Denmark
  surrendered.<br>
  <br>
  I continued for another year in the surgical ward. It was here I
  became interested in the effect of local anaesthetics, and
  decided to use this as a subject for a thesis. Thereafter I got a
  position at the Orthopaedic Hospital in Aarhus as part of the
  education in surgery.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 I stopped clinical training, and got a position at the
  Institute for Medical Physiology at Aarhus University in order to write the
  planned doctoral thesis on the anaesthetic and toxic mechanism of
  action of local anaesthetics.<br>
  <br>
  During my time in Hj&oslash;rring I met a very beautiful
  probationer, Ellen Margrethe Nielsen, with whom I fell in love. I
  had become ill while I was on the medical ward, and spent some
  time in bed in the ward. I had a single room and a radio, so I
  invited her to come in the evening to listen to the English
  radio, which was strictly forbidden by the Germans - but was what
  everybody did.<br>
  <br>
  After she had finished her education as a nurse in 1948, she came
  to Aarhus and we married. In 1950 we had a daughter, but
  unfortunately she had an inborn disease and died after 1 1/2
  years. Even though this was very hard, it brought my wife and I
  closer together. In 1952, and in 1954 respectively we got two
  healthy daughters, Hanne and Karen.<br>
  <br>
  The salary at the University was very low, so partly because of
  this but also because I was interested in using my education as a
  medical doctor, I took in 1949 an extra job as doctor on call one
  night a week. It furthermore had the advantage that I could get a
  permission to buy a car and to get a telephone. There were still
  after war restrictions on these items.<br>
  <br>
  I was born in a milieu which politically was conservative. The
  job as a doctor on call changed my political attitude and I
  became a social democrat. I realized how important it is to have
  free medical care, free education with equal opportunities, and a
  welfare system which takes care of the weak, the handicapped, the
  old, and the unemployed, even if this means high taxes. Or as
  phrased by one of our philosophers, N.F.S. Grundtvig, "a society
  where few have too much, and fewer too little".<br>
  <br>
  We lived in a flat, so the car gave us new possibilities. We
  wanted to have a house, and my mother would give us the payment,
  but I was stubborn, and wanted to earn the money myself. In 1957
  we bought a house with a nice garden in Risskov, a suburb to
  Aarhus not far away from the University.<br>
  <br>
  I am a family man, I restricted my work at the Institute to 8
  hours a day, from 8 to 4 or 9 to 5, worked concentratedly while I
  was there, went home and spent the rest of the day and the
  evening with my wife and children. All weekends and holidays, and
  4 weeks summer holidays were spent with the family. In 1960 we
  bought an acre of land on a cliff facing the beach 45 minutes by
  car from Aarhus, and built a small summer house. From then on
  this became the centre for our leisure time life. We bought a
  dinghy and a rowing boat with outboard motor and I started to
  teach the children how to sail, and to fish with fishing rod and
  with net.<br>
  <br>
  Later, when the girls grew older, we bought a yacht, the girls
  and I sailed in the Danish seas, and up along the west coast of
  Sweden. My wife easily gets seasick, but joined us on day tours.
  Later the girls took their friends on sail tours.<br>
  <br>
  In wintertime the family skied as soon as there was snow. A
  friend of mine, Karl Ove Nielsen, a professor of physics, took me
  in the beginning of the 1960s at Easter time on an 8-day cross
  country ski tour through the high mountain area in Norway,
  Jotunheimen. We stayed overnight in the Norwegian Tourist
  Association's huts on the trail, which were open during the
  Easter week. It was a wonderful experience, but also a tour where
  you had to take all safety precautions. It became for many years
  a tradition. Later the girls joined us, and they also took some
  of their friends. When the weather situation did not allow this
  tour, we spent a week in more peaceful surroundings either in
  Norway with cross-country skiing or in the Alps with slalom. We
  still do, now with the girls, their husbands and the
  grandchildren. Outside the sporting activities, I spend much time
  listening to classical music, and reading, first of all
  biographies.<br>
  <br>
  When the children left home, one for studying medicine and the
  other architecture, my wife worked for several years as a nurse
  in a psychiatric hospital for children, then engaged herself in
  politics. She was elected for the County Council for the social
  democrats, and spent 12 years on the council, first of all
  working with health care problems. She was also elected to the
  county scientific ethical committee, which evaluates all research
  which involves human beings. Later she was elected co-chairman to
  the Danish Central Scientific Ethical Committee, which lay down
  the guidelines for the work on the local committees, and which is
  an appeal committee for the local committees as well as for the
  doctors. She has worked 17 years on the committees and has been
  lecturing nurses and doctors about ethical problems.<br>
  <br>
  I had no scientific training when I started at the Institute of
  Physiology in 1947. It took me a good deal of time before I knew
  how to attack the problem I was interested in and get acquainted
  with this new type of work. The chairman, Professor S&oslash;ren L.
  &Oslash;rskov was a very considerate person, extremely helpful,
  patient, and gave me the time necessary to find my feet. During
  the work I got so interested in doing scientific work that I
  decided to continue and give up surgery. The thesis was published
  as a book in Danish in 1954, and written up in 6 papers published
  in English. The work on the local anaesthetics, brought me as
  described in the following paper to the identification of the
  sodium-potassium pump, which is responsible for the active
  transport of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane. The
  paper was published in 1957. From then on my scientific interest
  shifted from the effect of local anaesthetics to active transport
  of cations.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1940s and the first part of the 1950s, the amount of money
  allocated for research was small. Professor &Oslash;rskov, fell
  chronically ill. His illness developed slowly so he continued in
  his position, but I, as the oldest in the department after him,
  had partly to take over his job. This meant that besides teaching
  in the semesters I had to spend two months per year examining
  orally the students in physiology.<br>
  <br>
  The identification of the sodium-potassium pump gave us contact
  to the outside scientific world. In 1961, I met R.W. Berliner at
  an international Pharmacology meeting in Stockholm. He mentioned
  the possibility of obtaining a grant from National Institutes of Health (NIH). I
  applied and got a grant for two years. The importance of this was
  not only the money, but that it showed interest in the work we
  were doing.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, Professor &Oslash;rskov resigned and I was appointed
  professor and chairman. In the late 1950s and especially in the
  1960s, more money was allocated to the Universities, and also
  more positions. Due to the work with the sodium-potassium pump,
  it became possible to attract clever young people, and the
  institute staff in a few years increased from 4 to 20-25
  scientists. This had also an effect on the teaching. I got a
  young doctor, Noe N&aelig;raa, who had expressed ideas about
  medical teaching, to accept a position at the Institute. He
  started to reorganise our old fashioned laboratory course, we got
  new modern equipment, and thereafter we also reorganised the
  teaching, made it problem-oriented with teaching in small
  classes. My scientific interest was membrane physiology, but I
  wanted also to find people who could cover other aspects of
  physiology, so we ended up with 5-6 groups who worked
  scientifically with different physiological subjects.<br>
  <br>
  In 1972 we got a new statute for the Universities, which involved
  a democratization of the whole system. The chairman was no longer
  the professor (elected by the board of chairmen which made up the
  faculty), but he/she was now elected by all scientists and
  technicians in the Institute and could be anybody, scientist or
  technician. This was of course a great relief for me because I
  could get rid of all my administrative duties. A problem was,
  however, that I got elected as chairman, but later others took
  over. In the beginning it was very tedious to work with the
  system, not least because everybody thought that they should be
  asked and take part in every decision. Later we learned to hand
  over the responsibility to an elected board at the
  Institute.<br>
  <br>
  In these years the money to the Institutes came from the Faculty,
  which got it from the University (which got it from the State).
  The money was then divided inside the institute by the chairman,
  and later by the elected board. It was usually sufficient to
  cover the daily expenses of the research. External funds were
  only for bigger equipment. Besides research-money we had a staff
  of very well trained laboratory assistants, whose positions--as
  well as the positions of the scientific staff--was paid by the
  University. The institute every year sent a budget for the coming
  year, to the faculty, who then sent a budget for the faculty to
  the University, and the University to the State.<br>
  <br>
  This way of funding had the great advantage that there was not a
  steady pressure on the scientists for publication and for sending
  applications for external funds. It was a system that allowed
  everybody to start on his/her own project, independently, and
  test their ideas. Nobody was forced from lack of money to join a
  group which had money and work on their ideas. It was also a
  system which could be misused, by people who were not active
  scientifically. With an elected board it proved difficult to
  handle such a situation. Not least because the very active
  scientists tried to avoid being elected - i.e. it could be the
  least active who actually decided. In practice, however, the not
  very active scientists usually accepted to do an extra job with
  the teaching, thus relieving the very active scientists from part
  of the teaching burden.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1980s this was changed, the money for science was
  transferred to centralized (state) funds, and had to be applied
  for by the individual scientist. Not an advantage from my point
  of view. Applications took a lot of time, it tempted a too fast
  publication, and to publish too short papers, and the evaluation
  process used a lot of manpower. It does not give time to become
  absorbed in a problem as the previous system.<br>
  <br>
  My research interest was concentrated around the structure and
  function of the active transport system, the
  Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. A number of very excellent
  clever young scientists worked on different sides of the subject,
  either their own choice or suggested by me. Each worked
  independent on his/her subject. Scientists who took part in the
  work on the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and who made
  important contributions to field were, P.L. J&oslash;rgensen
  (purification and structure), I. Klodos (phosphorylation), O.
  Hansen (effect of cardiac glycosides and vanadate), P. Ottolenghi
  (effect of lipids), J. Jensen (ligand binding), J. G. N&oslash;rby
  (phosphorylation, ligand binding, kinetics), L. Plesner
  (kinetics), M. Esmann (solubilization of the enzyme, molecular
  weight, ESR studies), T. Clausen (hormonal control), A.B.
  Maunsbach and E. Skriver from the Institute of Anatomy in
  collaboration with P.L. J&oslash;rgensen (electron microscopy and
  crystallization), and I. Plesner from the Department of Chemistry
  (enzyme kinetics and evaluation of models). We also had many
  visitors.<br>
  <br>
  We got many contacts to scientists in different parts of the
  world, and I spent a good deal of time travelling giving
  lectures. In 1973 the first international meeting on the
  Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was held in New York. The
  next was 5 years later in &Aring;rhus, and thereafter every third
  year. The proceedings from these meetings have been a very
  valuable source of information about the development of the
  field.<br>
  <br>
  My wife joined me on many of the tours and we got friends abroad.
  Apart from the scientific inspiration the travelling also gave
  many cultural experiences, symphony concerts, opera and ballet,
  visits to Cuzco and Machu Picchu in Peru, to Uxmal and
  Chich&eacute;n Itz&aacute; on the Yucatan Peninsula, and to museums
  in many different countries. Not to speak of the architectural
  experiences from seeing many different parts of the world. And
  not least it gave us good friends.<br>
  <br>
  It is not always easy to keep your papers in order when
  travelling. Sitting in the airport in Moscow in the 1960s waiting
  for departure to Khabarovsk in the eastern part of Siberia,
  we--three Danes on our way to a meeting in Tokyo--realized that
  we had forgotten our passports at the hotel in town. There were
  twenty minutes to departure and no way to get the passports in
  time. We asked Intourist what to do. There was only one boat
  connection a week from Nakhodka, where we should embark to
  Yokohama, so they suggested that we should go on, they would send
  the passports after us. I had once had a nightmare, that I should
  end my days in Siberia. When we after an overnight flight arrived
  in Khabarovsk we were met by a lady who asked if we were the
  gentlemen without passports. We could not deny, and she told us
  that they would not arrive until after we had left Khabarovsk by
  train to Nakhodka. But they would send them by plane to
  Vladivostok and from there by car to Nakhodka. To our question if
  we could leave Siberia without our passports the answer was no.
  When the train the following morning stopped in Nakhodka, a man
  came into the sleeping car and asked if we were the gentlemen
  without passports. To our "yes" he said "here you are", and
  handed over the passports. Amazing. We had an uncomplicated boat
  trip to Yokohama.<br>
  <br>
  It was not as easy some years later in Argentina. I had been at a
  meeting in Mendoza, had stopped in Cordoba on the way, had showed
  passport in and out of the airports without problems. Returning
  to Buenos Aires to leave for New York, the man at the counter
  told me that my passport had expired three months earlier, and
  according to rules I had to return direct to my home country. I
  argued that I was sure I could get into the U.S., but he would
  not give way. We discussed for half an hour. Finally shortly
  before departure he would let me go to New York if he could
  reserve a plane out of New York to Denmark immediately after my
  arrival. He did the reservation, put a label on my ticket with
  the time of departure, and by the second call for departure I
  rushed off, hearing him saying "You can always remove the label".
  In New York, I stepped to the rear end of the line, hoping the
  man at the counter would be tired when it was my turn. He was
  not. I asked if I had to return to Denmark. "There is always a
  way out" was his answer, "No, go to the other counter, sign some
  papers, pay 5 dollars, and I let you in".<br>
  <br>
  In 1977, I was offered the chair of Biophysics at the medical
  faculty. It was a smaller department, with 7 positions for
  scientists, of which 5 were empty, which meant that we could get
  positions for I. Klodos and M. Esmann, who had fellowships.
  Besides J. G. N&oslash;rby and L. Plesner moved with us. The two
  members in the Institute, M. J. Mulvany and F. Cornelius became
  interested in the connection between pump activity and
  vasoconstriction, and reconstitution of the enzyme into
  liposomes, respectively, i.e. all in the institute worked on
  different sides of the same problem, the structure and function
  of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We got more space,
  less administration, and I was free of teaching
  obligations.<br>
  <br>
  We all got along very well, lived in a relaxed atmosphere,
  inspiring and helping each other, cooperating, also with the
  Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase colleagues left in the
  Physiological Institute. And even if we all worked on different
  sides of the same problem, there were never problems of
  interfering in each others subjects, or about priority.<br>
  <br>
  In 1988, I retired, kept my office, gave up systematic
  experimental work and started to work on kinetic models for the
  overall reaction of the pump on computer. For this I had to learn
  how to programme, quite interesting, and amazing what you can do
  with a computer from the point of view of handling even
  complicated models. And even if my working hours are fewer, being
  free of all obligations, the time I spent on scientific problems
  are about the same as before my retirement.<br>
  <br>
  I enjoy no longer having a meeting calendar, I enjoy to go
  fly-fishing when the weather is right, and enjoy spending a lot
  of time with my grandchildren.</p>
