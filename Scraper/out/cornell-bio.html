  <h1>Eric A. Cornell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cornell.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  Palo Alto, California in 1961. My parents were completing
  graduate degrees at Stanford. Two years later we moved to
  Cambridge, Massachusetts, the city I consider to be my hometown.
  My father was a professor of civil engineering at MIT, and my mother
  taught high school English. The family, including my younger
  brother and sister, accompanied my father on sabbatical years to
  Berkeley, California and Lisbon, Portugal. These were wonderful
  experiences for me and no doubt they are in part to blame for my
  lifelong love of travel.</p>

  <p>My mother taught me to read when I was
  still quite young, and at least in my memory I passed the
  majority of my childhood reading. My head was always bubbling
  over with facts and it seems to me this had little to do with my
  paying close attention in school and more to do with my voracious
  and omnivorous reading habits. Indeed in elementary school I
  often kept my desktop slightly open and affected an alert-looking
  pose that still allowed me to peek into the desk where I kept
  open my latest book, as interesting as it was irrelevant to the
  academic subject at hand. Every so often my hand slipped
  surreptitiously into the desk to turn the page. In the
  intervening three decades I have spent plenty of time lecturing
  in front of a classroom of my own, and in retrospect I realize I
  was seldom fooling anyone. Most of my teachers probably found I
  made less trouble if they let me read.</p>

  <p>Some nights, especially in the early summer
  when the late evening light kept my west-facing bedroom from
  getting very dark, I had trouble falling asleep at my appointed
  bedtime. My parents probably felt that reading me a story was a
  little redundant, but on occasion my father would come in and
  suggest to me a "problem" to think about. Stewing over these
  problems was supposed to help me go to sleep. It never did that,
  but it did get me in the lifelong habit of thinking about
  technical issues at all sorts of random moments in my daily life,
  and not only (or even primarily) during scheduled "thinking
  time." Some of my father's bedtime problems I now recognize as
  classic physics brainteasers. A man driving a van full of
  beehives comes to a bridge. The combined weight of the truck,
  bees, and beehives barely exceeds the safety limit of the bridge.
  The driver comes up with the idea of banging on the side of the
  van, so that all the bees swarm out of the hive and fly around in
  the back of the van. Does the fact that the bees are now all
  airborne make the truck light enough to safely cross the bridge?
  Other problems were exercises in mental estimation. If you hold
  out your thumb, at arms length, you can just about cover the moon
  with your thumb. The moon is a quarter of a million miles away.
  How big is it?</p>

  <p>The 1970s, the decade of my teenage years,
  was a transitional period in American youth culture. It was
  already past the peak of the era when science-minded kids built
  radios, model airplanes, rockets - things of that sort. But it
  was certainly well before the heyday of computers and video
  games. I was partly old-fashioned and partly modern. I certainly
  remember building model rockets. It was fun to watch the rocket
  blast into the air, suspenseful to wonder if the parachute would
  open to bring the rocket safely back. I didn't really enjoy the
  assembling the model kits very much, and usually I couldn't be
  bothered to paint the thing, or even to stick on the decals. A
  more vivid memory for me was designing a model of my own. Besides
  the store-bought kits, the Estes Model Rocketry company in those
  days also sold by mail various sizes of cardboard tubing,
  balsa-wood sheets, nosecones, and gun-powder rocket engines.
  Estes also published a terrific little booklet full of
  quantitative design tips. A key issue in rocket design is to make
  sure that the center of mass is well forward from the fins, lest
  the rocket be aerodynamically unstable. My father showed me how
  (after a candidate design was laid out on graph paper) to
  calculate the center of mass of the assembly based on the masses
  and distribution of the component parts. I designed an
  over-sized, under-powered, clunky sort of rocket. I didn't care
  how high it would go - I wanted it to rise slowly enough that I
  could watch to see if its orientation wobbled during the flight.
  On its maiden flight it lifted off the ground with all the
  ponderousness of a Saturn V, rising steady and true but rolling
  slightly about its long axis (had I glued the fins on crooked?)
  as it gained altitude. The engine burn completed, and then the
  parachute popped and my creation drifted with the wind to land on
  the roof of a schoolhouse. My parents suggested I go on Monday
  morning to ask the school's janitor to retrieve my rocket, but
  this I was too shy to do.</p>

  <p>My freshman year of high school I joined
  the chess and math clubs. The clubs met after school in the
  computer-instruction classroom, under the loose supervision of a
  genial polymath with the unlikely name of Mr. Wisdom. Between
  rounds of speed chess I read enough of a programming manual to
  teach myself to write programs on the school's DEC mainframe in
  the language Basic. For several months I was really captivated
  with this new activity. The exercises in the Basic manual seemed
  pretty tedious so I invented a few projects for myself, including
  a program to generate word puzzles for the math club newsletter.
  After a semester or so, my infatuation with computers burnt out
  as quickly as it had begun. Not enough substance there to sustain
  interest, I felt. This episode is probably the basis for my
  lifelong distaste for "computers for computers' sake" - it's a
  kids' game, I think. A second legacy of my brief childhood
  infatuation with computers was a life-long secret preference for
  programming in Basic, although during my years of apprenticeship
  in other scientists' labs I was compelled to learn both C and
  Fortran. When eventually I had the opportunity to establish a lab
  of my own, one of my first acts as a young principal investigator
  was to write a program to output a precisely timed sequence of
  electronic pulses to control the lasers and magnetic fields in
  what was to become the first successful Bose-Einstein
  condensation apparatus. Of course, I wrote the program in
  Basic!</p>

  <p>Some of my classes in high school were
  pretty interesting and I benefited from having several very
  intelligent and inspiring teachers. Among these were John Samp, a
  physics teacher, and JoAnn Walther, an English teacher. After the
  Nobel Prize announcement, I got back in touch with them and was
  delighted to learn that they are still (as of 2001) teaching at
  my old high school.</p>

  <p>Just before my final year of high school,
  my brother, sister and I moved with my mother to San Francisco. I
  spent my last year of high school there, at Lowell High School. Lowell High was a so-called
  "magnet school," drawing academically inclined students from all
  over the city. My fellow students there were very smart, but the
  really novel thing was that they actually seemed to put a lot of
  effort into their school work. By the end of my first semester
  there, I began to get into that habit as well. Something else new
  at Lowell was that it was "cool" to excel at school, at least
  among the Asian kids with whom I mostly hung out. Without the
  transitional year at Lowell, my first year as an undergraduate at
  Stanford
  would have been a horrible shock.</p>

  <p>The truth is that first year at Stanford
  was a shock anyway, although not for academic reasons. Everyone
  was beautiful, self-confident, self-satisfied. Later I moved into
  a student-run, co-op house and felt more at home in that
  "alternative" residential atmosphere. It was there I met my
  future wife, Celeste Landry, although our lives took us separate
  ways for many years and we were not to marry until more than ten
  years later.</p>

  <p>My first job in physics was as a "scanner"
  at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. As a freshman I
  needed to earn a little money and I was looking for a way to
  learn about science at the same time. The advertised hourly wage
  was unusually high for a campus job, which should have been a
  danger sign. On my first day on the job, a postdoc spent 30
  minutes or so showing me how to call up symbolic representations
  of an endless series of archived detector "events," for display
  on a graphics terminal. There was a particular kind of rare event
  I was to look for - I can't remember now exactly what it was -
  characterized by a certain precise number of photons, of muons,
  etc. The postdoc explained to me how to distinguish different
  sorts of particles on the basis of the amounts of energy they
  deposited in various sorts of detectors, spark chambers,
  calorimeters, what have you. When I recognized a promising event,
  I was to flag it by pressing a certain key on the terminal, and,
  "pop", another event would come up on the screen for my
  consideration. After my 30-minute training period was up, the
  educational part of the job (and incidentally the part of the job
  involving any human interaction) was essentially finished. I
  could come in whenever I wanted, work as many hours as I wanted.
  The money was great but towards the end of the third mind-numbing
  afternoon of staring at the graphics terminal I realized my
  sanity was at risk. I decided to quit right then and there, and
  wandered around the data center looking for someone to notify of
  my decision. There were plenty of people buzzing around the room,
  but no one looked familiar. It occurred to me that, after the
  original 30-minute training period, I had never again seen the
  postdoc who had taught me the tricks of the high-energy physics
  trade. Finally I just wandered out of the building, never to
  return. Over the course of my three afternoons I had worked my
  way through hundreds of stored events, and flagged four of them
  as promising candidates. Is it possible those four events
  eventually got my postdoc a nice assistant professor position at
  the University
  of Chicago? One can always wonder!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, I was taking freshman physics
  with Blas Cabrera, then only in his second year as a professor,
  and eventually I worked up the nerve to approach him after class.
  Did he have a position in his lab for an undergraduate? He did! I
  started off building some data acquisition electronics for a
  scanning magnetometer, sharing a lab bench with a fellow
  undergraduate, Charlie Marcus. For the remainder of my years at
  Stanford I worked afternoons and summers for low-temperature
  physics groups on campus. I really enjoyed this experience, and
  it was these jobs, more than anything else, that persuaded me to
  pursue a career in scientific research.</p>

  <p>Roughly halfway through my undergraduate
  years, I began to worry that my future was choosing me, instead
  of the other way around. Time seemed to be accelerating. Had I
  really already completed nearly two years of college? I was
  taking lots of science classes, spending lots more time in
  physics labs, and was doing well there. In a little more than a
  year, the most natural thing for me to do would be to apply to
  physics graduate school. Doubtless I would be admitted, and then
  - zoom - off I would go into a pre-defined future as a scientific
  researcher. It seemed somehow too pat, too canned. When was it
  that I actually got to decide the course of my own future life?
  Perhaps I would be happier pursuing something a little more
  explicitly intellectual than physics. Maybe a return to my first
  love, of books, was in order. I had been studying Mandarin
  Chinese for a quarter or two. I took a great interest in
  politics. Couldn't I put together some sort of future with all
  that in mind? The first thing I needed was to buy a little time
  to think it over, lest I be out the door with a degree before I
  knew what had happened. A Stanford program called Volunteers in
  Asia seemed to offer me that time. So the summer following my
  second year of college, I went off to the YMCA in Taichung,
  Taiwan, to teach conversational English. The work was pleasant
  and not very hard; I had a lot of time to read and to think and
  to study Chinese. Six months after that, I left Taiwan, first for
  Hong Kong and then for mainland China, where I spent another
  three months studying still more Chinese and generally kicking
  around the country.</p>

  <p>Travel provided many interesting
  experiences, but perhaps the most useful lesson I learned was
  that I really had no proficiency for learning the thousands of
  characters of the written Chinese language. It is not that my
  memory is generally poor. I am very good at remembering the
  lyrics to popular songs. A single line from a popular song
  probably represents about as many bits of information as a single
  Chinese character. If I could have displaced the one set of
  information with the other, I would have had no problem storing
  in my brain the 5000 characters necessary for advanced Chinese
  literacy. As it was, I realized choosing the study of Chinese
  literature as my life's work was probably a mistake. Conversely,
  I came to realize that being good at something is hardly a reason
  to avoid doing it.</p>

  <p>I returned to Stanford with much more of a
  sense of purpose. I continued to take elective courses in such
  topics as poetry and political science, but I allowed myself to
  enjoy my physics courses and my work in the labs. My last two
  years at Stanford I worked for the gyroscope-based general
  relativity experiment of Francis Everett and co-workers, with my
  final year's work growing into an honors project. Everett was the
  titular advisor of my honors thesis, but I worked more closely
  with John Turneaure, a research professor. The gyroscope
  relativity experiment needed data on the low-temperature
  adsorption properties of helium on various technical materials
  such as OFHC copper, fused quartz and so on. I inherited a
  recently abandoned apparatus and was told to extend the range of
  temperatures and go beyond monolayer coverage. I went to see John
  for advice as needed, but other than that I was left to work
  alone. No doubt I wasted a lot of time reinventing the wheel, but
  I loved the sensation of "having my own lab."</p>

  <p>For graduate school I returned to
  Cambridge. In the spring of 1985, shopping around for a graduate
  school and a research project, I met Dave Pritchard at MIT. He
  spun me a wonderful yarn: by very precisely measuring the mass
  difference between the helium-3 and tritium, one can determine
  the total amount of energy released in the beta decay of tritium.
  Combine this mass measurement with a determination (no big deal,
  Dave implied) of the endpoint of the beta-ray spectrum, and one
  has measured the rest mass of the electron neutrino! There were
  hints, in those days, that the neutrino might have a rest mass as
  large as ten eV, a value of cosmological significance. Think of
  it, Dave said: working with two or three other students on a
  bench-top experiment, one might just find the missing dark mass
  and close the universe! It sounded awfully good to me. It still
  does, as I retell it today.</p>

  <p>Thus in the fall of 1985 I joined Dave's
  single-ion cyclotron resonance experiment. The idea was to trap a
  single ion in a Penning trap, measure its cyclotron frequency to
  great accuracy, then swap in a different species of ion and do a
  comparison measurement. The ratio of cyclotron frequencies should
  be just the inverse of the ratio of masses. Two graduate
  students, Robert Weisskoff and Bob Flanagan, and a postdoc, Greg
  Lafyatis, had the apparatus designed and largely assembled by the
  time I arrived, but we didn't succeed in trapping and detecting
  single ions until three years later. The work got to be pretty
  frustrating and when at last one morning Robert finally acquired
  the definitive signal from a single ion, he said "That is that."
  By that afternoon he had begun writing his thesis and he did not
  return to the ion lab again. A new graduate student Kevin Boyce
  had recently joined the group and the two of us spent a couple of
  years learning how to make precision measurements on the single
  ions.</p>

  <p>It is hard to overstate how much I learned
  from Dave Pritchard over my five years as a graduate student. He
  was seldom in the lab, but he ate lunch with us students several
  days a week, and held regular progress meetings as well. Meeting
  with Dave could be a fairly overwhelming experience. He
  frequently was in a sort of quizmaster mode, in which he peppered
  his student with questions. "How big is this effect? You don't
  know? That's fine, but why don't you estimate it for me then? No,
  don't offer to go away and think about it - work it out right
  now, out loud, for the benefit of all of us here." His quiz
  sessions could be aggravating or even intimidating, but in the
  end I found them to be great training. Dave liked to show us how
  widely disparate effects in quantum and classical physics could
  be understood with the same basic and rather small set of ideas
  such as resonance, adiabaticity, stationary points, dressed
  states, entropy and so on. To this day I have ambitions of
  designing a course called "The Seven Most Useful Ideas in
  Physics," that would somehow condense and codify the Pritchardian
  wisdom. Thus it was that when my five years of grad school were
  over, while I had come nowhere near to finding the Universe's
  missing mass, I still felt enthused enough about physics research
  to proceed on to a postdoc.</p>

  <p>There are relatively few experiments in
  atomic physics these days that don't involve the use of a laser.
  One major shortcoming in my graduate education in preparing me
  for a career in atomic physics research was that I had not
  learned any laser techniques. I felt my postdoctoral job had
  better fill in that lacuna. Looking for a postdoc job, I made the
  usual rounds, visiting Yale, Stanford, Bell Labs, Gaithersburg, and so on. Laser
  cooling was in its heyday in 1990, and as I traveled around I saw
  all the major programs. I was a little daunted by the size and
  complexity of the experiments, and worried also that maybe all
  the really interesting experiments had already been done.
  Finally, I went out to Boulder to give a talk to <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/">Dave Wineland</a>'s
  group in NIST labs. Dave Wineland was and is one of
  the towering figures in ion trapping, so I felt a little foolish,
  earnestly describing to his group my modest contribution, but I
  soldiered on through my talk. No job offer was forthcoming, but
  as luck would have it, in the audience was a former
  Wineland-group postdoc, Sarah Gilbert. Sarah called her husband,
  Carl Wieman, who was looking to hire a postdoc, and suggested
  that he invite me to make the one kilometer trek from NIST labs
  over to JILA, on the University of Colorado campus, to visit his
  lab. At this time the main focus of Carl's research was on
  precision measurements of parity violation in cesium, but my
  attention was immediately drawn to his smaller, laser cooling
  experiment. In contrast to the other laser cooling experiments I
  had seen, which took up the better part of a room, Carl's
  experiment could have fit on a card table. Using diode lasers
  instead of Ar<sup>+</sup>-pumped dye lasers, and using a tiny
  little vapor cell instead of an atomic beam machine, the whole
  experiment seemed accessible and compact, even cute. There was
  just one graduate student working on the project, and this
  impressed me as well - if a single student could make it work,
  how hard could it be? (It would be almost a year later before I
  realized that Chris Monroe was not exactly an average graduate
  student!) It was clear to me that during a two-year postdoc I
  could learn how to make a fun little laser-cooling set up like
  Carl's, and, looking ahead, it also seemed to me that I could
  duplicate such an experiment as an assistant professor without
  much trouble. It would be sufficiently easy to constract that
  that I would have energy, time and money left over to use the
  cold atoms in turn to study something else; I would not be
  compelled to catch up with the established major AMO groups that
  were studying the cooling process itself.</p>

  <p>With an offer from Carl in my pocket, I
  went back to Cambridge to write up my dissertation. While
  considering the offer, I began to think for the first time of
  attempting to see Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). BEC was a
  natural thing for atomic physics student at MIT to think about:
  occupying the office next to Dave Pritchard was Dan Kleppner,
  co-leader (with Tom Greytak) of one of the major groups
  attempting to see BEC in spin-polarized hydrogen. The idea of BEC
  was in the air, and I had seen a number of talks on the topic.
  Just a year earlier the MIT BEC group had dramatically succeeded
  in implementing evaporative cooling out of a magnetic trap, a
  clever idea due to Harold Hess. The MIT hydrogen experiment was
  daunting in its size and complexity, whereas it seemed to me that
  if one took as one's starting point the relatively tractable
  vapor-cell, laser-cooling technology that Wieman was using, it
  wouldn't be so much of a stretch to imagine souping it up into an
  apparatus capable of evaporatively cooling to BEC. So I decided
  to head off to Boulder for a couple of years.</p>

  <p>After accepting Carl's offer I postponed
  actually moving to Boulder for three months while my then
  girlfriend finished her PhD as well. In the meantime I took a
  very short-term postdoctoral position working with Joel Parks at
  the Rowland Institute, helping him design and build a Paul trap
  for ionized atomic clusters.</p>

  <p>In October of 1990 I arrived in Boulder. I
  found working with Carl to be a very congenial experience. Carl
  and I share very similar tastes in what makes for an interesting
  physics experiment, and I was happy to assimilate a fraction of
  his seemingly endless bag of technological ideas. Carl taught me
  to decide what part of the experimental apparatus really
  mattered, and then to spare no effort improving that part.
  Conversely, Carl emphasized that one needs to recognize where
  "good enough" was indeed good enough, and to waste no time
  worrying about it. I learned from Carl's student, Chris Monroe,
  as well. I had always been reluctant to mess with the innards of
  a store-bought piece of equipment, lest I break something. Chris'
  ever-fearless attitude was, if that gizmo isn't doing what we
  need it to do now, how much worse off will we be even if we
  <i>do</i> break it? As my two-year postdoctoral appointment wound
  up, Carl, Chris and I had essentially defined what needed to be
  done to make BEC with the hybridized method of laser cooling
  followed by magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling.</p>

  <p>During those early years in Boulder, I
  spent a lot of time trying to imagine what a Bose-Einstein
  condensate would be like, if we could ever make one. Would it be
  superfluid, like liquid helium? Would it be coherent, like a
  laser? What do "superfluid" and "coherent" really mean? I
  understood these words in the context of the experiments the
  words had been invented to describe, or at least I thought I did,
  but it seemed to me that to understand how these words applied to
  a dramatically different physical system, one had to have a much
  deeper understanding. Superfluidity and lasing were two of my
  favorite topics in physics, but each was surrounded by a vast
  thicket of lore and literature. It was hard to step off of the
  well-worn paths through these thickets, hard for a newcomer to
  get a fresh look at the underlying phenomena. If one could make a
  gas-phase condensate, one would have a less brambled system
  against which to test one's own physical intuition. Meditations
  along these lines converted me from BEC dabbler to true
  believer.</p>

  <p>It was with some zealotry, then, that I
  took the "hybrid cooling to BEC" pitch on the road in 1992, in an
  effort to find a faculty job. Berkeley and MIT did not bite, but
  I had offers from Haverford College, University of
  Virginia and JILA/NIST. The environment at JILA for doing AMO
  research was so strong, I decided to accept their offer and
  remain, against the advice of several people who pointed out the
  potential risks of remaining in the shadow of my postdoctoral
  advisor. As it turned out, over the years Carl was to be
  extremely fair in the sharing of credit, and I have never
  regretted my decision to stay at JILA.</p>

  <p>The scientific developments from 1990 to
  1995 leading to BEC are discussed in the companion article. In
  the mid-1990s I ran a secondary research project in parallel with
  my BEC effort. The idea was to extend the techniques of laser
  cooling into solid-state systems. We never got it to work. In the
  end, my sunny optimism was trumped by my complete lack of
  training in solidstate spectroscopy. As it turned out, a group at
  Los Alamos National Labs has since successfully cooled a solid
  using a related experimental approach. Also in the mid-90s, Dana
  Anderson and I began a project to construct waveguides for matter
  waves. Our first successes were based on hollow glass fibers, but
  our ongoing collaboration now focuses on guiding atoms with the
  magnetic fields from lithographically patterned wires. The bulk
  of my group's research efforts over the last seven years has
  focused on elucidating the properties of BEC. With every passing
  year, BEC proves that it still has surprises left for us. Most
  lately my group has been pursuing studies of quantized vortices
  in BEC and of spin-waves in ultra-cold atoms. This latter work
  required us to retreat back above the BEC transition temperature!
  (Although we are still comfortably within a millionth of a degree
  of absolute zero.)</p>

  <p>I have been very fortunate over the years
  in the graduate students and postdocs who have come to work in my
  lab. Their hard work, talent and creativity have made me look
  good. I have been fortunate also to live in a society that values
  scientific research, and is willing to support people to do
  it.</p>

  <p>In 1993, Celeste Landry and I rekindled an
  old romance and we were married in January of 1995, in the
  Stanford Faculty Club. At the time of our wedding, I had upcoming
  professional travel to the ICOLS conference in Capri scheduled
  for June, and we planned to delay our honeymoon until then. Just
  two weeks before the ICOLS conference, the BEC experiment finally
  succeeded. In beautiful Capri, with lovely Celeste, I felt on top
  of the world.</p>

  <p>The next year I experienced a still keener
  pleasure, attending the birth of our daughter, Eliza. Her younger
  sister, Sophia, arrived in 1998. The four of us live in an old
  brick house in the shade of two large silver maples in central
  Boulder.</p>
