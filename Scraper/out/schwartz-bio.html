  <h1>Melvin Schwartz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schwartz.jpg" class="bio-img">Having been born in 1932, at the
  peak of the great depression, I grew up in difficult times. My
  parents worked extraordinarily hard to give us economic stability
  but at the same time they managed to instill in me two qualities
  which became the foundation of my personal and professional life.
  One is an unbounded sense of optimism; the other is a strong
  feeling as to the importance of using one's mind for the
  betterment of mankind.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in Physics really began at the age of 12 when I
  entered the Bronx High School of Science in New York. That school
  has become famous for the large number of outstanding individuals
  it has produced including among them four Nobel Laureates in
  Physics. The four years I spent there were certainly among the
  most exciting and stimulating of my life, mostly because of the
  interaction with other students having similar background,
  interest and ability. It's rather amazing how important the
  interaction with the one's peers can be at that age in
  determining one's direction and success in life.<br>
  <br>
  Upon graduating from high school the path to follow was fairly
  obvious. The Columbia Physics Department at that time was
  unmatched by any in the world. Largely a product of the late
  <a href="../1944/index.html">Professor I.I. Rabi</a>, it was
  a-department which was to provide the ambiance for six Nobel
  Prize pieces of work in widely diverse fields during the next
  thirteen years. And, in addition, it was the host for a period of
  time to another half dozen or so future Nobel Laureates either as
  students or as post-doctoral researchers. I know of no other
  institution either before or since that has come close to that
  record.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, it was that I became an undergraduate at Columbia in 1949,
  to stay there through my graduate years and take up a faculty
  position as Assistant Professor in 1958. I became an Associate
  Professor in 1960 and a Professor in 1963.<br>
  <br>
  In order for me to put my life into perspective, I must mention
  four individuals who have given it meaning, direction and focus.
  Foremost among these is my wife Marilyn whom I married 35 years
  ago and who has provided the one most enduring thread throughout
  these years. Without her constant encouragement and enthusiasm
  there would have been far less meaning to my life. The second is
  of course Jack Steinberger. Jack was my teacher, my mentor and my
  closest colleague during my years at Columbia. Whatever taste and
  judgement I have ever had in the field of Particle Physics came
  from Jack. Third of course is <a href="../1957/index.html">T.D.
  Lee</a>. He was the inspirer of this experiment and the person
  who has served as a constant sounding board for any ideas I have
  had. He has also become, I am proud to say, a dear personal
  friend. And finally, my close collaborator Leon Lederman. If
  there is any one person who has served as the sparkplug for high
  energy physics in the U.S. it has been Leon. I am proud to have
  been his collaborator.<br>
  <br>
  In 1966, after having spent 17 years at Columbia, I decided to
  move West to Stanford, where a new accelerator was just being
  completed. During the ensuing years I was involved in two major
  research efforts. The first of these investigated the charge
  asymmetry in the decay of the long-lived neutral kaon. The second
  of these, which was quite unique, succeeded in producing and
  detecting relativistic hydrogen-like atoms each made up of a pion
  and a muon.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1970's, lured in part by the new industrial revolution
  in "Silicon Valley" I decided to try my hand at a totally new
  adventure. Digital Pathways, Inc. of which I am currently the
  Chief Executive Officer is a company dedicated to the secure
  management of data communications. Although it is difficult to
  predict the future I still have all the optimism that I had back
  when I first grew up in New York-life can be a marvelous
  adventure.<br>

  <i>(added in 1991):</i> A new change in my career occurred in
  February 1991 when I became Associate Director, High Energy and
  Nuclear Physics, at Brookhaven National Laboratory.</p>
