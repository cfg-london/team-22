  <h1>Charles G. Dawes - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dawes.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Charles
  Gates Dawes</b> (August 27, 1865-April 23, 1951) pursued two
  careers during his lifetime, one in business and finance, the
  other in public service. He was at the height of his fame in both
  in 1926 when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1925. He
  was the vice-president of the United States; he had achieved
  worldwide recognition for his report on German reparations in
  1924; he had a secure reputation as a financier.<br>
  <br>
  By ancestry he was destined for a life of such duality. His
  father had distinguished himself in the Civil War, achieving the
  rank of brevet brigadier general; an uncle had given his life.
  Four generations earlier, William Dawes had ridden with Paul
  Revere on April 18, 1775, to warn the Massachusetts colonists of
  the British advance which signalized the opening of the American
  Revolution; and seven generations earlier in 1628 the first
  William Dawes had been among the Puritans who came to America.
  Financial acumen was just as natural a heritage as active
  patriotism. Dawes's father owned and managed a lumber company in
  Marietta, Ohio; an uncle was a prosperous banker.<br>
  <br>
  Since Charles Dawes's mother had graduated from Marietta College
  and his father was on its Board of Trustees, it was almost
  inevitable that he would enroll there. He received his bachelor's
  degree in 1884 at the age of nineteen, studied for two years in
  the Law School of the University of Cincinnati, and returned to Marietta
  to earn a master's degree.<br>
  <br>
  In 1887 he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, more to participate in the
  advantages of a fast-growing economy than to engage in the
  practice of law. In the seven years he lived there he earned a
  reputation as an intelligent, ingenious, persuasive, alert
  businessman. He controlled a city block of business offices,
  controlled a meat packing company, acted as director of a bank,
  and was an investor in land and in bank stocks. He laid the
  foundation for his large personal fortune in 1894, however, when
  he purchased control of a plant manufacturing artificial gas in
  La Crosse, Wisconsin, and of another plant immediately to the
  north of Chicago. Eventually, he and his brothers controlled
  twenty-eight gas and electric plants in ten states. To be near
  his main business office, he made his home in Evanston, a suburb
  to the north of Chicago, residing there until his death.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902, turning over to his brothers the management of the
  utilities, he entered the third phase of his business career,
  that of banking. He founded and became president of the Central
  Trust Company of Illinois, often referred to as the &laquo;Dawes
  Bank&raquo;, and spent virtually full time in its management until
  1917.<br>
  <br>
  The comptrollership of the currency was Dawes's first official
  governmental position. President William McKinley, for whom he had acted as
  a fund raiser in the 1896 campaign, had appointed him in 1898,
  and in 1901 promised to support him as a candidate for the Senate
  from Illinois. When McKinley was assassinated, Dawes, shorn of
  presidential support, withdrew his candidacy.<br>
  <br>
  In 1917 Dawes received his commission as a major in the army and
  twenty-six months later was discharged as a brigadier general.
  While on General Pershing's staff he integrated the
  system of supply procurement and distribution for the entire
  American Expeditionary Force and later performed an analogous
  service for the Allies by devising an inter-Allied purchasing
  board, as well as a unified distribution authority. In 1919,
  despite the opposition raised by his own Republican Party, he
  strongly urged the Congress to accept the Treaty of Versailles
  and the League of Nations.<br>
  <br>
  In 1920, appointed to the newly inaugurated position of Director
  of the Budget, Dawes applied his conceptions of efficiency and
  unity to the reform of budgetary procedures in the United States
  government. His most important reform resulted from his
  insistence that each department of the government prepare a true
  budget projecting future expenditures and stay within it. It is
  estimated that this reform and others, notably the unification of
  purchasing, saved the government about two billion dollars in the
  first year.<br>
  <br>
  The League of Nations late in 1923 invited Dawes to chair a
  committee to deal with the question of German reparations. The
  &laquo;Dawes Report&raquo;, submitted in April, 1924, provided
  facts on Germany's budget and resources, outlined measures needed
  to stabilize the currency, and suggested a schedule of payments
  on a sliding scale. For his masterly handling of this crucial
  international problem, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; he
  donated the money to the endowment of the newly established
  Walter Hines Page<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a> School of
  International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.<br>
  <br>
  From 1924 to 1932, Dawes devoted his entire attention to public
  service. He was elected to the vice-presidency of the United
  States in 1924, serving in Office from 1925 to 1929. In 1929,
  when the Dominican Republic requested advice on improving the
  financial operation of its government, Dawes headed a commission
  whose extensive recommendations for reform were later adopted.
  From June of 1929 to January of 1932, Dawes was the U.S.
  ambassador to Great Britain. In 1930 he was a delegate to the
  London Naval Conference; in 1932 he accepted the chairmanship of
  the American delegation to the Disarmament Conference in Geneva
  but resigned to accept the chairmanship of the Reconstruction
  Finance Corporation, a governmental agency empowered to lend
  money to banks, railroads, and other businesses in effort to
  prevent total economic collapse during the depression.<br>
  <br>
  Dawes was a disciplined and productive man. He led a full life in
  the commercial and political world until the age of sixty-seven;
  he wrote nine books; he discharged countless civic duties. Even
  in music he excelled. He performed on the flute and piano;
  composed a melody that Fritz Kreisler, the noted violinist, often
  played as an encore; combined his interest in music and his
  acumen in business to establish grand opera in Chicago. Withal he
  found time for family life. He admired his father and uncle; he
  brought his brothers into his business enterprises; and he was
  devoted to his wife and to his son and daughter, suffering
  intensely when his son was drowned in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,
  while on summer vacation from Princeton University.<br>
  <br>
  Dawes was a forthright man given to forthright talk. His
  nickname, &laquo;Hell and Maria&raquo; Dawes, came from some words
  uttered before a congressional committee investigating charges of
  waste and extravagance in the conduct of World War I. When a
  member of the committee asked Dawes if it was true that excessive
  prices were paid for mules in France, he shouted &laquo;Helen
  Maria, I'd have paid horse prices for sheep if the sheep could
  have pulled artillery to the front!&raquo;<a href=

  <br>
  He died of a coronary thrombosis at his Evanston home on April
  23, 1951.</p>
