  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not_1" id="not_1"></a>1. W.H. Page
  (1855-1918), American writer, editor, and diplomat; cofounder of
  Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., a publishing firm; ambassador to Great
  Britain (1913-1918).<br>
  <br>
  <a name="not_2" id="not_2"></a>2. Apparently &laquo;Helen
  Maria&raquo; was an expletive in common usage in Nebraska. The
  newspapers printed it as &laquo;Hell and Maria&raquo;, and that
  form stuck. Timmons tells the story in detail in <i>Portrait of
  an American</i>, pp. 193-198; Dawes also tells the story but
  leaves out the crucial phrase in <i>Notes as Vice President</i>,
  pp. 9-13.</p>
