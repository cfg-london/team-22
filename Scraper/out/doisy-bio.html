  <h1>Edward A. Doisy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="doisy.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Edward
  Adelbert Doisy</b> was born at Hume, Illinois, on November 13,
  1893. He was the son of Edward Perez and his wife Ada,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alley.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at the University of Illinois, where he took his
  A.B. degree in 1914 and his M.S. degree in 1916. From there he
  went to Harvard
  University, where he took his Ph.D. degree in 1920.<br>
  <br>
  From 1915 until 1917 he was assistant in biochemistry at Harvard Medical
  School and from 1917 until 1919 he did war service in the
  Sanitary Corps of the United States Army. From 1919 until 1923 he
  was Instructor, Associate, and Associate Professor at Washington University
  School of Medicine and in 1923 he became Professor of
  Biochemistry at St. Louis University School of Medicine. In
  1924 he was appointed Director of the Department of
  Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Doisy has been concerned chiefly with biochemical studies of the
  sex hormones and vitamins K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>. At the
  St. Louis School of Medicine he worked in collaboration with
  Edgar Allen on the refinement of the vaginal cytology (or smear)
  technique for the big-assay of the potency of oestrogenic
  hormones in ovariectomized rats.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929-1930 he succeeded in isolating oestrone, a feat
  independently accomplished at about the same time by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1939/index.html">Butenandt</a> in
  Germany.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936, in collaboration with MacCorquodale and Thayer, he
  recovered oestradiol from the ovaries of swine and estimated its
  concentration in the liquor folliculi.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 he succeeded in isolating vitamin K, which had been
  found, in 1935, by Almquist and Stokstad in alfalfa. Vitamin K
  was isolated in an almost pure form as a yellow oil by <a href=
  "index.html">Henrik Dam</a>, in collaboration with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/index.html">Paul Karrer</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 Doisy, in collaboration with Thayer, MacCorquodale,
  McKee, and Binkley, studied the analogues of vitamin K and
  established the distinction between vitamin K<sub>1</sub> which
  they isolated from alfalfa, and vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, isolated
  from fish meal, which has an action similar to that of vitamin
  K<sub>1</sub>, but has a slightly different constitution.<br>
  <br>
  Vitamin K was synthesized in 1939 by Louis Frederick Fieser and
  by Almquist and Klose, and by Doisy and his collaborators.<br>
  <br>
  For their work on vitamin K, Doisy and Dam were jointly awarded
  the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1943.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the work just mentioned, Doisy has improved the
  methods used for the isolation and identification of insulin and
  he has also made important contributions to the knowledge of
  antibiotics and blood buffer systems, and bile acid
  metabolism.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 Doisy published, in collaboration with Edgar Allen and C.
  H. Danforth, a book entitled <i>Sex and Internal
  Secretions.</i><br>
  <br>
  Apart from several medals and awards, Doisy holds honorary
  degrees of Yale, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, St. Louis, Central College;
  Gustavus Adolphus
  College, and Paris Universities. In 1932 and 1935, he was a
  member of the League of Nations Committee for the Standardization
  of Sex Hormones. He was President of the American Society of
  Biological Chemists in 1943-1945, of the Endocrine
  Society in 1949-1950, and of the Society for Experimental
  Biology and Medicine in 1949-1951.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955 his Department was renamed the Edward A. Doisy Department
  in his honour.<br>
  <br>
  Doisy married Alice Ackert in 1918. They live at St. Louis, Mo,
  and have four sons, Edward A. Jr., Robert, Philip, and
  Richard.</p>
