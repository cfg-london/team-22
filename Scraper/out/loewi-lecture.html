  <h2>The Chemical Transmission of Nerve Action</h2>

  <p>Natural or artificial stimulation of nerves
  gives rise to a process of progressive excitation in them,
  leading to a response in the effector organ of the nerves
  concerned.</p>

  <p>Up until the year 1921 it was not known how
  the stimulation of a nerve influenced the effector organ's
  function, in other words, in what way the stimulation was
  transmitted to the effector organ from the nerve-ending. In
  general it was thought that it came about through direct
  transmission of the stimulation wave from the nerve fibre to the
  effector organ. But the possibility of transmission by chemical
  means had also been considered and experiments had been conducted
  on these lines. As a result of his own experiments,
  Howell<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> had come to believe
  that vagus stimulation released potassium in the heart and that
  this was the cause of the resultant effect, and Bayliss<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> discussed the possibility, in view
  of the similarity in action of the so-called vagomimetic
  substances and chorda stimulation, that this stimulation might be
  caused by the production of such substances. Although these data
  were known to me, my attention was only drawn years after my
  discovery to the fact that earlier (in 1904 to be exact)
  Elliott<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, in the last
  paragraph of a short note, suggested the possibility that the
  stimulation of sympathetic nerves might be brought about by the
  release of adrenaline, and that Dixon<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> had already communicated
  experiments in an inaccessible site to test whether, during vagus
  stimulation, a substance was released which contributed to the
  stimulation reaction.</p>

  <p>In the year 1921 I was successful for the
  first times in obtaining certain proof that by stimulation of the
  nerves in a frog's heart substances were released which to some
  extent passed into the heart fluid and, when transferred with
  this into a test heart, caused it to react in exactly the same
  way as the stimulation of the corresponding nerves. In this way
  it was proved that the nerves do not act directly upon the heart,
  but rather that the direct result of nerve stimulation is the
  release of chemical substances and that it is these which bring
  directly about characteristic changes of function in the
  heart.</p>

  <p>It was, of course, possible right from the
  start that this mechanism which I described at the time as
  "humoral transference", but which is now known as "chemical"
  transference as the result of a well-founded suggestion by H.H.
  Dale, does not represent an isolated phenomenon but a special
  condition which also appears elsewhere. We shall soon see that
  this supposition was justified. But before I go into that I
  should like to characterize in more detail the substances which
  are released by nerve stimulation and produce the effect. First
  of all, I must mention my distinguished collaborators E.
  Navratil, W. Witanowski, and E. Engelhart, and thank them.</p>

  <p>Let me begin with the transfer medium of
  the reaction in vagus stimulation which I have called "vagus
  substance". We were able to determine that its effect is
  inhibited by atropine<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> and
  very quickly disappear<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>. In
  looking for a substance with both these characteristics, I found
  that out of a series of the known vagomimetic substances,
  muscarine, piloearpin, choline, and acetylcholine, only the
  last-named possessed them<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
  We were then able to establish further that the rapid
  disappearance of the action of the vagus substance and
  acetylcholine (Ac.Ch.) through the breaking down of these
  substances was caused by the action of an esterase in the
  heart<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, which had already
  been postulated by Dale<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>. I
  was able to show furthermore that the action of this esterase
  could be specifically inhibited through minimum concentrations of
  eserine<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>. This discovery was
  important not only because, for the first time, the operational
  mechanism of an alkaloid had been revealed, but especially
  because the discovery enabled the theory of the chemical
  transference of nerve stimulation to be developed for the first
  time. On the one hand, this eserine action provided a means of
  revealing the minimal quantities of Ac.Ch. being released by
  nerve stimulation which would otherwise, because of their rapid
  destructibility, have remained undisclosed. On the other hand, we
  are able, in cases where for any reason it is technically
  impossible or difficult to prove directly the release of Ac.Ch.
  in nerve stimulation, to draw the conclusion indirectly from the
  increase in effect of nerve stimulation after previous
  eserination that the nerve stimulation is being produced by the
  release of Ac.Ch. And now we must return to the characterization
  of the vagus substance.</p>

  <p>The vagus substance behaves identically
  with Ac.Ch. not only in regard to its reaction to atropine, and
  to its destructibility with esterase but also concerning all
  other characteristics. As Dale and Dudley<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> were able to produce it directly
  from the organs, there can be no more doubt that the vagus
  substance is Ac.Ch. and in future I shall refer to it as
  such.</p>

  <p>As regards the character of the substance
  which is released through stimulation of the sympathetic nerves
  of the heart and other organs, I was able to show earlier that it
  shares many properties with adrenaline; both, for example, are
  destroyed by alkali<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a> and by
  fluorescence and ultraviolet light<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, the activity of both is abolished
  by ergotamine<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>; on the
  other hand, as Cannon and Rosenblueth<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> have shown, it is raised by small
  and in themselves ineffective quantities of cocaine, the
  adrenaline-sensitizing action of which Fr&ouml;hlich and
  I<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> found some 25 years
  ago.</p>

  <p>Like the effect of adrenaline, an equal
  effective strength of the sympathicus substance declines very
  slowly in the heart, much more slowly incidentally than might
  have been expected in view of the rapid oxidizability of
  adrenaline or sympathicus substance in vitro. The cause of this,
  as revealed by Dr. Ralph Smith of Ann Arbor and me in a series of
  specially conducted experiments not as yet published, turns out
  to be the giving off of substances from the heart which inhibit
  adrenaline oxidation. There must, of course, be some
  physiological purpose in the fact that individual devices exist,
  on the one hand to remove the acetylcholine as quickly as
  possible and the adrenaline, on the other hand, as slowly as
  possible. And now we must return to the chemical nature of the
  sympathicus substance.</p>

  <p>Although for some time it had been
  considered probable after all we had seen that the sympathicus
  substance was adrenaline, I was only able to give direct proof of
  it this year. Gaddum and Schild<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>, on the basis of a statement by
  Paget, investigated the significance of a green fluorescence
  visible in ultraviolet light which pointed to adrenaline in the
  presence of O<sub>2</sub>, and alkali, and found that this
  appears to a high degree specific for adrenaline. I was now able
  to show that not only the heart extract, but also the heart
  fluid, shows this reaction after accelerated periods of
  stimulation<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Accordingly I
  consider it proved that the sympathicus substance is
  adrenaline.</p>

  <p>Now I must briefly consider the question of
  to what extent the neuro-chemical mechanism, that is to say the
  chemical transference of nerve stimulation, is important other
  than to the heart.</p>

  <p>Firstly, Rylant<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> and others were able to show that
  with warm-blooded animals too, vagus stimulation released Ac.Ch.
  which was responsible for the resultant stimulation reaction. I
  must mention in this connection that my collaborator
  Engelhart<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> was able to
  show, in accordance with the well-known fact that the heart vagus
  in warm-blooded animals ends at the auricular/ ventricular
  boundary, that here considerably more Ac.Ch. was to be found
  before and after stimulation in the auricle than in the
  ventricle, whereas in a frog's heart, where the vagus extends
  over the ventricle as well, the distribution of Ac.Ch. over
  auricle and ventricle is even. As the heart vagus belongs to the
  parasympathetic system, the question had to be examined whether
  and to what extent the neurochemical mechanism applied here. The
  first investigation on this point also came from my Institute,
  from Engelhart<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> , who was
  able to prove the release of Ac.Ch. as a result of stimulation of
  the oculomotor nerve. The total result of the many different,
  resultant investigations on various organs can be summarized by
  saying that up until now no single case is known in which the
  effect of the stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves was not
  caused by the release of Ac.Ch.</p>

  <p>As, to my mind, a lecture should concern
  itself not only with results, but also with still open questions,
  I must touch on the following: As all activity caused by the
  application of Ac.Ch. can be halted by atropine, one might expect
  that wherever Ac.Ch. is released as a result of nerve
  stimulation, the effect could everywhere be halted by atropine.
  This, however, is not so. Contractions of the bladder after
  stimulation of the pelvic nerve, dilation of the vessels of the
  salivary gland after stimulation of the chorda nerve still occur
  even after atropinization. And here we must mention the following
  strange observation by V.E. Henderson<sup><a href=
  "#footnote17">17</a></sup>: he found that after preliminary
  atropinization, vagus stimulation in the intestine produced no
  increase of tonus, but an increase of peristaltic contractions.
  The reason for these remarkable exceptions has so far escaped
  us.</p>

  <p>The neurochemical mechanism is everywhere
  apparent in the field of activity of the parasympathetic system,
  as in the sympathetic system. But we have Dale<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> and his collaborators to thank
  for the recognition that the stimulation of certain nerve fibres
  which belong anatomically to the sympathetic system lead to the
  release, not of adrenaline, as in the overwhelmingly large number
  of cases, but of Ac.Ch.</p>

  <p>To sum up then, it may be said that the
  neurochemical mechanism applies in the stimulation of all
  autonomic nerves.</p>

  <p>But it also embraces a much wider area. We
  owe this knowledge in the main to the basic investigations of
  Dale. There is no need, therefore, for me to go further into this
  in my lecture.</p>

  <p>We now have to discuss the important
  question of whether the nerve stimulation influences only the
  function of the effector organ by the release of nerve
  substances, as I will call the chemical transmitters for the sake
  of briefness, or whether it perhaps exerts another influence as
  well.</p>

  <p>Here we shall be well advised to take as a
  starting-point the mechanism of action of atropine or ergotamine.
  With Navratil<a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> I was able
  to show (and this finding was confirmed many times over) that
  these alkaloids do not, as had been thought previously, attack
  and incapacitate the nerves themselves. We were able to show this
  by demonstrating that even after using atropine and ergotamine,
  nerve stimulation still released nerve substances. This shows
  that atropine and ergotamine do not impair the function of the
  nerves, which is a liberating one, that is to say, they do not
  paralyse the nerves, but exert an antagonistic influence on the
  action of the substances produced. By recognizing that after
  previous application of atropine or ergotamine the stimulation of
  the respective nerves is known to have no effect at all upon the
  effector organ, it has been proved that nerve stimulation has no
  other effect but to release nerve substances. What other kind of
  function can remain for the nerve if the action of the substance
  released coincides absolutely with the effect of the nerve
  stimulation? Although what follows is self-explanatory, I still
  think it desirable to state it expressly: in all cases in which
  the neurochemical mechanism occurs, the nerves only control
  function to the extent of the release of the substance: the place
  where this occurs is in the effector organ of the nerve. From
  then onwards, the released substance exerts control: the
  functioning organ is, therefore, <i>its</i> effector organ
  exclusively.</p>

  <p>And now we must consider in which
  directions our knowledge of the physiological process has been
  extended, beyond what we have already said, by the discovery of
  the neurochemical mechanism.</p>

  <p>There will be no cause for argument if we
  see the most importance in the fact that at last a clear answer
  has been found to the age-old question as to the nature of the
  stimulus-transfer from nerve to effector organ.</p>

  <p>Next in importance appears to me to be the
  explanation of the nature of the peripheral inhibition. Up until
  now, it appeared quite inconceivable that the stimulation of a
  nerve could lead to inhibition in the effector organ. With the
  proof that this inhibition comes about because the nerve releases
  a function-inhibiting substance, the reason for it becomes clear.
  At the same time, however, something else is proved which seems
  to me to be of great importance: the release of a substance by
  the nerves is the expression of a positive function, an
  activation. This proves that the <i>direct</i> effect of the
  stimulation of all nerves, whether activating or inhibitory,
  represents a promotion of function, for this is what the release
  of the substance does.</p>

  <p>Today, because we know how it happens, this
  solution strikes us as self-evident. For, since the process of
  stimulation is, to a certain degree, unspecific and furthermore
  interference in stimulus frequencies which certainly form the
  basis of some inhibitory manifestations in the animal region of
  the central nervous system cannot, in the case of peripherally
  inhibitable organs, be regarded as the cause of inhibition, I see
  no other possibility, at least in general, as to how nerve
  stimulation can lead to inhibitions of the effector organ at all
  than by chemical means; in other words, the chemical mechanism is
  the only conceivable way.</p>

  <p>So much for the field of activity and the
  importance of the neurochemical mechanism.</p>

  <p>After this description which touches upon
  the general nature only of the neurochemical mechanism, we will
  now consider more exactly its finer mechanism.</p>

  <p>First of all the question arises: where are
  the substances released by nerve stimulation localized, or, in
  other words, where is the point of attack of the nerve
  stimulation? A priori, two possibilities exist: the substances
  are released in the nerve endings or in the effector organ.
  Investigations of this question carried out so far are concerned
  only with Ac.Ch.</p>

  <p>For the time being we shall only draw upon
  findings which concern the Ac.Ch. content of organs after nerve
  degeneration.</p>

  <p>As far back as 30 years ago,
  Anderson<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> observed the
  following: after degenerative division of the oculomotor nerve,
  light stimulation was for a long time without effect, regardless
  of whether the eye had been eserinized or not. There followed a
  period when light stimulus was still ineffective to the
  uneserinized eye, but not to the eserinized eye. At this moment,
  as could be shown, a weak regeneration of the oculomotor nerve
  had begun. In Anderson's time it was not possible to give an
  adequate explanation of these findings. Today, when we know that
  oculomotor stimulation releases AC.Ch., the action of eserine is
  revealed as being simply to increase the effect of the Ac.Ch. by
  inhibiting that of the esterase, and Anderson's results become
  absolutely clear. With degeneration of the oculomotor nerve the
  Ac.Ch. disappears. Eserine then also becomes ineffective. With
  the start of regeneration of the oculomotor nerve the Ac.Ch.
  appears again, but in too small quantities to cause miosis with
  light stimulus alone, i.e. without the increased activity
  provided by eserine. Thus Anderson's experiments provide the
  first proof that the existence of Ac.Ch. in the eye is dependent
  upon the nerves. Later Engelhart<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> in my own Institute produced this
  proof in a direct manner. With direct Ac.Ch. determination he
  found that after degeneration of the oculomotor nerve in corpus
  ciliare and iris, the Ac.Ch., present in considerable quantities
  in preserved nerves, completely disappears. This shows that, in
  many organs at any rate, the Ac.Ch. content and its maintenance
  is connected with the presence of the nerve. There are two
  possible explanations for the disappearance of the Ac.Ch. after
  nerve degeneration. Either the Ac.Ch. is a part of the nerve and
  disappears then naturally with its degeneration, or it belongs to
  the effector organ. Then we should have to assume that the
  formation and maintenance of the Ac.Ch. amount in the effector
  organ was, in some mysterious and trophic manner, dependent upon
  the nerve, so that it would disappear with its degeneration.
  Should the Ac.Ch. be a product of the effector organ and not the
  nerve ending, then, according to Dale, it would have to
  disappear, after degeneration, through some kind of atrophy. This
  hypothesis would then require a further subhypothesis, that of
  separate and specific transmission system in the effector organ
  quite unlike any other. This assumption would be necessary,
  because, after oculomotor nerve degeneration, the effector
  organs, corpus ciliare and iris do not degenerate, and yet the
  Ac.Ch. disappears. The influence of the oculomotor nerve
  degeneration must, in that case, only extend to the mysterious
  transmission system. In respect of these difficulties alone, a
  far likelier assumption is that the Ac.Ch. which is released by
  nerve stimulation belongs to the neurone itself, or more exactly
  to the nerve ending. There is in my opinion, in at least one
  instance, compelling proof for the correctness of this
  supposition.</p>

  <p>In Dale's Institute, Feldberg and
  Gaddum<a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> have shown that
  stimulation of the preganglionic sympathetic fibres in the neck
  releases Ac.Ch. in the sup.cerv. ganglion, which itself
  stimulates the ganglion, so that progressive stimulation is set
  up in the postganglionic fibres. In elegant experiments directed
  towards the question of the localization of the release of Ac.Ch.
  in the ganglion, Feldberg and Vartiainen<a href=
  "#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a> were recently able to prove that
  it was released neither by the preganglionic fibres nor by the
  ganglion cells themselves, the only direct effector organ. They
  concluded, therefore, that the Ac.Ch. was produced in the
  synapse. Synapse is not an anatomical but a purely functional
  concept. It indicates the spot where the nerve ending comes into
  contact with the cell, and has been adopted by histologists only
  in this sense. If, therefore, it can be proved that Ac.Ch. is
  formed in the "synapse", it can only, in my opinion, be in the
  preganglionic nerve ending or in the ganglion cell. As the
  ganglion cell can be ruled out, as Feldberg and Vartiainen have
  shown, there only remains, it appears to me, the nerve ending as
  the site of release. Although proof of this has so far only been
  obtained directly in the case of preganglionic sympathetic
  endings, there is, nevertheless, much to make us think that in
  other places as well the nerve substances are released in the
  nerve endings themselves. We know that in many organs by no means
  each single, functioning unit is accorded a nerve fibre. At most,
  according to St&ouml;hr, one occurs for every hundred
  capillaries. When the nerve is stimulated, however, all react. In
  these cases, how does the nerve substance diffuse to those
  regions without nerves? I believe that the nerve ending is here
  the liberation centre. This supposition is supported when we
  consider that when the autonomous nerves are stimulated the two
  same substances are always released in very different organs
  having a quite different chemical structure and accordingly
  undergoing quite different chemical changes. If the substances
  were not being released in the nerve endings, but peripherally of
  them, then we should again have to assume the presence of some
  mysterious mechanism capable of transferring the stimulation of
  the nerve ending to the supposed peripheral position where the
  substance would be released; in which case, the discovery of the
  neurochemicalmechanism would not, in my opinion, represent any
  important progress.</p>

  <p>We come now to the next question concerning
  this delicate mechanism.</p>

  <p>So far we have only spoken of the release
  of the substance from the nerve ending. This is only to say that
  a free nerve substance emerges from the nerve ending. But it is
  important for an understanding of the nature of nerve function to
  know what exactly we should imagine is implied by this release. A
  priori the following possibilities exist: either the substances
  are not present in the nerve ending when the nerves are in a
  state of rest and are only formed by nerve stimulation and, once
  formed, diffuse, or they are already present in the state of
  rest, but can only diffuse after stimulation. As regards the
  formation of nerve substances through the nerves, it is certain
  that this can be done. Even Witanowski<a href=
  "#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a> in his day found Ac.Ch. in the
  vagus, in the sympathicus and in the sympathetic ganglia. The
  last two findings were confirmed by Chang and Gaddum.<a href=
  "#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a> As Ac.Ch. is not present in the
  blood, it cannot diffuse from there, and neither, on account of
  its ready destructibility, could it diffuse from elsewhere in the
  nerves and ganglia. The same applies for adrenaline. Recently we
  have succeeded in showing the presence of adrenaline in a frog's
  brain in a state of rest or even anaesthetized, and also in the
  upper cervical ganglia of cattle. It was characterized by its
  effect upon the heart which was similar to that of adrenaline,
  through the neutralizing of this effect by ergotaminization and
  also by its destructibility through fluorescent light. These
  findings, therefore, confirm that the nerve substances are formed
  by the nerve and are present even in a state of rest. Whether the
  nerve, when stimulated, produces further substance as well is
  another still undecided question which we are not touching upon
  here. However interesting in itself the answer to this question
  may be, it does not appear to me to be of essential importance,
  since the basic effect of nerve stimulation is the release of the
  substances. There are two possibilities as regards the processes
  of release and diffusion: either the substances are present in a
  free and diffusible state in the nerve ending, but the nerve
  ending when in a state of rest is impermeable and only made
  permeable to them after stimulation, when they become diffusible
  and effective, or, the substances in the resting state are in
  some way combined and indiffusible and only the stimulation
  releases the combination and thereby makes them diffusible and
  effective. If the first possibility were to apply, then we must
  not find the Ac.Ch. at all, since, as has been shown, esterase is
  found everywhere in the nerves and this, as we shall soon see,
  destroys the free Ac.Ch. But we do find it in the nerve. This
  fact alone suffices to show that it is not present in a free,
  diffusible state in the nerve ending. In addition,
  Bergami<a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a> recently found, in
  confirmation of earlier experiments by Calabro<a href=
  "#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>, that Ac.Ch. only issues from the
  free end of severed nerves if the nerve is stimulated. In this
  case, the release cannot, of course, be attributed to any change
  in the state of permeability brought about by stimulation, since
  the free nerve ending has no membrane. The second possibility
  which I mentioned earlier must apply, namely that the Ac.Ch. in
  the unstimulated nerves is bound in some way and thereby
  protected from the assault of the esterase. In fact, it is
  present in such quantity in hearts where there is no vagus
  stimulation, that in a freely diffusible state it would be more
  than sufficient to stop the heart altogether. On its own it is
  ineffectual and is protected against the action of the esterase,
  in contrast to when it is in a diffusible state.</p>

  <p>In experiments directed towards the study
  of this question Engelhart and I<a href=
  "#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> found the following: If one
  determines the initial value of Ac.Ch. in a heart section,
  leaving the remaining portion of the heart intact for a few
  hours, as much Ac.Ch. is found in it afterwards as in the
  beginning. Dale and Dudley, incidentally, found the same in the
  case of the spleen. In an organ in a state of rest, therefore,
  the Ac.Ch. is protected against the esterase. But if free (that
  is to say diffusible) Ac.Ch. is added to a heart in a state of
  rest, it is destroyed. All this goes to show that obviously, as
  Dale also assumed, the Ac.Ch. is present in the organ in a state
  of rest in some kind of loose, non-diffusible combination, and
  for that reason it is non-susceptible to attack by esterase and
  non-effective. Such combinations we know do very often occur in
  an organism. The so-called "vehicle function" of the blood
  implies in fact no more than the ability of the blood's component
  parts to bind substances and, when necessary, to release them.
  But the binding must in any case be a very loose one, as after
  destroying the structure, for instance by mincing the organ, the
  Ac.Ch. is very quickly destroyed by esterase. Nerve stimulation
  would accordingly appear to have the effect of releasing from
  this combination the Ac.Ch. which has been proved to be present
  in the nerve.</p>

  <p>The same applies also for the nerve
  substance in the sympathetic system, adrenaline. As I was able to
  show this year<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, the heart
  contains 1 gamma to 2 gamma per gram, which corresponds to a
  concentration of 1:1 million to 1:500,000. Whereas adrenaline
  added to the heart will already be effective in a concentration
  of 1:100 million to the maximum, the concentration of 100-200
  times more adrenaline in a heart in a state of rest will be
  without effect. Therefore it also must be present in some kind of
  inactive combination in the heart. This fact also seems to me to
  be of importance in the possible interpretation of certain other
  findings. It is known that in many organs the adrenaline action
  is quickly over. Up until now this has been explained by the
  speedy oxidation of adrenaline. This is certainly the case for
  pure adrenaline solutions <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, on the
  other hand, adrenaline is not only not easily oxidized, but all
  the organs contain substances - among them, as has been proved,
  amino acids - which, even in minimal quantities, have a direct
  inhibiting effect upon the oxidation of adrenaline. How then does
  this rapid cessation of activity come about? It may, in part, be
  due to counteractions. In some cases, however, the disappearance
  of activity could be due to rapid transference of the adrenaline
  into an ineffective linkage as is to be found in the heart.</p>

  <p>Now let us return from this digression to
  the subject of the release of the nerve substances. This occurs
  very quickly and the action of the released nerve substance is
  very rapid also, although between release and effect the
  diffusion process has also to be set in motion. The time interval
  varies in length in different cases, but is in part certainly
  dependent upon the distance of the releasing nerve ending from
  the effector cell. According to Brown and Eccles<a href=
  "#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a> this is 80-100 omega in the case
  of the heart, but only 2 omega in the ganglionic synapse. This
  must mean that release coincides with stimulation. Dale is able
  to explain quite easily the fact that the effect reaches the
  ganglion cell almost without any time lapse by the fact that the
  release in the nerve ending occurs directly with contact with the
  ganglion cell, whereas in the heart, where incidentally the first
  contraction after vagus stimulation is smaller, a certain time is
  required for diffusion to the effector cells. As in the case of
  release and effect, the speed with which the substance and with
  it the effect disappears, varies in different objects. The
  discovery of the chemical mechanism of the effect of vagus
  stimulation in the heart was only possible because in this case
  the destruction of the Ac.Ch. occurs so slowly that the substance
  had time to diffuse, in sufficient quantity to be active, into
  the heart; in the ganglia on the other hand, the destruction
  occurs so rapidly that the Ac.Ch. in the perfusion fluid is only
  demonstrable after preliminary eserination. The differences in
  time between freeing and disappearance in both cases are easily
  understandable if we consider the quite different purposes which
  the nerve stimulation serves in both these cases.</p>

  <p>And now, finally, we come to the
  localization of the point of attack of the nerve substances.</p>

  <p>As long as it was not known that the
  autonomic nerves, when stimulated, release substances which
  condition the successful effect of the nerve stimulation, it was
  assumed in general, in consideration of the fact that the action
  picture of the so-called vago- and sympathico-mimetic substances
  is identical with the stimulating of the corresponding nerves,
  and, further, with the fact that it was believed that the
  alkaloids, atropine, and ergotamine, which inhibit the action of
  the substances, paralyse the corresponding nerves, that the vago-
  and sympathico-mimetic substances stimulate the nerves somewhere
  peripherally. But as they are effective even after nerve
  degeneration, it was assumed, with justification at the time,
  that a non-degenerative myoneural junction was the point of
  attack. Today, now that we know that the nerves do release nerve
  substances, this view is no longer tenable. The nerve substances,
  considered as vago- or sympathico-mimetic substances, would have
  to act like these, that is to say, they would have to stimulate
  the myoneural junction and release substances, etc. on their own.
  In this case there would be no kind of effect upon the effector
  organ. Quite apart from this, the supposition that the nerve
  substances stimulate the nerve somewhere is quite superfluous by
  the proof shown above, that the alkaloids atropine and ergotamine
  which inhibit the activity of the vago- and sympathico-mimetic
  substances, do not, as was supposed, paralyse the nerves, but are
  simply antagonistic to the substances. If all this is evidence
  against the nerve as point of attack, it has also been proved
  that Ac.Ch. and adrenaline are also effective in the absence of
  nerves. Ac.Ch., for instance, dilates vessels which are not
  parasympathetically innervated. Adrenaline increases the activity
  of the still nerveless embryonic heart and stimulates the
  arrectores pilorum, which, according to St&ouml;hr, are also
  nerveless, etc. Therefore, the point of attack of the nerve
  substances must be some part of the effector organ itself,
  probably chemical or chemico-physical in character and not
  morphological.</p>

  <p>As Dale has proved, we can no longer say
  that the nerve substances reproduce the action picture of the
  nerves but rather it is a fact that the nerves reproduce the
  action picture of the substances, since they release these and
  thus lead to effective action. That the activity caused by any
  one nerve substance appears principally at the spot where it is
  released, that is to say, that in that particular spot the cells
  are receptive to its action, is a local phenomenon of the
  specific sensitivity to certain chemical substances which is met
  with everywhere in the living organism and which is Erie of the
  foundations of its function and, therefore, of its very existence
  and which can only be understood teleologically and not causally;
  think, for example, of the finely graduated, specific sensitivity
  of the respiratory centre to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

  <p>Up until now we have discussed only the
  effect of the nerve substances on the organ in which they are
  released through nerve stimulus. Are they only active there, or
  in other distant organs too? We have already mentioned that a
  part of the released substance diffuses into the blood or into
  some other perfusing fluid. This could present the possibility of
  its action being extended to other more distant organs. What is
  the position here? Given special conditions, which I would like
  to characterize as pathological, this could happen.It has been
  proved that when the breaking up of the Ac.Ch. by an esterase, is
  inhibited by eserine, the Ac.Ch. penetrates with the blood to
  other organs in sufficient quantities to cause activity.
  Furthermore, Cannon<a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a> by
  preliminary sensitizing of organs through denervation, or
  cocainization, made them so hypersensitive to the sympathicus
  substance that they reacted to its release in any organ. In the
  same way as in these experimentally induced disturbances, it
  could also happen perhaps that in cases of illness, the release
  of surplus quantities of substance or incomplete destruction may
  interrupt the normal release and destruction, leading to
  hypersensitivity of organs and the appearance of effect at a
  distance. It would be very desirable if in future clinicians
  would give consideration to these relationships with a view to
  explaining certain symptoms and groups of symptoms which until
  now, partly without sufficient foundation, have been considered
  as purely reflex. Under normal conditions, however, the effect of
  the nerve substance would be limited to the organ in which it is
  released. The hormones are there to exert a general control, that
  is to say not a localized chemical one, on the organs.</p>

  <p>In conclusion a word or two on the question
  of how the neurochemical mechanism fits into the connecting
  pattern of cells. With the discovery that its influence comes
  about through substances which are released by the nervous system
  itself, we have the first proof that the nervous system is not
  only an effector organ for chemical influences from outside, and
  not only a participant in general metabolism, but that it has
  itself a specific chemical influence upon happenings in the
  organism. On closer examination this is not surprising.</p>

  <p>In nerve-free multicellular organisms, the
  relationships of the cells to each other can only be of a
  chemical nature. In multicellular organisms with nerve systems,
  the nerve cells only represent cells like any others, but they
  have extensions suited to the purpose which they serve, namely
  the nerves. Accordingly it is perhaps only natural that the
  relationships between the nervous system and other organs should
  be qualitatively of the same kind as that between the non-nervous
  organs among themselves, that is to say, of a chemical
  nature.</p>
