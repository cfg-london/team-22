  <h1>Yasser Arafat - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Translation from the Arabic text by D.
  Karara</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesty King Harald,<br>
  Your Majesty Queen Sonja,<br>
  Professor Sejersted - Chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize
  Committee,<br>
  Your Excellencies,<br>
  Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  A quote from the Holy Koran, "Then if they should be inclined to
  make peace, do thou incline towards it also, and put thy trust in
  Allah." The Holy Koran, 8:62.</p>

  <p>Ever since I was entrusted by my people to
  undertake the arduous task of seeking our lost home, I have been
  filled with a warm faith that all those in exile who bore the
  keys to their homes with them as they bore their limbs, an
  inseparable part of them, and those in the homeland, who bore
  their wounds as they bear their names... would, one day, for all
  their sacrifices, be granted the rewards of returning and
  freedom. And that, the difficult journey on that long pain-filled
  path would end in their own hallways.</p>

  <p>Now, as we celebrate together the first
  sighting of the crescent moon of peace, I stare into the eyes of
  those martyrs whose look has seared into my consciousness as I
  stand here on this podium and who ask me about the homeland,
  about their vacant places. I hide my tears from them and tell
  them: "How right you were. Your generous sacrifice has enabled us
  to behold the Holy land, to tread our first steps on it in a
  difficult battle, the battle for peace, the peace of the
  brave."</p>

  <p>Now, as we celebrate the reawakening of
  creative forces within us and restore the war-torn home that
  overlooks the neighbors' where our children shall play together
  and compete to pick flowers, now, I feel national and human pride
  in my Palestinian Arab People whose powers of patience and
  giving, of retaining a never-ending bond between homeland,
  history and people, have added a new chapter to the homelands'
  ancient legends, that of The Epic of Hope.</p>

  <p>To them, to the sons and daughters of that
  kind enduring nation, that nation of Yew and dew, of fire and
  sweat, I dedicate this Nobel Prize. I shall bear it to those
  children who have been promised freedom, safety and security in a
  homeland free of the threats of external occupation or internal
  exploitation.</p>

  <p>I know, I know full well, Mr. Chairman,
  that this supreme and greatly significant prize was not awarded
  to me and to my partners: Mr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Yitzhak Rabin</a>, the Israeli
  Prime Minister, and Mr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Shimon Peres</a>, the Foreign
  Minister, to crown an achievement: but as an encouragement to
  pursue a route with greater steps and deeper awareness, with
  truer intentions so that we may transform the peace option, the
  peace of the brave, from words into practice and reality and for
  us to be worthy of carrying forward the message entrusted to us
  by our peoples, as well as humanity and a universal moral
  duty.</p>

  <p>The Palestinians, whose national cause
  guards the gates of Arab-Israeli peace, look forward like their
  Arab brethren, to that comprehensive, just and lasting peace,
  based on "land for peace" and compliance with international
  legitimacy and resolutions. Peace, for us, is an <i>asset and in
  our interest</i>. It is an absolute human asset that allows an
  individual to freely develop his individuality unbound by any
  regional, religious or ethnic fetters. It restores to
  Arab-Israeli relations their innocent nature, and enables the
  Arab spirit to reflect through unrestrained human expression its
  profound understanding of the Jewish-European tragedy, just as it
  allows the tortured Jewish spirit to express its unfettered
  empathy for the suffering endured by the Palestinian people over
  their ruptured history. Only the tortured can understand those
  who have endured torture.</p>

  <p>Peace is in our interest: as only in an
  atmosphere of just peace shall the Palestinian people achieve
  their legitimate ambition for independence and sovereignty, and
  be able to develop their national and cultural identity, as well
  as enjoy sound neighborly relations, mutual respect and
  cooperation with the Israeli people. They, in return, will be
  able to articulate their Middle Eastern identity, and to open up
  economically and culturally towards their Arab neighbors. The
  Arabs are looking forward to developing their region which the
  long years of war had prevented from finding its true place in
  today's world, in an atmosphere of democracy, pluralism and
  prosperity.</p>

  <p>Just as war is a great adventure, peace is
  a challenge and wager. If we fail to endow peace with the
  wherewithal to withstand the tempest amid the storm. If we fail
  to nurture peace so that it may gain in strength, if we fail to
  give it scope to grow and gain in strength, the wager could be
  wasted and lost. So, from this rostrum I call upon my partners in
  peace to speed up the peace process, to bring about an early
  withdrawal, to allow elections to be held and to move on rapidly
  to the next stage, so that peace may become entrenched and grow,
  become an established reality.</p>

  <p>We started the peace process on the basis
  of land for peace, and on the basis of UN resolution 242 and
  338,<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> as well as other
  international decisions on achieving the legitimate rights of the
  Palestinian people. Even though the peace process has not reached
  its full scope, the new environment of trust as well as the
  modest steps implemented during the first and second years of the
  peace agreement are very promising and call for the lifting of
  reservations, for procedures to be simplified. We must fulfill
  what remains, especially the transfer of power and taking further
  steps in Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the
  settlements to achieve full withdrawal. This would provide our
  society with the opportunity to rebuild its infrastructure and to
  contribute from its location, with its own heritage, knowledge
  and know-how in forging our new world.</p>

  <p>In this context I call on Russia and the
  United States of America, the cosponsors of the peace conference,
  to help the peace process take bigger steps, by contributing to
  the process and helping to overcome all obstacles. I also call on
  Norway and Egypt as the first countries to have nurtured the
  Israeli- Palestinian peace to pursue this worthy initiative that
  took off from Oslo, to Washington to Cairo. Oslo shall remain the
  bright name that accompanies the process of peace, the peace of
  the brave, as will the name of those countries sponsoring the
  multilateral talks.</p>

  <p>Here I call on all the countries of the
  world especially the donor countries to speed up their
  contributions so that the Palestinian people may overcome their
  economic and social problems and proceed with reconstruction and
  the rebuilding of infrastructures. Peace cannot thrive, and the
  peace process cannot be consolidated in the absence of the
  necessary material conditions.</p>

  <p>I call on my partners in peace to reinforce
  the peace process with the necessary comprehensive and strategic
  vision.</p>

  <p>Confidence alone does not make peace. But
  acknowledging rights and confidence do. Failure to recognize
  these rights creates a sense of injustice, it keeps the embers
  burning under the ashes. It moves peace towards the quicksands of
  danger and rekindles a fuse that is ready to explode.</p>

  <p>We view peace as a historic strategic
  option, not a tactical one directed by current calculations of
  gain or loss. The peace process is not only a political process,
  it is an integrated operation where national awareness, economic,
  scientific and technological development play a major role, just
  as cultural, social and creative merging play essential roles
  that are of the very essence of the peace process and fortify
  it.</p>

  <p>I review all this as I recall the difficult
  peace journey we have travelled, we have only covered a short
  distance. We have to arm ourselves with courage and utmost
  temerity to cover the longer distance ahead, towards the homebase
  of just and comprehensive peace, and to be able to assimilate
  that creative force of the deeper meanings of peace.</p>

  <p>As long as we have decided to coexist in
  peace we must do so on a firm basis that will withstand time and
  for generations. A comprehensive withdrawal from the West Bank
  and the Gaza Strip requires an in-depth consideration of the
  settlements question, they cut across geographic and political
  union, impede free communication between the regions of the West
  Bank and the Gaza Strip and create foci of tension: this is
  contrary to the spirit of peace we seek and mars its serenity.
  The same applies to the question of Jerusalem, the spiritual
  haven for Moslems, Christians and Jews. It is the city of cities
  for Palestinians and where Jewish holy places are on an equal
  footing with Islamic and Christian holy places, so let us make it
  a world beacon for spiritual harmony, the radiance of
  civilization and religious heritage for all humanity. In this
  context, there is an urgent task that impels the peace process
  and will help it overcome deep-seated barriers, namely that of
  the detainees and prisoners. It is important that they be
  released, that their mothers, wives and children may smile
  again.</p>

  <p>Lets us protect this newborn infant from
  the winter winds, let us nurture it with milk and honey, from the
  land of milk and honey, and on the land of Salem, Abraham, Ismael
  and Isaac, the Holy Land, the Land of Peace.</p>

  <p>Finally, I would like to congratulate my
  partners in peace Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of
  Israel, and Mr. Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister on
  being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

  <p>My congratulations also go to the people of
  Norway, this friendly nation, for their sponsorship, for their
  warm hospitality, it betokens their history and nobility. I
  assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that we shall discover
  ourselves in peace more than we have with war and confrontation,
  as I am sure that the Israelis in turn shall find themselves in
  peace more than they have found it in war.</p>

  <p><br>
  Glory to God almighty,<br>
  <br>
  Peace on Earth,<br>
  and Goodwill to all People,<br>
  <br>
  Thank you.</p>

  Security Council Resolution 242 (November 22, 1967), passed after
  Israel's victory in the Six Day War, among other clauses
  emphasized "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory
  by war" and called for "the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces
  from territories occupied in the recent conflict". These points
  were welcomed by the Palestinians and other Arabs. On the other
  hand, the resolution also affirmed the necessity "for
  guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political
  independence of every state in the area". This pleased Israel,
  which the Arab states had refused to recognize and sought to
  overthrow by arms. Security Council Resolution 338 (October 22,
  1973) called for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Egypt
  and other Arab states, reaffirmed Resolution 242 and called for
  its immediate implementation. See Laqueur and Rubin, The
  Israel-Arab Reader, pp. 217-218, 310.</p>
