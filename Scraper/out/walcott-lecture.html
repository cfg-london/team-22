  <h2>The Antilles: Fragments of Epic Memory</h2>

  <p>Felicity is a village in Trinidad on the
  edge of the Caroni plain, the wide central plain that still grows
  sugar and to which indentured cane cutters were brought after
  emancipation, so the small population of Felicity is East Indian,
  and on the afternoon that I visited it with friends from America,
  all the faces along its road were Indian, which, as I hope to
  show, was a moving, beautiful thing, because this Saturday
  afternoon <i>Ramleela,</i> the epic dramatization of the Hindu
  epic the <i>Ramayana,</i> was going to be performed, and the
  costumed actors from the village were assembling on a field
  strung with different-coloured flags, like a new gas station, and
  beautiful Indian boys in red and black were aiming arrows
  haphazardly into the afternoon light. Low blue mountains on the
  horizon, bright grass, clouds that would gather colour before the
  light went. Felicity! What a gentle Anglo-Saxon name for an
  epical memory.<br>
  <br>
  Under an open shed on the edge of the field, there were two huge
  armatures of bamboo that looked like immense cages. They were
  parts of the body of a god, his calves or thighs, which, fitted
  and reared, would make a gigantic effigy. This effigy would be
  burnt as a conclusion to the epic. The cane structures flashed a
  predictable parallel: Shelley's sonnet on the fallen statue of
  Ozymandias and his empire, that "colossal wreck" in its empty
  desert.<br>
  <br>
  Drummers had lit a fire in the shed and they eased the skins of
  their tables nearer the flames to tighten them. The saffron
  flames, the bright grass, and the hand-woven armatures of the
  fragmented god who would be burnt were not in any desert where
  imperial power had finally toppled but were part of a ritual,
  evergreen season that, like the cane-burning harvest, is annually
  repeated, the point of such sacrifice being its repetition, the
  point of the destruction being renewal through fire.<br>
  <br>
  Deities were entering the field. What we generally call "Indian
  music" was blaring from the open platformed shed from which the
  epic would be narrated. Costumed actors were arriving. Princes
  and gods, I supposed. What an unfortunate confession! "Gods, I
  suppose" is the shrug that embodies our African and Asian
  diasporas. I had often thought of but never seen <i>Ramleela,</i>
  and had never seen this theatre, an open field, with village
  children as warriors, princes, and gods. I had no idea what the
  epic story was, who its hero was, what enemies he fought, yet I
  had recently adapted the <i>Odyssey</i> for a theatre in England,
  presuming that the audience knew the trials of Odysseus, hero of
  another Asia Minor epic, while nobody in Trinidad knew any more
  than I did about Rama, Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, apart from the
  Indians, a phrase I use pervertedly because that is the kind of
  remark you can still hear in Trinidad: "apart from the
  Indians".<br>
  <br>
  It was as if, on the edge of the Central Plain, there was another
  plateau, a raft on which the <i>Ramayana</i> would be poorly
  performed in this ocean of cane, but that was my writer's view of
  things, and it is wrong. I was seeing the <i>Ramleela</i> at
  Felicity as theatre when it was faith.<br>
  <br>
  Multiply that moment of self-conviction when an actor, made-up
  and costumed, nods to his mirror before stopping on stage in the
  belief that he is a reality entering an illusion and you would
  have what I presumed was happening to the actors of this epic.
  But they were not actors. They had been chosen; or they
  themselves had chosen their roles in this sacred story that would
  go on for nine afternoons over a two-hour period till the sun
  set. They were not amateurs but believers. There was no
  theatrical term to define them. They did not have to psych
  themselves up to play their roles. Their acting would probably be
  as buoyant and as natural as those bamboo arrows crisscrossing
  the afternoon pasture. They believed in what they were playing,
  in the sacredness of the text, the validity of India, while I,
  out of the writer's habit, searched for some sense of elegy, of
  loss, even of degenerative mimicry in the happy faces of the
  boy-warriors or the heraldic profiles of the village princes. I
  was polluting the afternoon with doubt and with the patronage of
  admiration. I misread the event through a visual echo of History
  - the cane fields, indenture, the evocation of vanished armies,
  temples, and trumpeting elephants - when all around me there was
  quite the opposite: elation, delight in the boys' screams, in the
  sweets-stalls, in more and more costumed characters appearing; a
  delight of conviction, not loss. The name Felicity made
  sense.<br>
  <br>
  Consider the scale of Asia reduced to these fragments: the small
  white exclamations of minarets or the stone balls of temples in
  the cane fields, and one can understand the self-mockery and
  embarrassment of those who see these rites as parodic, even
  degenerate. These purists look on such ceremonies as grammarians
  look at a dialect, as cities look on provinces and empires on
  their colonies. Memory that yearns to join the centre, a limb
  remembering the body from which it has been severed, like those
  bamboo thighs of the god. In other words, the way that the
  Caribbean is still looked at, illegitimate, rootless,
  mongrelized. "No people there", to quote Froude, "in the true
  sense of the word". No people. Fragments and echoes of real
  people, unoriginal and broken.<br>
  <br>
  The performance was like a dialect, a branch of its original
  language, an abridgement of it, but not a distortion or even a
  reduction of its epic scale. Here in Trinidad I had discovered
  that one of the greatest epics of the world was seasonally
  performed, not with that desperate resignation of preserving a
  culture, but with an openness of belief that was as steady as the
  wind bending the cane lances of the Caroni plain. We had to leave
  before the play began to go through the creeks of the Caroni
  Swamp, to catch the scarlet ibises coming home at dusk. In a
  performance as natural as those of the actors of the
  <i>Ramleela,</i> we watched the flocks come in as bright as the
  scarlet of the boy archers, as the red flags, and cover an islet
  until it turned into a flowering tree, an anchored immortelle.
  The sigh of History meant nothing here. These two visions, the
  <i>Ramleela</i> and the arrowing flocks of scarlet ibises, blent
  into a single gasp of gratitude. Visual surprise is natural in
  the Caribbean; it comes with the landscape, and faced with its
  beauty, the sigh of History dissolves.<br>
  <br>
  We make too much of that long groan which underlines the past. I
  felt privileged to discover the ibises as well as the scarlet
  archers of Felicity.<br>
  <br>
  The sigh of History rises over ruins, not over landscapes, and in
  the Antilles there are few ruins to sigh over, apart from the
  ruins of sugar estates and abandoned forts. Looking around
  slowly, as a camera would, taking in the low blue hills over Port
  of Spain, the village road and houses, the warrior-archers, the
  god-actors and their handlers, and music already on the sound
  track, I wanted to make a film that would be a long-drawn sigh
  over Felicity. I was filtering the afternoon with evocations of a
  lost India, but why "evocations"? Why not "celebrations of a real
  presence"? Why should India be "lost" when none of these
  villagers ever really knew it, and why not "continuing", why not
  the perpetuation of joy in Felicity and in all the other nouns of
  the Central Plain: Couva, Chaguanas, Charley Village? Why was I
  not letting my pleasure open its windows wide? I was enticed like
  any Trinidadian to the ecstasies of their claim, because ecstasy
  was the pitch of the sinuous drumming in the loudspeakers. I was
  entitled to the feast of Husein, to the mirrors and crepe-paper
  temples of the Muslim epic, to the Chinese Dragon Dance, to the
  rites of that Sephardic Jewish synagogue that was once on
  Something Street. I am only one-eighth the writer I might have
  been had I contained all the fragmented languages of
  Trinidad.<br>
  <br>
  Break a vase, and the love that reassembles the fragments is
  stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when
  it was whole. The glue that fits the pieces is the sealing of its
  original shape. It is such a love that reassembles our African
  and Asiatic fragments, the cracked heirlooms whose restoration
  shows its white scars. This gathering of broken pieces is the
  care and pain of the Antilles, and if the pieces are disparate,
  ill-fitting, they contain more pain than their original
  sculpture, those icons and sacred vessels taken for granted in
  their ancestral places. Antillean art is this restoration of our
  shattered histories, our shards of vocabulary, our archipelago
  becoming a synonym for pieces broken off from the original
  continent.<br>
  <br>
  And this is the exact process of the making of poetry, or what
  should be called not its "making" but its remaking, the
  fragmented memory, the armature that frames the god, even the
  rite that surrenders it to a final pyre; the god assembled cane
  by cane, reed by weaving reed, line by plaited line, as the
  artisans of Felicity would erect his holy echo.<br>
  <br>
  Poetry, which is perfection's sweat but which must seem as fresh
  as the raindrops on a statue's brow, combines the natural and the
  marmoreal; it conjugates both tenses simultaneously: the past and
  the present, if the past is the sculpture and the present the
  beads of dew or rain on the forehead of the past. There is the
  buried language and there is the individual vocabulary, and the
  process of poetry is one of excavation and of self-discovery.
  Tonally the individual voice is a dialect; it shapes its own
  accent, its own vocabulary and melody in defiance of an imperial
  concept of language, the language of Ozymandias, libraries and
  dictionaries, law courts and critics, and churches, universities,
  political dogma, the diction of institutions. Poetry is an island
  that breaks away from the main. The dialects of my archipelago
  seem as fresh to me as those raindrops on the statue's forehead,
  not the sweat made from the classic exertion of frowning marble,
  but the condensations of a refreshing element, rain and
  salt.<br>
  <br>
  Deprived of their original language, the captured and indentured
  tribes create their own, accreting and secreting fragments of an
  old, an epic vocabulary, from Asia and from Africa, but to an
  ancestral, an ecstatic rhythm in the blood that cannot be subdued
  by slavery or indenture, while nouns are renamed and the given
  names of places accepted like Felicity village or Choiseul. The
  original language dissolves from the exhaustion of distance like
  fog trying to cross an ocean, but this process of renaming, of
  finding new metaphors, is the same process that the poet faces
  every morning of his working day, making his own tools like
  Crusoe, assembling nouns from necessity, from Felicity, even
  renaming himself. The stripped man is driven back to that
  self-astonishing, elemental force, his mind. That is the basis of
  the Antillean experience, this shipwreck of fragments, these
  echoes, these shards of a huge tribal vocabulary, these partially
  remembered customs, and they are not decayed but strong. They
  survived the Middle Passage and the <i>Fatel Rozack,</i> the ship
  that carried the first indentured Indians from the port of Madras
  to the cane fields of Felicity, that carried the chained
  Cromwellian convict and the Sephardic Jew, the Chinese grocer and
  the Lebanese merchant selling cloth samples on his bicycle.<br>
  <br>
  And here they are, all in a single Caribbean city, Port of Spain,
  the sum of history, Trollope's "non-people". A downtown babel of
  shop signs and streets, mongrelized, polyglot, a ferment without
  a history, like heaven. Because that is what such a city is, in
  the New World, a writer's heaven.<br>
  <br>
  A culture, we all know, is made by its cities.<br>
  <br>
  Another first morning home, impatient for the sunrise - a broken
  sleep. Darkness at five, and the drapes not worth opening; then,
  in the sudden light, a cream-walled, brown-roofed police station
  bordered with short royal palms, in the colonial style, back of
  it frothing trees and taller palms, a pigeon fluttering into the
  cover of an cave, a rain-stained block of once-modern apartments,
  the morning side road into the station without traffic. All part
  of a surprising peace. This quiet happens with every visit to a
  city that has deepened itself in me. The flowers and the hills
  are easy, affection for them predictable; it is the architecture
  that, for the first morning, disorients. A return from American
  seductions used to make the traveller feel that something was
  missing, something was trying to complete itself, like the
  stained concrete apartments. Pan left along the window and the
  excrescences rear - a city trying to soar, trying to be brutal,
  like an American city in silhouette, stamped from the same mould
  as Columbus or Des Moines. An assertion of power, its decor
  bland, its air conditioning pitched to the point where its
  secretarial and executive staff sport competing cardigans; the
  colder the offices the more important, an imitation of another
  climate. A longing, even an envy of feeling cold.<br>
  <br>
  In serious cities, in grey, militant winter with its short
  afternoons, the days seem to pass by in buttoned overcoats, every
  building appears as a barracks with lights on in its windows, and
  when snow comes, one has the illusion of living in a Russian
  novel, in the nineteenth century, because of the literature of
  winter. So visitors to the Caribbean must feel that they are
  inhabiting a succession of postcards. Both climates are shaped by
  what we have read of them. For tourists, the sunshine cannot be
  serious. Winter adds depth and darkness to life as well as to
  literature, and in the unending summer of the tropics not even
  poverty or poetry (in the Antilles poverty is poetry with a V,
  <i>une vie,</i> a condition of life as well as of imagination)
  seems capable of being profound because the nature around it is
  so exultant, so resolutely ecstatic, like its music. A culture
  based on joy is bound to be shallow. Sadly, to sell itself, the
  Caribbean encourages the delights of mindlessness, of brilliant
  vacuity, as a place to flee not only winter but that seriousness
  that comes only out of culture with four seasons. So how can
  there be a people there, in the true sense of the word?<br>
  <br>
  They know nothing about seasons in which leaves let go of the
  year, in which spires fade in blizzards and streets whiten, of
  the erasures of whole cities by fog, of reflection in fireplaces;
  instead, they inhabit a geography whose rhythm, like their music,
  is limited to two stresses: hot and wet, sun and rain, light and
  shadow, day and night, the limitations of an incomplete metre,
  and are therefore a people incapable of the subtleties of
  contradiction, of imaginative complexity. So be it. We cannot
  change contempt.<br>
  <br>
  Ours are not cities in the accepted sense, but no one wants them
  to be. They dictate their own proportions, their own definitions
  in particular places and in a prose equal to that of their
  detractors, so that now it is not just St. James but the streets
  and yards that Naipaul commemorates, its lanes as short and
  brilliant as his sentences; not just the noise and jostle of
  Tunapuna but the origins of C.L.R. <i>James's Beyond a
  Boundary,</i> not just Felicity village on the Caroni plain, but
  Selvon Country, and that is the way it goes up the islands now:
  the old Dominica of Jean Rhys still very much the way she wrote
  of it; and the Martinique of the early Cesaire; Perse's
  Guadeloupe, even without the pith helmets and the mules; and what
  delight and privilege there was in watching a literature - one
  literature in several imperial languages, French, English,
  Spanish - bud and open island after island in the early morning
  of a culture, not timid, not derivative, any more than the hard
  white petals of the frangipani are derivative and timid. This is
  not a belligerent boast but a simple celebration of
  inevitability: that this flowering had to come.<br>
  <br>
  On a heat-stoned afternoon in Port of Spain, some alley white
  with glare, with love vine spilling over a fence, palms and a
  hazed mountain appear around a corner to the evocation of Vaughn
  or Herbert's "that shady city of palm-trees", or to the memory of
  a Hammond organ from a wooden chapel in Castries, where the
  congregation sang "Jerusalem, the Golden". It is hard for me to
  see such emptiness as desolation. It is that patience that is the
  width of Antillean life, and the secret is not to ask the wrong
  thing of it, not to demand of it an ambition it has no interest
  in. The traveller reads this as lethargy, as torpor.<br>
  <br>
  Here there are not enough books, one says, no theatres, no
  museums, simply not enough to do. Yet, deprived of books, a man
  must fall back on thought, and out of thought, if he can learn to
  order it, will come the urge to record, and in extremity, if he
  has no means of recording, recitation, the ordering of memory
  which leads to metre, to commemoration. There can be virtues in
  deprivation, and certainly one virtue is salvation from a cascade
  of high mediocrity, since books are now not so much created as
  remade. Cities create a culture, and all we have are these
  magnified market towns, so what are the proportions of the ideal
  Caribbean city? A surrounding, accessible countryside with leafy
  suburbs, and if the city is lucky, behind it, spacious plains.
  Behind it, fine mountains; before it, an indigo sea. Spires would
  pin its centre and around them would be leafy, shadowy parks.
  Pigeons would cross its sky in alphabetic patterns, carrying with
  them memories of a belief in augury, and at the heart of the city
  there would be horses, yes, horses, those animals last seen at
  the end of the nineteenth century drawing broughams and carriages
  with top-hatted citizens, horses that live in the present tense
  without elegiac echoes from their hooves, emerging from paddocks
  at the Queen's Park Savannah at sunrise, when mist is unthreading
  from the cool mountains above the roofs, and at the centre of the
  city seasonally there would be races, so that citizens could roar
  at the speed and grace of these nineteenth-century animals. Its
  docks, not obscured by smoke or deafened by too. much machinery,
  and above all, it would be so racially various that the cultures
  of the world - the Asiatic, the Mediterranean, the European, the
  African - would be represented in it, its humane variety more
  exciting than Joyce's Dublin. Its citizens would intermarry as
  they chose, from instinct, not tradition, until their children
  find it increasingly futile to trace their genealogy. It would
  not have too many avenues difficult or dangerous for pedestrians,
  its mercantile area would be a cacophony of accents, fragments of
  the old language that would be silenced immediately at five
  o'clock, its docks resolutely vacant on Sundays.<br>
  <br>
  This is Port of Spain to me, a city ideal in its commercial and
  human proportions, where a citizen is a walker and not a
  pedestrian, and this is how Athens may have been before it became
  a cultural echo.<br>
  <br>
  The finest silhouettes of Port of Spain are idealizations of the
  craftsman's handiwork, not of concrete and glass, but of baroque
  woodwork, each fantasy looking more like an involved drawing of
  itself than the actual building. Behind the city is the Caroni
  plain, with its villages, Indian prayer flags, and fruit vendors'
  stalls along the highway over which ibises come like floating
  flags. Photogenic poverty! Postcard sadnesses! I am not
  re-creating Eden; I mean, by "the Antilles", the reality of
  light, of work, of survival. I mean a house on the side of a
  country road, I mean the Caribbean Sea, whose smell is the smell
  of refreshing possibility as well as survival. Survival is the
  triumph of stubborness, and spiritual stubborness, a sublime
  stupidity, is what makes the occupation of poetry endure, when
  there are so many things that should make it futile. Those things
  added together can go under one collective noun: "the
  world".<br>
  <br>
  This is the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. Survival.<br>
  <br>
  If you wish to understand that consoling pity with which the
  islands were regarded, look at the tinted engravings of Antillean
  forests, with their proper palm trees, ferns, and waterfalls.
  They have a civilizing decency, like Botanical Gardens, as if the
  sky were a glass ceiling under which a colonized vegetation is
  arranged for quiet walks and carriage rides. Those views are
  incised with a pathos that guides the engraver's tool and the
  topographer's pencil, and it is this pathos which, tenderly
  ironic, gave villages names like Felicity. A century looked at a
  landscape furious with vegetation in the wrong light and with the
  wrong eye. It is such pictures that are saddening rather than the
  tropics itself. These delicate engravings of sugar mills and
  harbours, of native women in costume, are seen as a part of
  History, that History which looked over the shoulder of the
  engraver and, later, the photographer. History can alter the eye
  and the moving hand to conform a view of itself; it can rename
  places for the nostalgia in an echo; it can temper the glare of
  tropical light to elegiac monotony in prose, the tone of
  judgement in Conrad, in the travel journals of Trollope.<br>
  <br>
  These travellers carried with them the infection of their own
  malaise, and their prose reduced even the landscape to
  melancholia and self-contempt. Every endeavor is belittled as
  imitation, from architecture to music. There was this conviction
  in Froude that since History is based on achievement, and since
  the history of the Antilles was so genetically corrupt, so
  depressing in its cycles of massacres, slavery, and indenture, a
  culture was inconceivable and nothing could ever be created in
  those ramshackle ports, those monotonously feudal sugar estates.
  Not only the light and salt of Antillean mountains defied this,
  but the demotic vigour and variety of their inhabitants. Stand
  close to a waterfall and you will stop hearing its roar. To be
  still in the nineteenth century, like horses, as <a href=
  "../1987/index.html">Brodsky</a> has written, may not be such a
  bad deal, and much of our life in the Antilles still seems to be
  in the rhythm of the last century, like the West Indian
  novel.<br>
  <br>
  By writers even as refreshing as Graham Greene, the Caribbean is
  looked at with elegiac pathos, a prolonged sadness to which
  Levi-Strauss has supplied an epigraph: <i>Tristes Tropiques.</i>
  Their <i>tristesse</i> derives from an attitude to the Caribbean
  dusk, to rain, to uncontrollable vegetation, to the provincial
  ambition of Caribbean cities where brutal replicas of modern
  architecture dwarf the small houses and streets. The mood is
  understandable, the melancholy as contagious as the fever of a
  sunset, like the gold fronds of diseased coconut palms, but there
  is something alien and ultimately wrong in the way such a
  sadness, even a morbidity, is described by English, French, or
  some of our exiled writers. It relates to a misunderstanding of
  the light and the people on whom the light falls.<br>
  <br>
  These writers describe the ambitions of our unfinished cities,
  their unrealized, homiletic conclusion, but the Caribbean city
  may conclude just at that point where it is satisfied with its
  own scale, just as Caribbean culture is not evolving but already
  shaped. Its proportions are not to be measured by the traveller
  or the exile, but by its own citizenry and architecture. To be
  told you are not yet a city or a culture requires this response.
  I am not your city or your culture. There might be less of
  <i>Tristes Tropiques</i> after that.<br>
  <br>
  Here, on the raft of this dais, there is the sound of the
  applauding surf: our landscape, our history recognized, "at
  last". <i>At Last</i> is one of the first Caribbean books. It was
  written by the Victorian traveller Charles Kingsley. It is one of
  the early books to admit the Antillean landscape and its figures
  into English literature. I have never read it but gather that its
  tone is benign. The Antillean archipelago was there to be written
  about, not to write itself, by Trollope, by Patrick Leigh-Fermor,
  in the very tone in which I almost wrote about the village
  spectacle at Felicity, as a compassionate and beguiled outsider,
  distancing myself from Felicity village even while I was enjoying
  it. What is hidden cannot be loved. The traveller cannot love,
  since love is stasis and travel is motion. If he returns to what
  he loved in a landscape and stays there, he is no longer a
  traveller but in stasis and concentration, the lover of that
  particular part of earth, a native. So many people say they "love
  the Caribbean", meaning that someday they plan to return for a
  visit but could never live there, the usual benign insult of the
  traveller, the tourist. These travellers, at their kindest, were
  devoted to the same patronage, the islands passing in profile,
  their vegetal luxury, their backwardness and poverty. Victorian
  prose dignified them. They passed by in beautiful profiles and
  were forgotten, like a vacation.<br>
  <br>
  Alexis Saint-Leger Leger, whose writer's name is <a href=
  "../1960/index.html">Saint-John Perse,</a> was the first
  Antillean to win this prize for poetry. He was born in Guadeloupe
  and wrote in French, but before him, there was nothing as fresh
  and clear in feeling as those poems of his childhood, that of a
  privileged white child on an Antillean plantation, <i>Pour Feter
  une Enfance, Eloges,</i> and later <i>Images a Crusoe.</i> At
  last, the first breeze on the page, salt-edged and self-renewing
  as the trade winds, the sound of pages and palm trees turning as
  "the odour of coffee ascents the stairs".<br>
  <br>
  Caribbean genius is condemned to contradict itself. To celebrate
  Perse, we might be told, is to celebrate the old plantation
  system, to celebrate the beque or plantation rider, verandahs and
  mulatto servants, a white French language in a white pith helmet,
  to celebrate a rhetoric of patronage and hauteur; and even if
  Perse denied his origins, great writers often have this folly of
  trying to smother their source, we cannot deny him any more than
  we can the African Aime Cesaire. This is not accommodation, this
  is the ironic republic that is poetry, since, when I see cabbage
  palms moving their fronds at sunrise, I think they are reciting
  Perse.<br>
  <br>
  The fragrant and privileged poetry that Perse composed to
  celebrate his white childhood and the recorded Indian music
  behind the brown young archers of Felicity, with the same cabbage
  palms against the same Antillean sky, pierce me equally. I feel
  the same poignancy of pride in the poems as in the faces. Why,
  given the history of the Antilles, should this be remarkable? The
  history of the world, by which of course we mean Europe, is a
  record of intertribal lacerations, of ethnic cleansings. At last,
  islands not written about but writing themselves! The palms and
  the Muslim minarets are Antillean exclamations. At last! the
  royal palms of Guadeloupe recite <i>&Eacute;loges</i> by
  heart.<br>
  <br>
  Later, in <i>"Anabase",</i> Perse assembled fragments of an
  imaginary epic, with the clicking teeth of frontier gates, barren
  wadis with the froth of poisonous lakes, horsemen burnoosed in
  sandstorms, the opposite of cool Caribbean mornings, yet not
  necessarily a contrast any more than some young brown archer at
  Felicity, hearing the sacred text blared across the flagged
  field, with its battles and elephants and monkey-gods, in a
  contrast to the white child in Guadeloupe assembling fragments of
  his own epic from the lances of the cane fields, the estate carts
  and oxens, and the calligraphy of bamboo leaves from the ancient
  languages, Hindi, Chinese, and Arabic, on the Antillean sky. From
  the <i>Ramayana</i> to Anabasis, from Guadeloupe to Trinidad, all
  that archaeology of fragments lying around, from the broken
  African kingdoms, from the crevasses of Canton, from Syria and
  Lebanon, vibrating not under the earth but in our raucous,
  demotic streets.<br>
  <br>
  A boy with weak eyes skims a flat stone across the flat water of
  an Aegean inlet, and that ordinary action with the scything elbow
  contains the skipping lines of the <i>Iliad</i> and the
  <i>Odyssey,</i> and another child aims a bamboo arrow at a
  village festival, another hears the rustling march of cabbage
  palms in a Caribbean sunrise, and from that sound, with its
  fragments of tribal myth, the compact expedition of Perse's epic
  is launched, centuries and archipelagoes apart. For every poet it
  is always morning in the world. History a forgotten, insomniac
  night; History and elemental awe are always our early beginning,
  because the fate of poetry is to fall in love with the world, in
  spite of History.<br>
  <br>
  There is a force of exultation, a celebration of luck, when a
  writer finds himself a witness to the early morning of a culture
  that is defining itself, branch by branch, leaf by leaf, in that
  self-defining dawn, which is why, especially at the edge of the
  sea, it is good to make a ritual of the sunrise. Then the noun,
  the "Antilles" ripples like brightening water, and the sounds of
  leaves, palm fronds, and birds are the sounds of a fresh dialect,
  the native tongue. The personal vocabulary, the individual melody
  whose metre is one's biography, joins in that sound, with any
  luck, and the body moves like a walking, a waking island.<br>
  <br>
  This is the benediction that is celebrated, a fresh language and
  a fresh people, and this is the frightening duty owed.<br>
  <br>
  I stand here in their name, if not their image - but also in the
  name of the dialect they exchange like the leaves of the trees
  whose names are suppler, greener, more morning-stirred than
  English - <i>laurier canelles, bois-flot, bois-canot</i> - or the
  valleys the trees mention - <i>Fond St. Jacques, Matoonya,
  Forestier, Roseau, Mahaut</i> - or the empty beaches - <i>L'Anse
  Ivrogne, Case en Bas, Paradis</i> - all songs and histories in
  themselves, pronounced not in French - but in patois.<br>
  <br>
  One rose hearing two languages, one of the trees, one of school
  children reciting in English:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am monarch of all I survey,<br>
    My right there is none to dispute;<br>
    From the centre all round to the sea<br>
    I am lord of the fowl and the brute.<br>
    Oh, solitude! where are the charms<br>
    That sages have seen in thy face?<br>
    Better dwell in the midst of alarms,<br>
    Than reign in this horrible place ...</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>While in the country to the same metre, but
  to organic instruments, handmade violin, chac-chac, and goatskin
  drum, a girl named Sensenne singing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Si mwen di 'ous &ccedil;a fait mwen la
    peine<br>
    'Ous kai dire &ccedil;a vrai.</i><br>
    (If I told you that caused me pain<br>
    You'll say, "It's true".)<br>
    <i>Si mwen di 'ous &ccedil;a pentetrait mwen</i><br>
    <i>'Ous peut dire &ccedil;a vrai</i><br>
    (If I told you you pierced my heart<br>
    You'd say, "It's true".)<br>
    <i>Ces mamailles actuellement<br>
    Pas ka faire l 'amour z'autres pour un rien.</i><br>
    (Children nowadays<br>
    Don't make love for nothing.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is not that History is obliterated by
  this sunrise. It is there in Antillean geography, in the
  vegetation itself. The sea sighs with the drowned from the Middle
  Passage, the butchery of its aborigines, Carib and Aruac and
  Taino, bleeds in the scarlet of the immortelle, and even the
  actions of surf on sand cannot erase the African memory, or the
  lances of cane as a green prison where indentured Asians, the
  ancestors of Felicity, are still serving time.<br>
  <br>
  That is what I have read around me from boyhood, from the
  beginnings of poetry, the grace of effort. In the hard mahogany
  of woodcutters: faces, resinous men, charcoal burners; in a man
  with a cutlass cradled across his forearm, who stands on the
  verge with the usual anonymous khaki dog; in the extra clothes he
  put on this morning, when it was cold when he rose in the
  thinning dark to go and make his garden in the heights - the
  heights, the garden, being miles away from his house, but that is
  where he has his land - not to mention the fishermen, the footmen
  on trucks, groaning up mornes, all fragments of Africa originally
  but shaped and hardened and rooted now in the island's life,
  illiterate in the way leaves are illiterate; they do not read,
  they are there to be read, and if they are properly read, they
  create their own literature.<br>
  <br>
  But in our tourist brochures the Caribbean is a blue pool into
  which the republic dangles the extended foot of Florida as
  inflated rubber islands bob and drinks with umbrellas float
  towards her on a raft. This is how the islands from the shame of
  necessity sell themselves; this is the seasonal erosion of their
  identity, that high-pitched repetition of the same images of
  service that cannot distinguish one island from the other, with a
  future of polluted marinas, land deals negotiated by ministers,
  and all of this conducted to the music of Happy Hour and the
  rictus of a smile. What is the earthly paradise for our visitors?
  Two weeks without rain and a mahogany tan, and, at sunset, local
  troubadours in straw hats and floral shirts beating "Yellow Bird"
  and "Banana Boat Song" to death. There is a territory wider than
  this - wider than the limits made by the map of an island - which
  is the illimitable sea and what it remembers.<br>
  <br>
  All of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every
  mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog.
  Pieces of sunlight through the fog and sudden rainbows,
  <i>arcs-en-ciel.</i> That is the effort, the labour of the
  Antillean imagination, rebuilding its gods from bamboo frames,
  phrase by phrase.<br>
  <br>
  Decimation from the Aruac downwards is the blasted root of
  Antillean history, and the benign blight that is tourism can
  infect all of those island nations, not gradually, but with
  imperceptible speed, until each rock is whitened by the guano of
  white-winged hotels, the arc and descent of progress.<br>
  <br>
  Before it is all gone, before only a few valleys are left,
  pockets of an older life, before development turns every artist
  into an anthropologist or folklorist, there are still cherishable
  places, little valleys that do not echo with ideas, a simplicity
  of rebeginnings, not yet corrupted by the dangers of change. Not
  nostalgic sites but occluded sanctities as common and simple as
  their sunlight. Places as threatened by this prose as a headland
  is by the bulldozer or a sea almond grove by the surveyor's
  string, or from blight, the mountain laurel.<br>
  <br>
  One last epiphany: A basic stone church in a thick valley outside
  Soufri&egrave;re, the hills almost shoving the houses around into a
  brown river, a sunlight that looks oily on the leaves, a backward
  place, unimportant, and one now being corrupted into significance
  by this prose. The idea is not to hallow or invest the place with
  anything, not even memory. African children in Sunday frocks come
  down the ordinary concrete steps into the church, banana leaves
  hang and glisten, a truck is parked in a yard, and old women
  totter towards the entrance. Here is where a real fresco should
  be painted, one without importance, but one with real faith,
  mapless, Historyless.<br>
  <br>
  How quickly it could all disappear! And how it is beginning to
  drive us further into where we hope are impenetrable places,
  green secrets at the end of bad roads, headlands where the next
  view is not of a hotel but of some long beach without a figure
  and the hanging question of some fisherman's smoke at its far
  end. The Caribbean is not an idyll, not to its natives. They draw
  their working strength from it organically, like trees, like the
  sea almond or the spice laurel of the heights. Its peasantry and
  its fishermen are not there to be loved or even photographed;
  they are trees who sweat, and whose bark is filmed with salt, but
  every day on some island, rootless trees in suits are signing
  favourable tax breaks with entrepreneurs, poisoning the sea
  almond and the spice laurel of the mountains to their roots. A
  morning could come in which governments might ask what happened
  not merely to the forests and the bays but to a whole
  people.<br>
  <br>
  They are here again, they recur, the faces, corruptible angels,
  smooth black skins and white eyes huge with an alarming joy, like
  those of the Asian children of Felicity at <i>Ramleela;</i> two
  different religions, two different continents, both filling the
  heart with the pain that is joy.<br>
  <br>
  But what is joy without fear? The fear of selfishness that, here
  on this podium with the world paying attention not to them but to
  me, I should like to keep these simple joys inviolate, not
  because they are innocent, but because they are true. They are as
  true as when, in the grace of this gift, Perse heard the
  fragments of his own epic of Asia Minor in the rustling of
  cabbage palms, that inner Asia of the soul through which
  imagination wanders, if there is such a thing as imagination as
  opposed to the collective memory of our entire race, as true as
  the delight of that warrior-child who flew a bamboo arrow over
  the flags in the field at Felicity; and now as grateful a joy and
  a blessed fear as when a boy opened an exercise book and, within
  the discipline of its margins, framed stanzas that might contain
  the light of the hills on an island blest by obscurity,
  cherishing our insignificance.</p>
