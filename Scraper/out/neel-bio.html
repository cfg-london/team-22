  <h1>Louis N&eacute;el - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="neel.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Louis N&eacute;el</b> was born in Lyons
  on 22 November 1904. In 1931 he married H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
  Hourticq; they have three children, Marie Fran&ccedil;oise,
  Attach&eacute;e d'Administration at the Conseil d'Etat, Marguerite,
  married to Gu&eacute;ly, Professeur agr&eacute;g&eacute;e d'histoire,
  and Pierre, who is a television producer. Louis N&eacute;el studied
  at the Ecole Normal
  Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris from 1924-1928, where he was
  appointed lecturer in 1928. In 1932 he obtained the degree of
  Doctor of Science at the University of Strasbourg, where he was
  appointed Professor at the Faculty of Science (1937-1945). He was
  Professor in Grenoble since 1945. In 1946 he became Director of
  the laboratory for electrostatics and metal physics (Centre
  National de la Recherche Scientifique). From 1954 until 1970 he
  was Director of the Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble and of the
  Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise de Papeterie; in 1970 he was appointed
  President of the Institut National Polytechnique in Grenoble. He
  served as director of the Centre d'Etudes nucl&eacute;aires de
  Grenoble from 1956 to 1970. From 1949 to 1969 he was a member of
  the Board of Directors of the C.N.R.S.; scientific adviser to the
  French Navy since 1952; French representative at the Scientific
  Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br>
  <br>
  Louis N&eacute;el began his first research work on magnetism
  between 1928 and 1939 in Professor Weiss' laboratory in
  Strasbourg. Called up for war service in 1939, he worked on the
  defence of ships of the French fleet against German magnetic
  mines and invented an effective new method of protection
  (neutralization). After the Armistice of 1940, he went to
  Grenoble and established the Laboratoire d'Electrostatique et de
  Physique du M&eacute;tal, which in 1946 became one of the external
  laboratories of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
  This laboratory extended rapidly and gave rise to new
  laboratories; even so, it still has a staff of more than 250 at
  the present time.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956 Louis N&eacute;el created and subsequently developed, as
  part of the French Atomic Energy Commission, the Centre d'Etudes
  Nucl&eacute;aires de Grenoble. He also contributed to the decision
  to install the Franco-German high-flux reactor in Grenoble
  (1967).<br>
  <br>
  Although he continued with research, sometimes critical and
  difficult, on the specific heat of nickel, Louis N&eacute;el has
  mainly concentrated on theoretical problems, which have formed
  the subject of more than 150 publications. Besides his discovery
  of the concepts of antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism and its
  consequences, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, Louis
  N&eacute;el tackled and solved a number of other problems and
  extended our knowledge of many aspects of magnetism. The most
  important of these are as follows: theory of Rayleigh's Laws;
  magnetic properties of fine grains; magnetic viscosity; internal
  dispersion fields; superantiferromagnetism; and hysteresis.<br>

  The following distinctions and honours have been awarded to
  Professor N&eacute;el: Chevalier de la L&eacute;gion d'Honneur
  (military) in 1940, Officier in 1951, Commandeur in 1958, and
  Grand Officier in 1966; Croix de Guerre with palms (1940);
  Commandeur de l'Ordre des Palmes Acad&eacute;miques (I957);
  Chevalier du M&eacute;rite Social (1963); Holweck Prize (1952); old
  Medal of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (1965).
  He is a member of the French Academy of Science (Paris, 1953); a
  foreign member of the Soviet Academy of Science (1959), the Royal
  Dutch Academy of Science (1959), the Deutsche Akademie der
  Naturforscher Leopoldina (1964), the Rumanian Academy (1965), the
  Royal Society (London) (1966), and the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences (1966).<br>
  <br>
  Prof. N&eacute;el is honorary doctor of the Universities of
  Graz (1948), Nottingham (1951), Oxford (1958), Louvain (1965),
  Newcastle
  (1965), Coimbra
  (1966), Sherbrooke (1967), and Iassy (1971). He holds an
  honorary degree from the Polytechnic Institute of Turin (1960).
  He is an honorary member and former president (1957) of the
  Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Physique. From 1963 to 1966
  he was President of the International Union of Pure and Applied
  Physics.</p>
