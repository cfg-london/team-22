  <h1>John C. Mather - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="mather.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on Aug. 7, 1946 in Roanoke, Virginia, a small city near Blacksburg
where my father was a young faculty member at the school now called
Virginia Tech. For some generations, my family on both sides has been populated
with scientists and school teachers. My father, Robert E. Mather, was
starting his research career in animal husbandry and statistics, specializing
in dairy cattle breeding and feeding, having just received his PhD from the
University of Wisconsin. My mother, Martha Cromwell Mather, was teaching
high school French. When I was about a year and a half old, my parents
moved to the Rutgers Agricultural Experiment Station, also known as the
Dairy Research Station, in Sussex County, New Jersey. This is a very peaceful
farming area, in the rolling foothills of the Appalachians, and our house
was just a mile from Appalachian Trail. James Turner, a stockbroker from
Montclair, New Jersey, and originally Scottish from Glasgow, founded the
experiment station in 1931 I believe. So my childhood from age 1 to 15 was
spent in that house, at the top of a long hill, looking over a valley filled with
fields and farms and forests. My earliest memory is of a medical procedure in
the hospital in Sussex  I had my tonsils out when I was about 2.5 years old,
and they gave me ice cream. Our home looked out at a barn where 20 bulls
were kept, and they were the sires of half the cows of northern New Jersey.
Within a few yards of the house was an office building where the analysis of
the experiments was done. Down the hill past the barn was a laboratory with
calorimeters, chemical analysis equipment, liquid nitrogen tanks for keeping
semen frozen until it was needed, some radioisotope equipment for studying
metabolism, and so forth. As I understand it, my dad was responsible for developing
a test that measured the protein content of milk, and thus indirectly
for the re-optimization of the dairy industry to produce more protein and
less butter. Later on, he became one of the early users of computers, and had
the milk production records of 10,000 cows on punched IBM cards.</p>

<p>I attended Wantage Consolidated Elementary School near Sussex, N.J.,
  which had about 600 students, and was established in the 1930's so that the
  one-room schoolhouses in the area could be closed. So I rode a big yellow
  school bus to school, along with many other students, most of them children
  of independent farmers. Their farm labors made them very strong, and our
  school athletes excelled at baseball and wrestling, but I was not among the
  athletes. I was much more interested in reading everything that came my way,
  hiding a book behind the desk while the other students learned from class.
  My interest in science started quite early. My earliest school recollection,
  from age 6, is actually of mathematics, realizing that one could fill an entire
  page with digits and never come to the largest possible number, so I saw what
  was meant by infinity. I recall that my parents took my sister and me a few
  times to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, after a journey
  of at least two hours, which to me seemed forever. The first time, Mars
  was very close to the Earth, and there was great excitement about whether
  the canals could be seen. My father bought a small telescope from Sears
  Roebuck, but of course it could not show the canals, and Mars was extremely
  small even with the telescope. He also bought a book <i>Astronomy Made Simple</i>,
  which got me started. My parents also enjoyed reading aloud from various
  books, including biographies of Darwin and Galileo. I was fascinated with
  the museum displays of the sequence of different kinds of skeletons of fishes,
  showing their changes through time, so evolution was quite the obvious conclusion
  even to a child. I liked thinking about geology and hunting for fossils
  in the roadside streams, as I built little dams of mud and pebbles. I didn't
  really appreciate what science was about yet, but it sounded very exciting,
  and a little dangerous in case one discovered things that were not consistent
  with previous knowledge, especially religious thought. In later years, I occasionally
  dreamed of being in court, defending the right to teach evolution in
  the schools. My mother's father, Hobart Cromwell, was a bacteriologist with
  Abbott Laboratories in suburban Chicago. I never got to know him well, as
  he died very young, but he was always a heroic figure in our family, wise and
  gentle and intelligent by reputation, with the courage to fight against the
  McCarthyites.</p>

<p>By the time I was in fourth grade (age = grade + 5 years) I was already
  pretty sure I liked scientific and engineering things, including electronics.
  For Christmas I got a one-tube radio kit, and then I saved my allowance for
  a 5-tube shortwave Heathkit radio that I put together so I could listen to
  exotic languages and broadcasts from far-away places. Around that time,
  the IGY (International Geophysical Year) was starting up, and at our spot in
  New Jersey it was marked by a fabulous bright aurora, the only one I've every
  seen. I think 4th grade also marked my first entry into the school Science Fair,
  and I submitted 4 little projects. Hardly anyone else at the school was much
  interested in science at the time, but I had one friend who walked several
  miles to come visit us at our house and talk about these things. We did have a
  Bookmobile, a traveling library from the County that visited the farms every
  couple of weeks, and I borrowed as much as I could. I started reading about
  optics, and I saved my allowance and ordered some lenses from Edmund
  Scientific and assembled small refractor telescopes. One summer my parents
  sent me off to a summer camp in the Poconos, a place that stood out because
  it had a science program. Another summer, they sent me to a day camp with
  the high school science teacher in Newton, New Jersey, Ben Cummings. With
  him, we climbed a hillside near High Point State Park and came back with
  bags of trilobites. And one year, I wanted to do a science fair project with
  a &quot;robot&quot; that I designed with vacuum tubes and remote controls. It never
  worked but I got a lot of experience, and now looking back on it I recognize
  that my parents contributed a substantial research grant when I was only
  about 11. So I had a lot of opportunity to learn science, even in our very rural
  setting.</p>

<p>When I finished 8<sup>th</sup> grade, it was time to go to high school, and my parents
  decided to send me to Newton High School, where they thought we
  would get the best available education in our area. That turned out well for
  me, and I had some excellent teachers in science, math, and English that I
  really liked. I took biology in 9<sup>th</sup> grade, chemistry in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, and physics
  in 11<sup>th</sup> grade. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to go away to
  summer schools. After 10<sup>th</sup> grade I went to Assumption College for about 10
  weeks to learn about the foundations of mathematics, and after 11<sup>th</sup> grade
  I went to Cornell University for a summer physics program. That was truly
  extraordinary for me, with an introduction to quantum mechanics, special
  relativity, optics, nuclear physics, and cosmology. Coming back from these
  programs, having done fairly well, I was convinced that I could have a future
  in science, and I was very glad to have a head start relative to others of my
  age. The National Science Foundation sponsored these summer programs,
  and they certainly did a wonderful thing for us. I competed in the nationwide
  math contest and placed 7<sup>th</sup> in New Jersey, I think, and in a statewide physics
  contest I placed first. With all this success I was feeling pretty good, but my
  parents reminded me frequently that I would still have to work hard in college,
  since I had been a big fish in a little pond, and I didn't know what was
  yet to come in the big world.</p>

<p> I never got very excited about dairy cattle, but my father did help me
  learn two important things, statistics and calculus. For one of my science fair
  projects, I had 8 baby rats that I kept in cages under the table in the kitchen,
  
  and I fed them various diets to see what they needed. My mother must have
  had immense patience with me to allow me to have my experiment there.
  My dad showed me how to design a Greco-Latin square for the experiment,
  and how to do the analysis of variance. The answer: dog food and vitamins
  are good, and corn flakes alone are inadequate. One summer, he returned
  to college to learn calculus himself, and when he got home I borrowed his
  textbook and studied it instead of taking an advanced science course in high
  school. This was another way of getting a little ahead of my cohort, and when
  I got to college it was a good thing.</p>

<p>I chose Swarthmore for college, largely because the atmosphere felt good
  and the faculty promised a complete education in physics. I tried without
  much success to learn a little of the humanities and the arts, but even passing
  the courses in art history and music history was a challenge. In those courses
  I understood what other folks felt when they saw me doing so well in physics;
  I knew it was hopeless to compete on that territory, but I persevered and even
  took up piano lessons again, with enjoyment but not skill or talent. I jumped
  a little ahead again, skipping the second half of freshman physics and diving
  right into sophomore physics. I got a lot of special attention from the faculty
  there and really appreciated it. I was in the honors program, with four
  seminars in math and four in physics and two in astronomy. When it was time
  to graduate, David Wilkinson, a young professor at Princeton, was one of my
  honors examiners. He asked me a question about everyday effects of relativity,
  and I said that magnetism was a relativistic effect of electron motion, or
  something like that. Years later, David was a founding member of the COBE
  team.</p>

<p>For graduate school I chose Princeton, and was making plans to go there,
  when a friend Ted Chang, who was my friend at Assumption College for a
  high school summer, sent me a photo of himself sitting on the fountain in
  Berkeley in January, wearing short sleeves. He sent me an application form
  for a summer job, and I went. As it happened, my job was at the Lawrence
  Berkeley Laboratory, working with Henry Frisch on control electronics for a
  spark chamber. Henry's father was a physicist too, and taught my co-Nobelist
  George Smoot. I liked Berkeley, and changed my mind about Princeton.
  Being a little churlish, I wrote to Princeton and told them that I was withdrawing
  because they had no women students. I was fortunate that my fellowship
  from the National Science Foundation was portable, so switching
  was easy.</p>

<p>At Berkeley, I found a big old brown shingle house to share, and my rent
  was very low. The household was organized by John Hauptman, another
  physics student, and held about 8 other people. Roy Torbert, now a space
  physicist at UNH , was a member of our little group. One household member,
  Richard Rotblatt, was a former architecture student and nuclear reactor
  piping engineer, and he was also an excellent chef. Now he's an accomplished
  wine maker as well. For a while my best friend from high school lived
  with us after returning from Vietnam. This old house could tell many stories
  of the times, with people of all sorts moving in and out.</p>

<p>At first, I thought I wanted to be an elementary particle physicist like
  my hero <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Richard Feynman</a>. I took my courses for two years, during which
  my faith in my future was being challenged by the Vietnam War and by
  the Peoples' Park demonstrations that rocked the city. Governor Ronald
  Reagan's helicopters tear-gassed the campus, and people were seriously
  injured, but I tried to stay out of this trouble and had little sympathy with
  either side. Because I was very nearsighted, I was not drafted to be a soldier,
  so I didn't have to really deal with the great issue of principle that involved
  so many of my classmates. For a while I considered studying the law, in order
  to defend the country from the Government of the day, but when I read the
  course catalog I couldn't imagine studying those subjects. Now as a long-time
  Government employee my perspective has changed a bit. I also talked with
  my plasma physics professor about developing nuclear fusion power for the
  good of humanity, but he seemed to think this would be an extremely long
  and difficult project, as it has turned out to be.</p>

<p>So in 1970 I was looking for a thesis project, and interviewed with various
  faculty members. I found that Paul Richards was working with <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/index.html">Charles
  Townes</a> and a young postdoc Michael Werner to start up projects on the
  newly discovered Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. I liked all three
  of them immediately, as well as the proposed experiment, and I started right
  in. It was a new world for me, much more tangible than years of books and
  classes and late nights in the library. The first project was to build a small
  far infrared spectrometer to take to the Barcroft station on White Mountain
  in eastern California, where the University was studying physiology at high
  altitudes. This project worked out well, but was of course limited in accuracy
  by the interference of the Earth's atmosphere. We were able to set some interesting
  limits on the CMBR intensity, and we got a few publications from
  them. Then, Paul went off to England on a sabbatical and came back with a
  concept for a new experiment, a balloon-borne far infrared interferometer
  to measure the CMBR spectrum. He explained it to the graduate students,
  and David Woody and I started trying to work out and build the design. This
  was the beginning of a baptism by fire, in the art of building instruments that
  would work in remote and hostile locations. It was a time to learn something
  of almost every area of engineering, from mechanical to optical to cryogenics
  to electronics. I'm afraid that my skill was stronger in understanding than it
  was in implementation, and it's a true story that the antenna on the balloon
  payload fell off while it was on the launch pad. It was my solder joint that
  failed. Fortunately this fault was noticed, and the payload was launched successfully.</p>

<p>However, it also was true that we had gotten tired of testing, and our instrument
  did not work, for three different reasons. It was an awful feeling, one
  that stayed with me for the rest of my life, and it was one of those ways of
  learning what one does not want to learn. Murphy's law had been proven one
  more time. Also, I wanted to finish my thesis, and had already lined up a job
  in New York as a postdoc with Pat Thaddeus. So Paul agreed, and my thesis
  described the ground-based work and the design for the balloon instrument.
  David Woody designed a test chamber for the payload, a cubical box of
  Styrofoam and plywood, and filled it with dry ice. He found out why the instrument
  had failed, fixed it, and made it work right for the second flight, the
  summer after I left Berkeley for New York. He analyzed and published the
  data and got his thesis out of the project too. Now he's a radio astronomer at
  CalTech, designing antennas for the new ALMA observatory in Chile.</p>

<p>With Pat Thaddeus at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a part of
  NASA housed in a building adjacent to Columbia University, I was hoping to
  go into a new field of study. I thought that my work on the background radiation
  was awfully difficult, and it was going to be hard to do much better with
  balloons. I suppose I was reacting too much to the failure of the instrument.
  At any rate, I arrived in New York at the end of January 1974, only days before
  the last possible allowed date, and I started theoretical and observational work
  on naturally occurring SiO masers. I learned how to build a microwave receiver
  with brilliant machinists and technicians, and I took it off to McDonald
  Observatory in Texas and to the Navy's Maryland Point observatory on the
  Potomac. We did observe the SiO emission at 43 GHz, which had never been
  seen before in space, and I made a little progress writing a giant Fortran program
  on the IBM 360 computer, but it never came to anything, and years later
  I threw many boxes of IBM cards into the trash, finally admitting defeat.</p>

<p>However, in the summer after I arrived, my trajectory took another abrupt
  turn when NASA issued Announcements of Opportunity 6 and 7, for Scout
  and Delta-launched satellite missions. My optimism was returning, and
  when Pat asked for ideas, I cheerfully asserted that my thesis experiment
  would have worked a lot better in space. He suggested that I call up Rainer
  Weiss, David Wilkinson, and Michael Hauser, and with their colleagues Dirk
  Muehlner and Bob Silverberg together we conceived of the new mission. It
  would have four instruments, a far IR interferometer to measure the CMBR
  spectrum, two instruments to measure its anisotropy (difference in brightness
  in different directions), and an instrument to hunt for the diffuse IR
  background from the first galaxies. Then, the balloon payload flew successfully
  after David Woody fixed it, and things were looking up. We sent in our
  proposal, typed by hand on real typewriters, and I at any rate thought that
  our odds of success were very low. None of us had any prior experience with
  space missions, and none of us knew that there would be about 150 other
  proposals, or that two of those (from JPL and Berkeley) would be direct
  competitors for ours. However, NASA was interested after all. There was
  already a negotiation with the Netherlands and the UK to build the Infrared
  Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Ball Aerospace built the US part of the IRAS.
  So, the first expression of interest in our idea was to see whether the spectrometer
  could be miniaturized and given a ride to space as some part of the
  IRAS. I got a little money to study it, and I presented my concept to the IRAS
  science team at a meeting near Amsterdam. It went over with a resounding
  thud, for good reasons. I am very glad I never had to build this version of the
  instrument I had conceived, but I did learn a lot about what could be done,
  and I learned about the IRAS mission, which was to have a large helium cryostat
  much like the one we needed for the COBE.</p>

<p>So in the fall of 1976, NASA decided formally to study our concept, but
  not just with our team. Nancy Boggess, the Program Scientist at NASA
  Headquarters for infrared astronomy, appointed four members of our original
  team (Hauser, Weiss, Wilkinson, and me), along with George Smoot of
  UC Berkeley and Sam Gulkis of JPL, to form a Mission Definition Science
  Team. Anticipating this event, Mike Hauser had offered me a job at Goddard
  Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, so I was already in place as a
  proper civil servant. We were assigned a manager, Martin Donohoe, and we
  were to compete with about 11 other missions that were also viewed as promising.
  Our little team elected a Chairman (Rainer Weiss), and three Principal
  Investigators (me, Mike Hauser, and George Smoot), and NASA assigned
  me the job of Study Scientist, to work with the engineering team to make
  this project happen. So this was the beginning of the COBE satellite project.
  Mike Hauser, who had hired me, was my main mentor, and I have learned to
  seek his advice whenever times are tough. Among all my colleagues, Mike is
  my greatest hero and example to follow.</p>

<p>We submitted our report, and the results were favorable, so NASA assigned
  us a larger team of seasoned engineers, namely the team that had
  almost finished the IUE (International Ultraviolet Explorer), led by Jerry
  Longangecker. This was a time when the Space Shuttle was being considered
  by Congress, and NASA made a deal that would set its future for a long
  time: all new launches would be made with the Shuttle, and all the expendable
  rockets like the Deltas would be canceled. We argued but we had no
  success, and we had to redesign the COBE to go on the Space Shuttle. This
  wasn't so easy, since the COBE needed a polar orbit, achieved by a launch
  from California, at around 900 km altitude. Most of the Shuttles would be
  launched from Cape Canaveral (then called Cape Kennedy), so our requirement
  was a challenge in any case. By around 1979, NASA decided to build
  the COBE satellite in-house at Goddard, meaning that engineers and scientists
  at Goddard would work together very closely. This is an exception to the
  usual way that NASA obtains satellites, which is by writing contracts to major
  aerospace organizations and university laboratories. In our case, two of the
  three Principal Investigators were already at Goddard, and the third (George
  Smoot at Berkeley) was willing to have Goddard build that instrument too,
  so this new arrangement was very good for us. We had daily interactions
  with our engineering colleagues, we could walk into any laboratory to talk
  about any problem, and we made significant forward progress, and I really
  enjoyed that part. On the other hand, part of the deal was that our project
  was a training project for new engineers, and a reservoir for talent. When
  other projects got into trouble, our team was raided for top talent to go solve
  emergencies elsewhere, and of course there were many of those. I was very
  frustrated about this, but I had to admit, the Hubble Space Telescope really
  did have priority.</p>

<p>In 1980, I made a major decision, to marry Jane Hauser (no relation to
  Mike). I had met Jane in New York back in 1974 while I was taking a workshop
  in re-evaluation counseling, one of many personal growth experiences
  that I sought as a part of my emotional education. (My sister Janet became
  a teacher of this subject for many years, and so did one of my many bosses
  at Goddard.) Jane is a ballet teacher, but she was taking computer programming
  and math courses as she completed her undergraduate education, and
  I was very impressed. So on Nov. 22, 1980, a hundred scientists, engineers,
  and dancers threw us a potluck banquet after our wedding, and I have never
  seen so much good feeling and good food at one time and place, at least
  until I arrived in Stockholm. Jane has been my life partner, my best friend,
  my best editor, and my best advisor ever since. With her I have traveled to
  many amazing places, and become quite fascinated with understanding how
  ancient civilizations managed to accomplish their engineering feats. We've
  seen Tycho Brahe's observatory in Denmark, we've seen Ulugh Beg's observatory
  in Samarkand, and I think most amazing of all, we've seen Pompeii, with
  plumbing, faucets, running water, and so many signs of modern life that one
  can hardly imagine how that knowledge was lost. Sometimes I think it would
  be a lot of fun to write books about how great cities were built, but I seem to
  have something else to do right now.</p>

<p>From 1980 on through the rest of the COBE project, my professional life
  was almost entirely consumed with the COBE. For a while I was a Branch
  Head at Goddard, in charge of the group that Mike Hauser had created. I
  went off for training courses in all kinds of personnel matters. It was an interesting
  education, and reinforced the idea that the manager is really working
  on behalf of the employees. It also emphasized what has become a recurring
  theme for me: life is a team sport, and it matters who's on the team,
  and which team(s) one chooses to be on. For the year after the COBE was
  launched, Werner Neupert acted on my behalf. Later on, Chuck (Charles L.)
  Bennett became the branch head as well as continuing as Deputy Principal
  Investigator for the Differential Microwave Radiometers on the COBE; he's
  also one of my other favorite advisors and great heroes.</p>

<p>I can't imagine telling anything like a complete biographical story about
  my work on the COBE. I made an attempt in the book <i>The Very First Light</i>,
  written with John Boslough, a professional science writer. Some people have
  told me that they were exhausted after reading this book, the story was so full
  of terrifying moments. Needless to say, the COBE team was exhausted too at
  various times. For more details, please see the <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/mather-lecture.html">Nobel Lecture</a> accompanying
  this note, and the numerous technical publications from our team. But the
  main point I need to make is that the COBE mission was a team effort. Our
  team gave their complete concentration and support for a very long time,
  they dealt with having to redesign the mission after the Challenger explosion,
  they tested the observatory extensively, and they fixed the problems
  that they found. The analysis team found ways to compensate for &quot;systematic
  errors&quot; that were built into the designs, and in the end got measurements far
  beyond the formal requirements for sensitivity and accuracy.</p>

<p>After the COBE work was completed, I was wondering what to do next. For
  years I had successfully repelled all challenges to my concentration on one
  overwhelming responsibility. Now, it was done, and I switched my attention to
  developing new mission concepts. My colleague Harvey Moseley was working
  on the IRAC (Infrared Array Camera) for the SIRTF mission (Space Infrared
  Telescope Facility, later named the Spitzer Space Telescope). He said the
  next telescope needed more angular resolution, because the IRAC was so
  sensitive that its long exposures would be confusion-limited, i.e. that the
  fuzzy images of distant galaxies would be so numerous that they would overlap.
  I started thinking about this question and thought we needed to build
  a small (2 meter) telescope that would be deployed after launch, so it could
  be squeezed into an inexpensive launch vehicle. I presented this idea at a
  colloquium one day and my colleagues laughed and said NASA would never
  fly such a radical departure from tradition, and anything with a mechanism
  was dead before starting. I also learned about the Edison mission concept,
  being developed by Tim Hawarden and Harley Thronson and an extensive
  international team. This mission was proposed to NASA but was summarily
  rejected, based on grossly inaccurate thermal calculations made by some
  reviewer. Curiously enough, the marriage of these two rejected ideas has
  become the concept for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is
  now my major passion.</p>

<p>My involvement with the JWST began in the fall of 1995, when I received
  a phone message from Ed Weiler at NASA Headquarters, asking that I
  submit a proposal the next day for a study of the Next Generation Space
  Telescope. I was completely astonished  I had no awareness of this topic, or
  of the fact that an entire conference had been held at the Space Telescope
  Science Institute to argue for such an observatory. However, I wasted no
  time and said yes immediately, and then called around to find out the background
  information. John Campbell, Project Manager for the Hubble Space
  Telescope, already had an idea, and there was a committee, chaired by Alan
  Dressler, preparing a report on &quot;HST and Beyond&quot;. That report called for an
  infrared-optimized telescope to study topics from the early universe to the
  formation of stars and planets near home. It also called for an interferometer
  called the Terrestrial Planet Finder, to examine nearby stars for planets like
  our own Earth. So with this background, my creative juices were flowing, and
  so were those our colleagues. This initial phase of trying out wild ideas and
  hunting for ways to go far beyond anything ever done before is one of my biggest
  thrills. When Alan briefed our NASA Administrator, Dan Goldin, there
  was a real resonance, and Goldin told the January meeting of the American
  Astronomical Society that Alan's vision was much too small, and NASA would
  build a bigger telescope. Goldin got a standing ovation from the meeting. In
  the next few months, we started up two serious industrial/university partnerships
  to develop concepts that competed with the NASA concept, we had
  public briefings of the results, and we were well on our way. At the time, all
  the studies concluded that an 8 meter observatory could be built for the target
  price of $500 M in FY96 dollars, not counting civil service salaries, technology
  development, or the operations phase, but the designs were at the
  level of &quot;viewgraph engineering&quot; in the days when NASA was under the spell
  of &quot;faster, better, cheaper,&quot; so it should not be surprising that later details
  have driven up the cost. We initiated technology developments for all the
  main inventions that were required for the mission, and those have all been
  successful. We negotiated a partnership with the European and Canadian
  space agencies, and when we finally chose a prime contractor (TRW, later
  purchased by Northrop Grumman), the observatory was named after James
  Webb, the second NASA administrator. Webb is a very appropriate honoree,
  as he is the person responsible for getting human beings to the Moon with
  the Apollo project, and he also insisted to President Kennedy that for the
  good of the Nation, there had to be a scientific research program at NASA
  and in universities. The National Academy's Decadal Survey ranked the
  JWST project as top priority in 2000, and thanks to this endorsement is one
  of the few large projects still continuing forward in NASA's science portfolio.
  I think the others will be revived as soon as budget can be found for them,
  since the need has not disappeared. At the moment, the JWST is in excellent
  technical shape. All the major technological developments have been
  completed to the required level, called TRL-6, which means they have been
  tested in the relevant environments. Also, the most difficult items to obtain,
  the mirrors, the detectors, and the microshutter arrays, are being fabricated
  with their final flight designs as I write this note. The JWST is now planned
  for launch in 2013. My role is called &quot;senior project scientist,&quot; and I chair the
  science working group and ensure that the mission will meet the scientific
  requirements. Now, after 11 years of this project, it is quite mature, which
  means that huge teams of people are doing the serious work.</p>

<p>The JWST is not the only wild idea that I've been pushing forward. From
  conversations with Harvey Moseley came the concept for a far infrared interferometer
  to map the sky with the same image quality that we get with
  the Hubble Space Telescope; this mission is now called the SPECS, the
  Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure as David Leisawitz
  named it. One of these days (but not very soon) it will fly. On another day,
  I talked with David Bennett at Notre Dame, and we created the idea of a
  satellite mission to find planets around other stars using the micro-lensing
  phenomenon. David took it seriously and has submitted several proposals for
  it, and I think it will fly one day too, because it does things no other planetfinding
  mission can do. Probably my wildest idea was to send a miniature
  telescope to the outer solar system to see the cosmic infrared background
  light directly, without interference from interplanetary dust. This idea was
  half-baked but it was fun to work on it, and I got a little money to have a
  young technician build a miniature radiative cooler. That part worked brilliantly
  but it wasn't enough for a mission. I still enjoy developing new mission
  concepts, and have recently been trying to persuade people to work on yet
  another way of hunting for planets around nearby stars.</p>

<p>Now, as I have passed the age of 60, and the Nobel Prize has recognized
  our COBE work, my life has changed again. I am giving many public lectures,
  to help the public understand the work we have done and hope to do in the
  future, and to inspire young people to be as excited about science as I am. I
  am also broadening my perspective one more time, trying to learn about the
  entire range of space science, and helping to guide NASA science towards
  the discoveries of the future. On April 2, 2007, I will take on the job of Chief
  Scientist of the Science Mission Directorate of NASA, so I will have the opportunity
  and responsibility to advise NASA on the proper balance of scientific
  programs from Earth science to cosmology. The panorama of amazing
  research programs is almost overwhelming, and I am looking forward to
  seeing it.</p>

<p>Any biographical statement would be empty without thanking the people
  who helped me through life. My parents, my sister, and my wife have all
  helped me immeasurably in finding my way through the challenges, and
  maintaining my faith in humanity despite all the disappointments that happen.
  My teachers in high school, college, graduate school, and my postdoctoral
  advisor Pat Thaddeus have led me to water and urged me to drink, and
  I have sometimes followed their advice. Their enthusiasm was contagious and
  I do my best to pass it on to my colleagues and to the public. My professional
  mentors at NASA have shown me how to work successfully and cheerfully
  with a giant organization full of talent. NASA's review panels have saved our
  projects over and over, though we often hate to hear their opinions, and I
  especially thank the people who told us when we were doing things wrong.
  It is so much better to know about it before we push the launch button!
  And I suppose it is obvious, but the technical infrastructure developed by
  our modern society, partly in response to the Soviet Union and its scientific
  and engineering accomplishments, has made all of this possible beyond any
  imagining in 1946 when I arrived on Earth.</p>
