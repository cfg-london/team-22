  <h1>L&eacute;on Bourgeois - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bourgeois.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>L&eacute;on Victor Auguste Bourgeois</b> (May 21,
  1851-September 29, 1925), the &laquo;spiritual father&raquo; of the
  League of Nations, was a man of prodigious capabilities and
  diversified interests. A statesman, jurist, artist, and scholar,
  L&eacute;on Bourgeois, in the course of a long career, held almost
  every major office available in the French government of the
  Third Republic.<br>
  <br>
  The son of a clock-maker of Jurassian and Burgundian descent,
  Bourgeois lived most of his life in Paris in an
  eighteenth-century townhouse on the rue Palatine. He was an
  insatiable student, reflective, diligent, enthusiastic, and
  possessed of a happy propensity for becoming involved in whatever
  he did. Concerned throughout his life with the improvement of
  man's condition through education, justice under the law, medical
  care, and the abolition of war, he was that political anomaly, a
  politician without personal ambition, who twice refused to run
  for the presidency of the Republic despite assurances that he
  could easily capture it.<br>
  <br>
  As a schoolboy at the Massin Institution in Paris, Bourgeois
  displayed his intelligence, leadership, and oratorical flair
  early. He continued his education at the Lyc&eacute;e Charlemagne,
  and, after fighting in an artillery regiment during the
  Franco-Prussian War, enrolled in the Law School of the University
  of Paris. His education was remarkably broad. He studied Hinduism
  and Sanskrit, worked in the fine arts, becoming knowledgeable in
  music and adept in sculpture - indeed, at the height of his
  political career he exercised his talent as a craftsman, so it is
  reported, by drawing caricatures of his colleagues in cabinet
  meetings.<br>
  <br>
  In 1876, after having practiced law for several years, he assumed
  his first public office as deputy head of the Claims Department
  in the Ministry of Public Works. In rapid succession he became
  secretary-general of the Prefecture of the Marne (1877),
  under-prefect of Reims (1880), prefect of the Tarn (1882),
  secretary-general of the Seine (1883), prefect of the
  Haute-Garonne (1885), director of personnel in the Ministry of
  the Interior (1886), director of departmental and communal
  affairs (1887). In November of 1887, at the age of thirty-six, he
  was appointed chief commissioner of the Paris police.<br>
  <br>
  When in February, 1888, Bourgeois defeated the formidable General
  Boulanger to become deputy from the Marne, his political future
  was assured. He joined the Left in the Chamber, attending the
  congresses of the Radical-Socialist Party and rapidly becoming
  their most renowned orator. He was named undersecretary of state
  in Floquet's cabinet (1888), elected deputy from Reims (1889),
  chosen minister of the Interior in the Tirard cabinet
  (1890).<br>
  <br>
  As minister of public instruction in Freycinet's cabinet from
  1890 to 1892 and again in 1898 under Brisson, Bourgeois
  instituted major reforms in the educational structure,
  reconstituting the universities by regrouping the faculties,
  reforming both the secondary and primary systems, and extending
  the availability of postgraduate instruction. When he gave up the
  education portfolio in 1892, he accepted that of the Ministry of
  Justice for two years.<br>
  <br>
  On November 1, 1895, Bourgeois formed his own government. His
  political program included the enactment of a general income tax,
  the establishment of a retirement plan for workers, and
  implementation of plans for the separation of church and state,
  but his government succumbed, not quite six months old, to a
  constitutional fight over finances.<br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the French delegation to the first Hague Peace
  Conference in 1899, Bourgeois presided over the Third Commission,
  which dealt with international arbitration, and, together with
  the chairmen of the British and American delegations, was
  responsible for the success of the proposal adopted by the
  Conference to establish a Permanent Court of Arbitration. In
  early 1903, after the Court had become a reality, he was
  designated a member.<br>
  <br>
  Bourgeois became president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1902;
  briefly withdrew from public life in 1904 because of poor health;
  traveled for a time in Spain, Italy, and the Near East; resisted
  the urging of his friends to run for the presidency; sought and
  won election as senator from the Marne in 1905, an office to
  which he was continuously elected until his death; became
  minister of foreign affairs under Sarrien in 1906.<br>
  <br>
  In 1907, Bourgeois represented his country at the second Hague
  Peace Conference where he served as chairman of the First
  Commission on questions relating to arbitration, boards of
  inquiry, and pacific settlement of disputes. His speeches at The
  Hague and at other peace conferences were published in 1910 under
  the title <i>Pour la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nations</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after the turn of the century, Bourgeois twice declined the
  invitation of the president of the Republic to form governments,
  but he continued his services to the nation in other posts. He
  was minister of public works under Poincar&eacute; (1912), minister
  of foreign affairs under Ribot (1914), minister of state during
  the war, minister of public works (1917).<br>
  <br>
  In January of 1918, heading an official commission of inquiry on
  the question of a League of Nations, he presented a draft for
  such an organization. President of a newly formed French
  Association for the League of Nations, he attended the 1919
  international congress, convened in Paris, of various
  organizations interested in establishing a League, and in the
  same year served as the French representative on the League of
  Nations Commission chaired by <a href=
  "../1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson</a>. He brought out another
  collection of his speeches at this time, <i>Le Pacte de 1919 et
  la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nations</i>.<br>
  <br>
  The culmination of Bourgeois' career came in 1920 when he assumed
  the presidency of the French Senate, was unanimously elected the
  first president of the Council of the League of Nations, and was
  awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>
  <br>
  Because of deteriorating health and approaching blindness, he was
  unable to travel to Oslo to accept the prize in person, and in
  1923 he retired from the Senate. He died at Ch&acirc;teau d'Oger,
  near Ep&eacute;rnay, of uremic poisoning at the age of
  seventy-four. The French people honored him with a public
  funeral.</p>
