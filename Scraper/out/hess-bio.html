  <h1>Walter Hess - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hess.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Walter
  Rudolf Hess</b> was born in Frauenfeld, East Switzerland, on
  March 17, 1881. His father was a teacher of physics who allowed
  him, at a very early age, great freedom in dealing with
  apparatus, and taught him a proper carefulness. He also obtained
  a self-reliant gift of observation during excursions through
  forests and meadows, and on lakes and rivers, in the environment
  of the town of his birth. Here, he also visited the Gymnasium,
  completing the course in 1900. As a medical student, he visited
  Lausanne, Berne, Berlin, Kiel, and Zurich. In the University of
  the latter town he took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in
  1906.<br>
  <br>
  Although his aim always was to be a physiologist, external
  reasons first necessitated him to be an assistant in surgery,
  later in ophthalmology, and finally a practising opthalmologist.
  This detour, however, was by no means a disadvantage, as he
  learned, particularly in ophthalmology, to investigate and
  operate with precision. Also the contact with pathological
  physiology has proved in many respects a positive
  advantage.<br>
  <br>
  In 1912 he took the great decision - although already the father
  of a family - of leaving a prosperous practice and going back to
  the position of assistant, this time in physiology itself. He
  obtained his training from Professor Gaule, a pupil of Ludwig,
  and from Professor Verworn in Bonn. In 1917 he was nominated -
  not without great opposition - Director of the Physiological
  Institute at Zurich, with corresponding teaching
  responsibilities. After the First World War, he visited many
  English institutes and got to know the English doyens of
  physiology such as Langley, <a href="../1932/index.html" target=

  target="_blank">Hopkins</a>, <a href="../1936/index.html" target=
  "_blank">Dale</a>, and others.<br>
  <br>
  The scientific interests of Professor Hess were primarily
  directed towards haemodynamics and, in connection with this, the
  regulation of respiration. While the experimental work on the
  subject of the central coordination of vegetative organs has in
  general been extended, a comprehensive picture has emerged of the
  representation of the vegetative nervous system in the
  diencephalon, which has been accorded distinction by the Nobel
  Prize.<br>
  <br>
  During the experimental investigations of the diencephalon,
  setting aside the evidence of the regulatory representations,
  which control the activity of the internal organs in a
  coordinated fashion, somatomotor effects were observed relatively
  often. Following this, the symptoms were analysed in more detail,
  and in the process a relationship was demonstrated between
  supporting functions, automatic correcting movements, and the
  differentiated maintenance of tone in the skeletal musculature,
  as also were connections with actions due to the vestibular
  apparatus. Other investigations dealt with the control of parts
  of the forebrain (area orbitalis), in which Hess together with K.
  Akert has achieved some insight into the cortical representation
  of sight, and oral and pharyngeal regions.<br>
  <br>
  When the professorship and the directorship of the Physiological
  Institute had to be given up in accordance with the regulations,
  Hess had the right to transfer all the material which had been
  acquired over the previous years to the rooms placed at his
  disposal in the Physiological Institute. The possibility also
  existed here of allocating a workplace; to co-workers, and of
  using the &laquo;cerebro-biological collection&raquo;, which he had
  built up, for research purposes. So the work went on, albeit
  restricted in terms of space, and above all of staff.<br>
  <br>
  It had already occurred earlier to Hess that in the experiments
  on diencephalic stimulation modes of behaviour were occasionally
  evident in the experimental animal, which suggested a
  manifestation of psychic powers. Thus was the theme of <i>The
  Biological Aspect of Psychology</i> (1962) established; this was
  taken up, after the fundamental findings on stimulation or
  extirpation at defined sites in the diencephalon had previously
  been described in an atlas (1956).<br>
  <br>
  Out of this work on the integration of the experimental material
  in question concerning psychologically motivated expressions of
  the functional organization of the brain, among other things a
  contribution has been brought about towards bridging the gap
  which, until then, had yawned between physiology and psychiatry.
  At the same time in the monograph where his findings were
  summarized, the physiological foundations of the clinically
  important study of psychosomatic phenomena were dealt with, and
  the understanding of the mode of action of the so-called
  psychotropic drugs was advanced. Also, certain guiding principles
  for a closer contact between the investigation of behaviour and
  the type-specific organization of the central nervous system were
  included.<br>
  <br>
  In the course of the last few years, the goal of satisfying the
  prerequisites for continuing and broadening research on the brain
  was finally pursued.<br>
  <br>
  As the result of combined efforts, a special professorship for
  research on the brain with an independent institute at the
  University of
  Zurich has been established, of which his former co-worker,
  Professor K. Akert, has been elected director.</p>
