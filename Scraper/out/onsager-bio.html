  <h1>Lars Onsager - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="onsager.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Lars Onsager</b> was born in Oslo,
  Norway, November 27, 1903 to parents Erling Onsager, Barrister of
  the Supreme Court of Norway, and Ingrid, n&eacute;e Kirkeby. In
  1933 he married Margarethe Arledter, daughter of a well-known
  pioneer in the art of paper making, in Cologne, Germany. They
  have sons Erling Frederick, Hans Tanberg, and Christian Carl, and
  a daughter Inger Marie, married to Kenneth Roy Oldham.<br>
  <br>
  After three years with the experienced educators Inga and Anna
  Platou in Oslo, one year at a deteriorating private school in the
  country and a few months of his mother's tutoring, he entered
  Frogner School as the family returned to Oslo. There he was soon
  invited to jump a grade, so that he was able to graduate in
  1920.<br>
  <br>
              Admitted to Norges tekniske h&oslash;gskole in the fall of that 
              year as a student of chemical engineering, he entered a stimulating 
              environment; the department had attracted outstanding students over 
              a period of years. Among the professors particularly O.E. Collenberg 
              and J.P. Holtsmark encouraged his efforts in theory and helped him 
              in the evaluation of background knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  After graduation in 1925 he accompanied Holtsmark on a trip to
  Denmark and Germany, then proceeded to Zurich, where he remained
  for a couple of months with <a href=
  "../1936/index.html">Debye</a> and H&uuml;ckel and returned the
  following spring, for a stay of nearly two years. There he
  organized his results in the theory of electrolytes for
  publication, broadened his knowledge of physics and became
  acquainted with a good many leading physicists.<br>
  <br>
  In 1928 he went to Baltimore and served for the spring term as
  Associate in Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. The appointment was not
  renewed; but C.A. Kraus at Brown University engaged him as an
  instructor, and he remained in that position for five years.
  During this time he gave lectures on statistical mechanics,
  published the reciprocal relations and made progress on a variety
  of problems. Some of the results were published at the time, one
  with the able assistance of R.M. Fuoss; others formed the basis
  for later publications. In 1933 he accepted a Sterling Fellowship
  at Yale
  University, where he remained to serve as Assistant Professor
  1934-1940, Associate Professor 1940-1945 and JosiahWillard Gibbs
  Professor of Theoretical Chemistry 1945-1972. Incidentally, he
  obtained a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from Yale in 1935; his
  dissertation consisted of the mathematical background for his
  interpretation of deviations from Ohm's law in weak
  electrolytes.<br>
  <br>
  Over the years, the subjects of his interest came to include
  colloids, dielectrics, order-disorder transitions, metals and
  superfluids, hydrodynamics and fractionation theory. In 1951-1952
  he spent a year's leave of absence as a Fulbright Scholar with
  David Schoenberg at the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge, England, a
  leading center for research in low temperature physics. In the
  Spring of 1961 he served as Visiting Professor of Physics at the
  University of
  California in San Diego. Of his sabbatical leave 1967-1968 he
  spent the first three months as Visiting Professor at Rockefeller
  University and the last three as Gauss Professor in G&ouml;ttingen. In 1962, at the suggestion of
  Manfred Eigen, he joined Neuroscience Associates, a small
  interdisciplinary group organized by F.O. Schmitt in Cambridge,
  Massachusetts.<br>

              Lars Onsager holds honary degrees of Doctor of Science from Harvard 
              University (1954), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1962), Brown University (1962), Rheinisch-Westfahlische 
              Technische Hochschule (1962), the University 
              of Chicago (1968), Ohio State University (Cleveland, 1969), Cambridge University (1970) and 
              Oxford University 
              (1971), and Doctor technicae from Norges tekniske h&oslash;gskole 
              (1960).<br>
  <br>
  In 1953 he received the Rumford Medal from the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences, in 1958 The Lorentz Medal from The Royal
  Netherlands Academy of Sciences, in 1966 the Belfer Award in
  Science from Yeshiva
  University, in 1965 the Peter Debye Award in Physical
  Chemistry from the American Chemical Society, in 1962 the Lewis Medal
  from its California Section, the Kirkwood Medal from the New
  Haven Section and the Gibbs Medal from the Chicago Section, in
  1964 the Richards Medal from the Northeastern Section.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969 he received the National Science Medal, and he became an
  honorary member of The Bunsen Society for Physical Chemistry.
  During Spring 1970 he was Lorentz Professor in Leiden (The
  Netherlands).<br>
