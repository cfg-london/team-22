  <h1>Walter Gilbert - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gilbert.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  March 21, 1932 in Boston, Massachusetts. My father, Richard V.
  Gilbert, an economist, was at that time at Harvard University.
  He worked for the Office of Price Administration during the
  second World War and later headed up a planning group advising
  the Pakistani government. My mother, Emma Cohen, was a child
  psychologist, who practiced giving intelligence tests to me and
  my younger sister. She educated us at home for the first few
  years, to keep my sister and me amused. We loved reading and
  raided the adult section of the public library. In 1939 my family
  moved to Washington D.C.; I was educated there in public schools,
  later at the Sidwell Friends high school.<br>
  <br>
  I always had an interest in science, in those years minerology
  and astronomy (I was a member of a minerological society and an
  astronomical society as a child). I became interested in
  inorganic chemistry at high school. In my last year in high
  school, 1949, I was fascinated by nuclear physics and would skip
  school for long periods to go down to the Library of Congress to
  read about Van de Graaf generators and simple atom smashers. I
  went to Harvard and majored in chemistry and physics. I
  became interested in theoretical physics and, as a graduate
  student, worked in the theory of elementary particles, the
  quantum theory of fields. I spent my first graduate year at
  Harvard, then went to the University of Cambridge for two years, where I
  received my doctorate degree in 1957. My thesis supervisor was
  Abdus Salam; I worked on dispersion relations for elementary
  particle scattering: an effort to use a notion of causality,
  formulated as a mathematical property of analyticity of the
  scattering amplitude, to predict some aspects of the interaction
  of elementary particles. I met Jim Watson during this period. I
  returned to Harvard and, after a postdoctoral year and a year as
  Julian Schwinger's assistant, became an assistant professor of
  Physics. During the late fifties and early sixties, I taught a
  wide range of courses in theoretical physics and worked with
  graduate students on problems in theory. However, after a few
  years my interests shifted from the mathematical formulations of
  theoretical physics to an experimental field.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1960, Jim Watson told me about an experiment
  that he and Francois Gros and his students were working on. I
  found the ideas exciting and joined in for the summer. We were
  trying to identify messenger RNA, a short-lived RNA copy of a DNA
  gene, which serves as a carrier of information from the genome to
  the ribosomes, the factories that make proteins. After each
  messenger is used a few times to dictate the structure of a
  protein, it is broken down and recycled to make other messenger
  RNA molecules. The experiments sought a fleeting new component
  that we finally managed to pin down. I found the experimental
  work exciting and have continued research in molecular biology
  ever since.<br>
  <br>
  After a year of work on messenger RNA, I returned briefly to
  physics then came back to biology to study how proteins are
  synthesized. I showed that a single messenger molecule can
  service many ribosomes at once and that the growing polypeptide
  chain always remains attached to a transfer RNA molecule. This
  last discovery illuminated the mechanism of protein synthesis:
  the protein chain is transferred in turn from one
  amino-acid-bearing transfer RNA to another as it grows, their
  order dictated by messenger RNA and ultimately by the genetic
  code on the DNA. In the middle sixties, Benno M&uuml;ller-Hill
  and I isolated the lactose repressor: the first example of a
  genetic control element. A repressor is a protein product made by
  one gene in the bacterium in order to control a second gene by
  turning it off when its product is not wanted. This control
  function had been defined genetically by the work of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1965/index.html">Jacob and Monod</a>, but a
  repressor is made in such small amounts that it was an
  extraordinarily elusive biochemical entity. We identified,
  characterized, and purified one. We developed bacterial strains
  which made several thousand fold more protein, and showed how
  that repressor functioned. In the late sixties, David Dressler
  and I invented the rolling circle model, which describes one of
  the two ways DNA molecules duplicate themselves. In the early
  seventies I isolated the DNA fragment to which the <i>lac</i>
  repressor bound and studied the interaction of the bacterial RNA
  polymerase and the lac repressor with DNA. In the middle
  seventies, Allan Maxam and I developed the rapid chemical DNA
  sequencing. At this time, I also became interested in and
  developed some of the recombinant DNA techniques, specifically
  showing that blunt end ligation was efficient in putting DNA
  fragments together. In the late seventies with Lydia Villa
  Komaroff and Argiris Efstratiadis I worked on bacterial strains
  that expressed a mammalian gene product, insulin. Currently I am
  interested in, on one hand, the making of useful proteins in
  bacteria and, on the other hand, the structure of genes and the
  evolution of DNA sequences.<br>
  <br>
  After my change from physics to molecular biology, I was promoted
  at Harvard in Biophysics and later in Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology. Since 1974 I have been an American Cancer Society
  Professor of Molecular Biology.<br>

  I am married to Celia Gilbert, a poet, and have two children,
  John Richard and Kate.</p>
