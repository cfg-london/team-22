  <h1>Paul Heyse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="heyse.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Berlin on March 15, 1830, the
  second son of the royal university professor K.W.L. Heyse and his
  wife Julie, n&eacute;e Saaling, who came from a Jewish family.
  After attending the Gymnasium between my eighth and seventeenth
  years, I studied classical philology at Berlin University
  for two years under Boeckh and Lachmann, and with the friendly
  support of Emanuel Geibel and Franz Kugler I dabbled in all sorts
  of poetry. In Bonn, where I studied for a year, I changed from
  classical to Romance philology, taught there by its great
  founder, F. Diez, and at the beginning of 1852 I received the
  doctorate for a dissertation on the refrain in Proven&ccedil;al
  poetry. In the autumn of the same year I went to Rome on a grant
  by the Prussian Ministry of Culture. For a year I stayed at
  various Southern places, continuing my Romance studies at Italian
  libraries. The findings were published by W. Hertz in 1856 under
  the title <i>Romanische Inedita</i>.</p>

  <p>The year 1853 yielded even greater results in creative writing.
  In the spring of 1854 some of my publications persuaded King
  Maximilian II of Bavaria to offer me, at the suggestion of
  Emanuel Geibel, a position in Munich with an annual salary of
  1000 guilders, to take part in his so-called symposia, weekly
  soir&eacute;es at which scholars and poets were gathered. Before I
  moved I was married to Kugler's daughter Margarete, whom death
  took away from me in the autumn of 1862 after she had borne me
  four children. Five years later I married a young woman from
  Munich, Anna Schubart, with whom for forty-four years I have
  lived happily, except for the premature deaths of two children
  and a son from my first marriage.</p>
  
  <p>I have given a detailed account of the first four decades of my
  life until the death of my dear royal patron in my
  <i>Jugenderinnerungen und Bekenntnisse</i> (Berlin, 1900)
  [Memories of my Youth and Confessions]. From that time on outward
  events receded; my life has passed without particular events or
  adventures and has been devoted entirely to writing. Here is a
  list of books published by the Cotta Publishing House:</p>
  
  <p><i>Gesammelte Werke</i> (1871-191O) [Collected Works], 36 vols.;
  <i>Dramatische Dichtungen</i> (1864-1905) [Dramatic Works], 36
  vols.; <i>Romane, Novellen, lyrische und epische Gedichte</i>

  12 vols.; series II, 40 vols.; <i>Italienische Dichter seit der
  Mitte des 18ten Jahrhunderts: &uuml;bersetzungen und Studien</i>
  (1889-1905) [Italian Poets since the Middle of the I8th Century:
