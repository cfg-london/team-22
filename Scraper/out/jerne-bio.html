  <h1>Niels K. Jerne - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="jerne.jpg" class="bio-img"> Niels K.
  Jerne, born 23rd December 1911, London<br>
  <br>
  My parents, Hans Jessen Jerne and Else Marie Lindberg, and their
  ancestors (back to the seventeenth century and earlier) all lived
  on the island Fan&oslash; and in a small adjacent area of western
  Jutland in Denmark. My family moved to London in 1910, and then
  to Holland during the first world war. I received my
  Baccalaureate in Rotterdam in 1928.<br>
  <br>
  After two years of studying physics at the University of Leiden, I switched to medicine at the
  University of
  Copenhagen where I presented my thesis on the avidity of
  antibodies in 1951.<br>
  <br>
  My wife Alexandra and I married in 1964, and now live in our
  house near Avignon. Further details of my curriculum vitae:</p>
