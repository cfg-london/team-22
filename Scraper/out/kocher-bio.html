  <h1>Theodor Kocher - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="kocher.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Theodor Kocher</b> was born on August
  25, 1841, at Berne. His father, a Chief-Engineer, was a very keen
  worker and kept him constantly at work. The influence of a
  devoted mother and later the loving care of a selfsacrificing
  wife enabled him to pass without interruption through the
  continuous strait of secondary school and University, and he
  obtained his doctorate in 1865. His teachers of surgery were
  Demme, L&uuml;cke, Billroth, and Langenbeck. On the warm
  recommendation of both the latter he followed L&uuml;cke (who had
  been called to Strassburg) as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and
  Director of the University Surgical Clinic at Berne in 1872 and
  remained in this post in spite of several invitations to foreign
  universities. As L&uuml;cke's assistant and as
  &laquo;Privat-dozent&raquo; from 1866 onwards he published
  experimental work on haemostasis (by torsion of the arteries) in
  Langenbeck's <i>Archiv</i>, Vol. II, with which Billroth was
  especially pleased; and by anatomical investigations and studies
  of pathological anatomy he discovered a new method for the
  reduction of dislocations of the shoulder, which was soon
  accepted and used as the simplest and surest method of rectifying
  not only recent, but also old dislocations.<br>
  <br>
  When Kocher began his surgical activities the transition from the
  septic to the antiseptic treatment of wounds had been completed
  and Kocher worked for the latter with all his energies because of
  its great importance. Then arose a series of works on the
  antiseptic treatment of wounds with weak chlorine solutions, the
  Listerian treatment of ovariotomies (1875), the preparation of
  antiseptic catgut and the simplest method of obtaining healing of
  wounds without drainage tubes, on conditions governing healing by
  first intention, and on Lister's wound dressings.<br>
  <br>
  The surgical clinic in Berne was for a long time the centre of
  attraction for medical men who favoured the antiseptic treatment
  of wounds and wished to follow it. Later Kocher was one of the
  first to go over to pure asepsis about which he had the best
  opportunities to learn through his collaboration with Tavel,
  whose bacteriological studies on infective processes he sought to
  advance. From this work proceeded the second edition of
  <i>Vorlesungen &uuml;ber chirurgische Infektionshrankheiten</i>
  (Lectures on surgical infectious diseases ) by Kocher and Tavel,
  Basel, 1892, and Jena, 1900.<br>
  <br>
  Because Kocher had also to give courses of instruction to
  military doctors, it was necessary to work experimentally on
  gunshot wounds. Investigation of this subject produced
  significant contributions to the theory of the explosive effect
  of missiles, and Kocher with von Schjering produced the most
  extensive research on and the basis of the modern ideas of the
  mode of action of small calibre missiles with high initial
  velocity. These investigations led to numerous small
  contributions to the journals for Swiss physicians, a lecture to
  the general session of the International Medical Congress in Rome
  in April 1874 on the improvement of projectiles from the humane
  point of view, and two larger works: <i>&Uuml;ber
  Schusswunden</i> (On gunshot wounds), 1880, and <i>Die Lehre von
  den Schusswunden durch Kleinkalibergeschosse</i> (The theory of
  gunshot wounds due to projectiles of small calibre), 1895.<br>
  <br>
  Among Kocher's other more important works those on acute
  osteomyelitis (1878) and the theory of strangulated hernia (an
  experimental and clinical study, 1877) may be mentioned. In this
  study, on the basis of a large number of experiments, a new
  theory of strangulation of hernia was founded called the
  &laquo;dilation theory&raquo; which also had great significance for
  ileus. He published his method for the radical operation for
  hernia. A larger work was on hernia in infancy in Gerhardt's
  Handbook (1880). Apart from hernias, Kocher busied himself very
  much with the surgery of the abdominal organs. <i>In
  Magenresektion</i> (Resection of the stomach) he described a new
  procedure: pylorectomy with subsequent gastroduodenostomy. In
  <i>Excisio recti</i>(Excision of the rectum) preparatory excision
  of the coccyx was introduced, which had been initiated by Kraske,
  and Kocher took this step further and also removed a piece of the
  sacrum (1874). Other works were on the radical cure of cancer,
  the surgical treatment of gastric complaints (1909). In
  <i>Choledocho-Duodenostomia interna</i> (Internal
  choledocho-duodenostomy) he established the procedure for
  excision of gall stones from the lowest part of the bile duct. In
  <i>Mobilisierung des Duodenum</i> (Mobilization of the duodenum)
  he greatly advanced all the operations affecting the duodenum.
  With Dr. Matti he wrote <i>Hundert Operationen an den
  Gallenwegen</i> (A hundred operations on the bile ducts): this
  improved earlier surgical treatment of gall stones and simplified
  them in the form of ideal cholecystotomy. Other larger works
  dealt with ileus and with diseases of the male sexual organs,
  injuries of the vertebral column and fractures. Then followed
  <i>Zur Kenntnis der traumatischen Epilepsie</i> (On our knowledge
  of traumatic epilepsies ) and <i>&Uuml;ber einige Bedingungen zur
  Operativen Heilung der Epilepsie</i> (On some conditions for the
  operative cure of epilepsy), and papers on injuries and
  concussion of the brain and trepanning. He devised a new
  treatment for &laquo;pes varus&raquo; and published a
  well-illustrated work on phosphorus necrosis and another on coxa
  vara.<br>
  <br>
  His <i>Chirurgische Operationslehre</i> (Theory on surgical
  operations) reached six editions and was translated into most
  modern languages. It described many operations, mostly in
  abdominal surgery and the surgery of joints. His book
  <i>Erkrankungen der Schilddr&uuml;se</i> (Diseases of the thyroid
  gland ) discussed the etiology, symptology and treatment of
  goitres. His new ideas on the physiology and pathology of the
  thyroid gland caused controversy.<br>
  <br>
  He and his pupils also wrote several papers on various aspects of
  cretinism and various aspects of goitre.<br>
  <br>
  Kocher was an honorary member of numerous academies and medical
  societies, e.g. the German Surgical Society. He was an Honorary
  Fellow of the Royal College of
  Surgeons; Ll.D. Edinburgh
  University; Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Sciences,
  Uppsala; Honorary Member of the American Surgical Society; of the
  New York Academy of Medicine
  and the College of
  Physicians, Philadelphia; the Imperial Military Medical
  Academy, St. Petersburg; the Academy of Medicine, Turin; the
  Imperial Medical Society of Constantinople; the Royal Medical
  Society of Vienna; Royal Medico-Surgical Society, London; the
  London Medical Society; the London Chemical Society; the Medical
  Society of Finland; and various societies in Milwaukee, Dresden,
  Leipzig and Erlangen. He was a Corresponding Member of the
  Surgical Society of Paris and of the Royal Society of Medical and
  Natural Sciences of Brussels; of the Belgian Academy of Medicine;
  the German Society of Neurologists and of the Hufeland Society of
  Berlin; Honorary M.D. of the Free
  University of Brussels. In 1902 he was President of the
  German Society of Surgeons in Berlin and President of the First
  International Surgical Congress, 1905, in Brussels.<br>
  <br>
  In 1909 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on the
  thyroid gland. Three years later he donated to his University the
  sum of 200,000 Swiss francs for a Research Institute in
  Biology.<br>
  <br>
  Kocher married Marie Witchi (1851-1921). They had three sons, the
  eldest of whom, Albert (1872-1941) became Assistant Professor of
  Surgery and gave his father considerable help in his work.<br>

  Theodor Kocher died at Berne on July 27, 1917.</p>
