  <h1>Jules Bordet - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bordet.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Jules
  Bordet</b> was born in Soignies, Belgium, on June 13, 1870. He was
  educated in Brussels where he graduated as Doctor of Medicine in
  1892. In 1894 he went to Paris to work at the Pasteur Institute
  until 1901 when he returned to Belgium to found the Pasteur Institute, Brussels. He has
  been Director of the Belgian Institute since its inception
  (honorary since 1940) and Professor of Bacteriology, University of Brussels, since 1907
  (honorary since 1935).<br>
  <br>
  Bordet's early studies showed that antimicrobic sera include two
  active substances, one existing before immunization, known as
  alexine, and the other a specific antibody created by
  vaccination: he developed a method of diagnosing microbes by
  sera. In 1898, he discovered haemolytic sera and showed that the
  mechanism of their action on foreign blood is similar to that by
  which an antimicrobic serum acts on microbes and, furthermore,
  that the reactions of the sera are colloidal in nature. He has
  contributed much towards the understanding of the formation of
  coagulin and also anaphylactic poisons. Together with Gengou (in
  1906), he cultivated <i>B.pertussis</i> and laid the foundations
  of the generally accepted opinion that this organism is the
  bacterial cause of whooping cough. In addition to his being an
  acknowledged world authority in many branches of bacteriology,
  Bordet was considered to be a great exponent and worker on
  immunology. He was the author of <i>Trait&eacute; de
  l'Immunit&eacute; dans les Maladies Infectieuses</i> (2nd ed.,
  1939) (Treatise on immunity in infectious diseases) and a great
  number of medical publications.<br>
  <br>
  Bordet was a permanent member of the Administrative Council of
  Brussels University, he was President of the First International
  Congress of Microbiology (Paris, 1930), and Past President of the
  Premier Council of Hygiene of Belgium, the Scientific Council of
  the Pasteur Institute of Paris and the Belgian Academy of
  Medicine. He was Doctor, <i>honoris causa</i>, of the
  Universities of Cambridge,
  Paris, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Edinburgh, Nancy, Caen, Montpellier, Cairo, Athens, and Quebec. He was a member of
  the Belgian Royal Academy, the Royal Society (London), the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
  the Academy of Medicine (Paris), the National
  Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.), and many other academies and
  societies. Bordet gained many awards during his career, including
  the Grand Cordon de l'Ordre de la Couronne de Belgique (1930),
  the Grand Cordon de l'Ordre de L&eacute;opold (1937), the Grand
  Croix de la L&eacute;gion d'Honneur (1938), and public honours of
  Rumania, Sweden and Luxemburg.<br>
