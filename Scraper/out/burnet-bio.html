  <h1>Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="burnet.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Sir Frank
  Macfarlane Burnet</b> was born at Traralgon, Victoria, Australia,
  on September 3rd, 1899. He is the son of the Manager of the
  branch of the Colonial Bank in that town. He was educated at the
  Victoria State Schools and at Geelong
  College, completing his medical course at the University of
  Melbourne, where he graduated M.B., B.S., in 1922, and M.D.,
  in 1923.<br>
  <br>
  In 1923, Burnet went to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of the
  University of Melbourne to do research work on the agglutinin
  reactions in typhoid fever. He was from 1923-1924 Resident
  Pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  In 1926 he was awarded a Beit Fellowship for Medical Research and
  worked for a year at the Lister Institute, London.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932 he spent a year at the National Institute
  for Medical Research, Hampstead, London. Otherwise, apart
  from many visits to various countries to give lectures or for
  other purposes, he has worked continuously at the Hall Institute
  in Melbourne.<br>
  <br>
  In 1944 he became Director of this Institute and Professor of
  Experimental Medicine in the University of Melbourne.<br>
  <br>
  It is impossible to give, in a brief space, an adequate idea of
  the range and fundamental importance of Burnet's work. His work
  on the agglutinins of typhoid fever mentioned above was followed
  by the work on viruses for which he is nowadays justly famous. In
  1935 he isolated a strain of influenza A virus in Australia, and
  subsequently did much work on serological variations of the
  influenza virus and on Australian strains of the swine influenza.
  He also published papers on variations in the virulence of
  influenza virus and on the mutation rates in it, which he
  calculated.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946, in collaboration with W. I. B. Beveridge, Burnet devised
  a technique for cultivating viruses on the chorioallantoic
  membrane of chicken embryos and a method for determining the
  relative concentration of the material inoculated into these
  membranes by counting and statistically analysing the number of
  lesions that then appear on the membranes.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 he discovered, in collaboration with Stone, the
  receptor-destroying enzyme present in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, a
  discovery which led to the synthesis of neuraminic acid and to
  the demonstration, by Gottschalk and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1975/index.html">Cornforth</a>, that
  purified influenza virus will quantitatively split the
  acetylgalactosamine neuraminic acid compound. Later it was shown
  that this enzyme derived from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> can prevent
  infection by the influenza to a significant degree.<br>
  <br>
  Burnet did much other important work on certain aspects of the
  prevention of virus infections and on important biological
  aspects of virus growth inside the cells in which they can live.
  He found that the filamentous forms of some viruses (e.g. those
  of myxoviruses such as those which cause influenza, mumps, fowl
  plague, and Newcastle disease) can be ruptured by suspending them
  in water, and suggested that their infectivity is limited to
  their tips, so that these filamentous forms can, as later work
  showed, be regarded as having an infective &laquo;warhead&raquo;
  composed of nucleic acid and a long tail composed of
  non-infective viral haemagglutinin.<br>
  <br>
  Other aspects of Burnet's work are his work on the surface
  properties of these filamentous forms, which are, he found,
  similar to those of cell surfaces, and his work with the
  haemagglutinin found in extracts of tissue infected with
  vaccinia, which can, he found, be precipitated by a saturated
  solution of ammonium sulphate and by cobra venom. He has also
  added much to our knowledge of the haemagglutination of red blood
  cells by various animal viruses, and has made contributions of
  fundamental importance to our knowledge of the genetic complexity
  of virus particles, and to the genetic interactions between
  related viruses which simultaneously infect the same cell and
  their relations to the transfer of neuropathogenicity. In
  addition, he has increased our knowledge of the inhibition of
  viruses by various substances, and of the complex details of
  immunological methods of studying viruses and of the immunology
  of viral infections.<br>
  <br>
  Burnet has embodied his experience and experimental results, not
  only in numerous scientific papers, but in several books which
  show that he is a master, not only of a clear and attractive
  literary style, but also of lucid exposition of complex ideas and
  scientific facts.<br>
  <br>
  Burnet received many honours and distinctions, among which the
  Fellowship of the Royal Society of London (1942), where he was awarded
  the Royal Medal in 1947 and the Copley Medal in 1959, and where
  he delivered the Croonian Lecture in 1950. He holds an honorary
  doctorate of the University of Cambridge, and was made a Fellow of
  the Royal College
  of Surgeons in 1953. He was knighted in 1951, and in 1958 he
  received the Order of Merit.<br>
  <br>
  Burnet married Edith Linda Druce in 1928. They have one son, Ian,
  and two daughters, Elizabeth (Mrs. Paul M. Dexter) and Deborah
  (Mrs. John Giddy).</p>
