  <h2>The Leadership Demanded in This Momentous Time</h2>

  <p>There is an irresistible demand to
  strengthen the leadership of the constructive forces of the world
  at the present momentous time. This is true because of
  stupendous, almost unbelievable changes which have taken place in
  recent years on every continent. Extreme nationalism and
  Bolshevism have broken up the old world, a new world is in the
  making. It is literally true that old things are passing away;
  all things may become new, granted we have wise, unselfish, and
  determined guides.</p>

  <p>The summons has come to wage a better
  planned, more aggressive, and more triumphant warfare against the
  age-long enemies of mankind - ignorance, poverty, disease,
  strife, and sin. Such distinctively qualitative leadership is
  essential in order that the builders of the new civilization may
  possess the necessary background, outlook, insight, and grasp to
  cope successfully with the forces which oppose and disintegrate.
  How subtle, powerful, and ominous these are in both Orient and
  Occident!</p>

  <p>Such highly qualitative leadership is
  demanded especially in the realm of the fostering of right
  international relations. Here the demand is simply irresistible.
  In a sense the present generation is the first generation which
  could be truly international and it finds itself poorly prepared.
  Many, subtle, and baffling are the maladjustments,
  misunderstandings, with resultant strife and working at
  cross-purposes. We have nothing less to do than to get inside of
  whole peoples and change their motives and dispositions.</p>

  <p>Moreover, we have come out into an age in
  which in every land the economic facts and forces are matters of
  primary and grave concern. It finds us with twentieth-century
  machinery but with antiquated and inadequate political, social,
  and religious conceptions and programs. As a result literally
  millions of men are unemployed, discontented, and embittered.</p>

  <p>An insistent demand has come to augment the
  leadership of the forces of righteousness and unselfishness in
  order to meet constructively the startling development of
  divisive influences on every hand. Obviously these alarming
  manifestations are in evidence in the economic realm. Here we
  have in mind not simply the obvious - the age-long conflict
  between the rich and the poor, between the employed and the
  unemployed - yes, something more alarming, something suggested by
  the phrases economic imperialism, commercial exploitation, and
  the unjust use of the natural resources and so-called open spaces
  of the world. Other of these alarming divisive forces have been
  in evidence in the international realm and have been
  accomplishing their deadly work on an overwhelmingly extensive
  scale in recent years in two world wars. Still other of these
  divisive manifestations have been in the sphere of race
  relations. In some respects this has become most serious because
  most neglected.</p>

  <p>Above all, such strengthened leadership is
  essential and imperatively demanded if the constructive forces of
  the world are to be ushered into a triumphant stage. Irresistible
  is the demand on every hand and in every land for men to restudy,
  rethink, restate, revise and, where necessary, revolutionize
  programs and plans, and then, at all costs, to put the new and
  longer programs into effect.</p>

  <p>What should today and tomorrow across the
  breadth of the world characterize the leadership of the forces of
  righteousness and unselfishness?</p>

  <p>It should be a comprehending leadership. It
  should reveal a vivid awareness of the present expansive, urgent,
  and dangerous world situation. The leaders must understand its
  antecedents and background. They must know the real battleground,
  therefore the forces and factors that oppose, and those that are
  with us. They must indeed know our world, our time, and our
  destiny. In discovering the leaders of tomorrow we must become
  acquainted with the unanswered questions of ambitious youth and
  the possibilities of human nature. Above all, we must rely upon
  the superhuman resources.</p>

  <p>The leadership so imperatively needed just
  now must be truly creative. The demand is for thinkers and not
  mechanical workers. Bishop Gore<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>,
  one of the most discerning leaders of his day, summed up our need
  in an aphorism as apt today as yesterday: "We do not think and we
  do not pray"; that is, we do not use the principal power at our
  disposal - the power of thought - and we do not avail ourselves
  of incomparably our greatest power - the superhuman power of
  prayer. Well may we heed the injunction of St. Peter to "gird up
  the loins of your mind". How essential it is that those who
  tomorrow are to lead the constructive forces should give diligent
  heed that the discipline of their lives, the culture of their
  souls, and the thoroughness of their processes of spiritual
  discovery and appropriations be such as will enable them to meet
  the demands of a most exacting age.</p>

  <p>The leadership must be statesmanlike. And
  here let us remind ourselves of the traits of the true statesman
  - the genuinely Christian statesman. He simply must be a man of
  vision. He sees what the crowd does not see. He takes in a wider
  sweep, and he sees before others see. How true it is that where
  there is no vision the people perish.</p>

  <p>The most trustworthy leader is one who
  adopts and applies guiding principles. He trusts them like the
  North Star. He follows his principles no matter how many oppose
  him and no matter how few go with him. This has been the real
  secret of the wonderful leadership of Mahatma Gandhi<a href=
  "#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>. In the midst of most bewildering
  conditions he has followed, cost what it might, the guiding
  principles of non-violence, religious unity, removal of
  untouchability, and economic independence.</p>

  <p>The great statesmen observe relationships -
  a governing consideration imperatively demanded on the part of
  leaders in the present bewildering age.</p>

  <p>A most highly multiplying trait in point of
  far-reaching influences is that of ability to discover and use
  strong men. This trait stands out impressively in Rothschild's
  <i>Lincoln,</i> <i>Master of Men</i><a href=
  "#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Curzon<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>, one
  of the eminent administrators of his day, said we rule by the
  heart. Possibly no trait is more needed in the present time of so
  much misunderstanding, friction, and strife.</p>

  <p>Foresight has been a distinguishing
  characteristic of all truly great political, religious, and
  social betterment leaders. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1906/index.html">Theodore Roosevelt</a><a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> had the one motto hanging on his office
  wall which truly illustrated his life practice: "Nine tenths of
  wisdom is being wise in time." You will recall that it was said
  of Cecil Rhodes, the great African administrators<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>, that he was always planning what he
  would do year after next.</p>

  <p>Of front line importance among the most
  contagious and enduring traits of the leaders of nations and of
  all callings is that of spotless character. How this stands out
  in the chapter on "Aristides the Just" in Plutarch<a href=
  "#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>. And how the opposite stands out in
  Lorenzo de' Medici<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a> of whom it was
  said that "he was cultured yet corrupt, wise yet cruel, spending
  the morning writing a verse in praise of virtue and spending the
  night in vice".</p>

  <p>Among the qualities most needed among those
  who aspire to true leadership in the fostering of peace and
  goodwill among the nations and in overcoming racial and religious
  antagonism is the cooperative spirit and objective. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1912/index.html">Elihu Root</a><a href=
  "#not9"><sup>9</sup></a> who ever illustrated this trait,
  emphasized the fact that you can measure the future greatness and
  influence of a nation by its ability to cooperate with other
  nations.</p>

  <p>As I speak of leadership in these fateful
  years across the breadth of the world, I would pay a tribute to
  leaders of Norway. In this connection I would find it difficult
  to exaggerate my sense of the part borne with such marked courage
  and wisdom by His Majesty The King<a href=
  "#not10"><sup>10</sup></a> before, during, and following the
  momentous days of the war. In common with Christians the world
  over, I would gratefully acknowledge the heroic and truly
  Christian guidance and backing afforded by Bishop
  Berggrav<a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a> and other leaders of
  the church. Moreover, as I think of the contribution made by
  Hambro<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a> and other
  representatives of Norway in their marked guidance on baffling
  international questions in other countries, I am vividly reminded
  of the great international service he rendered during and at the
  end of the First World War. I would also recognize the splendid
  service being rendered day by day by your representative Mr.
  Lie<a href="#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>, with whom I had fellowship
  only last week, in his indispensable guidance of the vast and
  complicated activities of the United Nations Organization. Among
  the contributions of Norway to the insuring of right
  international relations in the present century, the part taken by
  the Nobel Peace Committee has been one of unique distinction.</p>

  <p>In closing, let me emphasize the
  all-important point that Jesus Christ summed up the outstanding,
  unfailing, and abiding secret of all truly great and enduring
  leadership in the Word: "He who would be greatest among you shall
  be the servant of all<a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>." He
  Himself embodied this truth and became "the Prince Leader of the
  Faith", that is, the leader of the leaders.</p>
