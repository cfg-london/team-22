  <h2>Peace, Progress, Human Rights<a href="#note">*</a></h2>

  <p>Honored members of the Nobel Committee,
  Ladies and Gentlemen.<br>
  <br>
  Peace, progress, human rights - these three goals are insolubly
  linked to one another: it is impossible to achieve one of these
  goals if the other two are ignored. This is the dominant idea
  that provides the main theme of my lecture. I am grateful that
  this great and significant prize, the Nobel Peace Prize, has been
  awarded to me, and that I have been given the opportunity of
  speaking to you here today. It was particularly gratifying for me
  to note the Committee's citation, which emphasizes the defense of
  human rights as the only sure basis for genuine and lasting
  international cooperation. I consider that this idea is very
  important; I am convinced that international confidence, mutual
  understanding, disarmament, and international security are
  inconceivable without an open society with freedom of
  information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the
  right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to
  live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience,
  together with the other civic rights, provides the basis for
  scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific
  advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis
  for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political
  guarantee for the possibility of an effective defense of social
  rights. At the same time I should like to defend the thesis of
  the original and decisive significance of civic and political
  rights in moulding the destiny of mankind. This view differs
  essentially from the widely accepted Marxist view, as well as the
  technocratic opinions, according to which it is precisely
  material factors and social and economic conditions that are of
  decisive importance. (But in saying this, of course, I have no
  intention of denying the importance of people's material
  circumstances.)</p>

  <p>I should like to express all these theses
  in my lecture, and I should like in particular to dwell on a
  number of concrete problems affecting the violation of human
  rights. It seems to me that a solution of these problems is
  imperative, and that the time at our disposal is short.</p>

  <p>This is the reason why I have called my
  lecture "Peace, Progress, Human Rights". There is, naturally, a
  conscious parallel with the title of my article of 1968,
  <i>Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom,</i>
  with which my lecture, both in its contents and its implications,
  has very close affinities.</p>

  <p>There is a great deal to suggest that
  mankind, at the threshold of the second half of the twentieth
  century, entered a particularly decisive and critical period of
  its history.</p>

  <p>Thermonuclear missiles, which in principle
  are capable of annihilating the whole of mankind, exist; this is
  the greatest danger threatening our age. Thanks to economic,
  industrial, and scientific advances, the so-called "conventional"
  arms have likewise grown incomparably more dangerous, not to
  mention chemical and bacteriological instruments of war.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that industrial and
  technological progress is the most important factor in overcoming
  poverty, famine, and disease. But this progress leads at the same
  time to ominous changes in the environment in which we live and
  the exhaustion of our natural resources. In this way mankind
  faces grave ecological dangers.</p>

  <p>Rapid changes in traditional forms of life
  have resulted in an unchecked demographic explosion which is
  particularly noticeable in the developing countries of the Third
  World. The growth in population has already created exceptionally
  complicated economic, social, and psychological problems, and
  will in the future inevitably pose still more serious problems.
  In a great many countries, particularly in Asia, Africa, and
  Latin America, the lack of food will be an overriding factor in
  the lives of many hundreds of millions of people, who from the
  moment of birth are condemned to a wretched existence on the
  starvation level. In view of this, future prospects are menacing,
  and in the opinion of many specialists tragic, despite the
  undoubted success of the "green revolution".</p>

  <p>And yet in the developed countries, too,
  people are faced with serious problems. One of these is the
  pressure resulting from excessive urbanization, all the changes
  that disrupt the community's social and psychological stability:
  the incessant pursuit of fashion and trends; over-production; the
  senseless and crazy tempo of life; the increase in the number of
  nervous and mental disorders; the growing number of people
  deprived of contact with nature and of normal human lives in the
  traditional sense of the word; the dissolution of families and
  the loss of simple human joys and delights; the decline in the
  community's moral and ethical principles; and the sense that more
  and more people no longer feel that they have any reasonable goal
  in life. Against this background we witness a whole host of
  disquieting phenomena: an increase in crime, in alcoholism, in
  drug addiction, in acts of terror, and so forth. The imminent
  exhaustion of the world's resources, the threat of
  overpopulation, the constant and deep-rooted international,
  political, and social problems are making a more and more
  forceful impact on the developed countries too, and will deprive
  - or at any rate threaten to deprive - a great many people who
  have long been used to abundance, affluence, and creature
  comforts.</p>

  <p>However, in the pattern of problems facing
  the world today a more decisive and important role is played by
  the global political polarization of mankind, which is divided
  into the so-called First World (which is conventionally called
  the Western world), the Second World (socialist), and the Third
  World (the developing countries). Two powerful socialist states,
  in fact, have become hostile, totalitarian empires, in which a
  single party and the state exercise immoderate power in all
  spheres of life. They possess an enormous potential for
  expansion, striving to increase their influence to cover large
  areas of the globe. One of these states - the Chinese People's
  Republic - has as yet reached only a relatively modest stage of
  economic development, whereas the other - the Soviet Union - by
  exploiting its unique natural resources, by taxing to the utmost
  the powers of its inhabitants and their ability to suffer
  continued privation, has today built up a tremendous war
  potential and a relatively high - though one-sided - economic
  development. But in the Soviet Union, too, the people's standard
  of living is low, and civic rights more restricted than in the
  smaller socialist countries. Highly complicated global problems
  are also involved in the Third World, where a relatively stagnant
  economy may be seen hand in hand with growing international
  political activity.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this polarization further
  reinforces the very serious dangers threatening the world - the
  danger of nuclear annihilation, famine, pollution of the
  environment, exhaustion of resources, over-population, and
  dehumanization.</p>

  <p>If we consider the whole of this complex of
  urgent problems and contradictions, I am convinced that the first
  point that must be made is that any attempt to reduce the tempo
  of scientific and technological progress, to reverse the process
  of urbanization, to call for isolationism, patriarchal ways of
  life, and a renaissance based on a return to sound national
  traditions from times long past, would be unrealistic. Progress
  is indispensable, and to bring it to a halt would involve the
  decline and fall of our civilization.</p>

  <p>It is not so very long since men were
  unfamiliar with artificial fertilizers, mechanized farming, toxic
  chemicals, and intensive agricultural methods. There are voices
  calling for a return to more traditional and possibly less
  dangerous forms of agriculture. But can this be put into practice
  in a world in which hundreds of millions of people are suffering
  the pangs of hunger? On the contrary, there is no doubt that we
  need increasingly intensive methods of farming, and we need to
  spread modern methods all over the world, including the
  developing countries. We cannot reject the idea of a more and
  more widespread use of the results of medical research or the
  extension of research in all its branches, including bacteriology
  and virology, neuro-physiology, human genetics, and gene surgery,
  no matter what potential dangers lurk in their abuse and the
  undesirable social consequences of this research. This also
  applies to research which aims at creating systems for imitating
  intellectual processes and research involving the control of mass
  human behaviorism, the setting up of a unified global system of
  communication, systems for selecting and storing of information,
  and so forth. It is quite clear that in the hands of
  irresponsible, bureaucratic authorities operating under cover of
  secretiveness, all this research may prove exceptionally
  dangerous, but at the same time it may prove extremely important
  and necessary to mankind, if it is carried out under state
  control, testing, and socio-scientific analysis. We cannot reject
  the wider and wider application of artificial materials,
  synthetic food, or the modernization of every aspect of life; we
  cannot object to the growing automatization and increase in
  industrial production, irrespective of the social problems these
  may involve.</p>

  <p>We cannot object to the construction of
  bigger and bigger thermonuclear power stations or research into
  nuclear physics, since energetics is one of the bases of our
  civilization. In this connection I should like to remind you of
  the fact that twenty-five years ago I and my teacher, the winner
  of the Nobel Prize for Physics, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1958/index.html">Igor Jeugenivich Tamm</a>,
  laid the basis for nuclear physical research in our country. This
  research has achieved a tremendous scope, extending into the most
  varied directions, from the classical setup for magnetic heat
  isolation to methods for the use of lasers.</p>

  <p>We cannot object to the exertions which aim
  at control not only of those parts of the universe that surround
  our earth, as well as other sections of the cosmos, including the
  attempts to intercept signals from civilizations outside our own
  earth. The chance of experiments of this kind proving successful
  is probably small, but precisely for this reason the results may
  well be tremendous.</p>

  <p>I have only mentioned a few examples, but
  there are undoubtedly many others. In actual fact all important
  aspects of progress are closely interwoven; not one of them can
  be dispensed without a risk of destroying the entire setup of our
  civilization. Progress is indivisible. But intellectual factors
  play a special role in the mechanism of progress. The attempt to
  underestimate these factors is particularly widespread in the
  socialist countries, no doubt owing to the populist-ideological
  dogmas of official philosophy, and may well result in a distorted
  picture of progress or even its cessation and stagnation.
  Progress is possible and innocuous only when it is subject to the
  control of reason. The highly important problem involving the
  preservation of the environment is one of the examples in which
  the role of public opinion, the open society, and freedom of
  conscience is particularly obvious. The partial liberalization
  that took place in our country after the death of Stalin made it
  possible for us to engage in public debate on this problem during
  the early sixties. But an effective solution of the problem
  demands increased tightening of social and international control.
  The military application of scientific results and controlled
  disarmament are an equally critical area, in which international
  confidence depends on public opinion and the open society. The
  example I mentioned involving the control of mass human
  behaviorism is already a highly topical one, even though this may
  appear far-fetched.</p>

  <p>Freedom of conscience, the existence of an
  informed public opinion, a system of education of a pluralist
  nature, freedom of the press, and access to other sources of
  information, all these are in very short supply in the socialist
  countries. This is a result of the economic, political, and
  ideological monism which is characteristic of these nations, At
  the same time these conditions are a vital necessity, not only if
  all abuse of progress, witting or unwitting, is to be avoided,
  but also if we wish to strengthen it. It is particularly
  important that an effective system of education and a creative
  sense of heredity from one generation to another is only possible
  in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom. And conversely:
  intellectual bondage, the power and conformism of a pitiful
  bureaucracy which from the very start acts as a blight on
  humanist fields of knowledge, literature, and art, results
  eventually in a general intellectual decline, bureaucratization
  and formalization of the entire system of education, a decline of
  scientific research, and the thwarting of all incentive to
  creative work, to stagnation, and to dissolution.</p>

  <p>In the polarized world the totalitarian
  states, thanks to d&eacute;tente, enjoy the opportunity today of
  indulging in a special form of intellectual sponging. And it
  seems that, if the inner changes, which we all consider
  necessary, do not take place, they will soon be forced to adopt
  an approach of this kind. This is precisely one of the many
  results of d&eacute;tente. If it does take place, the danger of an
  explosion in the world situation will merely increase.
  Cooperation on a wide front between the western countries, the
  socialist countries, and the developing countries is a vital
  necessity for peace, and it involves an exchange of scientific
  results, technology, trade, and mutual economic aid, particularly
  where food is concerned. But this cooperation must be based on
  mutual trust between open societies, or - to put it another way -
  with an open mind, on the basis of genuine equality, and not on
  the basis of the democratic countries' fear of their totalitarian
  neighbors. If that were the case, cooperation would merely
  involve an attempt at ingratiating oneself with a formidable
  neighbor. But a policy of this kind would merely mean postponing
  the evil day, which would soon return, through another door, in
  tenfold strength. This is simply another version of the Munich
  policy. The success of d&eacute;tente can only be assured if from
  the very outset it goes hand in hand with continual observation
  of openness on the part of all countries, an aroused sense of
  public opinion, free exchange of information, absolute respect in
  all countries for civic and political rights. In short: in
  addition to d&eacute;tente in the material sphere, with disarmament
  and trade, d&eacute;tente should take place in the intellectual and
  ideological sphere. The President of France, Giscard d'Estaing,
  expressed this in an admirable fashion during his visit to
  Moscow. It was worth listening to criticism from shortsighted
  pragmatists among one's own countrymen when the maintenance of an
  important principle was at stake!</p>

  <p>Before dealing with the problem of
  disarmament, I should like to take this opportunity once again of
  reminding you of some of my proposals of a general nature. This
  applies first and foremost to the idea of setting up an
  international consultative committee for questions related to
  disarmament, human rights, and the protection of the environment,
  under the aegis of the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United Nations</a>. In my opinion a committee of this
  kind should have the right to receive binding replies from all
  governments to their enquiries and recommendations. A committee
  of this kind could become an important working body in securing
  international discussion and information on the most important
  problems affecting the future of mankind. I am waiting for this
  idea to receive support and to be discussed.</p>

  <p>I should also like to emphasize that I
  consider it particularly important for United Nations armed
  forces to be used more generally for the purpose of restricting
  armed conflicts between states and ethnic groups. I have a very
  high regard for the United Nations' potential and necessary role,
  and I consider the institution to be one of mankind's most
  important hopes for a better future. Recent years have proved
  difficult and critical for this organization. I have written on
  this subject in my book <i>My Country and the World</i>, but
  after it came out a deplorable event took place: the General
  Assembly adopted - practically without any real debate - a
  resolution declaring Zionism a form of racism and racial
  discrimination. All impartial persons know that Zionism is the
  ideology of a national rebirth of the Jewish people after two
  thousand years of separation, and that this ideology is not
  directed against any other people. The adoption of a resolution
  of this kind has, in my opinion, dealt the prestige of the United
  Nations a hard blow. But despite motions of this kind, which are
  frequently tabled as the result of insufficient sense of
  responsibility among the leaders of some of the younger member
  nations of UNO, I believe nevertheless that the Organization may
  sooner or later be in a position to play a worthy role in the
  life of mankind, in accordance with the clause in which the
  Organization's aims are set forth.</p>

  <p>Let me now tackle one of the central
  questions of the present age, the problem of disarmament. I have
  described in detail just what my position is in the book <i>My
  Country and the World</i>. It is imperative to promote confidence
  between nations and carry out measures of control with the aid of
  international inspection groups. This is only possible if
  d&eacute;tente is extended to the ideological sphere, and it
  presupposes greater social openness. In my book I have stressed
  the need for international agreements on the limitation of arms
  supplies to other states, a halt in the production of new weapon
  systems based on a mutual agreement, treaties banning secret
  rearmament, the elimination of strategically uncertain factors,
  and in particular a ban on multi-warhead nuclear missiles.</p>

  <p>What do I consider would be the ideal
  international agreement on disarmament on the technical
  plane?</p>

  <p>I believe that prior to an agreement of
  this kind we must have an official declaration - though not
  necessarily official in the initial stages - on the extent of
  military potential (ranging from the number of nuclear warheads
  to forecast figures on the number of personnel liable for
  military service), with, for example, an indication of areas of
  "potential confrontation". The first step in this agreement would
  be to ensure that for every single strategic area and for all
  sorts of military potential an adjustment would be made in every
  case to iron out the superiority of one party to the agreement in
  relation to the other. (Naturally this is the kind of pattern
  that would be liable to some adjustment.) This would in the first
  place obviate the possibility of an agreement in one strategic
  area (Europe, for instance) being utilized to strengthen military
  positions in another area (e.g. the Soviet-Chinese border). In
  the second place, potential injustices based on quantitative
  comparison with regard to the significance of different types of
  potential would be excluded. (It would, for example, be difficult
  to say how many batteries of the ABM type would correspond to a
  cruiser, and so on.)<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> The next
  step in disarmament would have to be proportional and
  simultaneous de-escalation for all countries and in all strategic
  areas. A formula of this kind for "balanced" two-stage
  disarmament would ensure continuous security for all countries,
  an interrelated equilibrium between armed forces in all areas
  where there is a potential danger of confrontation, while at the
  same time providing a radical solution to the economic and social
  problems that have arisen as a result of militarization. In the
  course of time a great many experts and politicians have launched
  similar views, but hitherto these have not made much significant
  advance. However, now that humanity is faced with a real threat
  of annihilation in the holocaust of nuclear explosion, I hope
  that human reason will not hesitate to take this step. Radical
  and balanced disarmament is in effect both necessary and
  possible, constituting an integral part of a manifold and
  complicated process for the solution of the menacing and urgent
  problems facing the world. The new phase in international
  relations which has been called d&eacute;tente, and which appears
  to have culminated with the Helsinki Conference, does in
  principle open up certain possibilities for a move in this
  direction.</p>

  <p>The final agreement reached at the Helsinki
  Conference has a special claim on our attention, because here for
  the first time official expression is given to a nuanced approach
  which appears to be the only possible one for a solution of
  international security problems. This document contains
  far-reaching declarations on the relationship between
  international security and the preservation of human rights,
  freedom of information, and freedom of movement. These rights are
  guaranteed by solemn obligations entered into by the
  participating nations. Obviously we cannot speak here of a
  guaranteed result, but we can speak of fresh possibilities that
  can only be realized as a result of long-term planned activities,
  in which the participating nations, and in particular the
  democracies maintain a unified and consistent attitude.</p>

  <p>This is in particular bound up with the
  problem of human rights, to which I have devoted the final
  portion of my lecture. I should like to speak mainly of my own
  country. During the months that have ensued since the Helsinki
  Conference there has been absolutely no real improvement in this
  direction. In fact in some cases attempts on the part of
  hardliners can be noted to "give the screw another turn".</p>

  <p>This also applies to important problems
  involving an international exchange of information, the freedom
  to choose the country in which one wished to live, travel abroad
  for studies, work, or health reasons, as well as ordinary tourist
  travel. In order to provide concrete examples for my assertion, I
  should like to give you a few instances - chosen at random and
  without any attempt to provide a complete picture.</p>

  <p>You all know, even better than I do, that
  children, e.g. from Denmark, can get on their bicycles and cycle
  off to the Adriatic. No one would ever think of suggesting that
  they were "teenage spies". But Soviet children are not allowed to
  do this! I am sure that you can all find analogous examples of
  this and similar situations.</p>

  <p>As you know, the General Assembly, as a
  result of pressure on the part of the socialist countries,
  resolved to restrict the liberty to make TV transmissions via
  satellite. I believe, now that the Helsinki Conference has taken
  place, that there is every reason to deal afresh with this
  problem. For millions of Soviet citizens this is both important
  and interesting.</p>

  <p>In the Soviet Union there is a great
  shortage of artificial limbs and similar aids for invalids. But
  no Soviet invalid, even though he may be in receipt of a formal
  invitation from a foreign firm, is allowed to travel abroad in
  response to an invitation of this kind.</p>

  <p>Soviet newsstands do not sell foreign
  anti-Communist papers, and it is not even possible to buy every
  issue of the Communist periodicals. Even informative periodicals
  such as <i>America</i> are in very short supply. They are on sale
  only in a very small number of kiosks, and are immediately
  snapped up by eager buyers, generally with a "makeweight" of
  non-saleable printed matter.</p>

  <p>Any person wishing to emigrate from the
  Soviet Union must have a formal invitation from a close relative.
  For many people this is an insoluble problem, e.g. for 300,000
  Germans who wish to travel to the German Federal Republic (the
  emigration quota for Germans is 5,000 a year, which means that
  one's plans would have to cover a sixty-year period!). This is an
  enormous tragedy. The position of persons who wish to be reunited
  with relatives in non-Socialist countries is particularly tragic.
  They have no one to plead their case, and on such occasions the
  arbitrary behavior of the authorities knows no bounds.</p>

  <p>Freedom to travel, freedom to choose where
  one wishes to work and live, these are still violated in the case
  of millions of kolkhoz workers, and in the case of hundreds of
  thousands of Crimean Tartars, who thirty years ago were cruelly
  and brutally deported from the Crimea and who to this day have
  been denied the right to return to the land of their fathers.</p>

  <p>The Helsinki Treaty confirms yet again the
  principle of freedom of conscience. However, a stern and
  relentless struggle will have to be carried on if the contents of
  this treaty are to be given reality. In the Soviet Union today
  many thousands of people are persecuted because of their
  convictions, both by judicial and by non-judicial organs, for the
  sake of their religious beliefs and for their desire to bring
  their children up in the spirit of religion, for reading and
  disseminating - often only to a few acquaintances - literature
  which is unwelcome to the State, but which in accordance with
  ordinary democratic practice is absolutely legitimate, e.g.
  religious literature, and for attempts to leave the country. On
  the moral plane the persecution of persons who have defended
  other victims of unjust treatment, who have worked to publish and
  in particular to distribute information regarding the persecution
  and trials of persons with deviant opinions, and of conditions in
  places of internment, is particularly important.</p>

  <p>It is unbearable to consider that at this
  very moment that we are gathered together in this hall on this
  festive occasion, hundreds and thousands of prisoners of
  conscience are suffering from undernourishment, as the result of
  year-long hunger, and of an almost total lack of proteins and
  vitamins in their daily food, of a shortage of medicines (there
  is a ban on the sending of vitamins and medicines to internees),
  and of over-exertion. They shiver with cold, damp, and exhaustion
  in ill-lit dungeons, where they are forced to wage a ceaseless
  struggle for their human dignity and their conviction against the
  "indoctrination machine", in fact against the very destruction of
  their souls. The very special feature of the concentration camp
  system is carefully concealed. All the sufferings a handful of
  people have undergone because they have drawn aside the veil to
  reveal this, provide the best proof of the truth of their
  allegations and accusations. Our concepts of human dignity demand
  an immediate change in this system for all interned persons, no
  matter how guilty they may be. But what about the sufferings of
  the innocent? Worst of all is the hell that exists in the special
  psychiatric clinics in Dnieperopetrovsk, Sytshevk, Blagoveshensk,
  Kazan, Chernakovsk, Oriol, Leningrad, Tashkent, ... .</p>

  <p>There is no time for me today to describe
  in detail particular trials, or the fates of particular persons,
  There is a wealth of literature on this subject: may I draw your
  attention to works published by the Chronica Press in New York,
  which specializes in off-prints of the Soviet Samizdat periodical
  <i>Survey of Current Events,</i> and which publishes similar
  bulletins of current information. Here in this hall I should just
  like to mention the names of some of the internees I am
  acquainted with. As you were told yesterday, I would ask you to
  remember that all prisoners of conscience and all political
  prisoners in my country share with me the honor of the Nobel
  Prize. Here are some of the names that are known to me:</p>

  <p>Plyush, Bukovsky, Glusman, Moros, Maria
  Seminoova, Nadeshda Svetlishnaya, Stefania Shabatura, Irina
  Klynets-Stasiv, Irina Senik, Niyola Sadunaite, Anait Karapetian,
  Osipov, Kronid Ljubarsky, Shumuk, Vins, Rumachek, Khaustov,
  Superfin, Paulaitis, Simutis, Karavanskiy, Valery, Martshenko,
  Shuchevich, Pavlenkov, Chernoglas, Abanckin, Suslenskiy,
  Meshener, Svetlichny, Sofronov, Rode, Shakirov, Heifetz,
  Afanashev, Mo-Chun, Butman, Lukianenko, Ogurtsov, Sergeyenko,
  Antoniuk, Lupynos, Ruban, Plachotniuk, Kovgar, Belov, Igrunov,
  Soldatov, Miattik, Kierend, Jushkevich, Zdorovyy, Tovmajan,
  Shachverdjan, Zagrobian, Arikian, Markoshan, Arshakian,
  Mirauskas, Stus, Sverstiuk, Chandyba, Uboshko, Romaniuk,
  Vorobiov, Gel, Pronjuk, Gladko, Malchevsky, Grazis, Prishliak,
  Sapeliak, Kolynets, Suprei, Valdman, Demidov, Bernitshuk,
  Shovkovy, Gorbatiov, Berchov, Turik, Ziukauskas, Bolonkin,
  Lisovoi, Petrov, Chjekalin, Gorodetsky, Chjernovol, Balakonov,
  Bondar, Kalintchenko, Kolomin, Plumpa, Jaugelis, Fedoseyev,
  Osadchij, Budulak-Sharigin, Makarenko, Malkin, Shtern, Lazar
  Liubarsky, Feldman, Roitburt, Shkolnik, Murzienko, Fedorov,
  Dymshits, Kuznetsov, Mendelevich, Altman, Penson, Knoch, Vulf
  Zalmanson, Izrail Zalmanson, and many, many others. Among those
  in exile are Anatoly Martshenko, Nashpits, and Zitlenok.</p>

  <p>Mustafa Dziemilev, Kovalyev, and
  Tverdochlebov are awaiting their verdicts. There is no time to
  mention all the prisoners of whose fate I am aware, and there are
  still larger numbers whom I do not know, or of whom I have
  insufficient knowledge. But their names are all implicit in what
  I have to say, and I should like all those whose names I have not
  mentioned to forgive me. Every single name, mentioned as well as
  unmentioned, represents a hard and heroic human destiny, years of
  suffering, years of struggling for human dignity.</p>

  <p>The main solution to the problem of
  persecuting persons with deviant views must be liberation on the
  basis of international agreements - a liberation of all political
  prisoners, of all prisoners of conscience in prisons, internment
  camps, and psychiatric clinics, if necessary on the basis of a
  resolution passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations.
  This proposal involves no intervention in the internal affairs of
  any country. After all, it would apply to every country on the
  same basis - to the Soviet Union, to Indonesia, to Chile, to the
  Republic of South Africa, to Spain, Brazil, and to every other
  country. Since the protection of human rights has been proclaimed
  in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, this cannot
  for this reason be said to be a matter of purely internal or
  domestic concern. In order to achieve this great goal, no
  exertions are too great, however long the road may seem. And that
  the road is long was clearly shown during the recent sitting of
  the United Nations, in the course of which the United States
  tabled a proposal for political amnesty, only to withdraw it
  after attempts had been made by a number of countries - in the
  opinion of the USA - to extend unduly the framework that would
  cover the concept of amnesty. I much regret what took place. A
  problem cannot be taken out of circulation. I am profoundly
  convinced that it would be better to liberate a certain number of
  people - even though they might be guilty of some offence or
  other - than to keep thousands of innocent people locked up and
  exposed to torture.</p>

  <p>Without losing sight of an overall solution
  of this kind, we must today fight for every individual person
  separately against injustice and the violation of human rights.
  Much of our future depends on this.</p>

  <p>In struggling to protect human rights we must, I am convinced,
  first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of
  regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the
  destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. We need
  reform, not revolution. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant
  community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a
  free, undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems.
  What is d&eacute;tente? What is rapprochement? We are concerned not
  with words, but with a willingness to create a better and more
  friendly society, a better world order.</p>

  <p>Thousands of years ago tribes of human
  beings suffered great privations in the struggle to survive. In
  this struggle it was important not only to be able to handle a
  club, but also to possess the ability to think reasonably, to
  take care of the knowledge and experience garnered by the tribe,
  and to develop the links that would provide cooperation with
  other tribes. Today the entire human race is faced with a similar
  test. In infinite space many civilizations are bound to exist,
  among them civilizations that are also wiser and more
  "successful" than ours. I support the cosmological hypothesis
  which states that the development of the universe is repeated in
  its basic features an infinite number of times. In accordance
  with this, other civilizations, including more "successful" ones,
  should exist an infinite number of times on the "preceding" and
  the "following" pages of the Book of the Universe. Yet this
  should not minimize our sacred endeavors in this world of ours,
  where, like faint glimmers of light in the dark, we have emerged
  for a moment from the nothingness of dark unconsciousness of
  material existence. We must make good the demands of reason and
  create a life worthy of ourselves and of the goals we only dimly
  perceive.</p>
