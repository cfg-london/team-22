  <h1>Kurt W&uuml;thrich - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wuthrich.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  Aarberg, Switzerland, on October 4, 1938, and during my childhood
  I lived in the small town of Lyss in the Berner Seeland. At the
  time this was a rural area of farmland, forests and rivers. The
  roots of the W&uuml;thrich family are in an even more rural,
  mountainous area, the farming village of Trub in the Emmental
  near Bern. My mother's family owned the Restaurant "B&auml;ren"
  and a bakery in Lyss. My grandfather, Otto Kuchen, enjoyed
  fishing and hunting, and his jugged hare dish was a widely known
  fall season delicacy at the "B&auml;ren". My interests during
  childhood were largely influenced by our living in an old
  farmhouse, where my second grandfather, Jakob W&uuml;thrich, had
  been a farmer. Although my father, Herrmann W&uuml;thrich, took
  up an occupation as an accountant, he remained very much attached
  to his upbringings and our family produced a wide range of
  farming goods. My mother, Gertrud W&uuml;thrich-Kuchen was the
  true center of our family life. In addition to raising me and my
  two younger sisters, Elisabeth and Ruth, she did marvelous things
  in the kitchen, tended our big garden, raised fowl, and was
  involved in various activities in the community.</p>

  <p>My intense contacts with the rural
  environment of plants and animals awakened my interest in natural
  science at an early age. In particular, I acquired a thorough
  knowledge of the behavior of all sorts of water animals, mostly
  through observations made while enjoying all aspects of work and
  fun with a private trout river. On rare occasions I still enjoy
  fishing trips, and I am a member of the Mercury Bay Game Fishing
  Club in Whitianga, New Zealand, which lists <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html">Ernest Hemingway</a> and
  Zane Grey among its all-time membership. With regard to my
  professional life, I had set my mind on becoming a forest
  engineer. Although I subsequently changed my mind in this regard,
  I still enjoy tending the family forest, which now contains trees
  that were planted by three generations of our family starting
  with my grandfather.</p>

  <p>My formal training toward an academic
  profession started in 1952, when I transferred from the village
  schools in Lyss to the Gymnasium in the nearby "bilingue" city of
  Biel/Bienne. During the Gymnasium years my interests widened
  beyond forestry and fishing. We had the good fortune that our
  science and language teachers were either former University
  professors, who had left their academic positions elsewhere in
  Europe during the Second World War and found a haven in Biel, or
  followed the then common practice of using a teaching assignment
  at Gymnasium level as a stepping-stone for an academic career. At
  age 14 to 18 we were a group of seven students specializing in
  "natural sciences" who were thus trained in mathematics and
  physics at university level, and I happily accepted the
  challenge. According to my mother, it was during those years that
  I got used to working through the nights. Another focus was the
  French language, French literature, and French theatre and
  movies, which was largely motivated by the fact that the
  composition of our class as well as our teachers represented the
  bilingual character of Biel/Bienne. The Gymnasium Biel was
  informally attached to the Swiss Federal School of Sports and
  Gymnastics in nearby Magglingen, and thus my interest in
  competitive sports was awakened. These three areas all play an
  important role in my life up to the present days. Physics and
  mathematics are key activities in my professional life,
  professional visits in Paris and "les provinces" are combined
  with the sampling of French food, wine and culture, and I not
  only obtained the "Eidgen&ouml;ssisches Turn- und
  Sportlehrerdiplom" as one of my University degrees, but also
  played in a competitive soccer league well beyond the age of
  50.</p>

      1966.
    
  </p>

  <p>By now I can look back on 40 years of
  intense involvement with techniques referred to as "magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy". At the outset in 1962 and throughout my
  graduate studies there was electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR
  spectroscopy). EPR was complemented during my postdoctoral
  training from 1965-1967 by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
  spectroscopy applied to chemical physics projects, and since the
  fall of 1967 I have used NMR for studies of biological
  macromolecules. From there it was a sinuous avenue that led by
  1984 to the NMR method for protein structure determination in
  solution. Our results were occasionally met with doubts and
  disbelief, so that considerable moral strength and perseverance
  was at times called for.</p>

  <p>During my student years from 1957-1962, NMR
  spectroscopy was just being introduced as an analytical tool in
  chemistry, molecular biology was not yet established as an
  independent discipline, and the initial three-dimensional protein
  crystal structures were just emerging. My education at the
  University of Bern could thus not possibly cover the
  areas of our current research. The faculty and the student
  classes in Bern were small in numbers, with three physics
  students and seven chemistry students starting in 1957. From my
  curriculum in chemistry, physics and mathematics, I best remember
  intense work in linear algebra, classical mechanics, chemical
  thermodynamics, physical chemistry of synthetic polymers, and
  preparative biochemistry of proteins and nucleic acids. This
  combination turned out to be an excellent foundation for my later
  scientific activities. The last two years of formal education,
  from 1962 to 1964, were spent at the University of Basel,
  majoring in sports and getting a Ph.D. in chemistry. Studying
  sports included about 25 weekly hours of intense physical
  exercise as well as premedical courses in human anatomy and
  physiology. Combined with experience gained from observations
  made on myself in the pursuit of competitive sports, this
  provided an additional dimension to my education. The subject of
  my Ph.D. thesis in inorganic chemistry with Professor Silvio
  Fallab was the catalytic activity of copper compounds in
  autoxidation reactions, and for this project the availability of
  a state-of-the-art EPR spectrometer in the Physics Institute was
  a great opportunity.</p>

  <p>Studying natural sciences has always been a
  lot of fun for me, but nonetheless my mind was quite solidly set
  on a career as a high school teacher with a heavy involvement in
  sports. In parallel to my studies in natural sciences, I
  extensively yielded to what I thought to be my vocation. Thus,
  during the years 1957-1962, I spent part of each winter as a ski
  instructor in Swiss mountain resorts. From 1959 to 1965, I had
  part-time jobs in high schools, first teaching physics at the
  Kantonsschule Solothurn, then chemistry at the Gymnasium Biel,
  and finally gymnastics at the M&auml;dchengymnasium in Basel.
  These teaching assignments also had an important impact on my
  personal life. In 1961, while on my job as a ski instructor in
  the resort town of Saanenm&ouml;ser in the Berner Oberland, I met
  my wife, Marianne Briner, who at the time was an elementary
  school teacher. We were married in 1963, and Marianne then joined
  me in studying sports at the University of Basel, graduating with
  the "Eidgen&ouml;ssisches Turn- und Sportlehrerdiplom" and
  specializing in modern dance. After the graduate student and
  postdoctoral years we started a family, with our son Bernhard
  Andrew being born in 1968 in Berkeley Heights, NJ, USA, and our
  daughter Karin Lynn joining us in 1970 in Greifensee near
  Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland.</p>

  <p>After finishing my graduate studies I spent
  another year in Basel concentrating on EPR studies of metal
  complexes in solution. In the spring of 1965 we moved to the USA,
  where I joined Professor Robert E. Connick at the University of
  California, Berkeley, for postdoctoral training. We used NMR
  spin relaxation measurements of <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>2</sup>H and
  <sup>1</sup>H in addition to EPR for studies of the hydration of
  metal ions and metal complexes. The Berkeley period was devoted
  to intensive work on the theory of nuclear spin relaxation, group
  theory and quantum mechanics, which was motivated by Bob
  Connick's weekly group seminar, a graduate course on "Group
  Theory and Quantum Mechanics" by Professor Michael Tinkham, and
  an intense collaboration with another Swiss postdoc, Alex von
  Zelewsky, who soon thereafter accepted the chair of inorganic
  chemistry at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Over
  the years, Marianne and I returned at regular intervals to
  Berkeley, to renew the friendships of the 1960s and revive fond
  memories.</p>

  <p>In October 1967 I joined the Biophysics
  Department of Dr. Robert G. Shulman at Bell Telephone
  Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. I was given
  responsibility for the maintenance of what was one of the first
  superconducting high resolution NMR spectrometers, which operated
  at a proton resonance frequency of 220 MHz, and I was otherwise
  free to use this instrument for "research on protein structure
  and function". Due to my background, my interest was focused on
  metal centers rather than on polypeptide chains, and all my
  initial projects in high resolution NMR had to do with
  hemoproteins. Using blood sampled from my arm in the first aid
  station, a Japanese colleague at Bell Labs, Dr. Tetsuo Yamane,
  prepared "hemoglobin (KW)", and within a few months we found
  entirely new avenues of deriving information on
  structure-function correlations from the NMR spectra of
  hemoglobin and other hemoproteins. These projects were a lucky
  choice: with the limited sensitivity and spectral resolution of
  the instrumentation available in 1968, the special spectral
  properties of hemoproteins were a great asset for successful NMR
  applications. Many years later, the unique NMR spectral features
  that enabled the early work with these metalloproteins had an
  important role in various aspects of the development of the NMR
  method for threedimensional protein structure determination.</p>

  <p>In October 1969 I returned to Switzerland
  to join the ETH Z&uuml;rich. From the start I was equally well
  equipped with NMR and EPR instrumentation as previously at Bell
  Telephone Laboratories, and during the following 32 years the ETH
  provided us in regular intervals with the most advanced NMR
  equipment. Until 1975 I was working with a small group of
  students, a chemical engineer, Rudolf Baumann, who has stayed
  with me throughout all these years, and a postdoctoral associate
  with a physics Ph.D. in solid state EPR, Dr. Regula Keller, who
  largely took responsibility for the research with hemoproteins
  from 1970 to 1982. In 1973, Gerhard Wagner decided to do his
  graduate work with me. Gerhard then stayed with the group until
  1987, pursuing a classical European academic career with
  Habilitation before settling as a Professor at Harvard Medical
  School. Being able to keep outstanding junior scientists as
  research associates over extended periods of time was a special
  privilege enjoyed by senior faculty in the traditional "European
  system", and the continued presence of Rudolf, Regula and Gerhard
  during most of my initial 15 years in Z&uuml;rich was a key
  factor for success with our research program.</p>

  <p>In Z&uuml;rich, we continued research on
  hemoproteins with the use of NMR and EPR spectroscopy, where the
  biochemical work was mostly done by groups outside of the ETH who
  joined us for collaborative projects, and the spectroscopic work
  was done by Regula Keller, myself and a succession of graduate
  students. In addition, we started a program of systematic studies
  on the application of NMR techniques with polypeptides and small
  proteins. Spirits were kept high by successful studies of cyclic
  peptides in collaboration with the Head of the Institute of
  Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Professor Robert Schwyzer, the
  observation of unexpectedly well-resolved and longlived NMR lines
  of amide protons in the small protein basic pancreatic trypsin
  inhibitor (BPTI), and the discovery of "ring flips" in BPTI. On
  the main line of research, which should lead to a method for
  protein structure determination in solution, there was only
  little progress. In 1975, in an attempt to survey the state of
  the field of NMR spectroscopy with biological macromolecules, I
  wrote the monograph <i>NMR in Biological Research: Peptides and
  Proteins</i>. There were two principal conclusions from this
  venture that should greatly affect the continuation of our work
  plan. First, I fully realized that we really had been extremely
  fortunate in choosing hemoproteins as a focus for our early NMR
  efforts. Second, it became clear that attempts of the early 1970s
  to derive <i>de novo</i> three-dimensional protein structures
  from conformation-dependent proton chemical shifts was not a
  promising approach, independent of whether these shifts were
  caused by intrinsic or extrinsic diamagnetic or paramagnetic
  probes. We thus had to look for novel avenues for NMR structure
  determination, where hemoproteins with their unique NMRspectral
  properties could be an ideal testing ground for new ideas.</p>

  <p>Shortly after I had learned my lessons from
  writing the 1976 monograph, the conditions under which I could
  pursue my work evolved in quite important ways. After working for
  more than 5 years with a small group of students and research
  associates from the environs of Z&uuml;rich, and being able to
  spend long hours of my own time at the bench and on the NMR
  spectrometers, I found myself suddenly surrounded by more than 20
  postdoctoral fellows and students from all over the world. At
  around the same time, I also started to travel quite extensively
  in all parts of the world, with a first visit to India at the end
  of 1974, and a first "round-the-world" trip including stops in
  the USA and in Japan in the fall of 1975. The visits to India and
  Japan resulted in new, lasting friendships with local colleagues,
  and also in attracting a number of most talented postdoctoral
  fellows to Z&uuml;rich. Ever since, professional travel has
  become an important part of my activities. Over the years this
  also included visiting faculty appointments at the University of
  California, Berkeley, Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, Johns Hopkins
  University in Baltimore, MD, the California Institute of
  Technology in Pasadena, CA, the Scripps Research
  Institute in La Jolla, CA, RIKEN in
  Tokyo, Japan, and the University of Edinburgh, UK. Spending part of my
  time in these places of highest standards added greatly to my
  quality of life as well as to the progress of our research in
  Z&uuml;rich. The international aspect of my activities got a
  special boost in 1975, when - out of the blue - I was elected to
  membership in the Council of the International Union of Pure and Applied
  Biophysics (IUPAB). There was little work involved in this
  assignment, but in 1978 my IUPAB affiliation changed to being its
  Secretary General, and with this I also became a member of the
  "General Committee" of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
  and of the ICSU Standing Committee on the Free Circulation of
  Scientists. During the six-year term as Secretary General the
  demands on my time were thus quite heavy. Fortunately, Marianne
  agreed to run the IUPAB office. This made things easier, since
  she would travel with me and we dealt with the IUPAB business in
  makeshift offices temporarily installed in hotels all around the
  world. The sunny side was that I got to know many prominent
  scientists, whose names I had previously mostly known from the
  textbooks. For example, structural biology was represented in the
  IUPAB Council from 1978-81 by Britton Chance, Henryk Eisenberg,
  David Phillips, Frederic Richards and Akiyoshi Wada, a true
  center of excellence! In the business meetings as well as in the
  social gatherings, we spent much of our time discussing the
  latest research advances long before they appeared in print.
  There was a particularly close collaboration with the IUPAB
  Presidents during my tenure as Secretary General, Professor
  Setsuro Ebashi and Professor Richard Keynes. Richard Keynes is a
  great-grandson of Charles Darwin. During IUPAB-related joint
  travel in Europe and the Far East in 1982/83, I listened to a
  more and more enjoyable but seemingly endless series of
  presentations of his "Darwin Lecture" commemorating the 100th
  anniversary of Darwin's death; in return, Richard lived through a
  heavy dose of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy.</p>

  <p>Through my association with ICSU and IUPAB,
  I also got involved in entirely novel business. Most notable in
  hindsight were negotiations during the period 1980-1983 about
  joint adherence of China and Taiwan in international science
  organizations. We eventually defined terms and conditions for
  adherence to IUPAB of both "The Biophysical Society of China
  located in Beijing, China" and "The Chinese Biophysical Society
  located in Taipei, China". This involved extensive, highly formal
  correspondence, as well as visits and personal negotiations with
  Government and Academy officials in both countries. I also
  participated in IUPAB and ICSU programs of support for scientists
  in developing countries, and I organized summer schools and
  symposia in Africa, the Far East and Latin America. This all
  greatly influenced my outlook to the world. Although each year
  the IUPAB-related activities and my research-related travel kept
  me out of my laboratory for several months, the effect on our
  research was overall highly beneficial. As a bonus, I gained
  experience in directing a research group at a distance, and my
  junior associates could test their own initiatives during my
  absences.</p>

  <p>With all the new talent assembled in my
  group by 1976, we started to develop new NMR experiments and
  novel algorithms for the structural interpretation of NMR data,
  which eventually resulted in the NMR method for protein structure
  determination. This included the identification of the nuclear
  Overhauser effect (NOE) as a NMR parameter that can be related in
  an unambiguous way to three-dimensional macromolecular
  structures. We made used of the outstanding resolution of parts
  of the hemoprotein 1H-NMR spectra for calibrating NOE distance
  measurements with the then-available onedimensional (1D) NMR
  techniques. In addition to Regula Keller, Sidney Gordon, a
  sabbatical visitor, made a key contribution with the introduction
  of the 1D "transient NOE" experiment. Subsequently, the NOE had a
  key role in the approach used for obtaining sequence-specific
  assignments of the many hundred to several thousand NMR lines in
  a protein. The "sequential assignment strategy" was initially
  implemented by Gerhard Wagner and a diploma student, Andreas
  Dubs, using 1D NOE and spin decoupling experiments. In parallel
  with the 1D NMR investigations on NOEs and NMR assignment, the
  development of two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques for
  macromolecular studies had been started in 1976 as a joint
  project with Professor Richard R. Ernst, (Nobel prize in
  Chemistry, 1991). In 1977 the first 2D NMR spectrum of a protein
  was recorded, and by 1980 we had assembled four 2D NMR
  experiments that were then used for the initial protein structure
  determinations: COSY (2D correlated spectroscopy), SECSY (2D
  spin-echo correlated spectroscopy), FOCSY (2D foldover-corrected
  correlated spectroscopy) and NOESY (2D nuclear Overhauser
  enhancement spectroscopy). It was a lot of fun at the time to
  decide on these acronyms! Soon my group started to use 2D NMR
  experiments in daily practice, and the experience from more than
  a decade of one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy with proteins was
  happily and profitably married with the new potentialities of 2D
  NMR.</p>

  <p>By 1982, complete sequence-specific
  assignments had been obtained for a small protein, BPTI, and for
  the polypeptide hormone glucagon bound to lipid micelles. This
  was published in a series of four 1982 papers. Although the first
  one of these papers already outlines the presently used protocol
  for protein structure determination by NMR, it took two more
  years of intense work on metric matrix distance geometry
  algorithms and their implementation in efficient software
  packages before the first NMR structure determination of a
  globular protein, bull seminal protease inhibitor (BUSI), could
  be completed. A large number of brilliant junior scientists
  working in my group from 1976 to 1985 contributed directly or
  indirectly to this result: Gerhard Wagner was involved in each
  step of the project; Kuniaki Nagayama and Peter Bachmann devised
  the first generation of 2D NMR experiments for studies of
  biological macromolecules and wrote the software needed to handle
  such data with the then-available limited computational
  facilities; Anil Kumar recorded the first 2D NOESY experiment
  with a protein; Gerhard Wider made key contributions to 2D NMR
  spectroscopy and to the sequential assignment method; Werner
  Braun, Martin Billeter and Timothy Havel started a tradition in
  my laboratory of theoretical work on the structural
  interpretation of NMR data; Peter Strop prepared BUSI and worked
  on its resonance assignments; finally, Michael Williamson and
  Timothy Havel actually solved the structure of BUSI. They all,
  and many additional students and postdoctoral associates from the
  "heroic period" 1976-85 have in the meantime started highly
  successful independent academic careers.</p>

  <p>The completion of the first NMR structure
  of a protein brought new, unexpected challenges. When I presented
  the structure of BUSI in some lectures in the spring of 1984, the
  reaction was one of disbelief and suggestions that our structure
  must have been modeled after the crystal structure of a
  homologous protein. Apparently the structural biology community
  had thoroughly adjusted to the role of NMR as a method that could
  provide some exotic supplementary data, but which would not be
  suitable for <i>de novo</i> structure determination at atomic
  resolution. The criticism raised had two major consequences. The
  first one resulted from a discussion with Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1988/index.html">Robert Huber</a> (Nobel
  laureate in Chemistry, 1988) after a seminar in Munich on May 14,
  1984. Robert proposed to settle the matter by independently
  solving a new protein structure in his laboratory by X-ray
  crystallography and in my laboratory by NMR. For this purpose,
  each one of us received an ample supply of the _-amylase
  inhibitor Tendamistat from Hoechst AG. Virtually identical
  three-dimensional structures of Tendamistat were obtained by NMR
  in solution and by X-ray diffraction in single crystals, which
  settled matters once and for all. This was particularly
  comforting in the context of the fact that the subsequently
  solved NMR structure of metallothionein was completely different
  from an independently solved metallothionein crystal structure
  (it took six years before the crystal structure was redetermined
  and found to coincide with the NMR structure!). The second
  consequence was that I asked for a sabbatical leave and ended up
  in Wengen, a beautiful mountain resort in the Berner Oberland.
  This was possible because I was also finishing my 6-year term as
  the Secretary General of IUPAB in the summer of 1984. Considering
  the critical reaction to the initial NMR structure
  determinations, I felt that it was important to document our work
  in a complete and detailed fashion. I thus had good reasons to
  honor my commitment of writing a monograph on the Baker Lectures,
  which I had delivered in 1983 at Cornell University. As I spent
  much of the time alone in Wengen, with my family joining me for
  weekends and vacation periods, work progressed well. "NMR of
  Proteins and Nucleic Acids" covers primarily work in my research
  group during the period 1977-84. It also turned out that
  directing my research group at a distance was surprisingly
  successful, and since the manuscripts were typed in Z&uuml;rich
  from my handwritten notes, it helped that even ordinary mail was
  still reliably delivered within one day within Switzerland. It
  was therefore an easy decision for me to extend the stay in
  Wengen from the originally planned 6 months to 18 months. Besides
  the deskwork, important occupations in Wengen were skiing in the
  winter, and jogging and mountain climbing in the summer.
  According to my diaries I did not miss a single day of skiing
  from December 1, 1984 to April 10, 1985. This made up for having
  stayed away from the ski slopes during the 14 years from 1971 to
  1984 because of my other professional activities. I also returned
  to the skiing outstation of the Federal Sports School in
  M&uuml;rren for a much-needed overhaul of my skiing technique,
  and participated in the organization of the famous Lauberhorn ski
  race in Wengen.</p>

  </p>

  <p>In the spring of 1986, after a second
  winter of skiing in Wengen, I had thoroughly cleaned up the
  backlog of unpublished material, in addition to having finished
  work on the Baker Lectures monograph. Protein structure
  determination by NMR had by then found its believers, as
  documented by the fact that the first printing of my new book was
  sold out within a few weeks. For us, a new chapter had to be
  opened, and we established contacts with biochemists and
  molecular biologists for the real test of the NMR technique in
  applications to biologically interesting systems. By 1990, a
  collaboration with Professor Walter Gehring of the Biocenter at
  the University of Basel yielded structure determinations of the
  <i>Antennapedia</i> homeodomain and its complex with the operator
  DNA. Using this structure as a platform, additional NMR
  experiments provided entirely novel insights into the role of
  hydration water for specific DNA recognition. A NMR structure
  determination of the cyclophilin A-cyclosporin A complex was
  pursued as a joint project with two former graduate students,
  Hans Senn, and Hans Widmer, and their research team at Sandoz AG.
  It had immediate practical impact, since the structure of the
  bound immunosuppressant turned out to be very different from the
  only other structural information available at the time,
  <i>i.e.</i>, crystal and NMR structures of free cyclosporin A. It
  was, for all involved, a completely unexpected and for many
  reasons surprising result!</p>

  <p>In yet another exciting collaboration, with
  Professor Rudi Glockshuber at the ETH Z&uuml;rich, we completed a
  structure determination for the C-terminal half of the mouse
  prion protein in April 1996, barely 10 days after the BSE-crisis
  in Great Britain broke into the open. With this timing, the prion
  protein structure had high visibility also in the popular media.
  In 1997 we succeeded to characterize the structure of the intact
  prion protein, and found that the N-terminal half of the molecule
  forms a highly flexible, extended "tail". The prion protein thus
  presented a striking illustration of the unique power of NMR to
  characterize partially structured polypeptide chains. Others
  among the more than 70 protein structure determinations completed
  in my laboratory functionally relate to enzymology, toxicology,
  chaperone-mediated protein folding, and intercellular
  signaling.</p>

  <p>The biological and biomedical projects
  pursued during the past 16 years with the use of the NMR
  technique have added and still add greatly to the quality of my
  professional life. In these endeavors, the quite extreme
  specialization needed to maintain a high standard of structure
  determination breaks open in that I learn about an
  ever-increasing range of biological systems and biomedical
  problems. I feel very fortunate that my field of specialization
  thus leads me to an education in biology from people who have
  high standards, and who sometimes even tend to consider me as one
  of their own.</p>
