 <h2>Towards the Splendid City</h2>

 

  <p>My speech is going to be a long journey, a
  trip that I have taken through regions that are distant and
  antipodean, but not for that reason any less similar to the
  landscape and the solitude in Scandinavia. I refer to the way in
  which my country stretches down to the extreme South. So remote
  are we Chileans that our boundaries almost touch the South Pole,
  recalling the geography of Sweden, whose head reaches the snowy
  northern region of this planet.<br>
  <br>
  Down there on those vast expanses in my native country, where I
  was taken by events which have already fallen into oblivion, one
  has to cross, and I was compelled to cross, the Andes to find the
  frontier of my country with Argentina. Great forests make these
  inaccessible areas like a tunnel through which our journey was
  secret and forbidden, with only the faintest signs to show us the
  way. There were no tracks and no paths, and I and my four
  companions, riding on horseback, pressed forward on our tortuous
  way, avoiding the obstacles set by huge trees, impassable rivers,
  immense cliffs and desolate expanses of snow, blindly seeking the
  quarter in which my own liberty lay. Those who were with me knew
  how to make their way forward between the dense leaves of the
  forest, but to feel safer they marked their route by slashing
  with their machetes here and there in the bark of the great
  trees, leaving tracks which they would follow back when they had
  left me alone with my destiny.<br>
  <br>
  Each of us made his way forward filled with this limitless
  solitude, with the green and white silence of trees and huge
  trailing plants and layers of soil laid down over centuries,
  among half-fallen tree trunks which suddenly appeared as fresh
  obstacles to bar our progress. We were in a dazzling and secret
  world of nature which at the same time was a growing menace of
  cold, snow and persecution. Everything became one: the solitude,
  the danger, the silence, and the urgency of my mission.<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes we followed a very faint trail, perhaps left by
  smugglers or ordinary criminals in flight, and we did not know
  whether many of them had perished, surprised by the icy hands of
  winter, by the fearful snowstorms which suddenly rage in the
  Andes and engulf the traveller, burying him under a whiteness
  seven storeys high.<br>
  <br>
  On either side of the trail I could observe in the wild
  desolation something which betrayed human activity. There were
  piled up branches which had lasted out many winters, offerings
  made by hundreds who had journeyed there, crude burial mounds in
  memory of the fallen, so that the passer should think of those
  who had not been able to struggle on but had remained there under
  the snow for ever. My comrades, too, hacked off with their
  machetes branches which brushed our heads and bent down over us
  from the colossal trees, from oaks whose last leaves were
  scattering before the winter storms. And I too left a tribute at
  every mound, a visiting card of wood, a branch from the forest to
  deck one or other of the graves of these unknown
  travellers.<br>
  <br>
  We had to cross a river. Up on the Andean summits there run small
  streams which cast themselves down with dizzy and insane force,
  forming waterfalls that stir up earth and stones with the
  violence they bring with them from the heights. But this time we
  found calm water, a wide mirrorlike expanse which could be
  forded. The horses splashed in, lost their foothold and began to
  swim towards the other bank. Soon my horse was almost completely
  covered by the water, I began to plunge up and down without
  support, my feet fighting desperately while the horse struggled
  to keep its head above water. Then we got across. And hardly we
  reached the further bank when the seasoned countryfolk with me
  asked me with scarce-concealed smiles:<br>
  <br>
  "Were you frightened?"<br>
  "Very. I thought my last hour had come", I said.<br>
  "We were behind you with our lassoes in our hands", they
  answered.<br>
  "Just there", added one of them, "my father fell and was swept
  away by the current. That didn't happen to you."<br>
  <br>
  We continued till we came to a natural tunnel which perhaps had
  been bored through the imposing rocks by some mighty vanished
  river or created by some tremor of the earth when these heights
  had been formed, a channel that we entered where it had been
  carved out in the rock in granite. After only a few steps our
  horses began to slip when they sought for a foothold in the
  uneven surfaces of the stone and their legs were bent, sparks
  flying from beneath their iron shoes - several times I expected
  to find myself thrown off and lying there on the rock. My horse
  was bleeding from its muzzle and from its legs, but we persevered
  and continued on the long and difficult but magnificent
  path.<br>
  <br>
  There was something awaiting us in the midst of this wild
  primeval forest. Suddenly, as if in a strange vision, we came to
  a beautiful little meadow huddled among the rocks: clear water,
  green grass, wild flowers, the purling of brooks and the blue
  heaven above, a generous stream of light unimpeded by
  leaves.<br>
  <br>
  There we stopped as if within a magic circle, as if guests within
  some hallowed place, and the ceremony I now took part in had
  still more the air of something sacred. The cowherds dismounted
  from their horses. In the midst of the space, set up as if in a
  rite, was the skull of an ox. In silence the men approached it
  one after the other and put coins and food in the eyesockets of
  the skull. I joined them in this sacrifice intended for stray
  travellers, all kinds of refugees who would find bread and
  succour in the dead ox's eye sockets.<br>
  <br>
  But the unforgettable ceremony did not end there. My country
  friends took off their hats and began a strange dance, hopping on
  one foot around the abandoned skull, moving in the ring of
  footprints left behind by the many others who had passed there
  before them. Dimly I understood, there by the side of my
  inscrutable companions, that there was a kind of link between
  unknown people, a care, an appeal and an answer even in the most
  distant and isolated solitude of this world.<br>
  <br>
  Further on, just before we reached the frontier which was to
  divide me from my native land for many years, we came at night to
  the last pass between the mountains. Suddenly we saw the glow of
  a fire as a sure sign of a human presence, and when we came
  nearer we found some half-ruined buildings, poor hovels which
  seemed to have been abandoned. We went into one of them and saw
  the glow of fire from tree trunks burning in the middle of the
  floor, carcasses of huge trees, which burnt there day and night
  and from which came smoke that made its way up through the cracks
  in the roof and rose up like a deep-blue veil in the midst of the
  darkness. We saw mountains of stacked cheeses, which are made by
  the people in these high regions. Near the fire lay a number of
  men grouped like sacks. In the silence we could distinguish the
  notes of a guitar and words in a song which was born of the
  embers and the darkness, and which carried with it the first
  human voice we had encountered during our journey. It was a song
  of love and distance, a cry of love and longing for the distant
  spring, from the towns we were coming away from, for life in its
  limitless extent. These men did not know who we were, they knew
  nothing about our flight, they had never heard either my name or
  my poetry; or perhaps they did, perhaps they knew us? What
  actually happened was that at this fire we sang and we ate, and
  then in the darkness we went into some primitive rooms. Through
  them flowed a warm stream, volcanic water in which we bathed,
  warmth which welled out from the mountain chain and received us
  in its bosom.<br>
  <br>
  Happily we splashed about, dug ourselves out, as it were,
  liberated ourselves from the weight of the long journey on
  horseback. We felt refreshed, reborn, baptised, when in the dawn
  we started on the journey of a few miles which was to eclipse me
  from my native land. We rode away on our horses singing, filled
  with a new air, with a force that cast us out on to the world's
  broad highway which awaited me. This I remember well, that when
  we sought to give the mountain dwellers a few coins in gratitude
  for their songs, for the food, for the warm water, for giving us
  lodging and beds, I would rather say for the unexpected heavenly
  refuge that had met us on our journey, our offering was rejected
  out of hand. They had been at our service, nothing more. In this
  taciturn "nothing" there were hidden things that were understood,
  perhaps a recognition, perhaps the same kind of dreams.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><br>

  <p>I did not learn from books any recipe for
  writing a poem, and I, in my turn, will avoid giving any advice
  on mode or style which might give the new poets even a drop of
  supposed insight. When I am recounting in this speech something
  about past events, when reliving on this occasion a
  never-forgotten occurrence, in this place which is so different
  from what that was, it is because in the course of my life I have
  always found somewhere the necessary support, the formula which
  had been waiting for me not in order to be petrified in my words
  but in order to explain me to myself.<br>
  <br>
  During this long journey I found the necessary components for the
  making of the poem. There I received contributions from the earth
  and from the soul. And I believe that poetry is an action,
  ephemeral or solemn, in which there enter as equal partners
  solitude and solidarity, emotion and action, the nearness to
  oneself, the nearness to mankind and to the secret manifestations
  of nature. And no less strongly I think that all this is
  sustained - man and his shadow, man and his conduct, man and his
  poetry - by an ever-wider sense of community, by an effort which
  will for ever bring together the reality and the dreams in us
  because it is precisely in this way that poetry unites and
  mingles them. And therefore I say that I do not know, after so
  many years, whether the lessons I learned when I crossed a
  daunting river, when I danced around the skull of an ox, when I
  bathed my body in the cleansing water from the topmost heights -
  I do not know whether these lessons welled forth from me in order
  to be imparted to many others or whether it was all a message
  which was sent to me by others as a demand or an accusation. I do
  not know whether I experienced this or created it, I do not know
  whether it was truth or poetry, something passing or permanent,
  the poems I experienced in this hour, the experiences which I
  later put into verse.<br>
  <br>
  From all this, my friends, there arises an insight which the poet
  must learn through other people. There is no insurmountable
  solitude. All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others
  what we are. And we must pass through solitude and difficulty,
  isolation and silence in order to reach forth to the enchanted
  place where we can dance our clumsy dance and sing our sorrowful
  song - but in this dance or in this song there are fulfilled the
  most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being
  human and of believing in a common destiny.<br>
  <br>
  The truth is that even if some or many consider me to be a
  sectarian, barred from taking a place at the common table of
  friendship and responsibility, I do not wish to defend myself,
  for I believe that neither accusation nor defence is among the
  tasks of the poet. When all is said, there is no individual poet
  who administers poetry, and if a poet sets himself up to accuse
  his fellows or if some other poet wastes his life in defending
  himself against reasonable or unreasonable charges, it is my
  conviction that only vanity can so mislead us. I consider the
  enemies of poetry to be found not among those who practise poetry
  or guard it but in mere lack of agreement in the poet. For this
  reason no poet has any considerable enemy other than his own
  incapacity to make himself understood by the most forgotten and
  exploited of his contemporaries, and this applies to all epochs
  and in all countries.<br>
  <br>
  The poet is not a "little god". No, he is not a "little god". He
  is not picked out by a mystical destiny in preference to those
  who follow other crafts and professions. I have often maintained
  that the best poet is he who prepares our daily bread: the
  nearest baker who does not imagine himself to be a god. He does
  his majestic and unpretentious work of kneading the dough,
  consigning it to the oven, baking it in golden colours and
  handing us our daily bread as a duty of fellowship. And, if the
  poet succeeds in achieving this simple consciousness, this too
  will be transformed into an element in an immense activity, in a
  simple or complicated structure which constitutes the building of
  a community, the changing of the conditions which surround
  mankind, the handing over of mankind's products: bread, truth,
  wine, dreams. If the poet joins this never-completed struggle to
  extend to the hands of each and all his part of his undertaking,
  his effort and his tenderness to the daily work of all people,
  then the poet must take part, the poet will take part, in the
  sweat, in the bread, in the wine, in the whole dream of humanity.
  Only in this indispensable way of being ordinary people shall we
  give back to poetry the mighty breadth which has been pared away
  from it little by little in every epoch, just as we ourselves
  have been whittled down in every epoch.<br>
  <br>
  The mistakes which led me to a relative truth and the truths
  which repeatedly led me back to the mistakes did not allow me -
  and I never made any claims to it - to find my way to lead, to
  learn what is called the creative process, to reach the heights
  of literature that are so difficult of access. But one thing I
  realized - that it is we ourselves who call forth the spirits
  through our own myth-making. From the matter we use, or wish to
  use, there arise later on obstacles to our own development and
  the future development. We are led infallibly to reality and
  realism, that is to say to become indirectly conscious of
  everything that surrounds us and of the ways of change, and then
  we see, when it seems to be late, that we have erected such an
  exaggerated barrier that we are killing what is alive instead of
  helping life to develop and blossom. We force upon ourselves a
  realism which later proves to be more burdensome than the bricks
  of the building, without having erected the building which we had
  regarded as an indispensable part of our task. And, in the
  contrary case, if we succeed in creating the fetish of the
  incomprehensible (or the fetish of that which is comprehensible
  only to a few), the fetish of the exclusive and the secret, if we
  exclude reality and its realistic degenerations, then we find
  ourselves suddenly surrounded by an impossible country, a
  quagmire of leaves, of mud, of cloud, where our feet sink in and
  we are stifled by the impossibility of communicating.<br>
  <br>
  As far as we in particular are concerned, we writers within the
  tremendously far-flung American region, we listen unceasingly to
  the call to fill this mighty void with beings of flesh and blood.
  We are conscious of our duty as fulfillers - at the same time we
  are faced with the unavoidable task of critical communication
  within a world which is empty and is not less full of injustices,
  punishments and sufferings because it is empty - and we feel also
  the responsibility for reawakening the old dreams which sleep in
  statues of stone in the ruined ancient monuments, in the
  wide-stretching silence in planetary plains, in dense primeval
  forests, in rivers which roar like thunder. We must fill with
  words the most distant places in a dumb continent and we are
  intoxicated by this task of making fables and giving names. This
  is perhaps what is decisive in my own humble case, and if so my
  exaggerations or my abundance or my rhetoric would not be
  anything other than the simplest of events within the daily work
  of an American. Each and every one of my verses has chosen to
  take its place as a tangible object, each and every one of my
  poems has claimed to be a useful working instrument, each and
  every one of my songs has endeavoured to serve as a sign in space
  for a meeting between paths which cross one another, or as a
  piece of stone or wood on which someone, some others, those who
  follow after, will be able to carve the new signs.<br>
  <br>
  By extending to these extreme consequences the poet's duty, in
  truth or in error, I determined that my posture within the
  community and before life should be that of in a humble way
  taking sides. I decided this when I saw so many honourable
  misfortunes, lone victories, splendid defeats. In the midst of
  the arena of America's struggles I saw that my human task was
  none other than to join the extensive forces of the organized
  masses of the people, to join with life and soul with suffering
  and hope, because it is only from this great popular stream that
  the necessary changes can arise for the authors and for the
  nations. And even if my attitude gave and still gives rise to
  bitter or friendly objections, the truth is that I can find no
  other way for an author in our far-flung and cruel countries, if
  we want the darkness to blossom, if we are concerned that the
  millions of people who have learnt neither to read us nor to read
  at all, who still cannot write or write to us, are to feel at
  home in the area of dignity without which it is impossible for
  them to be complete human beings.<br>
  <br>
  We have inherited this damaged life of peoples dragging behind
  them the burden of the condemnation of centuries, the most
  paradisaical of peoples, the purest, those who with stones and
  metals made marvellous towers, jewels of dazzling brilliance -
  peoples who were suddenly despoiled and silenced in the fearful
  epochs of colonialism which still linger on.<br>
  <br>
  Our original guiding stars are struggle and hope. But there is no
  such thing as a lone struggle, no such thing as a lone hope. In
  every human being are combined the most distant epochs,
  passivity, mistakes, sufferings, the pressing urgencies of our
  own time, the pace of history. But what would have become of me
  if, for example, I had contributed in some way to the maintenance
  of the feudal past of the great American continent? How should I
  then have been able to raise my brow, illuminated by the honour
  which Sweden has conferred on me, if I had not been able to feel
  some pride in having taken part, even to a small extent, in the
  change which has now come over my country? It is necessary to
  look at the map of America, to place oneself before its splendid
  multiplicity, before the cosmic generosity of the wide places
  which surround us, in order to understand why many writers refuse
  to share the dishonour and plundering of the past, of all that
  which dark gods have taken away from the American peoples.<br>
  <br>
  I chose the difficult way of divided responsibility and, rather
  than to repeat the worship of the individual as the sun and
  centre of the system, I have preferred to offer my services in
  all modesty to an honourable army which may from time to time
  commit mistakes but which moves forward unceasingly and struggles
  every day against the anachronism of the refractory and the
  impatience of the opinionated. For I believe that my duties as a
  poet involve friendship not only with the rose and with symmetry,
  with exalted love and endless longing, but also with unrelenting
  human occupations which I have incorporated into my poetry.<br>
  <br>
  It is today exactly one hundred years since an unhappy and
  brilliant poet, the most awesome of all despairing souls, wrote
  down this prophecy: "A l'aurore, arm&eacute;s d'une ardente
  patience, nous entrerons aux splendides Villes." "In the dawn,
  armed with a burning patience, we shall enter the splendid
  Cities."<br>
  <br>
  I believe in this prophecy of Rimbaud, the Visionary. I come from
  a dark region, from a land separated from all others by the steep
  contours of its geography. I was the most forlorn of poets and my
  poetry was provincial, oppressed and rainy. But always I had put
  my trust in man. I never lost hope. It is perhaps because of this
  that I have reached as far as I now have with my poetry and also
  with my banner.<br>
  <br>
  Lastly, I wish to say to the people of good will, to the workers,
  to the poets, that the whole future has been expressed in this
  line by Rimbaud: only with a <i>burning patience</i> can we
  conquer the splendid City which will give light, justice and
  dignity to all mankind.<br>
  <br>
  In this way the song will not have been sung in vain.</p>
