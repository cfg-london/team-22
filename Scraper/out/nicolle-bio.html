  <h1>Charles Nicolle - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nicolle.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Charles Jules Henry Nicolle</b> was born
  in Rouen on September 21, 1866, where his father, Eug&egrave;ne
  Nicolle, was a doctor in a local hospital. Charles received,
  together with his brothers, early tuition in biology from his
  father and, after education at the Lyc&eacute;e Corneille de Rouen,
  he entered the local medical school where he studied for three
  years before following his elder brother, Maurice, who was
  working in Paris hospitals. (Maurice later became Director of the
  Bacteriological Institute of Constantinople and a Professor at
  the Pasteur Institute, Paris.) Meanwhile, Charles had
  studied under A. Gombault in the Faculty of Medicine and under
  Roux at the Pasteur Institute (serving at the same time as
  demonstrator in the microbiology course) to complete a thesis
  "Recherches sur la chancre mou" (Researches on the soft chancre),
  which gained him his M.D. degree in 1893. He returned to Rouen to
  become a member of the Medical Faculty and in 1896 he was
  appointed Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory. He
  continued in this capacity until 1903 when he was appointed
  Director of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, a position he held
  until his death in 1936.<br>
  <br>
  Early in his career, Nicolle worked on cancer, and at Rouen he
  investigated the preparation of diphtheria antiserum. In North
  Africa, under his influence, the Institute at Tunis quickly
  became a world-famous centre for bacteriological research and for
  the production of vaccines and serums to combat most of the
  prevalent infectious diseases. His discovery in 1909 that typhus
  fever is transmitted by the body louse helped to make a clear
  distinction between the classical louse-bound epidemic typhus and
  marine typhus, which is conveyed to man by the rat flea. He also
  made invaluable contributions to present-day knowledge of Malta
  fever, where he introduced preventive vaccination; tick fever,
  where he discovered the means of transmission; scarlet fever, by
  experimental reproduction with streptococci; rinderpest, measles,
  influenza, by his work on the nature of the virus; tuberculosis
  and trachoma. He was responsible for the introduction of many new
  techniques and innovations in bacteriology. Nicolle was one of
  the first to recognize the protective properties of the
  convalescence serum against typhus and measles; and succeeded in
  cultivating Leishmania donovani and Leishmania tropica on
  artificial culture media. His discovery of the mechanism of the
  transmission of typhus fever has created the basis for the
  preventive precautions against this disease, during the 1914-1918
  and 1939-1945 Wars.<br>

  Nicolle wrote several important books including <i>Le Destin des
  Maladies infectieuses</i>; <i>La Nature, conception et morale
  biologiques</i>; <i>Responsabilit&eacute;s de la M&eacute;decine</i>,
  and <i>La Destin&eacute;e humaine</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Nicolle was an Associate of l'Academie de M&eacute;decine and he
  was awarded the Prix Montyon in 1909, 1912, and 1914; the Prix
  Osiris in 1927, and a special Gold Medal to commemorate his
  Silver Jubilee in Tunis in 1928. On this occasion he was also
  appointed member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, Paris. In
  1932, he was elected Professor in the College of France.<br>
  <br>
  Charles Nicolle also enjoyed considerable reputation as a
  philosopher and as a writer of fanciful stories, such as <i>Le
  P&acirc;tissier de Bellone</i>, <i>Les deux Larrons</i>, and
  <i>Les Contes de Marmouse</i>. He was said by Jean Rostand to be
  "a poet and realist, a man of dreams and a man of truth".<br>
  <br>
  Nicolle married Alice Avice in 1895; two children came from this
  marriage, Marcelle (b. 1896) and Pierre (b. 1898).</p>

  <p>He died on February 28, 1936.</p>
