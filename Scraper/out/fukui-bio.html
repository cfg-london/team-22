  <h1>Kenichi Fukui - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fukui.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born the eldest of three sons of
  Ryokichi Fukui, a foreign trade merchant and factory manager, and
  Chie Fukui, in Nara, Japan, on October 4, 1918. In my high school
  years, chemistry was not my favourite subject, but the most
  decisive occurrence in my educational career came when my father
  asked the advice of Professor Gen-itsu Kita of Kyoto
  Imperial University concerning the course I should take.
  Prof. Kita suggested that Ryokichi, one of his juniors from the
  same native province, should send me to the Department of
  Industrial Chemistry with which he was then affiliated.<br>
  <br>
  For a few years after my graduation from Kyoto Imperial
  University in 1941, I was engaged in experimental research on
  synthetic fuel chemistry in the Army Fuel Laboratory. The result
  brought me a prize in 1944. I became lecturer in the Fuel
  Chemistry Department of Kyoto Imperial University in 1943,
  assistant professor in 1945, and professor in 1951. In 1947 I
  married Tomoe Horie. I have two children, Tetsuya (son) and
  Miyako (daughter).<br>
  <br>
  While I started originally as an experimentalist, I had built up
  a subgroup of theoreticians in my group before 1956. My work on
  experimental organic chemistry continued along with this, and the
  results were mostly published in Japanese papers, the number of
  which amounted to 137 during the period 1944 - 1972, together
  with my papers on reaction engineering and catalytic
  engineering.<br>
  <br>
  But the nature of my main work in chemistry can be better
  represented by more than 280 English publications, of which
  roughly 200 concern the theory of chemical reactions and related
  subjects. Other English papers relate to statistical theory of
  gellation, organic synthesis by inorganic salts, and
  polymerization kinetics and catalysts.<br>
  <br>
  My first scientific delight came in 1952 when I found a
  correlation between the frontier electron density and the
  chemical reactivity in aromatic hydrocarbons. This success led my
  theoretical group to the chemical reactivity theory, extending
  more and more widely the range of compound and reactions that
  were discussed.<br>
  <br>
  The year in which my 1952 paper was published was the same as
  that of Professor <a href="../1966/index.html" target=
  "_blank">Mulliken</a>'s publication of the important paper on the
  chargetransfer force in donor-acceptor complexes. Influenced by
  this paper, I gave a theoretical foundation for the findings
  mentioned above. The basic idea was essentially the consideration
  of the importance of the electron delocalization between the
  frontier orbitals of reactant species. The frontier orbital
  approach was further developed in various directions by my own
  group and many other scientists, both theoretical and
  experimental.<br>
  <br>
  I was also interested in formulating the path of chemical
  reactions. The first paper appeared in 1970. This simple idea
  served to provide information on the geometrical shape of
  reacting molecules, and I was able to make the role of the
  frontier orbitals in chemical reactions more distinct through
  visualization, by drawing their diagrams.<br>
  <br>
  I must confess that, when I was writing the 1952 paper, I never
  imagined I would be coming to Stockholm to receive the Nobel
  Prize 30 years later. But I have to add that already at that time
  Professor Gen-itsu Kita encouraged me by suggesting the
  possibility of the growth of my theory leading me one day to this
  supreme prize. The possibility became a reality through the good
  circumstances in which I found myself: with my teachers, my
  colleagues and students, and, of course, my parents and
  family.</p>
