  <h1>Ivar Giaever - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="giaever.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ivar Giaever</b> was born in Bergen,
  Norway, April 5, 1929, the second of three children. He grew up
  in Toten where his father, John A. Giaever, was a pharmacist. He
  attended elementary school in Toten but received his secondary
  education in the city of Hamar. Next he worked one year at the
  Raufoss Munition Factories before entering the Norwegian
  Institute of Technology in 1948. He graduated in 1952 with a
  degree in mechanical engineering.<br>
  <br>
  In 1953, Giaever completed his military duty as a corporal in the
  Norwegian Army, and thereafter he was employed for a year as a
  patent examiner for the Norwegian Government.<br>
  <br>
  Giaever emigrated to Canada in 1954 and after a short period as
  an architect's aide he joined Canadian General Electric's
  Advanced Engineering Program. In 1956, he emigrated to the USA
  where he completed the General Electric Company's A, B and C
  engineering courses. In these he worked in various assignments as
  an applied mathematician. He joined the General Electric Research
  and Development Center in 1958 and concurrently started to study
  physics at Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute where he obtained a
  Ph.D. degree in 1964.<br>
  <br>
  From 1958 to 1969 Dr. Giaever worked in the fields of thin films,
  tunneling and superconductivity. In 1965 he was awarded the
  Oliver E. Buckley Prize for some pioneering work combining
  tunneling and superconductivity. In 1969 he received a Guggenheim
  Fellowship and thereupon spent one year in Cambridge, England
  studying biophysics. Since returning to the Research and
  Development Center in 1970, Dr. Giaever has spent most of his
  effort studying the behavior of protein molecules at solid
  surfaces. In recognition of his work he was elected a Coolidge
  fellow at General Electric in May, 1973.<br>
  <br>
  Dr Giaever is a member of the Institute of Electrical and
  Electronic Engineers, and the Biophysical Society, and he is a
  Fellow of the American Physical Society. Dr. Giaever has served
  on committees for several international conferences and presently
  he is a member of the Executive Committee of the Solid State
  division in the American Physical Society.<br>
  <br>
  Ivar Giaever married Inger Skramstad in 1952 and they have four
  children. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1964.<br>

  <b>Notes added</b><i><br></i><br>
  Linus Pauling is reported to have said that the Nobel Prize did
  not change his life - he was already famous! That was not true
  for me. The Nobel Prize opened a lot of doors, but also provided
  me with many distractions. I have, however, continued to work in
  biophysics, attempting to use physical methods and thoughts to
  solve biological problems. At the present time, I am studying the
  motion of mammalian cells in tissue culture by growing both
  normal and cancerous cells on small electrodes.<br>
  <br>
  I left General Electric in 1988 to become an Institute Professor
  at Rensselaer (RPI) in Troy, New York 12180-3590, and
  concurrently I am also a Professor at the University of Oslo,
  Norway, sponsored by STATOIL.<br>
  <br>
  On a personal note my wife and I are now the proud grandparents
  of almost four grandchildren.</p>
