  <h1>Manfred Eigen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="eigen.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Manfred Eigen</b> was born in Bochum
  on 9 May 1927, the son of the chamber musician Ernst Eigen and
  his wife Hedwig, n&eacute;e Feld. He received his schooling at the
  Bochum humanistic Gymnasium.<br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1945 he commenced the physics and chemistry
  course at the Georg-August University in G&ouml;ttingen and
  obtained his doctorate in natural science in 1951. He wrote his
  dissertation on the specific heat of heavy water and aqueous
  electrolyte solutions under the guidance of Arnold Eucken. After
  two years as an assistant lecturer at the physical chemistry
  department of the university under Ewald Wicke, he transferred to
  the Max-Planck Institut f&uuml;r physikalische Chemie, which had
  moved to G&ouml;ttingen under the Directorship of Karl Friedrich
  Bonhoeffer. The influence of Bonhoeffer, who provided him with
  magnificent working conditions at the Institut, is reflected in
  his later work in the field of biophysical chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Eigen began his work on the problem of fast ionic reactions in
  solution in the period 1951-1953, encouraged to do so by the
  ultrasound absorption measurements carried out by his colleagues
  Konrad Tamm and Walter Kurtze. During the following years he
  developed a series of measuring techniques involving times down
  to the order of a nanosecond. He developed many of these
  techniques with Leo de Maeyer, who joined him in the autumn of
  1954, and with whom he is still collaborating closely at the
  G&ouml;ttingen MaxPlanck-Institut. The Max-Planck-Gesellschaft appointed Eigen a
  Scientific Member in 1957 and head in 1964. In 1967 he was
  elected Managing Director of the Institute for a period of three
  years. At the same time he was appointed to the Scientific
  Council of the German Federal Republic.<br>
  <br>
  Eigen's scientific development is reflected in the close on 100
  papers he has published. The subject matter of these works ranges
  from the thermodynamic properties of water and aqueous solutions,
  and the theory of electrolytes, through thermal conductivity and
  sound absorption, to fast ionic reactions.<br>
  <br>
  In the years 1953-1963 followed the description of a series of
  novel measuring techniques used for the study of very fast
  reaction in the range from one second to one nanosecond. The gap
  between the region of classical reaction kinetics and
  spectroscopy was thus closed. Eigen was particularly interested
  in proton reactions: together with De Maeyer he was the first to
  determine the neutralization rate and found the anomalous
  conduction characteristics of protons in ice crystals. The
  development of the theory of relaxation of multi stage processes
  was followed by studies on metal complex reactions, in which the
  fast reactions of a large number of metal ions were investigated
  in relation to their position in the periodic table. Around 1960
  the emphasis in his work shifted towards physical-organic
  chemistry. The individual steps of a series of reaction
  mechanisms were elucidated, and a general theory of acid-base
  catalysis was verified experimentally.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, however, his attention turned also to
  biochemical questions, which now claimed his chief interest.
  These questions ranged from hydrogen bridges of nucleic acids,
  through the dynamics of code transfer, to enzymes and lipid
  membranes. Biological control and regulation processes, and the
  problem of the storage of information in the central nervous
  system also occupy his attention. Practically every year he
  travels together with his friend and colleague Leo de Maeyer to
  Boston to discuss topics of common interest with American
  neurologists, biochemists, and biophysicists.<br>
  <br>
  Eigen holds the following honours and distinctions: Bodenstein
  prize of the Deutsche Bunsengesellschaft, 1956; Otto-Hahn Prize
  for Chemistry and Physics, 1962; Kirkwood Medal (American Chemical
  Society), 1963; Harrison Howe Award (American Chemical
  Society), 1965; Andrew D. White Professor at large at Cornell
  University, Ithaca, N.Y., 1965; Honorary Professor at the
  Technische Hochschule, Braunschweig, 1965; Foreign Honorary
  Member of the
  American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1964; Member of the
  "Leopoldina", Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher in Halle, 1964;
  Member of the G&ouml;ttingen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1965;
  Honorary Member of the American Association of Biological
  Chemists, 1966; Honorary degree of doctor of science at Harvard University,
  U.S.A., 1966; Honorary degree of doctor of science at Washington
  University, U.S.A., 1966; Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
  Sciences, Washington, U.S.A. 1966; Honorary degree of doctor
  of science, University of Chicago, U.S.A., 1966; Carus Medal of
  the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher "Leopoldina", Halle,
  1967; Linus Pauling Medal of the American Chemical Society,
  1967.<br>

  Manfred Eigen is married to Elfriede, n&eacute;e M&uuml;ller. They
  have two children, Gerald (born 1952) and Angela (born 1960). In
  his free time he is a keen amateur musician. His favorite holiday
  pastime is mountaineering.</p>
