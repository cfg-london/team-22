  <h2><br>This Past Must Address Its Present</h2>

  <p>A rather curious scene, unscripted, once
  took place in the wings of a London theatre at the same time as
  the scheduled performance was being presented on the actual
  stage, before an audience. What happened was this: an actor
  refused to come on stage for his allocated role. Action was
  suspended. A fellow actor tried to persuade him to emerge, but he
  stubbornly shook his head. Then a struggle ensued. The second
  actor had hoped that, by suddenly exposing the reluctant actor to
  the audience in full glare of the spotlight, he would have no
  choice but to rejoin the cast. And so he tried to take the
  delinquent actor by surprise, pulling him suddenly towards the
  stage. He did not fully succeed, so a brief but untidy struggle
  began. The unwilling actor was completely taken aback and deeply
  embarrassed - some of that tussle was quite visible to a part of
  the audience.<br>
  <br>
  The performance itself, it should be explained, was an
  improvisation around an incident. This meant that the actors were
  free, within the convention of the performance - to stop, re-work
  any part they wished, invite members of the audience on stage,
  assign roles and change costumes in full view of the audience.
  They therefore could also dramatize their wish to have that
  uncooperative actor join them - which they did with gusto. That
  actor had indeed left the stage before the contentious scene
  began. He had served notice during rehearsals that he would not
  participate in it. In the end, he had his way, but the incident
  proved very troubling to him for weeks afterwards. He found
  himself compelled to puzzle out this clash in attitudes between
  himself and his fellow writers and performers. He experienced, on
  the one hand, an intense rage that he had been made to appear
  incapable of confronting a stark reality, made to appear to
  suffer from interpretative coyness, to seem inhibited by a cruel
  reality or perhaps to carry his emotional involvement with an
  event so far as to interfere with his professional will. Of
  course, he knew that it was none of these things. The truth was
  far simpler. Unlike his colleagues together with whom he shared,
  unquestionably, the same political attitude towards the event
  which was being represented, he found the mode of presentation at
  war with the ugliness it tried to convey, creating an intense
  disquiet about his very presence on that stage, in that place,
  before an audience whom he considered collectively responsible
  for that dehumanizing actuality.<br>
  <br>
  And now let us remove some of the mystery and make that incident
  a little more concrete. The scene was the Royal Court Theatre,
  London, 1958. It was one of those Sunday nights which were given
  to experimentation, an innovation of that remarkable theatre
  manager-director, George Devine, whose creative nurturing
  radicalised British theatre of that period and produced later
  icons like John Osborne, N. F. Simpson, Edward Bond, Arnold
  Wesker, <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/index.html">Harold Pinter</a>, John Arden, etc., and even forced the then
  conservative British palate to sample stylistic and ideological
  pariahs like <a href="../1969/index.html">Samuel Beckett</a> and
  Bertold Brecht. On this particular occasion, the evening was
  devoted to a form of "living" theatre, and the main fare was
  titled ELEVEN MEN DEAD AT HOLA. The actors were not all
  professional actors; indeed they were mostly writers who jointly
  created and performed these dramatic pieces. Those with a long
  political memory may recall what took place at Hola Camp, Kenya,
  during the Mau-Mau Liberation struggle. The British Colonial
  power believed that the Mau-Mau could be smashed by herding
  Kenyans into special camps, trying to separate the hard cases,
  the mere suspects and the potential recruits - oh, they had it
  all neatly worked out. One such camp was Hola Camp and the
  incident involved the death of eleven of the detainees who were
  simply beaten to death by camp officers and warders. The usual
  enquiry set up, and it was indeed the Report which provided the
  main text on which the performance was based.<br>
  <br>
  We need now only to identify the reluctant actor, if you have not
  guessed that by now - it was none other than this speaker. I
  recall the occasion as vividly as actors are wont to recollect
  for ever and ever the frightening moment of a blackout, when the
  lines are not only forgotten but even the moment in the play. The
  role which I had been assigned was that of a camp guard, one of
  the killers. We were equipped with huge night-sticks and, while a
  narrator read the testimony of one of the guards, our task was to
  raise the cudgels slowly and, almost ritualistically, bring them
  down on the necks and shoulders of the prisoners, under orders of
  the white camp officers. A surreal scene. Even in rehearsals, it
  was clear that the end product would be a surrealist tableau. The
  Narrator at a lectern under a spot; a dispassionate reading,
  deliberately clinical, letting the stark facts reveal the states
  of mind of torturers and victims. A small ring of white officers,
  armed. One seizes a cudgel from one of the warders to demonstrate
  how to beat a human being without leaving visible marks. Then the
  innermost clump of detainees, their only weapon - non-violence.
  They had taken their decision to go on strike, refused to go to
  work unless they obtained better camp conditions. So they
  squatted on the ground and refused to move, locked their hands
  behind their knees in silent defiance. Orders were given. The
  inner ring of guards, the blacks, moved in, lifted the bodies by
  hooking their hands underneath the armpits of the detainees,
  carried them like toads in a state of petrification to one side,
  divided them in groups.<br>
  <br>
  The faces of the victims are impassive; they are resolved to
  offer no resistance. The beatings begin: one to the left side,
  then the back, the arms - right, left, front, back. Rhythmically.
  The cudgels swing in unison. The faces of the white guards glow
  with professional satisfaction, their arms gesture languidly from
  time to time, suggesting it is time to shift to the next batch,
  or beat a little more severely on the neglected side. In terms of
  images, a fluid, near balletic scene.<br>
  <br>
  Then the contrast, the earlier official version, enacting how the
  prisoners were supposed to have died. This claimed that the
  prisoners had collapsed, that they died after drinking from a
  poisoned water supply. So we staged that also. The prisoners
  filed to the water waggon, gasping with thirst. After the first
  two or three had drunk and commenced writhing with pain, these
  humane guards rushed to stop the others but no, they were already
  wild with thirst, fought their way past salvation and drank
  greedily the same source. The groans spread from one to the
  other, the writhing, the collapse - then agonized deaths. That
  was the version of the camp governors.<br>
  <br>
  The motif was simple enough, the theatrical format a tried and
  tested one, faithful to a particular convention. What then was
  the problem? It was one, I believe, that affects most writers.
  When is playacting rebuked by reality? When is fictionalizing
  presumptuous? What happens after playacting? One of the
  remarkable properties of the particular theatrical convention I
  have just described is that it gives off a strong odour of
  perenniality, that feeling of "I have been here before". "I have
  been a witness to this." "The past enacts its presence." In such
  an instance, that sense of perenniality can serve both as
  exorcism, a certificate of release or indeed - especially for the
  audience, a soporific. We must bear in mind that at the time of
  presentation, and to the major part of that audience, every death
  of a freedom fighter was a notch on a gun, the death of a fiend,
  an animal, a bestial mutant, not the martyrdom of a
  patriot.<br>
  <br>
  We know also, however, that such efforts can provoke changes,
  that an actualization of the statistical, journalistic footnote
  can arouse revulsion in the complacent mind, leading to the
  beginning of a commitment to change, redress. And on this
  occasion, angry questions had been raised in the Houses of
  Parliament. Liberals, humanitarians and reformists had taken up
  the cause of justice for the victims. Some had even travelled to
  Kenya to obtain details which exposed the official lie. This
  profound unease, which paralysed my creative will, therefore
  reached beyond the audience and, finally, I traced its roots to
  my own feelings of assaulted humanity, and its clamour for a
  different form of response. It provoked a feeling of indecency
  about that presentation, rather like the deformed arm of a leper
  which is thrust at the healthy to provoke a charitable sentiment.
  This, I believe, was the cause of that intangible, but totally
  visceral rejection which thwarted the demands of my calling,
  rendered it inadequate and mocked the empathy of my colleagues.
  It was as if the inhuman totality, of which that scene was a mere
  fragment, was saying to us: Kindly keep your comfortable
  sentiment to yourselves.<br>
  <br>
  Of course, I utilize that episode only as illustration of the far
  deeper internalised processes of the creative mind, a process
  that endangers the writer in two ways: he either freezes up
  completely, or he abandons the pen for far more direct means of
  contesting unacceptable reality. And again, Hola Camp provides a
  convenient means of approaching that aspect of my continent's
  reality which, for us whom it directly affronts, constitutes the
  greatest threat to global peace in our actual existence. For
  there is a gruesome appropriateness in the fact that an African,
  a black man should stand here today, in the same year that the
  progressive Prime Minister of this host country was murdered, in
  the same year as Samora Machel was brought down on the territory
  of the desperate last-ditch guardians of the theory of racial
  superiority which has brought so much misery to our common
  humanity. Whatever the facts are about Olof Palme's death, there
  can be no question about his life. To the racial oppression of a
  large sector of humanity, Olof Palme pronounced, and acted, a
  decisive No! Perhaps it was those who were outraged by this act
  of racial "treachery" who were myopic enough to imagine that the
  death of an individual would arrest the march of his convictions;
  perhaps it was simply yet another instance of the Terror Epidemic
  that feeds today on shock, not reason. It does not matter; an
  authentic conscience of the white tribe has been stilled, and the
  loss is both yours and mine. Samora Machel, the leader who once
  placed his country on a war footing against South Africa, went
  down in as yet mysterious circumstances. True, we are all still
  haunted by the Nkomati Accord which negated that earlier
  triumphant moment on the African collective will; nevertheless,
  his foes across the border have good reason to rejoice over his
  demise and, in that sense, his death is, ironically, a form of
  triumph for the black race.<br>
  <br>
  Is that perhaps too stark a paradox? Then let me take you back to
  Hola Camp. It is cattle which are objects of the stick, or whip.
  So are horses, goats, donkeys etc. Their definition therefore
  involves being occasionally beaten to death. If, thirty years
  after Hola Camp, it is at all thinkable that it takes the
  ingenuity of the most sophisticated electronic interference to
  kill an African resistance fighter, the champions of racism are
  already admitting to themselves what they continue to deny to the
  world: that they, white supremacist breed, have indeed come a
  long way in their definition of their chosen enemy since Hola
  Camp. They have come an incredibly long way since Sharpeville
  when they shot unarmed, fleeing Africans in the back. They have
  come very far since 1930 when, at the first organized incident of
  the burning of passes, the South African blacks decided to turn
  Dingaan's Day, named for the defeat of the Zulu leader Dingaan,
  into a symbol of affirmative resistance by publicly destroying
  their obnoxious passes. In response to those thousands of passes
  burnt on Cartright Flats, the Durban police descended on the
  unarmed protesters killing some half dozen and wounding hundreds.
  They backed it up with scorched earth campaign which dispersed
  thousands of Africans from their normal environment, victims of
  imprisonment and deportation. And even that 1930 repression was a
  quantum leap from that earlier, spontaneous protest against the
  Native Pass law in 1919, when the police merely rode down the
  protesters on horseback, whipped and sjamboked them, chased and
  harried them, like stray goats and wayward cattle, from street
  corner to shanty lodge. Every act of racial terror, with its
  vastly increasing sophistication of style and escalation in human
  loss, is itself an acknowledgement of improved knowledge and
  respect for the potential of what is feared, an acknowledgement
  of the sharpening tempo of triumph by the victimized.<br>
  <br>
  For there was this aspect which struck me most forcibly in that
  attempt to recreate the crime at Hola Camp: in the various
  testimonies of the white officers, it stuck out, whether overtly
  stated or simply through their efficient detachment from the
  ongoing massacre. It was this: at no time did these white
  overseers actually experience the human "otherness" of their
  victims. They clearly did not experience the reality of the
  victims as human beings. Animals perhaps, a noxious form of
  vegetable life maybe, but certainly not human. I do not speak
  here of their colonial overlords, the ones who formulated and
  sustained the policy of settler colonialism, the ones who
  dispatched the Maxim guns and tuned the imperial bugle. They knew
  very well that empires existed which had to be broken, that
  civilizations had endured for centuries which had to be
  destroyed. The "sub-human" denigration for which their
  "civilizing mission" became the altruistic remedy, was the mere
  rationalizing icing on the cake of imperial greed. But yes
  indeed, there were the agents, those who carried out orders (like
  Eichmann, to draw parallels from the white continent); they -
  whether as bureaucrats, technicians or camp governors had no
  conceptual space in their heads which could be filled - except
  very rarely and exceptionally - by "the black as also human". It
  would be correct to say that this has remained the pathology of
  the average South African white since the turn of the last
  century to this moment. Here, for example is one frank admission
  by an enlightened, even radical mind of that country:</p>

 
    <blockquote>
      <p>"It was not until my last year in school that it had occurred
        to me that these black people, these voteless masses, were in
        any way concerned with the socialism which I professed or that
        they had any role to play in the great social revolution which
        in these days seemed to be imminent. The 'workers' who were
        destined to inherit the new world were naturally the white
        carpenters and bricklayers, the tramworkers and miners who were
        organized in their trade unions and who voted for the Labour
        Party. I would no more have thought of discussing politics with
        a native youth than of inviting him home to play with me or to
        a meal or asking him to join the Carnarvon Football Club. The
        African was on a different plane, hardly human, part of the
        scene as were dogs and trees and, more remotely, cows. I had no
        special feelings about him, not interest nor hate nor love. He
        just did not come into my social picture. So completely had I
        accepted the traditional attitudes of the time."
      </p>
    </blockquote>


  <p>Yes, I believe that this self-analysis by
  Eddie Roux, the Afrikaaner political rebel and scientist, remains
  today the flat, unvarnished truth for the majority of
  Afrikaaners. "No special feelings, not interest nor hate nor
  love", the result of a complete acceptance of "traditional
  attitudes". That passage captures a mind's racial tabula rasa, if
  you like - in the first decade of this century - about the time,
  in short, when the Nobel series of prizes was inaugurated. But a
  slate, no matter how clean, cannot avoid receiving impressions
  once it is exposed to air - fresh or polluted. And we are now in
  the year 1986, that is after an entire century of direct,
  intimate exposure, since that confrontation, that first rejection
  of the dehumanizing label implicit in the Native Pass Laws.<br>
  <br>
  Eddie Roux, like hundreds, even thousands of his countrymen, soon
  made rapid strides. His race has produced its list of martyrs in
  the cause of nonracialism - one remembers, still with a tinge of
  pain, Ruth First, destroyed by a letter bomb delivered by the
  long arm of Apartheid. There are others - Andr&eacute; Brink, Abram
  Fischer, Helen Suzman - Breyten Breytenbach, with the scars of
  martyrdom still seared into their souls. Intellectuals, writers,
  scientists, plain working men, politicians - they come to that
  point where a social reality can no longer be observed as a
  culture on a slide beneath the microscope, nor turned into
  aesthetic variations on pages, canvas or the stage. The blacks of
  course are locked into an unambiguous condition: on this occasion
  I do not need to address <i>us</i>. We know, and we embrace our
  mission. It is the <i>other</i> that this precedent seizes the
  opportunity to address, and not merely those who are trapped
  within the confines of that doomed camp, but those who live
  outside, on the fringes of conscience. Those specifically, who
  with shameless smugness invent arcane moral propositions that
  enable them to plead inaction in a language of unparalleled
  political flatulence: "Personally, I find sanctions morally
  repugnant". Or what shall we say of another leader for whom
  economic sanctions which work against an Eastern European country
  will not work in the Apartheid enclave of South Africa, that
  master of histrionics who takes to the world's airwaves to sing:
  "Let Poland be", but turns off his hearing aid when the world
  shouts: "Let Nicaragua be". But enough of these world leaders of
  double-talk and multiple moralities.<br>
  <br>
  It is baffling to any mind that pretends to the slightest claim
  to rationality, it is truly and formidably baffling. Can the same
  terrain of phenomenal assimilation - that is, one which produced
  evidence of a capacity to translate empirical observations into
  implications of rational human conduct - can this same terrain
  which, over half a century ago, fifty entire years, two, three
  generations ago produced the Buntings, the Roux, the Douglas
  Woltons, Solly Sachs, the Gideon Bothas - can that same terrain,
  fifty, sixty, even seventy years later, be peopled by a species
  of humanity so ahistorical that the declaration, so clearly spelt
  out in 1919 at the burning of the passes, remains only a
  troublesome event of no enduring significance?<br>
  <br>
  Some atavistic bug is at work here which defies all scientific
  explanation, an arrest in time within the evolutionary mandate of
  nature, which puts all human experience of learning to serious
  question! We have to ask ourselves then, what event can speak to
  such a breed of people? How do we reactivate that petrified cell
  which houses historic apprehension and development? Is it
  possible, perhaps, that events, gatherings such as this might
  help? Dare we skirt the edge of hubris and say to them: Take a
  good look. Provide your response. In your anxiety to prove that
  this moment is not possible, you had killed, maimed, silenced,
  tortured, exiled, debased and dehumanized hundreds of thousands
  encased in this very skin, crowned with such hair, proudly
  content with their very being? How many potential partners in the
  science of heart transplant have you wasted? How do we know how
  many black South African scientists and writers would have stood
  here, by now, if you had had the vision to educate the rest of
  the world in the value of a great multi-racial society.<br>
  <br>
  Jack Cope surely sums it up in his Foreword to THE ADVERSARY
  WITHIN, a study of dissidence in Afrikaaner literature when he
  states:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>
    "Looking back from the perspective of the present, I think it
    can justly be said that, at the core of the matter, the
    Afrikaaner leaders in 1924 took the wrong turning. Themselves
    the victims of imperialism in its most evil aspect, all their
    sufferings and enormous loss of life nevertheless failed to
    convey to them the obvious historical lesson. They became
    themselves the new imperialists. They took over from Britain
    the mantle of empire and colonialism. They could well have set
    their faces against annexation, aggression, colonial
    exploitation, and oppression, racial arrogance and barefaced
    hypocrisy, of which they had been themselves the victims. They
    could have opened the doors to humane ideas and civilizing
    processes and transformed the great territory with its
    incalculable resources into another New World.<br>
    <br>
    Instead they deliberately set the clock back wherever they
    could. Taking over ten million indigenous subjects from British
    colonial rule, they stripped them of what limited rights they
    had gained over a century and tightened the screws on their
    subjection."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Well, perhaps the wars against Chaka and
  Dingaan and Diginswayo, even the Great Trek were then too fresh
  in your <i>laager memory</i>. But we are saying that over a
  century has passed since then, a century in which the world has
  leapt, in comparative tempo with the past, at least three
  centuries. And we have seen the potential of man and woman - of
  all races - contend with the most jealously guarded sovereignty
  of Nature and the Cosmos. In every field, both in the Humanities
  and Sciences, we have seen that human creativity has confronted
  and tempered the hostility of his environment, adapting,
  moderating, converting, harmonizing, and even subjugating.
  Triumphing over errors and resuming the surrendered fields, when
  man has had time to lick his wounds and listen again to the
  urgings of his spirit. History - distorted, opportunistic
  renderings of history have been cleansed and restored to truthful
  reality, because the traducers of the history of others have
  discovered that the further they advanced, the more their very
  progress was checked and vitiated by the lacunae they had
  purposefully inserted in the history of others. Self-interest
  dictated yet another round of revisionism - slight, niggardly
  concessions to begin with. But a breach had been made in the dam
  and an avalanche proved the logical progression. From the heart
  of jungles, even before the aid of high-precision cameras mounted
  on orbiting satellites, civilizations have resurrected,
  documenting their own existence with unassailable iconography and
  art. More amazing still, the records of the ancient voyagers, the
  merchant adventurers of the age when Europe did not yet require
  to dominate territories in order to feed its industrial mills -
  those objective recitals of mariners and adventurers from
  antiquity confirmed what the archeological remains affirmed so
  loudly. They spoke of living communities which regulated their
  own lives, which had evolved a working relationship with Nature,
  which ministered to their own wants and secured their future with
  their own genius. These narratives, uncluttered by the impure
  motives which needed to mystify the plain self-serving rush to
  dismantle independent societies for easy plundering - pointed
  accusing fingers unerringly in the direction of European savants,
  philosophers, scientists, and theorists of human evolution.
  Gobineau is a notorious name, but how many students of European
  thought today, even among us Africans, recall that several of the
  most revered names in European philosophy - Hegel, Locke,
  Montesquieu, Hume, Voltaire - an endless list - were unabashed
  theorists of racial superiority and denigrators of the African
  history and being. As for the more prominent names among the
  theorists of revolution and class struggle - we will draw the
  curtain of extenuation on their own intellectual aberration,
  forgiving them a little for their vision of an end to human
  exploitation.<br>
  <br>
  In any case, the purpose is not really to indict the past, but to
  summon it to the attention of a suicidal, anachronistic present.
  To say to that mutant present: you are a child of those centuries
  of lies, distortion and opportunism in high places, even among
  the holy of holies of intellectual objectivity. But the world is
  growing up, while you wilfully remain a child, a stubborn,
  self-destructive child, with certain destructive powers, but a
  child nevertheless. And to say to the world, to call attention to
  its own historic passage of lies - as yet unabandoned by some -
  which sustains the evil precocity of this child. Wherein then
  lies the surprise that we, the victims of that intellectual
  dishonesty of others, demand from that world that is finally
  coming to itself, a measure of expiation? Demand that it rescues
  itself, by concrete acts, from the stigma of being the wilful
  parent of a monstrosity, especially as that monstrous child still
  draws material nourishment, breath, and human recognition from
  the strengths and devises of that world, with an umbilical cord
  which stretches across oceans, even across the cosmos via
  so-called programmes of technological co-operation. We are saying
  very simply but urgently: Sever that cord. By any name, be it
  Total Sanction, Boycott, Disinvestment, or whatever, sever this
  umbilical cord and leave this monster of a birth to atrophy and
  die or to rebuild itself on long-denied humane foundations. Let
  it collapse, shorn of its external sustenance, let it collapse of
  its own social disequilibrium, its economic lopsidedness, its war
  of attrition on its most productive labour. Let it wither like an
  aborted foetus of the human family if it persists in smothering
  the minds and sinews which constitute its authentic being.<br>
  <br>
  This pariah society that is Apartheid South Africa plays many
  games on human intelligence. Listen to this for example. When the
  whole world escalated its appeal for the release of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1993/index.html">Nelson Mandela</a>, the South
  African Government blandly declared that it continued to hold
  Nelson Mandela for the same reasons that the Allied powers
  continued to hold Rudolf Hess! Now a statement like that is an
  obvious appeal to the love of the ridiculous in everyone.
  Certainly it wrung a kind of satiric poem out of me - Rudolf Hess
  as Nelson Mandela in blackface! What else can a writer do to
  protect his humanity against such egregious assaults! But yet
  again to equate Nelson Mandela to the archcriminal Rudolf Hess is
  a macabre improvement on the attitude of regarding him as
  sub-human. It belongs on that same scale of Apartheid's
  self-improvement as the ratio between Sharpeville and Von Brandis
  Square, that near-kind, near-considerate, almost benevolent
  dispersal of the first Native Press rebellion.<br>
  <br>
  That world which is so conveniently traduced by Apartheid thought
  is of course that which I so wholeheartedly embrace - and this is
  my choice - among several options - of the significance of my
  presence here. It is a world that nourishes my being, one which
  is so self-sufficient, so replete in all aspects of its
  productivity, so confident in itself and in its destiny that it
  experiences no fear in reaching out to others and in responding
  to the reach of others. It is the heartstone of our creative
  existence. It constitutes the prism of our world perception and
  this means that our sight need not be and has never been
  permanently turned inwards. If it were, we could not so easily
  understand the enemy on our doorstep, nor understand how to
  obtain the means to disarm it. When this society which is
  Apartheid South Africa indulges from time to time in appeals to
  the outside world that it represents the last bastion of
  civilization against the hordes of barbarism from its North, we
  can even afford an indulgent smile. It is sufficient, imagines
  this state, to raise the spectre of a few renegade African
  leaders, psychopaths and robber barons who we ourselves are
  victims of - whom we denounce before the world and overthrow when
  we are able - this Apartheid society insists to the world that
  its picture of the future is the reality which only its policies
  can erase. This is a continent which only destroys, it proclaims,
  it is peopled by a race which has never contributed anything
  positive to the world's pool of knowledge. A vacuum, that will
  suck into its insatiable maw the entire fruits of centuries of
  European civilization, then spew out the resulting mush with
  contempt. How strange that a society which claims to represent
  this endangered face of progress should itself be locked in
  centuries-old fantasies, blithely unaware of, or indifferent to
  the fact that it is the last, institutionally functioning product
  of archaic articles of faith in Euro-Judaic thought.<br>
  <br>
  Take God and Law for example, especially the former. The black
  race has more than sufficient historic justification to be a
  little paranoid about the intrusion of alien deities into its
  destiny. For even today, Apartheid's mentality of the
  pre-ordained rests - according to its own unabashed claims, on
  what I can only describe as incidents in a testamentary Godism -
  I dare not call it Christianity. The sons of Ham on the one hand;
  the descendants of Shem on the other. The once pronounced,
  utterly immutable curse. As for Law, these supremacists base
  their refusal to concede the right of equal political
  participation to blacks on a claim that Africans have neither
  respect for, nor the slightest proclivity for Law - that is, for
  any arbitrating concept between the individual and the
  collective.<br>
  <br>
  Even the mildest, liberal, somewhat regretful but contented
  apologists for Apartheid, for at least some form of Apartheid
  which is not Apartheid but ensures the <i>status quo</i> - even
  this ambivalent breed bases its case on this lack of the idea of
  Law in the black mind. I need only refer to a recent contribution
  to this literature in the form of an autobiography by a famous
  heart transplant surgeon, one who in his own scientific right has
  probably been a candidate for a Nobel Prize in the Sciences.
  Despite constant intellectual encounters on diverse levels, the
  sad phenomenon persists of Afrikaaner minds which, in the words
  of Eddie Roux, is a product of that complete acceptance of the
  "traditional attitudes of the time".<br>
  <br>
  They have, as already acknowledged, quite "respectable"
  intellectual ancestors. Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel, to cite just my
  favourite example, found it convenient to pretend that the
  African had not yet developed to the level where he</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"attained that realization of any substantial objective
    existence - as for example, God, or Law - in which the interest
    of man's volition is involved and in which he realizes his own
    being".
  </blockquote>

  <p>He continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p> "This distinction between himself as an individual and the
    universality of his essential being, the African in the
    uniform, undeveloped oneness of his existence, has not yet
    attained: so that the knowledge of absolute Being, an Other and
    a Higher than his individual self, is entirely wanting".
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>Futile to waste a moment refuting the banal
  untruthfulness of this claim, I content myself with extracting
  from it only a lesson which escapes, even today, those who insist
  that the pinnacle of man's intellectual thirst is the capacity to
  project this universality in the direction of a Super-Other.
  There is, I believe, a very healthy school of thought which not
  only opposes this materially, but has produced effectively
  structured societies which operate independently of this
  seductive, even productively, inspiring but extravagant
  fable.<br>
  <br>
  Once we thus overcome the temptation to contest the denial of
  this feat of imaginative projection to the African, we find
  ourselves left only with the dispassionate exercise of examining
  in what areas we encounter differences between the histories of
  societies which, according to Hegel and company, never conceived
  of this Omnipotent Extrusion into Infinite Space, and those who
  did - be these differences in the areas of economic or artistic
  life, social relations or scientific attainment - in short, in
  all those activities which are empirically verifiable, quite
  different from the racial consequences of imprecations arising
  from that post Adam-and-Eve nudist escapade in the Old
  Testament.<br>
  <br>
  When we do this, we come upon a curious fact. The pre-colonial
  history of African societies - and I refer to both Euro-Christian
  and Arab-Islamic colonization - indicates very clearly that
  African societies never at any time of their existence went to
  war with another over the issue of <i>their</i> religion. That
  is, at no time did the black race attempt to subjugate or
  forcibly convert others with any holier-than-thou evangelizing
  zeal. Economic and political motives, yes. But not religion.
  Perhaps this unnatural fact was responsible for the conclusions
  of Hegel - we do not know. Certainly, the bloody histories of the
  world's major religions, localized skirmishes of which extend
  even to the present, lead to a sneaking suspicion that religion,
  as defined by these eminent philosophers, comes to self-knowledge
  only through the activity of war.<br>
  <br>
  When, therefore, towards the close of the Twentieth Century, that
  is, centuries after the Crusades and Jihads that laid waste other
  and one another's civilizations, fragmented ancient cohesive
  social relations and trampled upon the spirituality of entire
  peoples, smashing their cultures in obedience to the strictures
  of unseen gods, when today, we encounter nations whose social
  reasoning is guided by canonical, theological claims, we believe,
  on our part, that the era of darkness has never truly left the
  world. A state whose justification for the continuing suppression
  of its indigenes, indigenes who constitute the majority on that
  land, rests on claims to divine selection is a menace to secure
  global relationship in a world that thrives on nationalism as
  common denominator. Such a society does not, in other words,
  belong in this modern world. We also have our myths, but we have
  never employed them as a base for the subjugation of others. We
  also inhabit a realistic world, however, and, for the recovery of
  the fullness of that world, the black race has no choice but to
  prepare itself and volunteer the supreme sacrifice.<br>
  <br>
  In speaking of that world - both myth and reality - it is our
  duty, perhaps our very last peaceful duty to a doomed enemy - to
  remind it, and its supporters outside its boundaries, that the
  phenomenon of ambivalence induced by the African world has a very
  long history, but that most proponents of the slanderous aspects
  have long ago learnt to abandon the untenable. Indeed it is
  probably even more pertinent to remind this racist society that
  our African world, its cultural hoards and philosophical thought,
  have had concrete impacts on the racists' own forebears, have
  proved seminal to a number of movements and even created
  tributaries, both pure and polluted, among the white indigenes in
  their own homelands.<br>
  <br>
  Such a variety of encounters and responses have been due,
  naturally, to profound searches for new directions in their
  cultural adventures, seeking solaces to counter the remorseless
  mechanization of their existence, indeed seeking new meanings for
  the mystery of life and attempting to overcome the social malaise
  created by the very triumphs of their own civilization. It has
  led to a profound respect for the African contribution to world
  knowledge, which did not, however, end the habitual denigration
  of the African world. It has created in places a near-deification
  of the African person - that phase in which every African had to
  be a prince - which yet again, was coupled with a primitive fear
  and loathing for the person of the African. To these paradoxical
  responses, the essentiality of our black being remains untouched.
  For the black race knows, and is content simply to know, itself.
  It is the European world that has sought, with the utmost zeal,
  to re-define itself through these encounters, even when it does
  appear that he is endeavouring to grant meaning to an experience
  of the African world.<br>
  <br>
  We can make use of the example of that period of European
  Expressionism, a movement which saw African art, music, and
  dramatic rituals share the same sphere of influence as the most
  disparate, astonishingly incompatible collection of ideas,
  ideologies, and social tendencies - Freud, Karl Marx, Bakunin,
  Nietzsche, cocaine, and free love. What wonder then, that the
  spiritual and plastic presence of the Bakota, Nimba, the Yoruba,
  Dogon, Dan etc., <i>should find themselves at once the
  inspiration</i> and the anathematized of a delirium that was most
  peculiarly European, mostly Teutonic and Gallic, spanning at
  least four decades across the last and the present centuries. Yet
  the vibrant goal remained the complete liberation of man, that
  freeing of his yet untapped potential that would carve marble
  blocks for the construction of a new world, debourgeoisify
  existing constrictions of European thought and light the flame to
  forge a new fraternity throughout this brave new world. Yes,
  within this single movement that covered the vast spectrum of
  outright fascism, anarchism, and revolutionary communism, the
  reality that was Africa was, as always, sniffed at, delicately
  tested, swallowed entire, regurgitated, appropriated, extoiled,
  and damned in the revelatory frenzy of a continent's recreative
  energies.<br>
  <br>
  Oscar Kokoschka for instance: for this dramatist and painter
  African ritualism led mainly in the direction of sadism, sexual
  perversion, general self-gratification. It flowed naturally into
  a Nietzschean apocalyptic summons, full of self-induced, ecstatic
  rage against society, indeed, against the world. Vassily Kadinsky
  on his part, responded to the principles of African art by
  foreseeing:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"a science of art erected on a broad foundation which must be
    international in character".
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>insisting that</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"it is interesting, but certainly not sufficient, to create an
    exclusively European art theory".
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>The science of art would then lead,
  according to him, to</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"a comprehensive synthesis which will extend far beyond the
    confines of art into the realm of the oneness of the human and
    the 'divine'".
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>This same movement, whose centenary will be
  due for celebrations in European artistic capitals in the next
  decade or two - among several paradoxes the phenomenon of
  European artists of later acknowledged giant stature -
  Modigliani, Matisse, Gauguin, Picasso, Brancusi etc. worshipping
  with varying degrees of fervour, at the shrine of African and
  Polynesian artistic revelations, even as Johannes Becher, in his
  Expressionist delirium, swore to build a new world on the
  eradication of all plagues, including -</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"Negro tribes, fever, tuberculosis, venereal epidemics,
    intellectual psychic defects - I'll fight them, vanquish them."
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>And was it by coincidence that
  contemporaneously with this stirring manifesto, yet another
  German enthusiast, Leo Frobenius - with no claims whatever to
  being part of, or indeed having the least interest in the
  Expressionist movement, was able to visit Ile-Ife, the heartland
  and cradle of the Yoruba race and be profoundly stirred by an
  object of beauty, the product of the Yoruba mind and hand, a
  classic expression of that serene portion of the world resolution
  of that race, in his own words:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"Before us stood a head of marvellous beauty, wonderfully cast
    in antique bronze, true to the life, incrusted with a patina of
    glorious dark green. This was, in very deed, the Olokun,
    Atlantic Africa's Poseidon."
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>Yet listen to what he had to write about
  the very people whose handiwork had lifted him into these realms
  of universal sublimity:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"Profoundly stirred, I stood for many minutes before the
    remnant of the erstwhile Lord and Ruler of the Empire of
    Atlantis. My companions were no less astounded. As though we
    have agreed to do so, we held our peace. Then I looked around
    and saw - the blacks - the circle of the sons of the 'venerable
    priest', his Holiness the Oni's friends, and his intelligent
    officials. I was moved to silent melancholy at the thought that
    this assembly of degenerate and feeble-minded posterity should
    be the legitimate guardians of so much loveliness."
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>A direct invitation to a free-for-all race
  for dispossession, justified on the grounds of the keeper's
  unworthiness, it recalls other schizophrenic conditions which are
  mother to, for instance, the far more lethal, dark mythopoeia of
  Van Lvyck Louw. For though this erstwhile Nazi sympathizer would
  later rain maledictions on the heads of the more extreme racists
  of his countrymen:</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>"Lord, teach us to think what 'own' is, Lord let us think! and
    then: over hate against blacks, browns, whites: over this and
    its cause, I dare to call down judgement."
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>Van Lvyck's powerful epic RAKA was
  guaranteed to churn up the white cesspools of these primordial
  fears. A work of searing, visceral impact operating on racial
  memory, it would feed the Afrikaaner Credo on the looming spectre
  of a universal barbaric recession, bearing southwards on the
  cloven hooves of the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse, the
  black.<br>
  <br>
  There is a deep lesson for the world in the black races' capacity
  to forgive, one which, I often think, has much to do with ethical
  precepts which spring from their world view and authentic
  religions, none of which is ever totally eradicated by the
  accretions of foreign faiths and their implicit ethnocentricism.
  For, not content with being a racial slanderer, one who did not
  hesitate to denigrate, in such uncompromisingly nihilistic terms,
  the ancestral fount of the black races - a belief which this
  ethnologist himself observed - Frobenius was also a notorious
  plunderer, one of a long line of European archeological raiders.
  The museums of Europe testify to this insatiable lust of Europe;
  the frustrations of the Ministries of Culture of the Third World
  and, of organizations like UNESCO are a continuing testimony to the
  tenacity, even recidivist nature of your routine receiver of
  stolen goods. Yet, is it not amazing that Frobenius is today
  still honoured by black institutions, black leaders, and
  scholars? That his anniversaries provide ready excuse for
  intellectual gatherings and symposia on the black continent,
  <i>that his racist condescensions</i>, assaults have not been
  permitted to obscure his contribution to their knowledge of
  Africa, or the role which he has played in the understanding of
  the phenomenon of human culture and society, even in spite of the
  frequent patchiness of his scholarship?<br>
  <br>
  It is the same largeness of spirit which has informed the
  relationship today of erstwhile colonial nations, some of whom
  have undergone the most cruel forms of settler or plantation
  colonialism, where the human degradation that goes with greed and
  exploitation attained such levels of perversion that human ears,
  hands, and noses served to atone for failures in production
  quota. Nations which underwent the agony of wars of liberation,
  whose earth freshly teems with the bodies of innocent victims and
  unsung martyrs, live side by side today with their recent
  enslavers, even sharing the control of their destiny with those
  who, barely four or five years ago, compelled them to witness the
  massacre of their kith and kin. Over and above Christian charity,
  they are content to rebuild, and share. This spirit of
  collaboration is easy to dismiss as the treacherous ploy of that
  special breed of leaders who settle for early compromises in
  order to safeguard, for their own use, the polished shoes of the
  departing oppressors. In many cases, the truth of this must be
  conceded. But we also have examples of regimes, allied to the
  aspirations of their masses on the black continent, which have
  adopted this same political philosophy. And, in any case, the
  final arbiters are the people themselves, from whose
  relationships any observations such as this obtain any validity.
  Let us simply content ourselves with remarking that it is a
  phenomenon worthy of note. There are, after all, European nations
  today whose memory of domination by other races remains so vivid
  more than two centuries after liberation, that a terrible
  vengeance culturally, socially, and politically is still exacted,
  even at this very moment, from the descendants of those erstwhile
  conquerors. I have visited such nations whose cruel histories
  under foreign domination are enshrined as icons to daily
  consciousness in monuments, parks, in museums and churches, in
  documentation, woodcuts, and photo gravures displayed under
  bullet-proof glass-cases but, most telling of all, in the
  reduction of the remnants of the conquering hordes to the
  degraded status of aliens on sufferance, with reduced civic
  rights, privileges, and social status, a barely tolerate
  marginality that expresses itself in the pathos of downcast
  faces, dropped shoulders, and apologetic encounters in those rare
  times when intercourse with the latterly assertive race is
  unavoidable. Yes, all this I have seen, and much of it has been
  written about and debated in international gatherings. And even
  while acknowledging the poetic justice of it in the abstract, one
  cannot help but wonder if a physical pound of flesh, excised at
  birth, is not a kinder act than a lifelong visitation of the sins
  of the father on the sons even to the tenth and twelfth
  generations.<br>
  <br>
  Confronted with such traditions of attenuating the racial and
  cultural pride of these marginalized or minority peoples, the
  mind travels back to our own societies where such causative
  histories are far fresher in the memory, where the ruins of
  formerly thriving communities still speak eloquent accusations
  and the fumes still rise from the scorched earth strategies of
  colonial and racist myopia. Yet the streets bear the names of
  former oppressors, their statues and other symbols of subjugation
  are left to decorate their squares, the consciousness of a fully
  confident people having relegated them to mere decorations and
  roosting-places for bats and pigeons. And the libraries remain
  unpurged, so that new generations freely browse through the works
  of Frobenius, of Hume, Hegel, or Montesquieu and others without
  first encountering, freshly stamped on the fly-leaf: WARNING!
  THIS WORK IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR RACIAL SELF-ESTEEM.<br>
  <br>
  Yet these proofs of accommodation, on the grand or minuscule
  scale, collective, institutional, or individual, must not be
  taken as proof of an infinite, uncritical capacity of black
  patience. They constitute in their own nature, a body of tests,
  an accumulation of debt, an implicit offer that must be matched
  by concrete returns. They are the blocks in a suspended bridge
  begun from one end of a chasm which, whether the builders will it
  or not, must obey the law of matter and crash down beyond a
  certain point, settling definitively into the widening chasm of
  suspicion, frustration, and redoubled hate. On that testing
  ground which, for us, is Southern Africa, that medieval camp of
  biblical terrors, primitive suspicions, a choice must be made by
  all lovers of peace: either to bring it into the modern world,
  into a rational state of being within that spirit of human
  partnership, a capacity for which has been so amply demonstrated
  by every liberated black nation on our continent, or - to bring
  it abjectly to its knees by ejecting it, in every aspect, from
  humane recognition, so that it caves in internally, through the
  strategies of its embattled majority. Whatever the choice, this
  inhuman affront cannot be allowed to pursue our Twentieth Century
  conscience into the Twenty-first, that symbolic coming-of-age
  which peoples of all cultures appear to celebrate with rites of
  passage. That calendar, we know, is not universal, but time is,
  and so are the imperatives of time. And of those imperatives that
  challenge our being, our presence, and humane definition at this
  time, none can be considered more pervasive than the end of
  racism, the eradication of human inequality, and the dismantling
  of all their structures. The Prize is the consequent enthronement
  of its complement: universal suffrage, and peace.</p>
