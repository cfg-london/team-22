  <h1>Albert Claude - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="claude.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Belgium, in 1899. Longlier,
  my birthplace, is located in a high point of the Belgian
  Ardennes, atop the rising spur of an eroded remnant of the foot
  of the Alps, next to a deep valley. In the Middle Ages, it had
  been a fortified place, of the Francs and Carolegian dynasties.
  Pepin le Bref, crowned King of the Francs in 751 spent in
  Longlier two winters, from October to Easter, in the years 750
  and 763. His son Charlemagne who by then had become Emperor of
  the Occident called a High Court of Justice of the Empire to meet
  in Longlier: the diploma, still preserved, was signed by him
  there in 771. In the year 1050, the Charlemagne Villa became a
  Monastery, and renamed later "Ferme Charlemagne". In the
  17th-18th century, it was adorned with a high sloping roof
  "&agrave; la mansarde", whereas the round towers, standing high at
  the wall corners, matched the roof with elegant, bell-shaped
  tops, a situation which remained unchanged until 1914.<br>
  <br>
  The landscape of the Longlier region is covered with remnants of
  the primeval forest of oak trees, progressively invaded by
  evergreens. The bluegreen color of the pines, which blends with
  the blue-grey color of the massif of slate rocks emerging through
  a meager soil gives the countryside an aspect, severe, but also
  of serene beauty, and even more, when the pure coat of the snow
  covers it during the long and cold winters.<br>
  <br>
  The population was sparse, at least at the time I was a boy. Our
  agglomeration was made of scattered small farms, regrouped into
  hamlets which, with the village, amounted to about 800
  inhabitants in all. Rarely, because the people were few, a
  funeral procession was climbing slowly from the valley, back of
  our house, and to the old church next to the Charlemagne farm,
  with the cemetery between them.<br>
  <br>
  The unique school of the Longlier region was built at the
  outskirt, a kilometer from my home, and about equal distance from
  the surrounding hamlets, so that the children could leave their
  home, and reach the school at about the same time. Actually, this
  school was just a single room with high windows, and a central
  stove, fed with coal and wood, by the teacher himself. As I
  remember, there was a set of 5 benches at either side of the
  stove, with a common sitting board which could accommodate 5
  children, in all 50 seats, for an average population, from year
  to year, of 40 pupils, at the most. The sexes and grades were
  mixed, and the ages, from 6 to 11 years old. All the courses were
  taught at the same time, in the same room, by the same and unique
  teacher. Under this highly pluralistic system, the school was
  running smoothly, and the results, as remembered over the years,
  turned out to be, in every respect, excellent.<br>
  <br>
  As usual for the time, the roads were not lighted at night, and
  no water distribution was available, nor in prospect. Due to the
  elevation of the site, we had to rely on rainwater, collected
  from the roofs, and on the clear water, filtering and running
  from the bare rocks, to the river and the streams below.<br>
  <br>
  In the Ardennes, the washed soil is poor, and the configuration
  rugged. When the spring and summer came, the heat of the sun
  brought life and beauty to the land. The farmers, however, rose
  early and worked late, each on their farm, relatively far apart,
  without the occasion, or the need, to communicate between
  themselves. Even more than in the cold of the winter, there was a
  strange stillness, in the heat of the afternoon.<br>
  <br>
  After supper, and when the daily work was over, we did not light
  the kerosene lamp, nor the makeshift carbide lamp we used, when
  the war came upon us, but sat outdoors, in the silence and the
  darkness of the night. As many have done before us, since the
  early rise of mankind, I reclined on the sloping back of a chair,
  and gazed intensely, and for hours, at the quivering milky way,
  and watched the coming of falling stars.<br>
  <br>
  When I became old enough, I took my turn in getting up early, and
  ringing the church bells (there were two of them) calling for the
  daily mass, at six o'clock in the morning. The ropes of the bells
  were hanging freely down the hollow shaft of the church tower, so
  that we could seize them and pull them from the ground, with the
  bells seen overhead. When the bells were in full swing, we used
  to grasp the rope firmly and let ourselves be lifted, just when
  the hammer hit the roaring bronze. This little familiarity had
  created an affectionate and reciprocal understanding between us
  and the Bells. One night, during a heavy storm, we were awakened
  by a crash. The Pepin le Bref tower, as it was called, which had
  stood there for many centuries had collapsed, bringing down, with
  it, the church bells. A few years later, in 1914, the madness of
  war reached our peaceful shores; the Charlemagne Villa, and part
  of the village, next to our home, was burnt. I was 15 years old,
  and starting to become an adult. For us, and for the dying
  Europe, and the thousands years of its past, it was a new World,
  and the end of an Era.<br>
  <br>
  My grandfather was born in 1830, just the year the Flemish and
  French speaking Catholics decided to secede from the Lutheran
  Dutch people of the low lands, governed by the House of Orange.
  His place of birth was not Longlier. For a number of generations
  tracing back to the 17th century, his ancestors had been active
  in maintaining a Relay, or Stagecoach stop, providing horses,
  food and lodging for travellers, and wagons for the conveyance of
  goods. The site of this undertaking was a small plateau, about
  the locality of Offaing, rising from the opposite side of the
  Longlier valley, away and higher up from the Charlemagne Villa.
  From this rather ancient time, I have a witness helping me to
  imagine and recreate the past. It is a chest of heavy oak with a
  secret lock, and a slit with a receptacle underneath, in which
  the hostess, my great-grandmother, would drop the coins she
  received from the customers, in payment for their expenditure at
  the inn. This chest, for the past twenty years, has been in my
  bedroom, next to my bed, supporting a lamp and a clock.<br>
  <br>
  My great-grandfather, Godfroid, born on the heights of Offaing in
  1800, or about, had five or six sons, including my grandfather,
  and a similar number of daughters, most of them promised to live
  well over ninety. In this healthy, no doubt dynamic, but crowded
  environment, my grandfather may have felt the pressure of
  competition, but most likely happened to the most adventurous and
  most farsighted: he decided to move and settle on his own.<br>
  <br>
  Following the Belgian revolution of 1830 the new nation decided
  to give itself a King, the choice being L&eacute;opold, Prince of
  Saxe-Cobourg and recent widower of the heir of the throne of
  England, with the crowning in 1831. L&eacute;opold the First was a
  man of high character and wisdom. It is to his knowledge of the
  industry of England and to his own initiative that Belgium owed
  to have had the first railroad lines on the Continent, the first
  one connecting Bruxelles with Antwerp and its harbor. The next
  undertaking was much more ambitious. This second line was to be
  transcontinental, starting from Brussels, through Namur,
  Luxembourg, Vienna, and further on.<br>
  <br>
  The Longlier valley gap, however, which happened to stand exactly
  across the projected direction of the new railroad line, would
  have to be bridged. In addition to this technical difficulty, it
  was found that the Devonian synclinal, which is the geologic
  substructure of the region was disturbed by a tectonic anomaly in
  the form of a narrow band, less than one kilometer in width,
  which had become deflected in front of the Longlier valley,
  passing just under the terminal point where the construction of
  the railroad had stopped. The problems were such that the
  construction of the line was postponed, for an undetermined
  length of time. My grandfather saw the opportunity and moved to
  Longlier. Apparently, he was not without means. Within a
  relatively short time he built a hotel, next to the freight depot
  of the railroad terminus. From the commissioned Agency handling
  the freight traffic for the line, the "Messageries Van Gent", he
  obtained some agreement whereby he would be responsible for the
  freight that landed at the Terminal, for its distribution outside
  the railroad areas. Very soon, he had horses and wagons
  distributing goods and wares in various directions, as far as the
  north of France, especially Sedan and Bazeilles, where we had
  some relatives. His business prospered rapidly, and he became
  relatively wealthy.<br>
  <br>
  For me, this story of railroads and of a diligent grandfather,
  which I have recalled, has been more meaningful than the effect
  of a tectonic anomaly on a Devonian synclinal. Without the
  decision of my grandfather to move to Longlier, my mother would
  have been someone else, and there would have been no tales of
  ringing bells in a medieval church tower, and no ailing uncle to
  take care of. It was a question of being, or not being. Once the
  first step taken, what remains to deal with are the important but
  universal problems of the individual, versus his environment. My
  mother, Glaudice Watriquant, was 45 years old when I was born,
  and my father 43. I was the youngest of four, two brothers and
  one sister, with a gap of 9 years with the oldest. As it
  happened, most of my early years were spent in the company of
  old, or very old people, each having their problems and ailments,
  but never complaining. This created a pervading feeling of
  tolerance, kindness, and stoic strength which made me happy and
  feel secure.<br>
  <br>
  For a while, my father worked for my grandfather. As a child
  eight years old he was already accompanying the driver, not much
  older than himself, returning by night bringing back fresh
  vegetables and labile goods from the renowned French
  market-garden of Fonds-de-Givonne. They took turn to rest,
  although the traffic was rare at night, especially in the long
  forest roads; moreover, the horses knew the way and kept on
  driving even if both drivers fell asleep, as occurred more than
  once. It was pleasant for youngsters to wake up at the songs of
  the birds, in a mellow summer night. I would have enjoyed it as
  they did. My father was gentle, and romantic, in tune with his
  century. He liked to memorize poetry, from Lamartine, and
  especially Victor Hugo, whom he admired the most. When he
  returned from his work and we were very young, we asked him to
  recite verses to us or sing a lieder, quite well, of the same
  vein. When he came of age, my father chose to become a baker and
  pastry maker, perhaps as a complement to the hotel, and for which
  he spent three years of training in Paris. He was there the year
  the poet Hugo died. On the Champs Elys&eacute;es early, he found
  his way on the top of a gas lamp-post from where he watched pass
  the funeral procession of hundreds of thousands, for hours. It
  was in 1885, and my father was 29. It was also his last year of
  training. His first residence when married, two years later, was
  in the right wing of the Charlemagne Farm, next to the round
  tower, and my eldest brother was born there. The second
  residence, with the bakery and a store, where my second brother
  and my sister were born, was next to the railroad station. By the
  time of my birth, my father had taken over a former property of
  my grandfather, remodeled it and added a large building to serve
  as a kind of general store. During my time, the local work was
  already done by hired bakers, my father being away all day,
  taking care of orders and deliveries.<br>
  <br>
  Two or 3 years after I was born, my mother developed a carcinoma
  of the breast which appeared shortly after she hurt herself in a
  fall. She died when I was 7. Too young to go to school, and my
  elder brothers away in the high school in the town nearby, I was
  with her most of the time. She suffered, but calmly. I was
  careful not to make demands on her, and tried to help her when I
  could. Neighbours and acquaintances came to visit her, sometimes
  two or three at a time. They didn't pay attention to me; on their
  way out I followed them to the door, and heard them describe, in
  their own way, the future course of the disease. I was sad but
  kept it to myself. Not to leave me alone at home, she took me
  with her when visiting some healer that had been recommended to
  her. For one of them, in Marbehan, we had to take the train.
  Living close to her and partaking of her pain, I felt more and
  more being as a little nurse at her side. But like the grown-ups
  of that time, I could not help.<br>
  <br>
  The death of our mother made a big change in the family. After a
  few years of increasing difficulties (there was a pre-war
  depression going-on), the decision was made to move to Athus, a
  prosperous steel mills region bordering both France and the Grand
  Duchy of Luxembourg. A couple of years before we left, my eldest
  brother L&eacute;on, student at the high school was sitting, one
  day, at the kitchen table with a book flat beside him.
  Cautiously, I approached him and said, pointing the right hand
  page to him: what is this? I remember that, in order to see the
  page, I had to stand on the tip of my toes, and stretch my head
  forward. What I saw was the simple outline of a retord, drawn in
  a square, marginal indentation of the text. My brother did not
  turn me but began to explain, molding his words with his hands. I
  did not remember what he said, and could not understand their
  technical meaning, but as he was speaking I felt my chest, my
  heart, and the roots of my soul expand. It was a revelation,
  never to be forgotten. How beautiful this world within the book.
  I intensely wished to see and know more. In the innocence of my
  age, I did not doubt that I could. I was 8 1/2 years old. The
  kitchen table of our youth followed in Athus, an is now in
  Brussels, in the kitchen of our home.<br>
  <br>
  My attendance at the Longlier primary school was curtailed more
  than a year before the moving. When we arrived in Athus, we found
  ourselves in an essentially German speaking community. In the
  church, the hymns and prayers were said in German, and German was
  spoken in the school where I was received. Every day at 4 PM,
  each pupil in turn had to read aloud a chapter of the bible. The
  bible in use, and of which I had a copy, was printed in gothic
  characters of the oldest type. I may have practiced the sound of
  them at home, orduring the long, idle hours in the school: when
  my turn came, I succeeded in reading my part aloud without
  knowing the words. Again, as before in the world of the aged
  people I had lived in, I was made to observe my environment from
  without, in an abstract way, as visitors in an aquarium.<br>
  <br>
  After a year or two, I was asked to return to Longlier to help in
  the care of an uncle who had suffered a major cerebral
  hemorrhage. His right side was paralyzed and he had lost the use
  of his speech. He was tall and heavy, and my aunt was in her 60th
  year, and ailing. Soon, I took over all the care of my uncle, day
  and night, and later, progressively the responsibility of the
  management and the routine work of the household. I was about 13
  years old, and more duties and problems of other sorts were added
  when the war came. My only outside contacts then were the
  frequent visits of the doctor, who came regularly, or when we
  called for him in case of emergencies. He came driving himself
  his horse and cab which he used also when making the rounds of
  his patients in the country. To me, he looked old, but must have
  been less than 60. He had experience and common sense, and never
  seemed in a hurry. I reported to him about my uncle, and listened
  to his comments and advices. Finally, we conversed about other
  subjects and the news of the day. This familiarity with a
  respected physician and my appreciation of his work, or the
  tragedy I experienced with the long, tormented agony and death of
  my mother might have influenced me in wanting to study medicine.
  It was not the case. As far as I remember, even younger than
  eight, I have always been guided by reason. Not cold reason, but
  that which leads to the truth, to the real, and to sane Justice.
  When I went to the University, the medical school was the only
  place where one could hope to find the means to study life, its
  nature, its origins, and its ills.<br>
