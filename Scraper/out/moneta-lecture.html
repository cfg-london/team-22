  <h2>Peace and Law in the Italian Tradition</h2>

  <p>When on the afternoon of December 10, 1907,
  I received the happy news, soon to be made public in the
  newspapers, that you had conferred upon me the Nobel Peace Prize,
  the satisfaction of all Italians was reflected in the many marks
  of affection and esteem I received from people in every walk of
  life, and in particular from His Majesty King Victor
  Emmanuel<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, who, in his
  telegram congratulating me on this great honor, reaffirmed "his
  ardent desire that the great cause of peace should triumph". For
  all the honors I have received and for a public acclaim as great
  as any man could wish for, you have placed me in your debt;
  indeed, the years of life still left to me are too short in which
  to demonstrate to you, by renewed activity in my propagandist
  work, my undying gratitude.</p>

  <p>Your choice was all the more pleasing to my
  fellow countrymen in coming from a country we have loved for a
  very long time for its devotion to truth and beauty, for its
  civic institutions, and for its poets and dramatists, such as
  Ibsen and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1903/index.html">Bj&oslash;rnson</a><a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> who are among the most admired and
  most widely read in Italy. It was they who focused the world's
  attention on the admirable way of life, so full of vigor and
  sincerity, of your wonderful country. It was they who evoked anew
  your courageous ancestors, the Vikings, who with their small
  boats and indomitable courage were sailors and warriors truly
  worthy of being immortalized in legend; conquerors, not
  mercenaries, they astonished the world by the boldness of their
  fighting exploits in the days when war was honorable.</p>

  <p>I say, without adulation but with the
  profound conviction that I am truly expressing what the world
  thinks of you and of your country (especially what the
  inhabitants of my own country think, and it is well known that
  foreigners, in their judgment of the affairs of others, are often
  as impartial and truthful as posterity) - I say to you, in all
  sincerity, that your civic life today is as worthy of admiration
  in our time as was that of the bold Vikings in the days of war
  and armed conquest.</p>

  <p>This is because, caught up in the daily
  struggle, your nation faces ever changing reality with a clear
  eye and rejects old practices accordingly. It does not cling to
  customs which no longer have a reason for being; it is constantly
  readjusting itself to new needs and necessities. That is why your
  country is today in the vanguard of the world peace movement.
  Your Storting was the first parliament to uphold officially the
  idea of universal arbitration, to set aside funds for the
  Interparliamentary Union and for the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1910/index.html">Bureau in Bern</a><a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> ,and, ever since 1890, to encourage
  the King to lend support to arbitration treaties between Norway
  and the small nations. Furthermore, the memory of the recent
  attainment of your independence, for which you strove so long in
  the midst of the gravest difficulties, is still fresh in all our
  minds<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Your independence,
  achieved as it was without violence or bloodshed, is a living
  example of good sense and wisdom, prudence and great tenacity,
  and brings everlasting credit both to you who obtained it and to
  those who did not refuse it to you.</p>

  <p>Pacifism - as we have always advocated it,
  and as you are practicing it - does not seek to obliterate
  countries by throwing them into the melting pot of
  cosmopolitanism, but to organize them, if this is not already the
  case, according to the dictates of justice.</p>

  <p><i>In varietate unitas</i>! The more each
  nation contributes to world society from the wealth of its own
  aptitudes, its own race, and its own traditions, the greater the
  future development and happiness of mankind will be.</p>

  <p>And now, allow me to say a few words in
  respectful tribute to the memory of Alfred Nobel whose last act
  is responsible for my being here with you. Although Alfred Nobel
  was Swedish, he wished the choice and award of the Peace Prize to
  be in the hands of the Norwegian Parliament, which, as I have
  already said, was the first parliament in Europe to support the
  idea of international arbitration.</p>

  <p>The service done our cause by Nobel was
  immense; for here was a man of science, a man of industry, always
  in search of practical goals, who rejected the old clich&eacute;
  that peace is an unattainable utopia, capable only of seducing
  the minds and souls of sentimental idealists.</p>

  <p>The inception of the Nobel Peace Prize put
  an almost immediate end to the scoffing of skeptics and
  pseudo-intellectuals; and ever since then, our ranks have been
  reinforced by newcomers from all sides: politicians,
  industrialists, merchants, bankers - all hitherto aloof, now
  sympathetic to our cause.</p>

  <p>The gravest difficulties faced by our
  Society<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, however, occurred
  at the very beginning of its existence when our members, who had
  founded it to combat a militant nationalism which imperialist
  politicians wanted to foster in Italy, were denounced by our
  adversaries as the "stateless ones".</p>

  <p>This accusation was totally inconsistent.
  Before devoting ourselves to the propaganda of peace, my friends
  and I had first taken part in Italy's battles of independence,
  and by defending peace and brotherhood among peoples we were
  faithfully interpreting the great men who had planned and
  instigated our revolution. Like them, we proclaimed our primary
  obligation to be that of liberating our country, believing with
  Immanuel Kant<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> that to hasten
  the great and beneficial advent of united mankind, it is first
  essential to restore nations to their natural frontiers.</p>

  <p>Our revolution did not explode in a sudden
  uprising of people intolerant of a tyrannical regime; it was the
  result of a long period of intellectual and moral evolution,
  brought about by men of great talent and of rare spiritual
  qualities, poets and philosophers, true educators of the people.
  In speaking of liberty and patriotism, all of them taught that
  liberty may be won by risking death, but it is preserved only by
  adherence to the principles of justice and through acts of civic
  virtue.</p>

  <p>I was a young man when, in March, 1848,
  Milan along with the other cities of Lombardy rose in revolt
  against the ruling government's rejection of its offer of "peace
  and fraternity" in return for national representation for
  Lombardy and Venice. While the tocsin sounded, we were putting up
  the barricades; we fought, mingling cries of joy with the shots
  and the crash of tiles and bricks thrown from windows. If this
  magnificent and epic struggle, which passed into history under
  the name of the "Five Days"<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>,
  demonstrated the courage of our people in the face of danger, it
  also demonstrated their generosity in the face of victory, which
  was free of reprisals even against the most notorious police
  agents. They fought heroically but without hatred for the poor
  foreign soldiers who were obliged by discipline to fight in spite
  of themselves. For our fighters it was practically a cause for
  celebration whenever, by catching the enemy unawares, they were
  able to capture them without bloodshed. The enemy prisoners and
  wounded were all well treated.</p>

  <p>One day when my father and brothers were
  absent, I watched, from the windows of my home, three Austrian
  soldiers fall amid a hail of bullets. Apparently dead, they were
  carried away to a neighboring square. I saw them again two hours
  later: one of them was still in the throes of dying. This sight
  froze the blood in my veins and I was overcome by a great
  compassion. In these three soldiers I no longer saw enemies but
  men like myself, and with remorse as keenly suffered as if I had
  killed them with my own hands, I thought of their families who
  were perhaps at that very moment preparing for their return.</p>

  <p>In that instant I felt all the cruelty and
  inhumanity of war which sets peoples against one another to their
  mutual detriment, peoples who should have every interest in
  understanding and being friends with each other. I was to feel
  this way many times as I looked at the dead and the wounded in
  all the wars for our independence in which I took part.</p>

  <p>I was not alone in thinking and feeling
  this way. On the day following the victory of the people, the
  government set up after the insurrection issued a manifesto to
  the peoples of Europe, in which it said<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>:</p>

  <p>"The day is probably not far distant when
  all nations will forget old quarrels and rally to the banner of
  international brotherhood, putting an end to all conflict and
  enjoying peace and friendship, strengthened by the bonds of
  commerce and industry. We look forward to that day. Italians!
  Free and independent we shall seal the peace of brotherhood with
  our own hands, not least with the nations which today constitute
  the Austrian Empire, if only they are willing."</p>

  <p>We can almost identify these vows as the
  heritage of, or better still, as the development of a civic way
  of thinking which, manifest from time to time in Italian life
  from its very beginning, considers law and justice the basis of
  true social harmony and of all human relations.</p>

  <p>The same idea played a leading part in the
  common rites of the Etruscans, Volscians, Sabines, and Latins
  when magistrates representing forty-seven towns gathered together
  at the temple of Jupiter on the Mons Albanus<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>. These early Italian peoples formed
  confederations whose only purpose was to present a united front
  against aggression by their neighbors and against the demands of
  collective municipalities, never to promote aggression of their
  own.</p>

  <p>The concept that flourished during the most
  glorious periods of republican Rome and that appeared in the
  Twelve Tables of the Law<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
  as one of the first, though as yet imperfect, affirmations of the
  rights of man, inspired the struggle between patricians and
  plebeians. The plebeians were eager to gain equal rights with the
  patricians, and the patricians were anxious not to let the
  government of the Republic slip from their grasp since they could
  foresee from the first victories Rome's great destiny.</p>

  <p>This was a conflict that rarely degenerated
  into civil war. It instituted the tribunal, the right of appeal
  to the people, and the arraignment of magistrates who abused
  their powers. It was a conflict dominated by patriotic feeling so
  intense that it stirred those involved in it to fantastic feats
  of heroism and sacrifice which the world may perhaps equal but
  never surpass.</p>

  <p>Governed as it was by a senate always eager
  to spread the influence of the city, Rome soon became a militant
  conqueror. It should, however, be given credit for the <i>jus
  fetialium</i><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>, which
  originated among the first Italian races, particularly among the
  Etruscans and Sabines, and which Cicero called "<i>sanctissimum
  jus</i>".</p>

  <p>This law was a true <i>jus
  gentium</i><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> for its day,
  an important affirmation of the supremacy of justice, equity, and
  peace. Although it dealt primarily with legal form and ceremony,
  it marked great progress nevertheless, for it removed legal
  procedure, which constitutes so great a part of law, from the
  domain of the arbitrary. Functioning as guardian of this law was
  a college of priests responsible for declaring war, making
  alliances, arraigning those who violated the law of the people,
  keeping the peace by ensuring respect for treaties.</p>

  <p>When Rome became omnipotent after the Punic
  Wars<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>, it no longer looked
  to the "Collegium Fetialium" for approval, regarding it as a
  superfluous and antiquated institution.</p>

  <p>But though sheer force of arms opened the
  way to a world empire, though the exploits of Roman consuls and
  of the Senate were not without frequent incidents of cruelty to
  towns like Numantia, which put up heroic resistance<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>, the first and already vigorous
  protests came from the Roman people themselves.</p>

  <p>Histories of ancient Rome, such as those by
  Livy<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> and Dionysius of
  Halicarnassus<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>, are full of
  accounts of popular protests and of episodes concerning the way
  in which the common people of Rome resisted the war-mongering and
  conquering policies of the Senate; it was, indeed, the Latin
  poets and philosophers who called war "horrida bella" or "bella
  matribus detestata"<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Even though Rome came to dominate the world
  through a series of often unjust wars, it was its civic and
  assimilative virtues, which it never lost, that enabled Rome to
  maintain its position and to be of service to humanity. Behind
  the legions came the merchants and farmers who, as conquest
  spread, implanted the civic standards, the name, the language,
  and the institutions of the mother country in the new
  territories. While assimilating some of the character and customs
  of the vanquished peoples, Rome imparted to them some of its own,
  thus fusing all peoples, lands, and cultures into a homogeneous
  entity and finally, as its crowning gift, granting citizenship,
  first to the Italian people themselves and later to all nations
  within the Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>This explains the rapidity with which the
  conquered provinces became absorbed and Romanized, and how
  imperial Rome with its handful of legions was able to keep under
  control the immense populations of its enormous empire. And if it
  is with some justification that later aspirations of certain
  warrior kings to conquer the world have been attributed to the
  splendor of the Roman conquests, it should also be remembered
  that when the Republic declined and the Empire began, it was Rome
  who gave the world the doctrine of the rights of man and of
  nations.</p>

  <p>One of the advocates of this doctrine was
  the philosopher and teacher Cicero who, even prior to Alberico
  Gentili and Grotius<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>, sowed
  the first seeds of international law. Cicero was against all wars
  unless they were absolutely unavoidable.</p>

  <p>"Disputes", he said, "can be settled in two
  ways: by reason or by force; one way belongs to man and the other
  to the beasts; one should employ force only when reason proves
  impossible."<a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> He possessed
  a much greater breadth of vision than Aristotle, who justified
  slavery and believed that it would last until doomsday. "Beneath
  the cloak of the slaves", said Cicero,"breathes a man who is not
  just a thing, but a person who hires out his services and who has
  a right to decent treatment and a fair wage." He wanted all
  people to be equal in the eyes of justice: "True law is reason,
  just and consistent with nature; it imposes obligations and
  forbids fraud; it cannot be different in Athens from what it is
  in Rome."<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although in the realm of ethics Cicero was
  far ahead of his time, he was not alone in propounding such
  ideas. The Epicurean poet Lucretius, in his poem about the Roman
  world<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>, marked the contrast
  of its internal strife and the horrors of its wars with the
  placid tranquillity of the sage who, from the heights of the
  austere temple of knowledge, contemplates the senseless conflicts
  of men. And when Augustus brought these conflicts to an end,
  there was a host of high-minded individuals, such as Vergil,
  Horace, Pliny, Seneca, and all the Stoics, who extolled the
  peace<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>No one painted a more accurate picture of
  military depredation than Vergil. Inspired though he was by the
  Latin spirit and by his pride in Rome, he nevertheless glorified
  Rome's true mission as one of providing the world with the rules
  of peace and justice.</p>

  <p>These ideas of peace and justice were a
  prelude to Christianity which, while preaching brotherhood among
  all men, established its principal center in Rome. When the
  Empire fell under the sword of the barbarian, the ideal of
  humanitarianism and peace survived in Italy by finding refuge and
  support in the Roman church. The church set out to educate even
  the barbarians; it opposed the cruelty of the times with the
  Christian law of love; and it almost always used its moral
  authority, intensified by the very violence and rampant anarchy
  of the day, to foster the free and civil association of peoples.
  This international arbitration, which, for want of any communal
  law, we still regard as the best protection of peace today, was
  practiced by the best and greatest of the pontiffs of the early
  Middle Ages who censured injustice and the corruption of the
  aristocracy and who defended the liberty of the common man.</p>

  <p>The <i>Truces of God</i> which at certain
  times of the year punctuated any continuous wars between
  neighboring countries; or between communities, or even between
  factions within the same community, were also a beneficent
  inspiration of the Roman church. They sprang into existence and
  multiplied in a feudal society whose aristocracy, beyond our
  mountain ranges, gloried in celebrating any event, joyous or sad,
  with battles and massacres.</p>

  <p>When, however, following the Donation of
  Constantine<a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a>, the popes
  became temporal sovereigns and began to concern themselves more
  with their own material interests than with the moral interests
  of the people, they gradually lost the authority which, to the
  benefit of society at large, they had previously wielded in civic
  matters.</p>

  <p>The last days of the Empire saw the growth
  of our free towns, composed for the most part of a Roman element
  (which was never suppressed), of a Christian element, and of a
  new Germanic element.</p>

  <p>During the Middle Ages it was these free
  towns that kept the torch of freedom alight in Italy. They
  aroused and sustained in their citizens the sentiment of human
  dignity and they insured the protection of their cottages by
  forcing the nobility to abandon their castles and to live among.
  the free citizens in the towns and villages. It was they who,
  even before the birth of the Hanseatic League, formed the Lombard
  League to defend their rights against the Empire<a href=
  "#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>. And it was they who, after
  defeating Barbarossa's army at Legnano, then for the sake of
  peace and of compliance with customary law, acknowledged in
  Barbarossa imperial authority in all "except", said they in the
  presence of Pope Alexander III, "what concerns the honor of
  Italy"<a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>. "Moreover", they
  added, "we will never allow ourselves to be deprived of our
  liberty. This we have inherited from our fathers and our
  ancestors and this we will yield only with life itself; we would
  rather die than live in slavery."</p>

  <p>This devotion to the free towns,
  strengthened by a religious feeling which prompted each town to
  seek for itself a patron saint, produced in Italy a galaxy of
  republics, all flourishing in commerce, industry, and the arts at
  a time when the rest of Europe was still in the grip of
  feudalism. However, formation of one strong and unified Italian
  state was impossible, for no Italian prince could obtain the
  slightest support for it from the people, who were more concerned
  with the liberty and sovereignty of their own town than with any
  notion of national greatness.</p>

  <p>Dante saw the danger and the pity of this
  division into jealous and antagonistic city states. In his poem,
  attacking parties, he says in an immortal line that Italy, "no
  longer the mistress of provinces," has become the slave of cruel
  and pitiless sects<a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>This masterpiece in which Dante sets forth
  the fundamentals of his doctrine can be said, if one discards the
  now obsolete part which was adapted to his own day and to the
  metaphysics of Aristotle, to present the rules of government and
  of humanitarian life under <i>one</i> law; to this end, he wanted
  the Empire transferred to Rome, for he perceived in the Romans
  those qualities most suited to governing the world.</p>

  <p>The purpose of civilization, he said, is to
  put man's intellectual potential to practical use, in short, to
  develop his faculties to their fullest extent. So too, do
  universal peace and the free functioning of public bodies and of
  nations coordinate in aiming for the ultimate establishment of a
  universal society.</p>

  <p>Translate these highly philosophical words
  into common parlance and you see outlined the way to attain
  universal peace and, at the same time, to attain the greatest
  possible universal perfection.</p>

  <p>I will not now speak of Pietro
  Belli<a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a> nor of Alberico
  Gentili who, in imposing limitations and applying rules to war,
  were the predecessors of H. Grotius and who, in holding peace to
  be the ultimate goal desired by all civilization, went far beyond
  him.</p>

  <p>To conclude this already considerable
  digression, let me repeat the words of one of our eminent
  historians and publicists of today: "It has always been the
  concern of all the great Italian political leaders to preach:
  <i>peace, love, unity</i>, and <i>concord.</i>"</p>

  <p>With the decline of the freedom and
  sovereignty of the city states came a reawakened interest in
  Greek and Roman letters and through it the Renaissance which,
  scorning politics and disdaining military glory, held the
  supremacy of the mind and of the cult of truth and beauty to
  constitute the ideal life. It paved the way for the association
  of nations by creating a fellow-feeling among scholars and men of
  science.</p>

  <p>But this purely intellectual pacific
  existence, coupled with the disuse of arms, was fatal for
  Italy.</p>

  <p>While in neighboring territories great
  monarchies possessing new permanent armies were consolidating,
  the premature pacifism in our country left her once more
  wide-open to invasion; as a result, the richest and most
  beautiful parts of our peninsula came under the domination now of
  Austria, now of Spain.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Since we are deeply concerned with the
  present, with all its dangers and contradictions, you may think
  it strange that I have talked to you about ancient Italy and
  about the Italy of the Middle Ages rather than about the place
  and purpose of today's Italy within the complicated framework of
  modern Europe.</p>

  <p>I do not regard a look at the past as
  fruitless, however, for it was from the past that the forerunners
  and the first apostles of our revolution drew their inspiration.
  The idea of a legal system for the whole world, pursued by the
  pacifists in Europe and America during both the last century and
  this one, is to be found back in the history of Rome and in the
  minds of our greatest thinkers.</p>

  <p>Both pagan and Christian Rome regarded
  national law as the foundation and keystone of the law of
  nations. That is why nationalism, in whose name Italy rose in
  rebellion, is not jealous, is neither shut up within itself nor
  greedy for the acquisition of foreign territories. It is, on the
  contrary, sympathetic toward all nations who live and flourish in
  liberty, or who aspire thereto.</p>

  <p>After Giuseppe Mazzini<a href=
  "#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a> had founded the "Giovine Italia"
  [Young Italy], whose objective was unification and liberation of
  Italy, he went on in 1834 to found the "Giovine Europa" at Bern
  in collaboration with German and Polish exiles. In accordance
  with his instructions to its initiators, this group strove "to
  organize human society in such a way as to enable it through
  continuous progress in the shortest possible time to discover and
  apply the law of God by which it should be governed"<a href=
  "#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Later, Mazzini founded another such
  committee with Ledru-Rollin and other French, German, and
  Hungarian exiles<a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you would now be interested to hear
  what Pasquale Stanislao Mancini<a href=
  "#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>, leader of the modern Italian
  juridical school, was teaching in regard to <i>the new law of
  nations</i> as early as 1852 when he held a professorship at the
  University of Turin. "Humanity is our concern," he said, "and it
  is essential that mankind attain a unique organization of
  sufficient versatility to enable it to fulfill its destiny on
  earth. But in the human world an element of diversity exists:
  nations in which individual talents and abilities are educated
  become developed nations, civilization is advanced, and the rule
  of law becomes a reality."</p>

  <p>After the revival and reconstitution of
  Italy, Mancini, along with other jurists such as Corsi, Buzzati,
  and Pasquale Fiore<a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>, never
  tired of advocating the reform and codification of <i>the law of
  nations</i>, or, in a word, the establishment of international
  justice in the interests of peace and the progress of
  civilization.</p>

  <p>So far, this plea from our jurists and
  lawyers has not been answered; so international justice is still
  the high objective of our world congresses and of our
  propaganda.</p>

  <p>A great deal of credit for the development
  of the study of international law in nearly every civilized
  country belongs to the Italian school; from this study was born
  the Institute of International Law to which you so rightly
  awarded the Nobel Prize in one of the first years after you began
  to function<a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But Italy has done more than this.</p>

  <p>Anticipating the beginning of a
  codification of international law - and indeed we have even now
  at The Hague a tribunal for its application<a href=
  "#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a> - Italy, since her unification,
  has introduced into positive legislation almost all of the
  principles concerning private international law set up by her
  juridical school. The legislation has established not only that
  "a foreigner may enjoy the same civil rights as those held by
  Italian citizens" (Article III of the Italian Civil Code), but
  also that in civic matters, he is, while in our country, governed
  by the laws of his own nation. In this important respect we have
  preceded other nations in eradicating the differences, as far as
  civil law is concerned, between nationals and foreigners and have
  thereby founded the principles of our doctrine concerning the
  rights of the human individual in the provisions of
  jurisprudence. Thus theory is put into practice, as is further
  demonstrated by the fact that Italy is the first, and so far the
  only one, among the bigger nations to have abolished the death
  penalty from its penal code.</p>

  <p>It is evident then that Italy offers the
  best conditions for the continuous development and perfection of
  private international law, which provides the surest route to
  public law.</p>

  <p>It is not patriotic vanity that has
  prompted me to bring up these facts. It is because on the day
  when an international parliament proclaims the judicial unity of
  nations, followed by a related disarmament, the day awaited by
  all pacifists, I believe that all nations, Norway no less than
  Russia, England as well as France, will be able to prove that
  they have contributed in one way or another to this great
  event.</p>

  <p>But I must also provide facts to show that
  our first educators did not teach us in vain that Italy would
  have to undergo a rebirth not only to gain her own rights, but
  also to fulfill her obligations toward other nations.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, like all other nations,
  Italy has had to yield to the hard necessity of armaments which
  from time to time must be increased because they are considered
  essential for the conservation of peace in the present state of
  world turmoil.</p>

  <p>The situation is so strangely anomalous
  that we see even allies fortifying and arming themselves one
  against the other; we cannot, however, blame Italy for this.</p>

  <p>Of the many examples I could cite to show
  how strongly the Italian soul is opposed to the idea of war, I
  will be content to give you two of the most eloquent ones.</p>

  <p>As the leader of the government in 1865,
  General La Marmora<a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a>, who
  was a true product of the old Piedmontese militarism, initiated
  confidential negotiations with the court of Vienna in an effort
  to procure the surrender of Venice in exchange for a sum of
  millions to be established; that these talks never went beyond
  the preliminary stage was not La Marmora's fault.</p>

  <p>The second example is even more
  typical.</p>

  <p>Garibaldi, who was the most sublime
  personification of Latin genius and military valor of our day,
  won the battle of the Volturno at the end of September,
  1860<a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a>, and on the following
  day, in his capacity as dictator of southern Italy, sent a
  message to the powers of Europe, exhorting them to put an end to
  wars and armaments by uniting in a European confederation.</p>

  <p>With the same hand that had but a little
  earlier wielded the sword of liberation, he wrote: "In waging
  war, we differ little from primitive men who killed one another
  to snatch each other's prey. We spend our lives (today as then)
  continually threatening one another while in Europe the large
  majority, not only of great minds but of all sensible men,
  understand perfectly that we could easily go through life without
  this perpetual menace and mutual hostility and without the
  necessity which seems to have been fatally imposed on nations by
  some secret and invisible enemy of mankind of slaughtering each
  other with such science and refinement."</p>

  <p>He closed by expressing the hope that
  France and England, setting aside old rivalries and uniting,
  would form the nucleus of a European confederation which all
  other nations of Europe would soon join.</p>

  <p>Garibaldi's hopes for a French and English
  unity that might serve as a nucleus of a European confederation
  have been realized. The future will tell whether or not the other
  nations will gradually rally round them.</p>

  <p>Incarnating the highest ideals which he
  always put into action, fighting in a hundred battles for the
  freedom of all peoples, Garibaldi in 1870, in the same spirit,
  despite his distress over the transfer of his native town of Nice
  to France, hastened with his companions to the aid of a France
  abandoned by all Europe - and this only a few years after he had
  attended the first Congress for Peace and Liberty in
  Geneva<a href="#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>, which he opened
  with these words: "All nations are sisters and war between them
  is therefore inconceivable. Italians as citizens of other
  countries, men of other countries as citizens of Italy - that is
  the goal we should reach..."</p>

  <p>These sentiments are the same ones
  expressed by the Italian people in the culminating moments of the
  revolution, but I would be dishonest were I to claim that they
  are those of the majority of my fellow citizens in ordinary
  times. Had that been the case, our pacifist propaganda would
  never have been necessary and would not at present be
  necessary.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, because Garibaldi, having
  become universally known and admired, said himself on several
  occasions that he had always drawn inspiration "from the great
  qualities and magnanimous deeds of the Roman people", there arose
  in Italy a generation of patriots who, dreaming of an impossible
  return of Roman splendor, would have liked to make modern Italy a
  military power of the first rank rather than a nation outstanding
  for its great freedom and advancement.</p>

  <p>To begin with, they would have liked to
  annex the canton of Ticino<a href=
  "#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a>; then they set their sights on
  the Ethiopian Empire whose coinage they had already got as far as
  minting<a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Irritated at seeing France enter Tunis in
  spite of the French government's last assurances to our
  government that she would not<a href=
  "#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a>, these patriots believed that
  with the aid of Germany they could make war against France and
  wrest Nice and Corsica from her.</p>

  <p>It was at this stage that we, the former
  followers of Garibaldi together with patriots from other parties,
  all of us friends of France, formed the Lombard Union of Peace to
  counteract this mad Gallophobia.</p>

  <p>By exposing the nefarious schemes of the
  sowers of discord, by reviving memories of Italy's debt of
  gratitude to France, by holding conferences and forming pacifist
  propaganda committees in the cities where they were most needed,
  we succeeded in obliging the government of that time to modify
  its policy and to silence those newspapers which seemed bent on
  creating a rift of hatred between Italy and France.</p>

  <p>You know the result of our work. For
  several years there has been no trace of Gallophobia in Italy;
  and a warm friendship for our western neighbor has taken its
  place. We had clear proof of this last June on the fiftieth
  anniversary of the liberation of Milan and Lombardy. The streets,
  the squares, and the theaters were filled with crowds vibrant
  with memories of the political events and the feats of bravery
  that had freed our country. The warmest and most unanimous
  demonstrations were those saluting France and her army - several
  of whose gallant representatives were among us - for the generous
  assistance lent us during that memorable campaign in 1859,
  assistance which played so large a part in securing our
  emancipation.</p>

  <p>Clearly, a people who, after a half-century
  of extraordinary and occasionally unfortunate events, can
  preserve intact their deep appreciation of the benefits received
  from another nation, can be neither a boorish people nor one
  oblivious to the obligations that bind them to the society of
  other nations.</p>

  <p>Although today this society of other
  nations has no actual political existence, it has a virtual one.
  We Italians were made very aware of this when, struck by the
  terrible disaster which buried Messina, Reggio, and many villages
  in Calabria and Sicily<a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a>, we
  were consoled by receiving touching proofs of affection and
  prompt aid from every part of the world.</p>

  <p>Such is the voice of the universal human
  soul which, in times of great calamity, ignores the artificial
  barriers created for reasons of state and testifies to the
  goodness and nobility of human nature.</p>

  <p>And during the celebration of our national
  jubilee we did not forget the great demonstration of compassion
  and active sympathy that came to our country from your
  magnanimous Norway, as indeed from all the civilized nations.</p>

  <p>The orator of the "Mille" himself, the poet
  Abba<a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>, in the presence of
  the King at Rome, commemorated that great event by expressing the
  thought which was then and still is uppermost in the minds both
  of the people and of the government; he closed his speech by
  saying that Italy had risen again to accomplish the mission of
  peace with which history and her position in Europe had charged
  her. It is now known, even outside Italy, that there is no longer
  in our country any party agitating for war. Even so, there is no
  lack among us, particularly among the military, of people who,
  though not expressly wishing for war, would not be displeased
  were war to come; they hope that the laurels of victory, denied
  to Italy at the time of her wars of independence, which were
  fought by bands of Italians [rather than by an organized Italian
  army], might now come to crown Italy as a nation. This idea, held
  by a small number of our fellow citizens, has been rejected by
  all those of us who have any human feelings and is contradicted
  by the history of nearly every modern nation which has managed to
  become great, prosperous, and respected in spite of the fact that
  its military chronicles record a larger number of defeats than of
  victories.</p>

  <p>When, by the virtue of its people and the
  valor of its fighting men, a nation manages in a few years to
  throw off all governments that have enslaved and divided it and
  to accomplish a rebirth that would have taken other nations over
  a century; when, not since the Greek insurrection against Turkish
  domination<a href="#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a>, has there been
  a single war of national independence in Europe or America in
  which Italians have not shown their brotherhood by fighting on
  the side of liberty; when the bravery of our soldiers was always
  remarkable even in the battles which we lost, like the Prussians
  at Jena<a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a> and the French in
  the [France-Prussian] War of 1870-1871, through lack of
  organization and the fault of commanders-in-chief - when all
  these things are true, then new wars are not needed to
  demonstrate to the world that if our independence and our
  national honor are again endangered, our people and our army will
  know how to perform their duty to the bitter end. However, it is
  not glory in war that Italy or any other nation should seek
  today.</p>

  <p>It is sad to think that the peace which has
  now prevailed in Europe for many years can be maintained only at
  the price of ever increasing armaments whose enormous economic
  weight prevents nations from developing themselves fully and
  freely; and sad to think that this peace exists only on condition
  that very serious questions be ignored - a situation that, after
  a few vain protests, allows the abuse of force which would not
  occur if law were in control.</p>

  <p>No man of sense and feeling can fail to see
  the grave dangers of this situation or to shudder at the thought
  of the terrible conflagration it could lead to if we delay much
  longer in finding the remedy.</p>

  <p>It is urgently necessary that some ray of
  truth and love fall upon the three or four men who are today the
  arbiters of peace and war, so that a peace rich in justice and
  well-being for Europe may replace the present armed truce.</p>

  <p>Ever since Muraviev, chancellor of the
  Russian Empire, acting for the ingeniously inspired Czar
  Nicholas, addressed his famous circular to the powers inviting
  them to a conference aimed at disarmament and peace<a href=
  "#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>, we have believed that the great
  day of proclaiming universal peace was close at hand.</p>

  <p>The frequent exchange of visits in recent
  years between the sovereigns of England, Germany, Russia, and the
  president of the French Republic, the often attempted
  conciliation between France and Germany, the demonstrations of
  friendship made both in England and in Germany to dispel the
  clouds of suspicion and enmity which unhealthy prejudices raise
  from time to time between the two - all these indicated the good
  intentions of the heads of state as well as of the people and
  encouraged us to go on hoping. But almost immediately the dark,
  proud, and provocative arrogance of nationalism reared its ugly
  head, and the ground we believed ourselves to have gained in the
  direction of a general peace seemed lost again.</p>

  <p>Will it always be like this? Will the day
  foretold by the prophet never come, that day when no nation will
  ever again take up arms against another and when lances and
  swords will be beaten into plowshares? Was it in vain that Jesus
  of Nazareth came into this world to herald peace and goodwill
  among men and died on the Cross so that one day all men would
  recognize each other as brothers?</p>

  <p>Consider the French Revolution which should
  have introduced the ideals of peace, equality, and fraternity
  into international relations and instead, two years after the
  Declaration of the Rights of Man, let loose a tempest of war such
  as the world had not seen since Attila<a href=
  "#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a>. Consider the fact that two years
  after the founding of the Society of the Friends of Peace in
  France<a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>, which was greeted
  warmly by men of letters, by statesmen, and by workers'
  associations throughout France and Germany, came the outbreak of
  the Franco-German War, disastrous not only for France, but also
  for the cause of peace throughout Europe. And then remember that
  our distinguished master Frederic Passy was not returned to
  office by his electors<a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>,
  perhaps on account of his grievous sin in having become the most
  fervent apostle of international peace. Notice too that not one
  of our most eminent pacifists has ever been summoned to lead a
  government or to direct foreign policy. Note that the Pope, the
  vicar of Christ on earth as he is called, shuts himself up like a
  voluntary prisoner in the Vatican in protest against loss of
  temporal power<a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a>; yet when
  his voice should have rung out above every other in true
  Christian love and anguish in an effort to avert war at its
  inception, it was either never raised at all, or else too late,
  or too feebly, just as were the voices of his most recent
  predecessors. Consider the way that poets, with few exceptions,
  pay court to fame and popularity by singing the praises of war
  and massacre. Consider again how the most sublime virtues are
  always associated with the national flag while cruelty is
  ascribed to the enemy alone - this in order to sustain mistrust,
  hatred, and enmity between nations. Remembering and pondering all
  this, oh, I confess to you that I too have had moments of
  discouragement, wondering whether the idea to which I devote and
  have for years devoted all my time and energy might be no more
  than an illusion of my poor mind, a dream like Thomas More's
  <i>Utopia</i> or our own Campanella's <i>City of the
  Sun</i><a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But these were fleeting moments! And I was
  soon telling myself that if work for a future of peace and
  justice, a future of continual progress and of fruitful and
  useful labor for all men and all nations was indeed an illusion,
  it was still an illusion so divine as to make life worth living
  and to inspire one to die for it.</p>

  <p>But it is not an illusion. I felt this deep
  within me, and the history of human evolution as well as everyday
  experience confirmed it for me. Reasonable ideas which find their
  sanction in the conscience of the righteous do not die; they are
  consequently realities and active forces, but they are so only to
  the extent that those who profess them know how to turn them to
  account. It depends on us, then, and on our judgment and
  steadfastness whether or not the idea of peace will root itself
  ever more firmly in public awareness until it grows into the
  living and active conscience of a whole people.</p>

  <p>Today, unfortunately, what many facts
  indicate only too well is that universal peace, as we conceive of
  it, still lies far in the distant future, and in view of the
  growing greed for the lands of others, the weaker countries can
  no longer trust the stronger ones.</p>

  <p>"Keep your powder dry and always be ready
  to defend yourself"; this is for Italy, as well as for others, a
  hard necessity at the present time.</p>

  <p>I do not believe that there is at the
  moment a single government in Europe which is actually planning
  war, but the time could come when those who are thinking of it
  least might find themselves embroiled in war by force of
  circumstances. We had a classic example of this in France in 1870
  when, one month before the war, no one dreamed of or could have
  imagined such a thing; but once it had started no one knew how to
  stop it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, one thing seems certain:
  alliances today are made not for war, but for peace. We see proof
  of this in the fact that one nation belonging to a given group of
  allies can establish and maintain friendly relations with nations
  making up another group, without protests or complaints from the
  allies.</p>

  <p>There are still of course many people
  dominated by old prejudices who conceal under the mask of
  civilized man, the barbarian who sees any foreigner as an enemy
  and war as a good speculation. It is up to us pacifists to expose
  these backward mentalities by making people aware of what war
  really involves - just how many tears, how much blood, and how
  much torture unfortunate populations have to pay as the price of
  victory.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the situation in Europe is so
  involved, the old bitterness between certain nations still so
  alive, that no one can guarantee the future.</p>

  <p>It is very strange, however, that while
  progressive men of science have succeeded in overcoming the
  resistance of the winds and in cleaving a way through the air on
  artificial wings, not one of their counterparts among progressive
  statesmen - and there are still many in the various countries has
  so far found out how to overcome the resistance of evil passions
  and antisocial interests that together block the inevitable
  advance of nations toward the common goal of peace, justice, and
  well-being.</p>

  <p>I do not know what the governments of the
  principal powers will do today, tomorrow, or later to find a way
  out of a situation whose weaknesses, instability, and dangers
  they themselves recognize.</p>

  <p>Nor am I any more able to predict what
  government and what policy could bring about a different form of
  parliamentary action in our own country. I can assure you of one
  thing, however, for I know the spirit of our people. It is that
  Italy will never take up arms or bring influence to bear in the
  service of causes condemned by the conscience of free men who
  have a feeling for justice and for the conditions of universal
  progress.</p>

  <p>One recent event is a good omen for the
  future: When in 1870 the very popular king, Victor Emmanuel II,
  out of a sense of chivalry wanted to send 100,000 men to
  reinforce the army of Napoleon - then waging war on Prussia in an
  effort to prevent the unification of Germany - our people opposed
  it unanimously, and the 100,000 soldiers remained in Italy.</p>

  <p>Later, when the Crispi government seemed
  bent on war against the French Republic, Cavallotti<a href=
  "#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a> spoke out in the name of Italian
  democracy and all the friends of peace, saying that the Italian
  soldiers would have to march over our dead bodies before they
  could cross the French frontier. As a result, Crispi was forced
  into changing his policy to one that made such a war
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Again, a few years later, the same minister
  planned to send an entire army to Africa to regain the prestige
  which, according to the militarists, had been lost by our forces
  in the unfortunate battle of Adua. But threatened with revolution
  by the people if this senseless and unjust war were continued, he
  was compelled to hand over power.</p>

  <p>I do not, however, wish to conceal from you
  the fact that, although our people have many good qualities, they
  are also impressionable and impulsive, and since some of their
  agitators are equally so, it has occasionally happened that some
  of them, particularly the students, have indulged in rash
  demonstrations which could have compromised Italy's good
  relations with neighboring states. But these were commotions that
  the majority of the people never had anything to do with. They
  were not provoked by thoughts of revenge nor were they stirred up
  in answer to taunts; almost without exception they were the
  result of insults and injuries suffered by Italians outside the
  frontiers of our kingdom: "Blood is thicker than water."</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, I'm sure you know how I am going
  to end my lecture. Italy, the youngest and the smallest among the
  great powers, has contributed to international life her fair
  share of political ideas, juridical concepts, and moral ideals
  which have been both sound and productive and which have served
  as her compass in dark and stormy days; they will be her
  strength, her glory, and her driving spirit in times to come.</p>

  <p>The Italian Revolution was fought first of
  all to obtain the liberty and unity of the nation, and then, with
  that achieved, to join the freest and most advanced nations in
  inaugurating a new era of peace, justice, and joint cooperation
  in the work of civilization.</p>

  <p>So far, only the first goal has been
  attained; Victor Emmanuel II, who was king of tiny Piedmont, made
  his contribution by assuming the crown of Italy in Rome.</p>

  <p>It remains now to realize the second
  ideal.</p>

  <p>If King Victor Emmanuel III (who deserves
  recognition from civilization for founding the International
  Institute of Agriculture<a href="#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a>
  which will certainly yield benefits useful to all in the future
  world economy) will lend his support to the fulfillment of the
  Italian Revolution with respect to Italy's place in the world, he
  will gain added renown for himself and his subjects and at the
  same time strengthen the bond of affection between himself and
  his people.</p>

  <p>"Courage ever high and ever for liberty,
  for justice, and for peace among peoples." This is the motto with
  which both people and sovereigns can face all obstacles and
  strive to reach the highest goals.</p>

  <p>I speak here without mandate, but I speak
  as a man who has followed closely (sometimes as one of the lesser
  participants) every phase of the political renaissance of his
  country and who has in the supreme moments of our national epic
  felt the stirrings of the Italian soul.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, at this most solemn moment of my
  life, before you citizens and representatives of this illustrious
  Norway whose example has taught all nations, large and small, how
  to achieve without violence the greatest civil victories - in
  view of the patriotic and humanitarian ideals in the name of
  which Italy has come into its third existence, and in memory of
  the long list of heroes and martyrs who died on the battlefields,
  in prisons, or on the scaffold for those ideals - I give the
  solemn assurance, as a seal to my speech, that Italy will never
  fail in the commitment she made before the world: to be, once
  free to control her own destiny, an element of order and of
  progress, of pacification and of civilization in Europe. Yes, I
  am fully convinced that she will never fail, for one can say of
  Italy what your great Ibsen said of your country:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">After a heavy sleep,<br>
    She awoke renewed in strength, ready for the word of
    command,<br>
    And now she is the race which has the will and the faith,<br>
    Will and faith in the peaceful progress of mankind<a href=
