  <h1>Robert Huber - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="huber.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born February 20, 1937 in
  M&uuml;nchen as the first child of Sebastian and Helene Huber. My
  father was cashier at a bank and my mother kept the house and
  brought up the children, me and my younger sister, a difficult
  task during the war, a continuous struggle for some milk and
  bread and search for air-raid shelters. There was no Grammar
  school in 1945 and 1946 and I entered the Humanistische
  Karls-Gymnasium in M&uuml;nchen 1947 with intense teaching of
  Latin and Greek, some natural science and a few optional monthly
  hours of chemistry. I learned easily and had time to follow my
  inclination for sports (light athletics and skiing) and
  chemistry, which I taught myself by reading all textbooks I could
  get.<br>
  <br>
  I left the Gymnasium with the Abitur in 1956 and began to study
  chemistry at the Technische Hochschule (later Technische
  Universit&auml;t) in M&uuml;nchen, where I also made the
  Diploma in Chemistry in 1960. A stipend of the Bayerisches
  Ministerium f&uuml;r Erziehung und Kultur and later of the
  Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes helped to relieve financial
  problems of my family and allowed me to study without delay. The
  most impressive teachers I remember were W. Hieber and the
  logical flow and impressive diction of his lectures in inorganic
  chemistry; <a href="../1973/index.html">E.O. Fischer</a>, the
  young star in metalloorganic chemistry; F. Weygand and his deep
  knowledge of organic chemistry; and G. Joos and G. Scheibe, the
  physicist and physicochemist, respectively. I joined the
  crystallographer W. Hoppe's laboratory for my diploma work on
  crystallographic studies of the insect metamorphosis hormone
  ecdysone. Part of these studies were made in Karlson's laboratory
  at the Physiologisch-Chemisches Institut der Universit&auml;t
  M&uuml;nchen, where I found by a simple crystallographic
  experiment the molecular weight and probable steroid nature of
  ecdysone which Hoppe and I later elucidated in atomic detail
  after my thesis work which was on the crystal structure of a
  diazo compound (1963). This discovery convinced me of the power
  of crystallography and led me to continue in this field.<br>
  <br>
  After a number of structure determinations of organic compounds
  and methodical development of Patterson search techniques I began
  in 1967, with Hoppe's and Braunitzer's support, crystallographic
  work on the insect protein erythrocruorin (with Formanek). The
  elucidation of this structure and its resemblance to the
  mammalian globins as determined by Perutz and Kendrew in their
  classical studies suggested for the first time a universal globin
  fold. In 1971 the University of Basel offered me a chair of
  structural biology at the Biozentrum and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft the
  position of a director at the Max-Planck-Institut
  f&uuml;r Biochemie, which I accepted. I remained associated
  with the Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, where I became
  Professor in 1976.<br>
  <br>
  In 1970, I had begun work on the basic pancreatic trypsin
  inhibitor which has later become the model compound for the
  development of protein NMR, molecular dynamics, and experimental
  folding studies in other laboratories. Work in the field of
  proteolytic enzymes and their natural inhibitors has been
  continued and extended to many different inhibitor classes,
  proteases, their proenzymes, and complexes between them (with
  Bode, Bartels, Chen, Fehlhammer, Deisenhofer, Loebermann, Kukla,
  Papamokos, Ruhlmann, Steigemann, Toknoka, Wang, Walter, Weber,
  Wei) including recently inhibitors of cysteine proteases (with
  Musil, Bode, Engh) and other hydrolytic enzymes like a-amylase
  (with Pflugrath, Wiegand) and creatine hydrolase (with
  Hoeffken). The potential of these systems for drug and protein
  design has spurred our interest until today.<br>
  <br>
  Early in the seventies I initiated work on immunoglobulins and
  their fragments, which culminated in the elucidation of several
  fragments, an intact antibody and its Fc fragment, the first
  glycoprotein to be analysed in atomic detail (with Colman,
  Deisenhofer, Epp, Marquart, Matsushima). Work was extended to
  proteins interacting with immunoglobulins and to complement
  proteins (with Paques, Jones, Deisenhofer). We also studied a
  variety of enzymes leading to the elucidation of the structure
  and the chemical nature of the selenium moiety in glutathione
  peroxidase (with Ladenstein, Epp). We determined the structures
  of citrate synthase in different states of ligation (with
  Remington, Wiegand) and recently of a very large multienzyme
  complex, heavy riboflavin synthase (with Ladenstein).<br>
  <br>
  Early in the 1 980s we began with studies of proteins involved in
  excitation energy and electron transfer, light-harvesting
  proteins (with Schirmer, Bode), later bilin-binding protein, the
  reaction centre (with Deisenhofer, Epp, Miki in collaboration
  with Michel) and ascorbate oxidase (with Messerschmidt,
  Ladenstein) which are described in my lecture.<br>
  <br>
  Most of these structural studies were collaborative undertakings
  with other laboratories, many of them from foreign
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  We had discovered that some of the proteins analysed showed
  large-scale flexibility which was functionally significant. The
  trypsinogen system was investigated (with Bode) in great detail
  by low temperature crystallography, gamma-ray spectroscopy,
  chemical modification, and molecular dynamics calculations.
  However, it required some years before the scientific community
  in general accepted that flexibility and disorder are very
  relevant molecular properties also in other systems.<br>
  <br>
  The development of methods of protein crystallography has been in
  the focus of my laboratory's work from the beginning and led to
  the development of refinement in protein crystallography (with
  Steigemann, Deisenhofer, Remington), to the development of
  Patterson search methods (with Bartels and Fehlhammer), to
  methods and suites of computer programmes for intensity data
  evaluation and absorption correction (FILME, with Bartels,
  Bennett, Schwager), for protein crystallographic computing
  (PROTEIN, with Steigemann), for computer graphics and electron
  density interpretation and refinement (FRODO, Jones), and for
  area detector data collection (MADNES, Pflugrath, Messerschmidt).
  These methods and programmes are in use in many laboratories in
  the world today.<br>
  <br>
  I married Christa Essig in 1960. We have four children. The
  eldest daughter (1961) and the two sons (1963, 1966) have been or
  are studying economics. The youngest daughter (1976) shows some
  interest in biology, a last hope.</p>
