  <h1>Horst L. St&ouml;rmer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stormer.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born on
  April 6, 1949 in a regional hospital in Frankfurt am Main in
  Germany. Having the umbilical cord wrapped twice tightly around
  my neck, my parents' fear for the mental health of their
  first-born son subsided only gradually.<br>
  <br>
  My forefathers had been farmers, inn-keepers, blacksmiths,
  carpenters and shop keepers in the region. My mother, an
  elementary school teacher, and my father, having finished an
  apprenticeship, had been married during the previous year,
  shortly after a devastating war. Opening a store for interior
  decoration in my father's home town of Sprendlingen, they were
  trying to build an existence and start a family at the same time.
  Eighteen months later a brother, Heinz, was born without the
  umbilical complications.<br>
  <br>
  Sprendlingen, today a part of Dreieich, just south of Frankfurt,
  was a town of some 15,000 inhabitants. I was raised in the circle
  of an extended family of four uncles and aunts, who, together
  with my parents, lived in two houses with barns and sheds and the
  store surrounding a large yard. It was an ideal playground for
  two boys growing up with their cousins - this group always
  extended by a horde of friends. Constructing huge sand castles
  with moats and bridges, cardboard tents from the shop's packing
  material, building elaborate knight's armour from scrap
  floor-covering and intricate race tracks for marbles from curtain
  rails remain fond memories of childhood.<br>
  <br>
  I began kindergarten at age three and was soon after joined by my
  brother. The kindergarten's seemingly unlimited amount of toy
  building blocks must have fascinated me and I soon became
  somewhat of the establishment's chief architect. School, at six,
  was a happy time, complemented in the afternoons by playing
  soccer in our yard, roaming about the fields surrounding my home
  town, and building dozens of detailed cardboard model ships and
  airplanes from "Ausschneideb&ouml;gen".<br>
  <br>
  There was never a doubt in my parents' mind that their sons would
  receive the best possible education. Although none of my
  forefathers graduated from high school, my parents regarded
  highly the merits of a good education as a tool for social
  advancement. In their value system knowledge always ranked above
  wealth - although not rejecting a possible fortuitous marriage of
  both. To enter "Gymnasium", at ten, required the passing of a
  test. I was accepted and from then on commuted for eight years,
  five km each way, to the "Goethe Gymnasium" in the neighboring
  town of Neu Isenburg.<br>
  <br>
  Gymnasium was hard. I was not a particularly good student. I
  loved mathematics and the sciences, but I barely scraped by in
  German and English and French. Receiving an "F" in either of
  these subjects always loomed over my head and kept me many a year
  at the brink of having to repeat a level. Luckily there was
  "Ausgleich", balancing a bad grade in one subject with a good
  grade in another. Mathematics and later physics got me through
  school without repeat performance. I also excelled in sports,
  particularly in track and field, where I won a school
  championship in the 50 m dash. But sports could not be used for
  "Ausgleich".<br>
  <br>
  One of my teachers stood out, Mr. Nick. He taught math and
  physics. A new teacher, basically straight out of college, young,
  open, articulate, fun, he represented what teachers could be
  like. His love and curiosity for the subjects he was teaching was
  contagious. As 15 or 16 year-olds, we read sections of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a>'s Lecture Notes
  in Physics in a voluntary afternoon course he offered.<br>
  <br>
  Having mastered wooden building blocks and cardboard models,
  passed erector sets and toy trains, I had reached the level of
  "Elektro-Mann" and "Radio-Mann". Dozens of telephones and light
  boxes to communicate between the sheds at home were designed,
  constructed, improved, and mercilessly wrecked, possibly
  foreshadowing my later employment by a communications company.
  And then, of course, there was chemistry, a subject I did not
  appreciate in school, but it held the secrets for making
  explosives. I built a rocket that propelled a modified car of a
  toy train into the air. After several exhilarating launches, the
  rocket exploded in my hand and ripped off half my right thumb. I
  learned an important lesson: a rocket and a bomb differ only in
  the exhaust. Affecting me somewhat during adolescence, the
  missing thumb also relieved me from army duty. Today, it is only
  an unimportant, physical curiosity.<br>
  <br>
  I always wanted to become a physicist. Supposedly, at age six, I
  had told just that to a technician, who was repairing a TV set in
  our home. Obviously, I had little clue as to what a physicist
  did. Nevertheless, the goal persisted all through high school,
  but suddenly got overthrown during the last year of "Gymnasium"
  when an art teacher discovered my talent for design. I passed my
  baccalaureate with average grades - quite good in the sciences
  but quite poor in the humanities - and started to study
  architecture at the Technical High School in Darmstadt, about 20
  km south of my home town. Being too late at application time, I
  had to register for "Lehrfach f&uuml;r Bauwesen", a related
  subject, that consisted of similar freshmen courses as
  architecture. I turned out to be very good in making any
  technical drawing of a bird cage from any requested angle, but
  very poor in freehand drawing and decided that architecture was
  not for me. Instead I went on to pursue my true love -
  physics.<br>
  <br>
  As with architecture in Darmstadt, I was too late for
  registration in physics at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and
  took up mathematics instead, transferring to physics the
  following year. The year was 1968. Student revolts swept the
  campuses from Berkeley to Berlin. Frankfurt was a major site for
  riots in the streets and in the lecture halls. For a young
  student, hardly familiar with university life, largely ignorant
  of the aim of the different protests, these were uncertain times.
  Legitimate educational reform requests became confused with
  larger political issues leading to absurd happenings around
  campus. Damage was done to the institution of the university and
  its teaching staff but, at the same time, 1968 marked the
  beginning of a gradual and rational reform.<br>
  <br>
  Studying physics and mathematics was wonderful. It was a far cry
  from Gymnasium. I loved the rigor of mathematics. In physics we
  had fascinating beginners lectures by two descendants of the
  famous "Pohl School" of G&ouml;ttingen, Prof. Martienssen and
  Prof. Queisser. I had joined a group of likeminded students that
  studied together and hung out in "Caf&eacute; Bauer" for
  relaxation. Life was good, until I took the "Vordiplom", the
  major exam in all courses at the end of the fourth
  semester.<br>
  <br>
  All physics and math exams - some six to eight written or verbal
  tests - went very well. They went so well, that I thought I
  needn't study at all for the dreaded verbal chemistry test. With
  straight "A"s in physics and mathematics, what was the chemistry
  professor to do but let me pass? I was mistaken and flunked
  badly, requiring <i>all</i> tests to be taken again, six months,
  later. Thankfully, physics and math professors - some having had
  experiences of their own with chemistry tests - conspired and
  promised to maintain my grades in those subjects. It gave me six
  months, to study nothing but chemistry. I never felt more
  confident walking into an exam and succeeded getting an "A" in
  <i>chemistry.</i> I had been wary of the field of chemistry
  throughout high school and during much of my studies. Counting
  valences and bonds, memorizing dozens of exceptions to the rules
  and hundreds of arcane compounds never made much sense to me. I
  came to revise my attitude towards chemistry once I had grasped
  quantum mechanics and the origin of the chemical bond.<br>
  <br>
  The thesis work for my Diploma - in Germany a required step
  towards the Ph.D. - was performed in Professor Werner
  Martienssen's Physical Institute under the supervision of a young
  assistant professor Eckhardt Hoenig. Professor Hoenig had just
  returned from the United States, where he had worked on
  highly-sensitive superconducting detectors, so-called SQUIDS. The
  aim was to use these new devices to study the magnetic properties
  of hemoglobin to derive the geometry of its bond with oxygen. It
  was a time of immense joy paired with intense learning of
  intricate low-temperature techniques. Hoenig was a wizard in
  inventing and building sophisticated instrumentation to attack
  physics questions. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/index.html">Gerd Binnig</a>, who later
  shared the Nobel Prize for the invention of the Scanning
  Tunneling Microscope, was another student of a total of four
  working with Hoenig at this time in the same lab. It is probably
  coincidental, nevertheless, I believe our education in
  experimental physics down in this basement of the "Neubau" was
  second to none and strongly affected our experimental approaches
  throughout our careers. Hemoglobin did not bow to our
  instruments, at least over the course of a year, and I quickly
  performed some measurements on iron impurities in magnesium. I
  wrote an unimpressive diploma thesis on the magnetic anisotrophy
  of their susceptibility and received the necessary license to
  start with a Ph. D. thesis.<br>
  <br>
  At this time, my horizon unexpectedly widened. It had never
  occurred to me, nor to many of my town's youngsters, to go to
  university anywhere else but Frankfurt or Darmstadt. We went to
  the closest one and lived at home, where our families had been
  based for generations. However, in the fall of 1974, a former
  student from Frankfurt, Wolfgang Kottler, visited. He had since
  moved to Grenoble, France, where the Max-Planck-Institute for
  Solid State Research in Stuttgart was operating a high-magnetic
  field facility together with the French National Center for
  Scientific Research, CNRS. He was just finishing his Ph.D. thesis
  under Professor Hans-Joachim Queisser and was beating the bushes
  for his own replacement in Grenoble. Initially hesitant to make
  such a big step, moreover to a foreign country, the mastery of
  whose language I largely failed in school, I visited Grenoble and
  asked myself: Why not?<br>
  <br>
  Going to Grenoble was the single most important step in my life.
  Leaving the familiar surroundings of home, diving into another
  culture, another language, meeting new people, making new friends
  was initially frightening, but eventually immensely educational
  and gratifying. Meeting my wife, Dominique Parchet, in Grenoble
  certainly added to the city's attractions. Grenoble, at the edge
  of the Alps, not far from Switzerland was the French Science
  City. The magnet lab had been established only a few years back.
  Professor Klaus Dransfeld was the local director. There existed a
  frontier atmosphere with an exhilarating "can do" sentiment. It
  was an international place. Many famous scientists passed through
  and, due to the informality surrounding the lab, even the
  students were able to meet them on a very personal basis. This
  was quite different from other, more hierarchically structured
  research institutes. In a certain sense, students were kings at
  the magnet lab. They knew all the ins and outs of the magnets and
  the visiting collaborators were willing to share their scientific
  knowledge with them in return. It also was there, I first met
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1998/index.html">Daniel Tsui</a> from
  Bell Labs.<br>
  <br>
  My thesis project was to work on the properties of electron hole
  droplets in high magnetic fields, a subject that had been
  proposed by Dieter Bimberg of the magnet lab. I was joined by
  Rolf Martin, who had just received his Ph.D. from the University
  of Stuttgart. Together we spent hundreds of immensely enjoyable
  and very productive research hours - daytime or nighttime -
  around the colossal magnets. Sharing a French "villa" with Ronald
  Ranvaud, where many distinguished visitors from abroad were often
  guests, life revolved totally around science. I finished my
  thesis in just over two years and received my Ph.D. from the
  University of Stuttgart, where my thesis advisor, Prof. Queisser,
  now a director at the Max-Planck-Institute in Stuttgart, held the
  position of an honorary professor. Instead of the usual
  dedication, my thesis had started with a cartoon. I learned only
  recently, that this had been a major cause of irritation and that
  removal of the cartoon as well as cutting my shoulder-length hair
  could barely be warded off.<br>
  <br>
  All through my Ph.D. years, Prof. Queisser had urged me to finish
  my thesis swiftly and move on to the United States. He himself
  had been in the US, working at Bell Labs and later with Shockley,
  one of the inventors of the transistor. Bell Labs, the research
  arm of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), was the
  "Mecca" of solid state research. Strongly encouraged and
  supported by my thesis advisor, I had visited Bell Labs and
  worked with John Hensel on electron hole droplets for several
  weeks during the spring of 1976. The visit was also intended to
  make contact with Raymond Dingle of Bell Labs. At the time, he
  was working on semiconductor quantum wells, an exciting new area
  of research made possible by the invention of molecular beam
  epitaxy (MBE) in the late '60s by Alfred Cho, also of Bell Labs.
  I had heard Dingle speaking on the topic at the 1975 March
  meeting of the German Physical Society and had decided that
  <i>this</i> was the subject I wanted to pursue. As it turned out
  Queisser knew Dingle personally and with partial financial
  support from the Max-Planck-Institute in Stuttgart I was accepted
  into a consultant position in Venky Narayanamurti's Department,
  working effectively as a postdoc with Ray Dingle. I moved to Bell
  Labs in June 1977.<br>
  <br>
  Modulation-doping, the technique to generate ultra-high mobility
  two-dimensional electron systems, instrumental for practically
  all of my later research, was conceived about two weeks after my
  arrival at Bell Labs in a conversation with Ray Dingle. In his
  office, he had outlined their recent efforts to introduce free
  carriers into semiconductor superlattices and had sketched the
  positions of band edges, impurities and electrons on his
  white-board. It occurred to me that by placing impurities
  exclusively into the potential barriers, while keeping them out
  of the potential wells, the scattering of electrons by impurities
  should be reduced, thus increasing mobilities. It was a casual,
  almost trivial observation, which, however, turned out to have
  big impact.<br>
  <br>
  Modifications to the MBE crystal growth instrumentation of Arthur
  Gossard and his assistant William Wiegmann to allow for such a
  selective doping were made over the course of a few months, and
  they demonstrated the anticipated gains in mobilities. Initially,
  mobilities improved by a mere factor two or three over
  conventionally doped superlattices, but they have since grown by
  another factor of ~1000. Loren Pfeiffer and Ken West, both from
  Bell Labs, have led this effort and have consistently provided
  the most exquisite samples for research. Much of our experimental
  success rests on our direct access to their "candy store".<br>
  <br>
  Modulation-doping gained me a permanent position at Bell Labs in
  the fall 1978, and I was soon joined by my long-time assistant,
  Kirk Baldwin. With such high-quality material available, many
  physics experiments - previously conducted on two-dimensional
  electron systems in silicon - became feasible in gallium
  arsenide. It also opened the door to many optical experiments on
  two-dimensional electron systems, largely performed by Aron
  Pinczuk and his colleagues at Bell Labs in Holmdel.<br>
  <br>
  At the time, Dan Tsui of Bell Labs was already recognized as one
  of the world's leading experts on two-dimensional electron
  systems in silicon. He quickly recognized the potential of the
  new material for research and invited him on his frequent trips
  to the MIT Francis Bitter High Magnetic Field Lab in Cambridge,
  Massachusetts. It was the beginning of a scientific collaboration
  and personal friendship, which has lasted now for almost 20
  years.<br>
  <br>
  The quantum Hall effect, having just been discovered in 1980 by
  Klaus von Klitzing, was a major topic of our research. Another
  topic was the electron crystal, which was theoretically predicted
  to form in very low electron density samples in very high
  magnetic field. An exceptionally high quality, low electron
  density specimen had just been fabricated by Art Gossard and
  Willy Wiegmann. Dan Tsui had succeeded in contacting it
  electrically, and in October 1981 we took it to the Magnet Lab to
  look for signs of an electron crystal. What we discovered
  instead, during the evening of October 6, was the fractional
  quantum Hall effect.<br>
  <br>
  Since this discovery, many outstanding graduate students (Gregory
  Boebinger, Robert Willett, Andrew Yeh, Wei Pan), postdocs (Albert
  Chang, Hong-Wen Jiang, Rui Du, Woowon Kang) and colleagues (James
  Eisenstein, Peter Berglund) joined us and made discoveries of
  their own in this fascinating research area. Other postdocs
  working with me (Edwin Batke, Rick Hall, Joe Spector, Ray
  Ashoori, and Amir Yacoby) have performed research in neighboring
  areas, but affected our thinking in lower-dimensional physics in
  general.<br>
  <br>
  In 1983, I was promoted to head the department for Electronic and
  Optical Properties of Solids. Administration was a minor chore
  during those days, and I could continue to pursue my own
  research, practically full time. They were very exciting and
  intense research days during which the fractional quantum Hall
  effect and its implications were established in many laboratories
  around the world. Theoretical progress was rapid and
  exhilarating.<br>
  <br>
  In 1991, I was promoted to director of the Physical Research
  Laboratory, heading some 100 researchers in eight departments in
  William Brinkman's Physics Research Division at Bell Labs. The
  time available for my own research dwindled, but I was
  compensated by becoming exposed to a wide range of exciting
  research topics. The initial satisfaction faded when the physical
  sciences at Bell Labs came under strong pressure from management
  to contract. These were difficult years, not just for me, but
  much more so for many of my friends and colleagues at Bell Labs.
  I was reminded of Gymnasium and the power of teachers. With the
  split-up of AT&amp;T in 1996, the creation of Lucent
  Technologies, which subsumed Bell Labs, and a change of
  leadership, the physical sciences at Bell Labs are blossoming
  again today.<br>
  <br>
  I always had thought of becoming a teacher one day. Being totally
  immersed in exciting research at Bell Labs, the idea had faded.
  It was resurfacing. I stepped down from my position in the Summer
  of 1997 and joined Columbia University in January of 1998 as a
  Professor of Physics and Applied Physics, while remaining Adjunct
  Physics Director at Bell Labs, part-time.</p>
