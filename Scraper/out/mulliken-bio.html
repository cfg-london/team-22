  <h1>Robert S. Mulliken - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mulliken.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Robert Sanderson Mulliken</b>
  was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on June 7, 1896, the son
  of Samuel Parsons Mulliken, Professor of Organic Chemistry, and
  Katherine W. Mulliken. He married Mary Helen von No&egrave;,
  December 24, 1929. Their children are Lucia Maria (Mrs. John P.
  Heard) and Valerie No&egrave;.<br>
  <br>
  Mulliken took a B.Sc. Degree in 1917 at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology, Cambridge, Mass., and a Ph.D. degree at the
  University of
  Chicago, Ill., in 1921.<br>

  Mulliken has been deeply interested in valence theory and
  molecular structure. His earlier work on isotopes and on diatomic
  band spectra was followed by theoretical systematization of the
  electronic states of molecules, mainly in terms of the idea of
  molecular orbitals. This included work on electronegativities,
  dipole moments, and valence-state energies. A subsequent series
  of papers on the theoretical interpretation of absolute
  intensities of electronic spectra led him to computations on
  conjugated organic molecules, and to the quantum-mechanical
  statement of the concept of hyperconjugation. There followed work
  on quantum-mechanical questions underlying molecular-orbital
  theory and on the use of interatomic overlap integrals as
  measures of bond energies. His more recent work has dealt
  extensively with the structure and spectra of molecular
  complexes, on the one hand, and on the other hand (extending and
  developing earlier work) with the structure and spectra of
  hydrogen, helium, nitrogen and other small molecules.<br>

  1956-1961; Distinguished Service Professor of Physics and
  Chemistry, University of Chicago, since 1961; Distinguished
  Research Professor of Chemical Physics, Florida State
  University (Jan.-March), since 1964. Other professional
  positions held: Director, Editorial Work and Information,
