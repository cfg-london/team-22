  <h1>Ren&eacute; Cassin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cassin.jpg" class="bio-img">A jurist,
  humanitarian, and internationalist, <b>Ren&eacute; Samuel
  Cassin</b> (October 5, 1887- )<a href="#footnote*">*</a> is one
  of the world's foremost proponents of the legal as well as the
  moral recognition of the rights of man. Neither a pessimist nor
  an optimist, the peace laureate, eighty-one years old when
  awarded the prize in 1968, confessed that "men are not always
  good" but he has based much of his life's work on the premise
  that human responses can be constructive if states will transform
  the conditions that breed ill will into those that recognize the
  dignity of man.<br>
  <br>
  Cassin was born in Bayonne (Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Atlantiques), the son
  of Gabrielle (Dreyfus) Cassin and Henri Cassin, a merchant.
  Having established a record of intellectual brilliance at the
  Lyc&eacute;e of Nice, he added to it in his advanced studies at the
  University of Aix-en-Provence where, in 1908, he received a
  degree in the humanities, along with one in law. He took first
  place in the competitive examination given by the Law Faculty and
  in 1914 received the doctorate in juridical, economic, and
  political sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Cassin has made his career in law as practitioner, professor,
  scholar, administrator, and promoter. The legal career which he
  began in 1909 in Paris, where he was a counsel at the Court of
  Paris, was brought to an end when he was inducted into the
  infantry in 1914. Severely wounded in 1916 by German shrapnel, he
  survived, but only because his mother, serving as a nurse in the
  field hospital to which he had been carried, persuaded the
  doctors to perform surgery. Although the injury he sustained was
  to give him acute discomfort throughout his life, he recovered,
  married Simone Yzombard of Marseilles, and entered upon his
  career as a professor of law at Aix late in 1916.<br>
  <br>
  He moved to a professorship in law at Lille in 1920 and in 1929
  to the chair of fiscal and civil law at the University of Paris,
  where he remained until his retirement from formal teaching in
  1960. His teaching career included various scholarly assignments
  that took him to other countries. He lectured at the National
  School of Overseas Territories; undertook academic missions in
  Europe, French Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East;
  lectured at the Academy of International Law at The Hague, and at
  the University
  Institute of Advanced International Studies in Geneva.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he made extensive contributions to legal scholarship,
  writing technical treatises on contracts, inheritance, the
  conception of domicile, and the inequality between men and women
  in civil legislation; he also published dozens of articles, many
  of topical concern, such as those dealing with aspects of human
  rights.<br>
  <br>
  Cassin has been an administrator of academic affairs as well. For
  the embryonic French government-in-exile during World War II, he
  was the commissioner of public instruction. With the liberation
  of France in 1945, he became president of the Council of the
  National School of Administration [Conseil de l'&eacute;cole
  nationale d'administration] and in 1960 president of the French
  National Overseas Center of Advanced Studies [Centre national des
  hautes-&eacute;tudes de la France d'outre-mer].<br>
  <br>
  As a member of the Permanent Conference of Allied Ministers of
  Education (1942-1945), he encouraged the retention of instruction
  in the French language and the dissemination of French culture
  throughout the world. In the next two decades or so, he promoted
  education and law by serving as the president of several
  organizations - among them, the French branch of the World
  Federation of Democratic Jurists (1949), the Society of
  Comparative Legislation (1952-1956), the International Institute
  of Administrative Sciences (1953-1956), the International
  Institute of Diplomatic Studies and Research (1956), and the
  French Association for the Development of International Law
  (1962-1967).<br>
  <br>
  Cassin has occupied high posts in the judiciaries of France and
  Europe. From 1944 to 1960, he was vice-president of the Council
  of State, a body which exercises ultimate jurisdiction in cases
  involving administrative personnel and administrative law. For
  the next ten years he was on the Constitutional Council, a court
  which, akin to the American Supreme Court, rules on questions of
  the constitutionality of laws passed by the legislature. He was
  president of the Court of Arbitration at The Hague from 1950 to
  1960 and a member (1959-1965) and president (1965-1968) of the
  European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg.<br>
  <br>
  After World War I, Cassin devised practical outlets for his
  humanitarian instincts. In 1918 he founded the French Federation
  of Disabled War Veterans (L'Union f&eacute;d&eacute;rale des
  associations des mutil&eacute;s et d'anciens combattants) and until
  1940 served it in the capacity of president or of honorary
  president. To benefit children orphaned by the war, he accepted
  the office of vice president of the High Council for Wards of the
  Nation [Conseil superieur des pupilles de la nation]. In 1926 he
  founded and until the outbreak of World War II was the permanent
  reporter for the International Conference of Associations of
  Disabled War Veterans [Conference internationale des associations
  de mutil&eacute;s et d'anciens combattants].<br>
  <br>
  Cassin has participated in the political life of his country in
  various ways, but not in the usual one of seeking elective office
  or of acting as the leader or representative of a political
  party. He is a patriot and an internationalist at the same time.
  From 1924 to 1938, he was a French delegate to the League of
  Nations, serving at the Disarmament Conference and supporting
  various moves in the Assembly to advance the formulation and
  application of international procedures for reasonable
  accommodation of problems arising out of clashing national
  interests.<br>
  <br>
  Cassin is said to have been the first civilian to leave Bordeaux
  to join General de Gaulle in response to his appeal from London
  after the armistice of June, 1940, between Germany and the
  capitulating French government. A mainstay for de Gaulle, he
  drafted all of the legal texts of his incipient government and
  conducted delicate negotiations with Great Britain, including the
  Churchill-de Gaulle accord which became the "Charter" of the Free
  French forces. He held important positions - among them,
  permanent secretary of the Council of Defense of the Empire
  (1940-1941), National Commissioner of Justice and Public
  Instruction (1941-1943), president of the Juridical Committee of
  the Provisional Government (1943-1945) and vice-president of the
  Upper House [Haute Assembl&eacute;e]; he was a delegate to the
  United Nations Commission on Inquiry into War Crimes (1943-1945)
  and chairman (1944) of the legislative committee for the
  Consultative Assembly set up as part of the government-in-exile
  in Algiers in 1943.<br>
  <br>
  In the period following World War II, Cassin not only occupied
  the judicial posts already mentioned, but also continued the
  international work he had begun in the League of Nations. On five
  occasions - 1946, 1948, 1950, 1951, 1968 - he was a French
  delegate to the Assembly of the United Nations, and for many years between
  1945 and 1960 a delegate to the UNESCO conferences.<br>
  <br>
  In his work on human rights, Cassin fused his legal knowledge,
  his humanitarian instinct, and his belief in internationalism. He
  was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
  from its creation in 1946; vice-chairman from 1946 to 1955, a
  period which included Eleanor Roosevelt's chairmanship
  (1946-1953); chairman from 1955 to 1957; and again vice-chairman
  in 1959. The workhorse of the Commission, he was the one most
  responsible for the draft of the Declaration of Human Rights approved by the General
  Assembly on December 10, 1948.<a href=

  <br>
  In a series of lectures delivered in 1951 at The Hague Academy of
  international Law,<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cassin
  provides a thorough discussion of the Declaration and of the
  early problems of drafting the Covenants: he analyzes the
  pertinent clauses in the Charter of the UN, the mandate of the
  Commission, the preparation and acceptance of the Declaration; he
  then provides a lawyer's insight into definition of the rights,
  the limitations imposed, the problems of enforcing the proposed
  Covenants, measures needed for the examination of possible
  complaints, and procedures required for international
  surveillance and constructive control. In an article written to
  mark the International Human Rights Year of 1968, Cassin
  concludes with a simple admonition: "Now that we possess an
  instrument capable of lifting or easing the burden of oppression
  and injustice in the world, we must learn to use it".<a href=
