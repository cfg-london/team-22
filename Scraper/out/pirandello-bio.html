  <h1>Luigi Pirandello - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pirandello.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Luigi Pirandello</b>(1867-1936) was born
  in Girgenti, Sicily. He studied philology at Rome and at Bonn and
  wrote a dissertation on the dialect of his native town (1891).
  From 1897 to 1922 he was professor of aesthetics and stylistics
  at the <i>Real Istituto di Magistere Femminile</i> at Rome.
  Pirandello's work is impressive by its sheer volume. He wrote a
  great number of novellas which were collected under the title
  <i>Novelle per un anno</i> (15 vols., 1922-37). Of his six novels
  the best known are <i>Il fu Mattia Pascal</i> (1904) [<i>The Late
  Mattia Pascal</i>], <i>I vecchi e i giovani</i> (1913) [<i>The
  Old and the Young</i>], <i>Si gira</i> (1916) | [<i>Shoot!</i>],
  and <i>Uno, nessuno e centomila</i> (1926) [<i>One, None, and a
  Hundred thousand</i>].<br>
  <br>
  But Pirandello's greatest achievement is in his plays. He wrote a
  large number of dramas which were published, between 1918 and
  1935, under the collective title of <i>Maschere nude</i>
  [<i>Naked Masks</i>]. The title is programmatic. Pirandello is
  always preoccupied with the problem of identity. The self exists
  to him only in relation to others; it consists of changing facets
  that hide an inscrutable abyss. In a play like <i>Cos&iacute;
  &eacute; (se vi pare)</i> (1918) [<i>Right You Are (If You Think
  You Are)</i>], two people hold contradictory notions about the
  identity of a third person. The protagonist in <i>Vestire gli
  ignudi</i> (1923) [<i>To Clothe the Naked</i>] tries to establish
  her individuality by assuming various identities, which are
  successively stripped from her; she gradually realizes her true
  position in the social order and in the end dies
  &laquo;naked&raquo;, without a social mask, in both her own and her
  friends' eyes. Similarly in <i>Enrico IV</i> (1922) [<i>Henry
  IV</i>] a man supposedly mad imagines that he is a medieval
  emperor, and his imagination and reality are strangely confused.
  The conflict between illusion and reality is central in <i>La
  vita che ti diedi</i> (1924) [<i>The Life I Gave You</i>] in
  which Anna's long-lost son returns home and contradicts her
  mental conception of him. However, his death resolves Anna's
  conflict; she clings to illusion rather than to reality. The
  analysis and dissolution of a unified self are carried to an
  extreme in <i>Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore</i> (1921) [<i>Six
  Characters in Search of An Author</i>] where the stage itself,
  the symbol of appearance versus reality, becomes the setting of
  the play.<br>
  <br>
  The attitudes expressed in <i>L'Umorismo</i> [<i>Humour</i>], an
  early essay (1908), are fundamental to all of Pirandello's plays.
  His characters attempt to fulfil their self-seeking roles and are
  defeated by life itself which, always changing, enables them to
  see their perversity. This is Pirandello's humour, an irony which
  arises from the contradictions inherent in life.</p>
