  <h1>Sir John Eccles - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="eccles.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John Carew Eccles</b> was born in
  Melbourne, Australia, on January 27th, 1903. He owes much to his
  early training by his father, William James Eccles, who was a
  teacher as also was his mother, n&eacute;e Mary Carew. He graduated
  from Melbourne University in Medicine with first class
  honours in 1925, and as Victorian Rhodes Scholar for 1925 entered
  Magdalen
  College, Oxford, as an undergraduate in order to study under
  <a href="../1932/index.html">Sir Charles Sherrington</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927, with first class honours in Natural Sciences, the
  Christopher Welch Scholarship and a Junior Research Fellowship at
  Exeter
  College, Oxford, he commenced research on reflexes with
  Sherrington's colleagues. Later from 1928 to 1931 he was research
  assistant to Sherrington, there being eight papers published
  conjointly; and he also collaborated with <a href=
  "../1967/index.html">Ragnar Granit</a> on two research projects.
  He was awarded an Oxford D. Phil. degree in 1929 for a thesis on
  Excitation and Inhibition. Later Oxford appointments were to a
  Staines Medical Fellowship at Exeter College in 1932, a tutorial
  fellowship of Magdalen College, and a University Demonstratorship
  in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  During this Oxford period research was largely on synaptic
  transmission both in the central nervous system and peripherally
  in sympathetic ganglia, smooth and cardiac muscle. Using the
  newly developed techniques of electrophysiology - amplifiers and
  cathode ray oscilloscopes. It was the period of controversy
  between the exponents of the rival chemical and electrical
  theories of synaptic transmission with Eccles in particular
  resisting many aspects of the chemical transmitter story that was
  being developed so effectively by <a href=
  "../1936/index.html">Dale</a> and his colleagues. In retrospect
  it can be appreciated that this controversy had the effect of
  defining problems and stimulating much good experimental work,
  but the decisive victory of the chemical theory had to await the
  intracellular recording both from neuromuscular junctions by Fatt
  and <a href="../1970/index.html">Katz</a> and from nerve cells
  that was made possible by the technique of the microelectrode
  with cathode follower amplification. And now, as a final stage of
  this drama, electrical transmission between nerve cells is being
  demonstrated in many specialized synapses, not only in the
  invertebrate, but also in the vertebrate nervous system. These
  recent developments have served to increase still further the
  assurance with which we can accept the chemical transmitter
  hypothesis for an overwhelming majority of both central and
  peripheral synapses.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937 Eccles left England for Australia to become Director of a
  small medical research unit in Sydney, where he was fortunate to
  have the distinguished collaboration of Bernard Katz and Stephen
  Kuffler. This period from 1937 to 1943 was devoted largely to an
  electrophysiological analysis of the neuromuscular junctions of
  cats and frogs, but in the later years his time was almost
  entirely occupied by applied science related to the war effort.
  Subsequently as Professor of Physiology at the University of
  Otago, New Zealand, from 1944-1951 he returned to synaptic
  transmission in the central nervous system; and in 1951 Brock,
  Coombs and Eccles succeeded for the first time in inserting
  microelectrodes into nerve cells of the central nervous system
  and in recording the electrical responses produced by excitatory
  and inhibitory synapses. This early work was described in the
  Waynflete Lectures of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1952, which in
  1953 were published as <i>The Neurophysiological Basis of Mind:
  The Principles of Neurophysiology</i>. The New Zealand interlude
  was also notable because there Eccles met the philosopher, Karl
  Popper, from whom he learnt the relationship of the scientist to
  hypotheses; how to be daring in developing hypotheses of the
  greatest generality, and at the same time how to test them with
  the utmost rigour with the consequence either of falsification in
  whole or in part, or at best corroboration; but never
  confirmation. He feels that this relationship to hypotheses has
  not only increased his conceptual power, but has also greatly
  helped emotionally! He can now rejoice even in the falsification
  of a cherished theory, because even this is a scientific
  success.<br>
  <br>
  From 1952 until 1966 Eccles was Professor of Physiology of the
  Australian
  National University. In the earlier years (1953-1955) in
  collaboration with Coombs and Fatt, attention was concentrated on
  the biophysical properties of synaptic transmission, which is the
  research that has been cited in the Nobel Award. The conceptual
  basis of these investigations derived particularly from the
  hypotheses of the ionic mechanisms of membrane activity that had
  been developed by <a href="index.html">Hodgkin</a>, <a href=
  "index.html">Huxley</a>, Katz and Keynes in England. In 1955 this
  stage of the investigation was described in the Herter Lectures
  of Johns Hopkins
  University, and was published in 1957 as <i>The Physiology of
  Nerve Cells</i>. Subsequently the ionic sieve hypothesis of
  inhibitory synaptic action developed from that early work has
  been corroborated not only in Canberra by the many associates
  listed in the references of the lecture, but also in several
  other laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  There have been in recent years remarkable advances in the
  powerful microtechniques: electron-microscopy, microelectrode
  recording and micropharmacology. Eccles surveyed all these new
  developments in <i>The Physiology of Synapses</i> in 1964.<br>
  <br>
  However, the nervous system is not simply to be understood as a
  system of synaptic transmissions. The organization of the
  pathways of communication is essential for even the simplest
  explanations of its performance. From 1960-1966 these
  organizational problems dominated the research programs of the
  Canberra laboratory. Soon the problems were studied at the much
  more challenging levels of the brain with investigations firstly
  of the dorsal column nuclei and thalamus, then of the hippocampus
  and finally of the cerebellum. The rationale of these studies is
  to understand the mode of operation of the structural patterns
  that form such a characteristic feature of the aggregations of
  nerve cells in the cerebellum and the hippocampus, for
  example.<br>
  <br>
  From 1966 Eccles continued this research first at the Institute
  of Biomedical Research at Chicago and after 1968 at the State University of
  New York at Buffalo. Progress accounts appeared in two books,
  <i>The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine</i>, published conjointly
  with Professors M. Ito and J. Szent&aacute;gothai as co-authors,
  and <i>The Inhibitory Pathways of the Central Nervous System</i>
  (1969) which are the Sherrington Lectures at the University of
  Liverpool.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to this purely scientific study of the brain, Eccles
  has followed Sherrington in developing a philosophy of the human
  person that is consonant with the whole of brain science. Various
  aspects of this philosophy were developed in lectures and
  broadcast talks, and recently the whole of Eccles' philosophical
  thought has been brought together in a book entitled <i>Facing
  Reality</i> published by Springer in the Heidelberg Science
  Library (1970).<br>

  In 1928 John Carew Eccles married Irene Frances Miller of
  Motueka, New Zealand, and there are nine children; four sons and
  five daughters, of whom the two eldest sons are scientists with
  Ph. D.'s. Rosamond collaborated with her father in much of his
  neurophysiological research, his son Peter is a radar
  meteorologist. Following divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena
  T&aacute;bor&iacute;kov&aacute; of Prague, Czechoslovakia, who is an
  M.D. of Charles University and a neurophysiologist. They
  collaborate in their research.</p>
