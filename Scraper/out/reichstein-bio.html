  <h1>Tadeus Reichstein - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="reichstein.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Tadeus Reichstein</b> was born on July 20th, 1897, at
  Wloclawek, Poland. He was the son of Isidor Reichstein and
  Gastava Brockmann. After passing his early childhood at Kiev,
  where his father was an engineer, Reichstein was educated, first
  at a boarding-school at Jena and later, when his family moved to
  Zurich (where he was naturalized), he first went to a private
  tutor and later to the Oberrealschule (technical school of junior
  college grade) and the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule (E.T.H.)
  (State Technical College).<br>
  <br>
  In 1916 Reichstein passed his school-leaving examination and
  began to study chemistry at the E.T.H. at Zurich, taking his
  diploma there in 1920. He then spent a year in industry and then
  began to work for his doctorate under Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1953/index.html">H. Staudinger</a>. In 1922
  he graduated and then began research under Professor Staudinger
  on the composition of the flavouring substances in roasted
  coffee.<br>
  <br>
  After leaving Professor Staudinger, he continued to work for nine
  years on this subject, being financed for this purpose by an
  industrial firm, who provided him with an assistant. The aroma of
  coffee is, he found, composed of extremely complex substances,
  among which are derivatives of furan and pyrrole, and substances
  containing sulphur. Reichstein published during this period a
  series of papers on these substances and on new methods of
  demonstrating and making them, and also on the aromatic
  substances in chicory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929 he qualified as a lecturer at the E.T.H. Here he lectured
  on organic and physiological chemistry and in 1931, when his work
  on aromatic substances in coffee and chicory ended, he became
  assistant to Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1939/index.html">L. Ruzicka</a> and was
  then able to devote himself exclusively to scientific
  research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1934 he was appointed Titular Professor, in 1937 Associate
  Professor, and in 1938 Professor in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, and
  Director of the Pharmaceutical Institute in the University of Basel.
  In 1946 he took over, in addition, the Chair of Organic Chemistry
  and he held both these appointments until 1950, when a new
  Director of the Pharmaceutical Institute was appointed.<br>
  <br>
  Between the years 1948-1952 he supervised the building and
  equipment of a new Institute of Organic Chemistry, which was
  ready for occupation in 1952, Reichstein becoming its Director in
  1960. He now lives in Basel.<br>
  <br>
  In 1933 Reichstein succeeded, independently of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/index.html">Sir Norman Haworth</a> and
  his collaborators in Birmingham, in synthesizing vitamin C
  (ascorbic acid). Otherwise he has worked on the glycosides of
  plants, and during the years 1953-1954 he worked in collaboration
  with S. A. S. Simpson and J. F. Tait (London), with A. Wettstein
  and R. Neher (Ciba Ltd., Basel), and M. Tausk (N.V. Organon, Oss,
  The Netherlands), and isolated and explained the constitution of
  aldosterone, a hormone of the adrenal cortex, which until then
  had not been isolated. Reichstein also collaborated with <a href=
  "index.html">E. C. Kendall</a> and <a href="index.html">P. S.
  Hench</a> in their work on the hormones of the adrenal cortex
  which culminated in the isolation of cortisone and the discovery
  of its therapeutic value in the treatment of rheumatoid
  arthritis. For this work, Reichstein, Kendall, and Hench were
  jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in
  1950.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 he received the Honorary Doctorate of the Sorbonne,
  Paris, and in 1952 he was elected a Foreign Member of the
  Royal
  Society, London.<br>
  <br>
  Reichstein married Henriette Louise Quarles van Ufford, of Dutch
  nobility, in 1927. They have one daughter.</p>
