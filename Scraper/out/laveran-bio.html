  <h1>Alphonse Laveran - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="laveran.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Charles
  Louis Alphonse Laveran</b> was born in Paris on June 18, 1845 in
  the house which was formerly No. 19 rue de l'Est but later
  became, when this district was rebuilt, an hotel at No. 125,
  Boulevard St. Michel.<br>
  <br>
  Both his father and paternal grandfather were medical men. His
  father, Dr. Louis Th&eacute;odore Laveran, was an army doctor and a
  Professor at the &Eacute;cole de Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, his mother,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gu&eacute;nard de la Tour, was the daughter and
  granddaughter of high-ranking army commanders. When he was very
  young, Alphonse went with his family to Algeria. His father
  returned to France as Professor at the &Eacute;cole de
  Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, of which he became Director with the rank of
  Army Medical Inspector.<br>
  <br>
  Alphonse, after completing his education in Paris at the
  Coll&egrave;ge Saint Baube and later at the Lyc&eacute;e
  Louis-le-Grand, wished to follow his father's profession and in
  1863 he applied to the Public Health School at Strasbourg, was
  admitted there and attended the courses for four years. In 1866
  he was appointed as a resident medical student in the Strasbourg
  civil hospitals. In 1867 he submitted a thesis on the
  regeneration of nerves. In 1870, when the Franco-German war broke
  out, he was a medical assistant-major and was sent to the army at
  Metz as ambulance officer. He took part in the battles of
  Gravelotte and Saint-Privat and in the siege of Metz. After the
  capitulation of Metz, he went back to France and was attached
  first to Lille hospital and then to the St. Martin Hospital in
  Paris. In 1874 he was appointed, after competitive examination,
  to the Chair of Military Diseases and Epidemics at the &Eacute;cole
  de Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, previously occupied by his father. In 1878,
  when his period of office had ended, he was sent to B&ocirc;ne in
  Algeria and remained there until 1883. It was during this period
  that he carried out his chief researches on the human malarial
  parasites, first at B&ocirc;ne and later at Constantine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1882, he went to Rome with the special aim of seeking, in the
  blood of patients who had become infected with malaria in the
  Roman Campagna, the parasites he had found in the blood of
  patients in Algeria. His researches, done at the San Spirito
  Hospital, confirmed him in the opinion that the blood parasites
  that he had described were in fact the cause of malaria. His
  first communications on the malaria parasites were received with
  much scepticism, but gradually confirmative researches were
  published by scientists of every country and, in 1889, the
  Academy of Sciences awarded him the Br&eacute;ant Prize for his
  discovery, which was from that time not disputed, of the malarial
  parasites. In 1884, he was appointed Professor of Military
  Hygiene at the &Eacute;cole de Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce.<br>
  <br>
  In 1894, his period of office as professor having ended, he was
  appointed Chief Medical Officer of the military hospital at Lille
  and then Director of Health Services of the 11th Army Corps at
  Nantes. He had neither a Laboratory nor patients, but he wished
  to continue his scientific investigations. He now held the rank
  of Principal Medical Officer of the First Class and in 1896 he
  entered the Pasteur Institute as
  Chief of the Honorary Service. From 1897 until 1907, he carried
  out many original researches on endoglobular Haematozoa and on
  Sporozoa and Trypanosomes. In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize
  for his work on protozoa in causing diseases and he gave half the
  Prize to found the Laboratory of Tropical Medicine at the Pasteur
  Institute. In 1908 he founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Pathologie
  Exotique, over which he presided for 12 years. He did not abandon
  his interest in malaria. He visited the malarious areas of France
  (the Vend&eacute;e, Camargue and Corsica). He was the first to
  express the view that the malarial parasite must be found,
  outside the human body, as a parasite of Culicidae and, after
  this view had been proved by the patient researches of <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Ronald Ross</a>, he played a large part in
  the enquiry on the relationships between <i>Anopheles</i> and
  malaria in the campaign undertaken against endemic disease in
  swamps, notably in Corsica and Algeria.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1900, he especially studied the trypanosomes and published
  either independently or in collaboration with others, a large
  number of papers on these blood parasites. He successively
  studied: the trypanosomes of the rat, the trypanosomes that cause
  Nagana and Surra, the trypanosome of horses in Gambia, a
  trypanosome of cattle in the Transvaal, the trypanosomiases of
  the Upper Niger, the trypanosomes of birds, Chelonians,
  Batrachians and Fishes and finally and especially the trypanosome
  which causes the terrible endemic disease of Equatorial Africa
  known as sleeping sickness. His work (not completed) on the
  treatment of trypanosomiases and especially on infections with
  <i>Tr.gambiense</i> have already had important results.<br>
  <br>
  To sum up, Laveran did not, for 27 years, cease to work on
  pathogenic Protozoa and the field he opened up by his discovery
  of the malarial parasites has been increasingly enlarged.
  Protozoal diseases constitute today one of the most interesting
  chapters in both medical and veterinary pathology.<br>
  <br>
  Laveran was, in 1893, elected a Member of the Academy of
  Sciences. He also became, in 1912, a Commander of the Legion of
  Honour. During the years 1914-1918, he took part in all the
  committees concerned with the maintenance of the good health of
  the troops, visiting Army Corps, compiling reports and
  appropriate instructions. He was a member, associate or honorary
  member of a vast number of learned societies in France, Great
  Britain, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Rumania, Russia, the
  U.S.A., the Netherlands Indies, Mexico, Cuba and Brazil.<br>
  <br>
  In 1885 he married Mlle. Pidancet. On May 18, 1922, he died after
  an illness lasting several months.</p>
