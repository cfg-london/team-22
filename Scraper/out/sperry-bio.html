  Birthplace and Family: Born August 20,
  1913, in Hartford, Connecticut to Francis Bushnell and Florence
  Kraemer Sperry of Elmwood, a small suburb. Father was in banking;
  mother trained in business school and after dad's death, when I
  was 11 years old, she became assistant to the principal in the
  local high school. One brother, Russell Loomis, a year younger,
  went into chemistry. I was married to Norma Gay Deupree, December
  28, 1949. We have one son, Glenn Michael (Tad), born October 13,
  1953 and one daughter, Janeth Hope, born August 18, 1963.<br>

  Education: My early schooling was in Elmwood, Connecticut and
  William Hall High School in West Hartford, Connecticut. I
  attended Oberlin College on a 4 year Amos C. Miller
  Scholarship. After receiving the AB in English in 1935, I stayed
  on 2 years more in Oberlin for an MA in Psychology, 1937, under
  Professor R. H. Stetson. I then took an additional third year
  at-large at Oberlin to prepare for a switch to Zoology for Ph.D.
  work under Professor Paul A. Weiss at the University of
  Chicago. After receiving the Ph.D. at Chicago in 1941, I did
  a year of postdoctoral research as a National Research Council
  Fellow at Harvard University under Professor Karl S.
  Lashley.<br>
