  <h1>Jack S. Kilby - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kilby.jpg" class="bio-img">The Nobel Committee has asked me to discuss
  my life story, so I guess I should begin at the beginning.</p>

  <p>I was born in 1923 in Great Bend, Kansas,
  which got its name because the town was built at the spot where
  the Arkansas River bends in the middle of the state. I grew up
  among the industrious descendents of the western settlers of the
  American Great Plains.</p>

  <p>My father ran a small electric company that
  had customers scattered across the rural western part of Kansas.
  While I was in high school, a huge ice storm knocked down most of
  the poles that carried the telephone and electric power lines. My
  father worked with amateur radio operators to communicate with
  areas where customers had lost their power and phone service.</p>

  <p>My dad's goal was to do whatever it took to
  run his business and to help people, but I thought that amateur
  radio was a fascinating subject. It sparked my interest in
  electronics, and that's when I decided that this field was
  something I wanted to pursue.</p>

  <p>I also was a fan of broadcast radio. In the
  1940s, I especially enjoyed listening to Big Band music. Even
  today, there's a radio station in Dallas that plays this kind of
  music, and with a little luck, I don't have to listen to much
  else.</p>

  <p>After high school, I studied electrical
  engineering at the University of Illinois. Most of my classes
  were in electrical power, but because of my childhood interest in
  electronics, I also took some vacuum tube engineering physics
  classes.</p>

  <p>I graduated in 1947, just one year before
  Bell Labs announced the invention of the transistor. It meant
  that my vacuum?tube classes were about to be come obsolete, but
  it offered great opportunities to put my physics studies to good
  use.</p>

  <p>In line with the interests that occupied my
  thoughts in Great Bend, I hired on with an electronics
  manufacturer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that made parts for radios,
  televisions and hearing aids.</p>

  <p>While in Milwaukee, I took evening classes
  at the University
  of Wisconsin towards a master's degree in electrical
  engineering. Working and going to school at the same time
  presents some challenges, but it can be done and its well worth
  the effort.</p>

  <p>In 1958, my wife and I moved to Dallas,
  Texas, when I took job with Texas Instruments. TI was the only
  company that agreed to let me work on electronic component
  miniaturization more or less full time, and it turned out to be a
  great fit.</p>

  <p>After proving that integrated circuits were
  possible, I headed teams that built the first military systems
  and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. I also
  worked on teams that invented the handheld calculator and the
  thermal printer, which was used in portable data terminals.</p>

  <p>In 1970 I took a leave of absence from TI
  to do some independent work. While on leave, one of the things I
  worked on was how to apply silicon technology to help generate
  electrical power from sunlight.</p>

  <p>From 1978 to 1984, I spent much of my time
  as a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at
  Texas A&amp;M
  University. The "distinguished" part is in the eye of the
  beholder, and I really didn't do much "professing." However, I
  did have a rewarding time doing research and working with
  students and faculty on various projects.</p>

  <p>I officially retired from TI in the 1980s,
  but I have maintained a significant involvement with the company
  that continues to this day.</p>

  <p>Along the way, I've been honored to receive
  awards such as the National Medal of Science and to be inducted
  into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Seeing your name
  alongside the likes of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and the Wright
  Brothers is a very humbling experience, and I appreciate these
  and the other honors very much.</p>

  <p>Receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics was a
  completely unexpected, yet very pleasant surprise. I had to start
  my pot of coffee very early the morning I received the news that
  I had been chosen.</p>

  <p>It's gratifying to see the committee
  recognize applied physics, since the award is typically given for
  basic research. I do think there's a symbiosis as the application
  of basic research often provides tools that then enhance the
  process of basic research. Certainly, the integrated circuit is a
  good example of that. Whether the research is applied or basic,
  we all "stand upon the shoulders of giants," as Isaac Newton
  said. I'm grateful to the innovative thinkers who came before me,
  and I admire the innovators who have followed.</p>

  <p>Four decades of hindsight is perhaps a
  unique experience among those who have been awarded the Nobel
  Prize in Physics. As I noted in my lecture, there were various
  efforts to solve the electronic miniaturization problem at the
  time I invented the integrated circuit. Humankind eventually
  would have solved the matter, but I had the fortunate experience
  of being the first person with the right idea and the right
  resources available at the right time in history.</p>

  <p>I would like to mention another right
  person at the right time, namely Robert Noyce, a contemporary of
  mine who worked at Fairchild Semiconductor. While Robert and I
  followed our own paths, we worked hard together to achieve
  commercial acceptance for integrated circuits. If he were still
  living, I have no doubt we would have shared this prize.</p>

  <p>Now that I am retired, I still occasionally
  consult on various industry and government projects, mostly in
  the area of semiconductors. I also serve on the board of
  directors of a company or two.</p>

  <p>People often ask me what I'm proud of, and,
  of course, the integrated circuit is at the top of the list. I'm
  also proud of my wonderful family. I have two daughters and five
  granddaughters, so you could say that the Kilbys specialized in
  girls.</p>

  <p>I've reached the age where young people
  frequently ask for my advice. All I can really say is that
  electronics is a fascinating field that I continue to find
  fulfilling. The field is still growing rapidly, and the
  opportunities that are ahead are at least as great as they were
  when I graduated from college. My advice is to get involved and
  get started.</p>
