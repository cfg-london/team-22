  <h1>Cordell Hull - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hull.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Cordell
  Hull</b> (October 2, 1871-July 23, 1955) was born in a log cabin
  in Pickett County, Tennessee, the third of the five sons of
  William and Elizabeth (Riley) Hull. His father was a farmer and
  subsequently a lumber merchant. The only one of the five boys who
  showed an interest in learning, Cordell wanted to be a lawyer. He
  obtained his elementary school training in a one-room school that
  his father himself had built in nearby Willow Grove; then for a
  period of about three years he attended in succession the
  Montvale Academy at Celina, Tennessee, the Normal School at
  Bowling Green, Kentucky, and the National Normal University at
  Lebanon, Ohio. He received a law degree in 1891 after completing
  a one-year course at Cumberland University at Lebanon,
  Tennessee.<br>
  <br>
  Not yet twenty, Hull began the practice of law in Celina, but
  having participated in political campaigning even while a
  student, decided to run for the state legislature as soon as he
  came of age. From 1893 to 1897 he was a member of the Tennessee
  House of Representatives, abandoning politics temporarily to
  serve as captain of the Fourth Tennessee Regiment in the
  Spanish-American War. Hull returned to the practice of law, this
  time in Gainsboro, Tennessee, but in 1903 was appointed judge of
  the Fifth Judicial District. He held this position until 1907,
  earning the nickname &laquo;Judge&raquo;, used even by his wife,
  Rose Frances Whitney, whom he married in 1917.<br>
  <br>
  Elected to Congress from the Fourth Tennessee District in 1907,
  Hull served as a U.S. representative until 1931, interrupted only
  by two years as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In
  his distinguished career in Congress, Hull was a member of the
  powerful House Ways and Means Committee for eighteen years, the
  leader of the movement for low tariffs, the author of the first
  Federal Income Tax Bill (1913), the Revised Act (1916), and the
  Federal and State Inheritance Tax Law (1916), as well as the
  drafter of a resolution providing for the convening of a world
  trade agreement congress at the end of World War I. He became, in
  short, a recognized expert in commercial and fiscal
  policies.<br>
  <br>
  Hull was elected U.S. senator for the 1931-1937 term but resigned
  upon his appointment as secretary of state by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 4, 1933. He
  was sixty-two. In 1944 when he resigned because of ill health, he
  had occupied this important post for almost twelve years, the
  longest tenure in American history.<br>
  <br>
  His debut in this office was not auspicious. He headed the
  American delegation to the Monetary and Economic Conference in
  London in July, 1933, a conference which ended in failure despite
  the parlous state of world prosperity. On the heels of disaster
  came triumph. In November of that year he headed the American
  delegation to the seventh Pan-American Conference, held in
  Montevideo, and there won the trust of the Latin American
  diplomats, laying the foundation for the &laquo;good
  neighbor&raquo; policy among the twenty-one American nations so
  successfully followed up in the Inter-American Conference for the
  Maintenance of Peace held in Buenos Aires (1936), the eighth
  Pan-American Conference in Lima (1938), the second consecutive
  Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics
  in Havana (1940).<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, given authority through the Trade Agreements Act of
  1934, he negotiated reciprocal trade agreements with numerous
  countries, lowering tariffs and stimulating trade.<br>
  <br>
  Hull was responsive, also, to the problems arising in other parts
  of the globe. From 1936 on, foreseeing danger to peace in the
  rise of the dictators, he advocated rearmament, pled for the
  implementation of a system of collective security, supported aid
  short of war to the Western democracies, condemned Japanese
  encroachment into Indo-China, warned all branches of the U.S.
  military well in advance of the attack on Pearl Harbor to prepare
  to resist simultaneous, surprise attacks at various points.
  Although Hull participated in some of the policy making
  conferences of the Allies, his major effort during the later
  stages of World War II was that of preparing a blueprint for an
  international organization dedicated to the maintenance of peace
  and endowed with sufficient legislative, economic, and military
  power to achieve it. Although obliged because of the precarious
  state of his health to resign as secretary of state in late
  November, 1944, Hull nonetheless served as a member of and senior
  adviser to the American delegation to the United Nations Conference
  in San Francisco in 1945.<br>
  <br>
  Hull did not possess the oratorical talent, the stylistic
  finesse, the brilliant charm, or the impressive personality so
  frequently characteristic of the politician who makes his way to
  the front benches. Tall and lean in figure, almost shy in manner,
  earnest and sincere in thought and deed, Hull had the power that
  comes to one who is thoroughly convinced of the rightness of his
  political and economic policies for peace and justice, is capable
  of defending them against all comers, and unwearying in his
  efforts to give them practical form.</p>
