  <h1>Arthur L. Schawlow - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schawlow.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Mount Vernon, New
  York, U.S.A. on May 5, 1921. My father had come from Europe a
  decade earlier. He left his home in Riga to study electrical
  engineering at Darmstadt, but arrived too late for the beginning
  of the term. Therefore, he went on to visit his brother in New
  York, and never returned either to Europe or to electrical
  engineering. My mother was a Canadian and, at her urging, the
  family moved to Toronto in 1924. I attended public schools there,
  Winchester elementary school, the Normal Model School attached to
  the teacher's college, and Vaughan Road Collegiate Institute
  (high school).<br>
  <br>
  As a boy, I was always interested in scientific things,
  electrical, mechanical or astronomical, and read nearly
  everything that the library could provide on these subjects. I
  intended to try to go to the University of Toronto to study radio
  engineering, and my parents encouraged me. Unfortunately my high
  school years, 1932 to 1937, were in the deepest part of the great
  economic depression. My father's salary as one of the many agents
  for a large insurance company could not cover the cost of a
  college education for my sister, Rosemary, and me. Indeed, at
  that time few high school graduates continued their education.
  Only three or four out of our high school class of sixty or so
  students were able to go to a university.<br>
  <br>
  There were, at that time, no scholarships in engineering, but we
  were both fortunate enough to win scholarships in the faculty of
  Arts of the University of Toronto. My sister's was for English
  literature, and mine was for mathematics and physics. Physics
  seemed pretty close to radio engineering, and so that was what I
  pursued. It now seems to me to have been a most fortunate chance,
  for I do not have the patience with design details that an
  engineer must have. Physics has given me a chance to concentrate
  on concepts and methods, and I have enjoyed it greatly.<br>
  <br>
  With jobs as scarce as they were in those years, we had to have
  some occupation in mind to justify college studies. A scientific
  career was something that few of us even dreamed possible, and
  nearly all of the entering class expected to teach high school
  mathematics or physics. However, before we graduated in 1941
  Canada was at war, and all of us were involved in some way. I
  taught classes to armed service personnel at the University of
  Toronto until 1944, and then worked on microwave antenna
  development at a radar factory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1945, graduate studies could resume, and I returned to the
  University. It was by then badly depleted in staff and equipment
  by the effects of the depression and the war, but it did have a
  long tradition in optical spectroscopy. There were two highly
  creative physics professors working on spectroscopy, Malcolm F.
  Crawford and Harry L. Welsh. I took courses from both of them,
  and did my thesis research with Crawford. It was a very rewarding
  experience, for he gave the students good problems and the
  freedom to learn by making our own mistakes. Moreover, he was
  always willing to discuss physics, and even to speculate about
  where future advances might be found.<br>
  <br>
  A Carbide and Carbon Chemicals postdoctoral fellowship took me to
  Columbia
  University to work with Charles H. Townes. What a marvelous
  place Columbia was then, under <a href="../1944/index.html">I.I.
  Rabi's</a> leadership! There were no less than eight future Nobel
  laureates in the physics department during my two years there.
  Working with <a href="../1964/index.html">Charles Townes</a> was
  particularly stimulating. Not only was he the leader in research
  on microwave spectroscopy, but he was extraordinarily effective
  in getting the best from his students and colleagues. He would
  listen carefully to the confused beginnings of an idea, and join
  in developing whatever was worthwhile in it, without ever
  dominating the discussions. Best of all, he introduced me to his
  youngest sister, Aurelia, who became my wife in 1951.<br>
  <br>
  From 1951 to 1961, I was a physicist at Bell Telephone
  Laboratories. There my research was mostly on superconductivity,
  with some studies of nuclear quadrupole resonance. On weekends I
  worked with Charles Townes on our book <i>Microwave
  Spectroscopy</i>, which had been started while I was at Columbia
  and was published in 1955. In 1957 and 1958, while mainly still
  continuing experiments on superconductivity, I worked with
  Charles Townes to see what would be needed to extend the
  principles of the maser to much shorter wavelengths, to make an
  optical maser or, as it is now known, a laser. Thereupon, I began
  work on optical properties and spectra of solids which might be
  relevant to laser materials, and then on lasers.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1961, I have been a professor of physics at Stanford University
  and was chairman of the department of physics from 1966 to 1970.
  In 1978 I was appointed J.G. Jackson and C.J. Wood Professor of
  Physics. At Stanford, it has been a pleasure to do physics with
  an outstanding group of graduate students, occasional
  postdoctoral research associates and visitors. Most especially
  the interaction with Professor Theodor W. Hansch has been
  continually delightful and stimulating. Our technicians, Frans
  Alkemade and Kenneth Sherwin have been invaluable in constructing
  apparatus and keeping it in operation. My secretary for the past
  nineteen years, Mrs. Fred - a Jurian, provides whatever order
  that can be found amidst the chaos of my office. Much of the
  time, my thoughts are stimulated there by the sounds of
  traditional jazz from my large record collection.<br>
  <br>
  My wife is a musician, a mezzo soprano and choral conductor. We
  have a son, Arthur Keith, and two daughters, Helen Aurelia and
  Edith Ellen. Helen has studied French literature at Stanford, the
  Sorbonne, and at the University of California in Berkeley, and is now on
  the staff of Stanford University. Edith graduated from Stanford
  this year with a major in psychology.</p>
