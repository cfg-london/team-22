  <h1>Ernst B. Chain - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chain.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ernst Boris
  Chain</b> was born on June 19, 1906, in Berlin, his father, Dr.
  Michael Chain, being a chemist and industrialist. He was educated
  at the Luisengymnasium, Berlin, where he soon became interested
  in chemistry, stimulated by visits to his father's laboratory and
  factory. He next attended the Friedrich-Wilhelm
  University, Berlin, where he graduated in chemistry in 1930.
  He was from an early age interested in biochemistry and after
  graduation he worked for three years at the Charit&eacute;
  Hospital, Berlin, on enzyme research. In 1933, after the access
  to power of the Nazi regime in Germany, he emigrated to England.
  Here, his first two years were spent working on phospholipids at
  the School of Biochemistry, Cambridge, under the direction of
  <a href="../1929/index.html">Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins</a>,
  for whose personality and scientific ability he came to have a
  great admiration.<br>
  <br>
  In 1935 he was invited to Oxford University where he worked in the Sir William Dunn
  School of Pathology, becoming, in 1936, demonstrator and
  lecturer in chemical pathology. In 1948 he was appointed
  Scientific Director of the International Research Centre for
  Chemical Microbiology at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit&agrave;, Rome. He became
  Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College, University of London, in
  1961, which position he still holds.<br>
  <br>
  His research has covered a wide range of topics in addition to
  those already detailed. From 1935 to 1939 he worked on snake
  venoms, tumour metabolism, the mechanism of lysozyme action and
  the invention and development of methods for biochemical
  microanalysis. In 1939 he began, with <a href="index.html">H. W.
  (now Sir Howard) Florey</a>, a systematic study of antibacterial
  substances produced by micro-organisms. This led to his best
  known work, the reinvestigation of penicillin, which had been
  described by <a href="index.html">Sir Alexander Fleming</a> nine
  years earlier, and to the discovery of its chemotherapeutic
  action. Later he worked on the isolation and elucidation of the
  chemical structure of penicillin and other natural antibiotics.
  Since 1948 his research topics have included carbohydrate-amino
  acid relationship in nervous tissue, a study of the mode of
  action of insulin, fermentation technology, 6-aminopenicillanic
  acid and penicillinase-stable penicillins, lysergic acid
  production in submerged culture, and the isolation of new fungal
  metabolites.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Chain is author or co-author of many scientific papers
  and contributor to important monographs on penicillin and
  antibiotics. He was in 1946 awarded the Silver Berzelius Medal of
  the Swedish Medical Society, the Pasteur Medal of the Institut
  Pasteur and of the Societ&eacute; de Chimie Biologique, and a prize
  from the Harmsworth Memorial Fund. In 1954 he was awarded the
  Paul Ehrlich Centenary Prize; in 1957 the Gold Medal for
  Therapeutics of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London;
  and in 1962 the Marotta Medal of the Societ&agrave; Chimica
  Italiana. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
  1949. He holds honorary degrees of the Universities of Li&egrave;ge, Bordeaux,
  Turin, Paris,
  La Plata,
  Cordoba,
  Brasil, and
  Montevideo, and is a member or fellow of many learned societies
  in several countries: these include the Societ&eacute;
  Philomatique, Paris; the New York Academy of Medicine; the Accademia dei
  Lincei and the Accademia dei XL, Rome; the Acad&eacute;mie de
  M&eacute;dicine, Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, Paris; the Real
  Academia de Ciencias, Madrid; the Weizmann Institute
  of Science, Rehovoth, Israel; the National Institute of
  Sciences, India; the Societ&agrave; Chimica Italiana; and the
  Finnish Biochemical Society.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Commander of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur and Grande
  Ufficiale al Merito della Repubblica Italiana.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Chain married Dr. Anne Beloff in 1948. They have two
  sons, Benjamin and Daniel, and one daughter, Judith. Music is one
