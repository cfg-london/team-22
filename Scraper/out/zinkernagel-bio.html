  <h1>Rolf M. Zinkernagel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="zinkernagel.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in 1944 in Riehen, a village
  near Basel, and spent almost all of my first twenty-five years
  with my family in the same house. My grandfather on my father's
  side had bought this house in 1918 after moving with his family
  from T&uuml;bingen to Basel to become Professor of German
  Literature at the University of Basel. My father grew up in Basel,
  went through the schools there, and studied biology, finishing
  with a thesis under the guidance of Prof. A. Portmann. Portmann
  was an outstanding zoologist-palaeontologist, with a very broad
  perspective on human development seen in an evolutionary context,
  not only anatomically, but also psychologically. With this
  training my father became the first PhD to be employed by the JR
  Geigy AG - one of the former four big pharmaceutical companies in
  Basel - not as a chemist, but as a biologist. This in a way
  heralded a new era of biologically oriented pharmaceutical
  research and development.<br>
  <br>
  My mother grew up in La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the French-speaking
  Jura mountains, raised by parents whose family was in the
  watch-making business and in banking. After moving to Basel, my
  mother became a lab technician and met my father at work. I was
  the middle child of three, my brother Peter, born in 1942, became
  an architect and my younger sister Anne-Marie, born in 1945,
  became a lab technician.<br>
  <br>
  I went through public school in Riehen, then in Basel, to the
  Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliches Gymnasium, the same school
  attended by both my father and father-in-law. Since this school
  didn't teach Latin as a compulsory subject, which was at the time
  still necessary for several disciplines, such as medicine or law,
  I took four years of voluntary Latin as well as the school's more
  mathematically and science-oriented subjects. During that time I
  had a great number of hobbies: I was introduced by a chemist and
  collaborator of my father's - who is also a gifted painter - to
  the prehistory of the Basel region. This was extremely
  interesting, because during the last glacial period this area was
  not covered with ice, so that many sites of the previous
  inter-glacial period have survived. At the same time I also
  attended several handicraft courses, learning cabinet-making and
  smithing, as well as enjoying dancing and going to the mountains
  with the Swiss Alpine Club. My father sent my brother and me on a
  holiday exchange program to England to learn English. I read a
  lot and was allowed to do a fair amount of travelling through
  England, France and the Scandinavian countries, between the ages
  of twelve to sixteen. When I obtained my matura in 1962, I was
  uncertain as to what to study. The two areas I favoured were
  either medicine or chemistry and, because of the greater range of
  choices the medical profession could offer, i.e. research,
  clinical activity, or private practice in the mountains, medicine
  was my target for the next 6 years. I first had to acquire my
  matura in Latin, however, and in parallel with the medical
  studies I also had to do my military service. I somehow managed
  all this by working hard during the first two or three years of
  medical school. During that time I met my wife, Kathrin, who was
  studying in the same class, also at the university of Basel. We
  took our final exams together, which we had prepared with a very
  nice group of four medical students. In November of 1968, two
  weeks after the final board exams, we got married. We had
  originally wanted to go to Africa, where I would have liked to
  work and learn about leprosy. We applied to the WHO in Geneva and other
  international organisations, but we were not accepted because of
  our lack of experience. On the first of January 1969 I began to
  work at the surgery department at one of the hospitals in Basel,
  and Kathrin started at the University of Basel Eye Clinic.
  However, within that first year I somehow became aware that
  surgery might not be the career l should pursue for the rest of
  my life and I started to look around for alternatives. After many
  discussions about my career with several researchers (including
  A. Pletscher, J. Lindenman and many others), to find another
  goal, I applied to the postgraduate course in Experimental
  Medicine at the University of Zurich. To fill in the time between
  surgery and this course, I did some studies on capillary growth
  in the epiphysis of the long bones in the Institute of Anatomy at
  the University of Basel, under the direction of R. Schenk and U.
  Riede. The course in Zurich is a unique institution that is
  financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the state of
  Zurich, it gave some ten medical students from all over
  Switzerland the opportunity to learn more about modern science,
  in particular molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics,
  neurobiology and immunology, and to catch up with what had been
  missed during medical school. Starting in October 1970, I spent
  two years in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Lausanne,
  under the direction of H. Isliker, learning about immunology,
  immuno-chemistry and the frustrations of experimental lab work.
  In Lausanne, I was asked to apply to bacteria a technique that
  had been made popular by T. Brunner and then by J. C. Cerottini,
  the <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay to monitor the destruction of
  the immunological effector functions of host cells. This test
  involved the labelling of cells with a radioactive isotope, to
  monitor the immune mechanism destruction of host cells. The
  process was measured by determining the relative amount of
  radioactivity released from the dying cells. This project proved
  very difficult and did not produce any conclusive result: The
  chromium was not properly absorbed by the bacteria and this
  release assay was therefore not easily feasible. Nevertheless
  some work was accomplished on the role of IgA, which was obtained
  from hyperimmunised cows that release a significant amount of IgA
  into the colostral milk. I was evaluating whether such
  hyperimmune milk products were able to protect in an ileal loop
  model against the entrotoxin-releasing entropathogenic <i>E.
  coli.</i> This confrontation with an infectious disease and the
  potential of immune responses to protect against it, motivated me
  to look for a second postdoc position in the same field.
  Together, Kathrin and I sent about fifty applications to various
  labs throughout the world, including ones in the UK, the USA, and
  in Australia, but we either got no answer back or only negative
  ones. At that time we already had two children and my wife was
  also trying to find a position to pursue her own career as an eye
  doctor.<br>
  <br>
  In 1972, while I was looking around for positions, H. Isliker
  discussed my plans with Professor G. Ada, Head of Department of
  Microbiology of the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra
  at the Australian National University, and with Robert
  Blanden, a professorial fellow at the same institution. G. Ada
  and H. Isliker were working together at the International Union
  Against Cancer in Lyon, and R. Blanden came by to teach at the
  WHO course on immunology at our institution, which was hosting
  the WHO training lab in Lausanne. This juxtaposition opened up
  the possibility that I could join the Department of Microbiology
  in Canberra with the condition that I brought my own salary. The
  post-doctoral fellowship from the Swiss Foundation for Biomedical
  Fellowships granted me 32'000 SFr. per year for two years to go
  to Australia. Fortunately Kathrin did not object to such a
  drastic move with our two small children Christine, 2 1/2 years,
  and Annelies 11 months old. We flew to Canberra in January of
  1973. My plan was to work with R. Blanden on cell-mediated
  immunity against Salmonella and Listeria to learn more about the
  role of cell-mediated versus antibody-dependent immune effector
  mechanisms in these infectious disease models. When we arrived in
  Canberra we were very lucky and happy to find a generous
  infrastructure offered by the Australian National University,
  which provided us with a detached four-room family house within a
  group of some thirty houses lovingly called the "University
  ghetto", in Hughes. It provided an extremely nice and congenial
  environment for students, young and middle-aged post-doctoral,
  pre-doctoral and professorial visitors from all over the world.
  Kathrin soon found a position as a part-time physician at the
  emergency room of the Woden Valley Hospital, the kids found
  access to play-groups and kindergarten, I spent all day in the
  lab studying immunity to infectious diseases and we made many
  friends amongst the Hughes community.<br>
  <br>
  Within the department, the only empty space in the small labs at
  the John Curtin School, was in the lab occupied by <a href=
  "index.html">Peter Doherty</a>. He had arrived as a post-doc from
  Edinburgh at the end of 1971, his interests being mostly in
  inflammatory processes in the brain, particularly in mice with
  the Semliki Forest virus or with lymphocytic choriomeningitis
  virus (LCMV). We started to cooperate on immune responses against
  the LCMV virus; he was tapping the cerebral spine fluid and doing
  the inflammatory and immunopathological analyses in the brains,
  while I was doing the cytotoxicity assays, since I had become
  familiar with them in Lausanne. This collaboration resulted not
  only in the discovery of the MHC restriction, as will be detailed
  in our lectures, but also encouraged me to eventually enrol at
  the age of 28 as a PhD student at ANU. I had two reasons: one,
  obviously, was to add a PhD to the doctorate that I had earned
  with a thesis on the clinical problems of neuritis of the plexus
  brachialis at the University of Basel. The second motivation was
  that the exchange rate of 5.2 Swiss Francs for 1 Australian
  dollar made life rather difficult at the time. The PhD
  scholarship added a welcome 2000 Australian dollars to our
  budget.<br>
  <br>
  The two-and-a-half years in Canberra were particularly successful
  because the group of people that had come together in G. Ada's
  department (including R. Blanden, K. Lafferty, A. Cunningham, P.
  Pletscher, P. McCullagh and many others), was just the right mix
  of investigative, critical if not aggressive, intelligent if not
  inquisitive, humorous if not bitter, and enjoyable minds working
  together and making sure that one's feeling of being right was
  constantly questioned and challenged. Of course, the fact that
  all these people - or at least most - worked with biological
  model situations, either involving infectious diseases or the
  transplantation of organs, made all of us very aware that
  immunology really had to deal with defence in vivo and not with
  artificial antigens in an in vitro setting.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as our first papers were published in <i>Nature</i> I had
  to look around for the next post-doctoral or professional
  situation and was contacted by F. Dixon of the Scripps clinic in
  La Jolla, who was looking for an assistant professor to join
  Scripps to work on cell-mediated immunity of auto-immune mice; he
  had heard from J.C. Cerottini in Lausanne about our work in
  Canberra. I had also approached <a href="../1980/index.html">B.
  Benacerraf</a> at Harvard to find out whether there would be any
  chance of working in his Department of Pathology to continue
  studying infectious disease immunology. At the second
  International Congress of Immunology in Brighton in 1974 P.
  Doherty and I had various opportunities to report on our findings
  of MHC restriction. I met with F. Dixon and B. Benacerraf. After
  several discussions and because I could no longer continue to
  work with the virus in the Boston lab, but also because
  California, the sea and sun seemed attractive, the decision to
  join the lab of F. Dixon in La Jolla was easy.<br>
  <br>
  Our two children were very happy in Canberra and they both spoke
  the most beautiful Australian English. Our second daughter,
  Annelies, however, went through repeated colds and middle ear
  infections, one of them causing a near-lethal Haemophilus
  influenza meningitis, signalling a selected IgA defect (that
  turned out to be transient). On December 9th, 1974 Kathrin gave
  birth to our Australian son, Martin, at Woden Valley Hospital,
  while I was summarising our experiments on MHC-restricted T cell
  recognition during the annual meeting of the Australian Society
  for Immunology assembled in Canberra.<br>
  <br>
  Kathrin moved back to Switzerland in early January 1975 to spend
  a few months with our parents and to get another 6 month's
  training in ophthalmology, while I had to write up my PhD thesis
  and Peter Doherty was sweating to correct my offences to the
  English language. So for another 3 months I finished up several
  studies in the lab in Canberra and then travelled through
  Australia by train and bus. The two following months in
  Switzerland were spent by renovating a 16th century house in the
  Jura mountains with my brother Peter. In early July 1975, we all
  moved to La Jolla with a green card, i.e. as US-immigrants, to
  join the Scripps Clinic of Medical Research. The decision to
  apply for a green card was suggested by F. Dixon not only to
  avoid time restrictions during my stay in the USA but also
  because the prospects for finding an interesting job in
  Switzerland were virtually nil. Work at Scripps started well, not
  least because Alana Althage, one of F. Dixon's technicians, was
  assigned to me. She has been helping me ever since by preparing
  much of the experimental work and by keeping the lab running for
  the past 20 years. I continued studying cell-mediated immunity
  and LCMV. This virus had also been studied for several years at
  Scripps by M.B.A. Oldstone and F. Dixon. We were using
  experimental surgical techniques to evaluate whether or not the
  MHC of the thymus played a role or not in the selection and
  expression of the T cell specificity for self. A series of
  similar data was obtained by experiments done in parallel by M.
  Bevan at the MIT. They resulted in the discovery that the
  MHC-molecules of the thymus dictated the restriction specificity
  of T cells for self-MHC. These results caused major excitement in
  the immunological community because they fitted in nicely with
  what one knew about the role of thymus in T cell maturation as
  originally described by J.F.A.P. Miller in England and in
  Australia.<br>
  <br>
  My wife worked as a voluntary collaborator at the ophthalmology
  clinic at Scripps for about 10 to 20% of her time; she kept her
  medical skills alive, particularly in 1978, when she decided to
  study for - and successfully passed - the US-medical board
  exams.<br>
  <br>
  The University of Zurich had approached me in 1976 to look into
  the possibility of taking over a position that had been freed in
  1975 by Professor G. Zbinden, Head of Toxicology of the
  University and the ETH. This division of Experimental Pathology
  within the Department of Pathology was an attractive chance to go
  back to Switzerland and to start a larger group. Although the
  Medical Faculty of the University of Zurich had voted on a
  finalist for this position sometime in 1977 and had put me in
  first position, it took another two years of tough negotiations
  with the government before we could move in the fall of 1979.
  This required a lot of patience from Kathrin, F. Dixon and all of
  us; the signed contract only arrived about 10 days before the
  planned starting date in Zurich!<br>
  <br>
  For the past 17 years we have lived near Zurich, first in
  Zollikon, and now in Zumikon, in a cosy old house with huge
  woodstoves, a beautiful flower garden and a handy vegetable plot,
  chickens, and an Appenzeller dog. Kathrin finished her
  ophthalmology specialisation in the first few years, then started
  up her own practice. The children adapted reasonably well to
  schools here and are just about to finish medical school.<br>
  <br>
  Work in the lab was difficult at first because we had to organise
  all installations, equipment and animal quarters for infectious
  experiments. This was made much easier when Hans Hengartner, a
  molecular biologist from the ETH, joined the lab; he had spent 4
  years at the Basel Institute of Immunology. In 1978, he
  approached me to plan a possible move together to Zurich. This
  was another lucky event in my life, comparable to the moves to
  Australia and to Scripps; the collaboration with Hans, first in
  the division of Experimental Pathology and subsequently in our
  Institute of Experimental Immunology, as associate - and
  eventually as full professor of both the University and the ETH -
  has been extremely productive, exciting, stimulating,
  straightforward and mutually complementary. Joining our
  molecular, immunological and physiological capabilities and
  expertise has helped to achieve far more than either of us could
  have done alone. Together, we continue to follow viruses in
  infected hosts to find out more about how the host immune system
  functions and how viruses and immune system have co-evolved.</p>
