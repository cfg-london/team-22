  <h1>Clifford G. Shull - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="shull.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on September
  23, 1915 to my parents, David H. and Daisy B. Shull, in the
  section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, known as Glenwood, which
  obviously relates to their selection of my middle name. I was
  preceded by an older sister, Evalyn May, and an older brother,
  Perry Leo, so that I grew up as the baby in the family. Both my
  father and mother had origins in rural, central Pennsylvania, in
  farming sections of Perry County. After moving with his then
  family to the big city, Pittsburgh, my father started a small
  business that evolved into a hardware store and an associated
  home repair service.<br>
  <br>
  My early years of growth were entirely normal and happy ones and
  I had the usual collection of friends and buddies, who were often
  seen on the ball field or on roller skates. Grade schooling was
  nearby, a few blocks from our home, and this led later on to
  junior high school in the adjoining Hazelwood section but still
  within walking distance of our home. Following this, I had
  decided to go to Schenley High School for the remaining three
  years of school work and this required a more troublesome commute
  of 45 minutes by public street car. My first interest in physics
  as a career speciality came during my senior year at Schenley
  when I took the physics course taught by Paul Dysart. Somewhat
  older than the usual high school teacher and with a PhD degree in
  his background, he was a very impressive teacher who delighted in
  demonstrations from his laboratory and in explaining the
  principles behind them. Thereafter my original interest in
  aeronautical engineering was in heavy competition with physical
  science.<br>
  <br>
  It seemed natural, in view of limited family financial straights,
  that I should continue into college study by living at home and
  commuting to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie
  Mellon University). Carnegie Tech was also located in the
  Schenley Park district of Pittsburgh so that essentially the same
  commute was called for and it offered good, reputable curricula
  in the engineering and physical sciences. I was pleased when
  offered admission to the fall term of 1933 and particularly so
  when given a half-tuition scholarship in view of my good high
  school record. Once there, my interest in physics as a major
  subject sharpened quckly, helped along no doubt by the brilliant
  lectures in my freshman physics course given by Harry Hower, the
  chairman of the Physics Department. Hower was more aptly labeled
  an optical and illuminating engineer than a physicist, because of
  his extensive consulting activities in coastal lighthouse lens
  design and other architectural problems, but his lectures were
  delightful, inspiring and not often-to-be-missed by his
  students.<br>
  <br>
  Shortly after my admission at Carnegie Tech, a family crisis
  developed when my father died unexpectedly in January, 1934. By
  this time, my sister had married and, with her husband, were
  living at home along with my brother (who had just finished
  college as an art major), my mother and myseelf. My brother
  decided to forego his art teaching and operate my father's
  business and this continued until I had finished Carnegie Tech in
  1937. The four years spent there were entirely pleasurable ones,
  in spite of the time-consuming commute, and I enjoyed the
  association with my fellow students and professors in the
  department. I was able to work in the summer periods at jobs both
  on and off campus and this helped to meet my rather minimal
  expenses during the year. Among the professors, I valued very
  much the friendly encouragement and counsel offered by Emerson
  Pugh during my junior and senior years, leading to my continuance
  into graduate school at New York University in the fall of
  1937.<br>
  <br>
  New York University was then a very large university, perhaps the
  largest in the nation, with several distributed, more or less
  autonomous, campuses. I was located with the Physics Department
  at the University Heights campus in the upper Bronx section of
  New York City and my teaching assistantship provided living
  subsistence, teaching meaning laboratory course help and problem
  assignment grading. We graduate students were encouraged at an
  early stage to join and help in one of the half dozen or so
  ongoing research projects within the department. I became
  associated with a nuclear physics group headed by Frank Myers and
  Robert Huntoon, who were in the process of building a 200 keV
  Cockcroft-Walton generator for accelerating deuterons. Much
  valuable experience was obtained with this exposure by Craig
  Crenshaw, another graduate student, and myself and we were able
  to help in the initial experiment with this accelerator, a study
  of the D-D nuclear reaction.<br>
  <br>
  During the third year of my graduate study, the Department
  decided that it could support the construction of a new 400 keV
  Van de Graaff generator to be used for accelerating electrons.
  Frank Myers took on this responsibility with me as his assistant
  and the thought that it could be used to repeat the
  electron-double-scattering (EDS) experiment as a possible thesis
  topic for me. This EDS type of experiment loomed important at the
  time because it was considered a direct test that electrons have
  a spin or polarization. Several earlier experiments had given
  either negative or inconclusive results and it seemed worthwhile
  that the experiment be performed again under new conditions. The
  construction and testing of the new facility went smoothly and I
  turned to getting ready for my thesis EDS experiment. By this
  time, Frank Myers had decided to take his overdue sabbatical
  leave with Robert Van de Graaff at MIT. I was fortunate in
  getting Richard Cox, a senior professor in the department, to
  supervise and offer expert and friendly advice on my efforts.
  Finally after four months of data collection and analysis, the
  experiment was successful and I was able to prepare a thesis and
  take my PhD degree in June 1941.<br>
  <br>
  Among the other research programs being pursued by the NYU
  department was the study of neutron interactions with materials
  as started by Alan Mitchell and carried on by Martin Whitaker.
  Using a Ra-Be neutron source surrounded by a paraffin howitzer, a
  modest beam of thermalized neutrons was available for
  experimentation and, during my period at the Heights, this was
  directed towards a search for the expected paramagnetic
  scattering from certain materials. Theoretical prediction of this
  had been given by O. Halpern and M. Johnson and their students in
  the Department. I was familiar with this problem through my
  contemporary graduate student William Bright who worked with
  Whitaker on the experiment and indeed found myself working on the
  same problem a decade later.<br>
  <br>
  I have neglected to mention an important event that occurred in
  my first year in New York City. Through my good friend Craig
  Crenshaw, I was introduced to a young lady, Martha-Nuel Summer,
  who had recently come from South Carolina to the graduate school
  at Columbia University to study early American History. Our
  friendship flourished during the years of our professional
  studies and we married shortly after I took my degree and had a
  job in waiting. She has remained my loving companion to the
  present and along the way we have been favored by three fine
  sons, John, Robert and William, who have beautiful families of
  their own.<br>
  <br>
  I had arranged for a position at Beacon, NY with the research
  laboratory of The Texas Company, and Martha and I set up
  housekeeping there in July 1941. This laboratory addressed
  problems associated with the production and use of petroleum
  fuels and lubricants and included a small group of physicists. I
  was asked to study the microstructure of catalysts using gas
  adsorption and x-ray diffraction and scattering as tools for
  characterizing the physical structure of these materials. These
  catalysts were used in the production of high-performance
  aviation fuel and this area of investigation became increasingly
  important after the US entry in the World War in December 1941.
  Of singular significance to the scientific community in the first
  year of our wartime activity was the growth of the Manhattan
  Project dealing with the development of an atomic weapon. Many
  scientists had been drawn into this, including a number of my old
  colleagues and professors from graduate school. I was encouraged
  to join them and would have done so except that The Texas Company
  would not agree to my wartime job change. The matter was finally
  settled in their favor by an adjudication hearing at an area
  manpower board and I stayed in Beacon through the war
  years.<br>
  <br>
  My work at Beacon was interesting and challenging and gave me the
  opportunity of learning things about diffraction processes,
  crystallography and the new field of solid state physics. Through
  visits and early meetings of the American Society for X-ray and
  Electron Diffraction, I was able to know established personages
  such as Warren, Buerger, Fankuchen, Zachariasen, Ewald, Harker,
  Gingrich and Donnay. Once the war was over, my interest in
  participating in the exciting new developments in nuclear physics
  within the Manhattan Project returned, and I paid a visit to the
  Clinton Laboratory (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in
  Tennessee. The activity there fascinated me very much and I
  convinced Martha that we should move there, which we did in June
  1946 along with our one and a half year old son.<br>
  <br>
  It was arranged that I would work with Ernest Wollan, who had
  been at the Laboratory since its formation during the war period
  and who had just assembled a rudimentary two-axis spectrometer
  for obtaining neutron diffraction patterns of crystals and
  materials. Wollan had shown me his first powder diffraction
  pattern on my earlier visit and I was delighted to be able to
  join him in exploring how neutron patterns could be used to
  supplement those obtained with x-rays or electrons. Our
  collaboration on common problems was to continue for nearly a
  decade until I left Oak Ridge in 1955 for academic life at
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I regret very much that
  Wollan's death in 1984 precluded his sharing in the Nobel honor
  that has been given to Brockhouse and me since his contributions
  were certainly deserving of recognition.<br>
  <br>
  I was attracted to MIT by the prospects of teaching and of
  training graduate research students at the soon-to-be-completed
  MITR-I research reactor on campus. This reactor was among the
  early group of condensed volume reactors using isotopically
  enriched fuel which were being explored in that period. Together
  with occasional post-doctoral students and a regular flow of
  graduate thesis students, our group carried on investigations
  using neutron radiation from this reactor in many fields until my
  retirement from MIT in 1986. These studies included: internal
  magnetization in crystals, development of polarized beam
  technology, dynamical scattering in perfect crystals,
  interferometry, and fundamental properties of the neutron. The
  opportunity of being at MIT with its fine faculty and excellent
  students has certainly been most stimulating and satisfying.</p>
