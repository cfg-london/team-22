  <h2>The Central Control of the Activity of Internal Organs</h2>

  <p>A recognized fact which goes back to the
  earliest times is that every living organism is not the sum of a
  multitude of unitary processes, but is, by virtue of
  interrelationships and of higher and lower levels of control, an
  unbroken unity. When research, in the efforts of bringing
  understanding, as a rule examines isolated processes and studies
  them, these must of necessity be removed from their context. In
  general, viewed biologically, this experimental separation
  involves a sacrifice. In fact, quantitative findings of any
  material and energy changes preserve their full context only
  through their being seen and understood as parts of a natural
  order. This implies that the laws governing organic cohesion, the
  organization leading from the part to the whole, represent a
  biological uncertainty, indeed an uncertainty of the first order.
  It becomes all the more acute, the more rapidly the advances of
  specialization develop and threaten the ability to grasp, or even
  to appreciate it. While this state of affairs has just been
  referred to, our subject is defined by its general content. In
  particular it deals with the neural mechanisms by which the
  activity of the internal organs is adapted to constantly changing
  conditions, and by which they are adjusted to one another, in the
  sense of interrelated systems of functions. It only remains to be
  added that broadening of our knowledge in these respects is of
  benefit not only with regard to the human compulsion to
  understand, but also to the practical healing art. For man also,
  in health and sickness, is not just the sum of his organs, but is
  indeed a human organism.</p>

  <p>After this short introduction, we now come
  on to the concrete complex of questions, to which has been
  devoted the work whose results have earned me this great
  distinction and have thus brought me into this high circle. The
  initial situation is defined by the findings, which have now been
  turned to the common good, concerning the morphological and
  physical structure of the so-called vegetative - "autonomic" in
  English usage - nervous system. This was - I believe - a good
  start, and was brought about by the achievements of the great
  masters W.H. Gaskell and J.N. Langley, and had been given shape
  in an easily comprehensible and stimulatingly graphic exposition
  by the distinguished pharmacologists H.H. Meyer and R. Gottlieb.
  Of particular interest here in this conception, for which there
  is good experimental confirmation, is the paired antagonistic
  innervation of the internal organs, and their grouping according
  to the separate regions in which the peripheral organization is
  linked to the central nervous system. (The keywords
  <i>sympathetic</i> and <i>parasympathetic</i> characterize the
  relationships under consideration.) In contrast to the
  exploration of the vegetative nervous system, which is very
  far-reaching (even if it is not still without certain inner
  contradictions) stands a relatively limited understanding of the
  central organization of the whole mechanism of control. This is
  not easily understood, because the informative experiments must
  explore a segment in which elements are also assembled and
  integrated, which subserve special sensory functions and the
  movement of the body. Things that are distributed over a wide
  area in the body itself, lie close together in the central
  nervous system. Correspondingly an unequivocal differentiation is
  disproportionately more difficult. The direct contiguity of
  functionally multivalent pathways and nuclei confuses the
  experimental elucidation of related symptoms. One thing had
  nevertheless become clear, namely that the parts of the brain
  communicating directly with the spinal cord at the upper end -
  the medulla oblongata, and the segment lying directly beneath the
  cerebrum, the so-called diencephalon - exert a decisive influence
  on the vegetative controlling mechanisms. As regards the
  diencephalon further orientation had been achieved to the extent
  that it was realized that the parts of it lying nearest the base
  of the skull, i.e. the <i>hypothalamus</i>, were particularly
  important to the nature of the whole enquiry. Observations at the
  sickbed in conjunction with what was ascertained in the deceased
  at autopsy, and in addition experiments which provided some rough
  pointers, had led to this insight (Karplus and Kreidl <i>et
  a</i>l.). Something which still, however, lay in obscurity, when
  my own investigations were started, was the allocation of
  definite functions to particular morphological substrata, was, in
  other words, the organic structure of the diencephalic vegetative
  control system. To throw as much light as possible on this was
  the task which I set myself.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of all experimental work
  stands the choice of the appropriate technique of investigation.
  In many cases it has first to be created; it was so here as well.
  Although the method used to produce the results was of decisive
  importance, it can only be gone into in outline here. In the
  first place, satisfaction of two requirements was decisive, these
  two being a condition of the special circumstances in the central
  nervous system, which have been described: one concerns the
  technical devices, which were taken practically to the limits of
  refinement; the other is related to securing the minimum
  obstruction to the experimental animal's modes of expression. We
  would like to emphasize these two, because in these particulars
  American investigators, whose merit is beyond doubt (especially
  Ranson and Magoun), have followed another path, beset with
  various avoidable experimental errors. But, here as there,
  fundamental to the investigations lay the same principle which
  enables to obtain information, if one wishes to explore the
  layers and connections which lie below a surface: one applies
  "probes". In our case, artificial foci of excitation were
  produced with electrical impulses, and their effects noted. In
  addition, the technique of localized exclusion was also applied;
  as with disease foci, the reactions of this on the behaviour were
  interpreted in terms of disappearance of symptoms and were linked
  indirectly to the functional significance of the excluded
  substrata.</p>

  <p>If I had thought, by observing the effects
  of artificial electrical stimuli in small doses on some dozen or
  so experimental animals with altogether some hundred points of
  stimulation distributed over the diencephalon, to achieve in due
  course the looked-for elucidation, then the first result was a
  thorough disappointment. The only positive finding which could be
  drawn from the first series, was the conclusion that the
  relationships obviously had a more complicated lay-out than had
  been thought, for the effects were so varied that no obedience to
  any law could be discovered. To meet this situation, the
  experiments had to be carried out on a considerably expanded
  basis. This was a simple enough conclusion; its realization was a
  different matter. It must be born in mind that one does not see
  directly - as is the case in the exploration of the surface of
  the brain - where the electrodes are attacking. Exact information
  about the functional significance of the deep sections of the
  brain is only obtained by working through the brain
  histologically in serial section. To avoid far too great delays,
  the experiments must be fitted in together as it were in time,
  and it is only possible to keep the material collected under
  control by using a carefully organized system of registration.
  The difficulty of finding one's way around in the abundance of
  individual observations was overcome by a graphic method. The
  extension of the experiments on the widest basis means time. To
  this is added the expenditure - for Swiss circumstances - of
  considerable funds. I make these last references on the one hand
  to make the slow growth of knowledge comprehensible, and on the
  other to be able to thank the various Swiss Foundations and above
  all the Rockefeller Foundation of New York for their financial
  support.</p>

  <p>This short outline of the method of working
  brings us to the question of the results. As we go into these,
  certain motor effects, although they merit great interest, must
  be left on one side.</p>

  <p>Now, concerning the influence of the
  diencephalon on the activity of the internal organs, the
  following facts could be disclosed: first of all, it has turned
  out that the functions which are mediated by the sympathetic
  section of the vegetative nervous system, are related to the
  posterior and middle parts of the deepest section of the
  hindbrain, i.e. of the hypothalamus. So the latter is to be
  considered, as it were, as the central area of origin of the
  sympathetic system. In order to give this discovery its full
  physiological import, some more elucidation is required. The goal
  of physiological research is functional nature. So in the course
  of this preoccupation with the vegetative nervous system, among
  other things the question has arisen of whether a circumscribed
  role is associated with the classical sympathetic system, which
  is defined primarily in terms of its area of origin, which is
  restricted to the thoracic spinal cord. An investigation
  undertaken from the viewpoint of the effect of its activity has
  yielded the finding that this is the case to a considerable
  extent. Where the sympathetic intervenes, it assists the body's
  efficiency and it aids the organism to greater success in its
  conflicts with its environment. It is functional, in so far as it
  behaves like an ergotropic or dynamogenic system. In addition to
  this item of knowledge there are still more findings which will
  interest the psychiatrist in particular, but also everyone who
  realizes that behind the variety of types of phenomenon stands
  the unity of the organism. On stimulation within a circumscribed
  area of the ergotropic (dynamogenic) zone, there regularly occurs
  namely a manifest change in mood. Even a formerly good-natured
  cat turns bad-tempered; it starts to spit and, when approached,
  launches a well-aimed attack. As the pupils simultaneously dilate
  widely and the hair bristles, a picture develops such as is shown
  by the cat if a dog attacks it while it cannot escape. The
  dilation of the pupils and the bristling hairs are easily
  comprehensible as a sympathetic effect; but the same cannot be
  made to hold good for the alteration in psychological behaviour.
  For this, only connections between hypothalamus, thalamus and
  cerebral cortex come into consideration. Functionally, the total
  behaviour of the animal illustrates the fact that, in the part of
  the diencephalon indicated, a meaningful association of
  physiological processes takes place, which is related on the one
  hand to the regulation of the internal organs, and on the other
  involves the functions directed outwards towards the environment.
  In other words: we know the key position in the diencephalon
  which has one aspect directed inwards and one aspect directed
  outwards. The sympathetic system is thereby, within the framework
  of a far-reaching organization, the mediating agent which
  intervenes particularly in the activity of the internal
  (vegetative) organs. With regard to the manifest influence of the
  psychomotor system and the psychological processes of
  association, a bridge is thrown over a gap, still wide open
  today, which lies between the purely somatically oriented
  physiology and psycho-physiology. It completes and broadens the
  insight into psychosomatic relationships, in the way they had
  been demonstrated by the great Russian physiologist Pavlov, who
  approached them from another side. To him also fell the great
  honour of speaking from this position.</p>

  <p>In spite of the necessary restrictions on
  our exposition, observations of a different kind will induce us
  briefly to touch on the theme of somato-motor phenomena once
  again. Before this, another striking finding must be reported.
  The individual, vegetatively innervated, organ gets its
  differentiated innervation in the known peripheral organization
  of the sympathetic ergotropic system; correspondingly it can also
  be brought into action in isolation. This fact and the
  relationships, as they are met with, for example in the
  projection of the peripheral organs reacting to nervous
  stimulation in the motor area of the cerebral cortex, could give
  grounds for supposing that the individual internal organs also
  have a discrete representation in the diencephalon. In such an
  order of things the ergotropic zone would also be organized as it
  were by organs. The experimental findings offer proof that in
  reality the relationships are disposed differently. The fact is
  that even the most narrowly circumscribed forms of excitation and
  the most delicate stimulus dose never bring to light an isolated
  symptom related to one organ. In every case a group
  symptomatology makes its appearance. It is always groups of
  organs that are called into action, and indeed in such a way that
  the individual effects are combined, namely in accordance with
  the principle of synergistic coordination. Controls issue from
  the diencephalon which harness the functional capacities of
  individual organs in viable responses. This order of things holds
  good quite markedly in the ergotropic zone.</p>

  <p>But under the influence of circumscribed
  stimuli applied to the hypothalamus, and partly also to the
  layers of the thalamus lying close above it, symptoms have also
  appeared which do not permit of classification in the
  sympathetic-ergotropic system of functions, and indeed rather act
  in opposition to this. The blood pressure, for example, does not
  respond by a rise, but by a fall; the heart rate does not
  increase, but rather decreases. At the same time respiration
  slows down, as opposed to the speeding-up which is obtained from
  the ergotropic-dynamogenic zone. Often a profuse flow of saliva
  occurs; further symptoms are choking and vomiting, micturition,
  defaecation. In other cases panting is caused, i.e. the mechanism
  most often seen in the dog under natural conditions, when it is
  hot. While the tongue, with its rich blood supply, moistened by a
  copious flow of saliva, hangs out of the wide-open mouth with the
  flow of air due to rapid respiration streaming over it, the
  discharge of excess heat takes place. This function, which is
  also common to the cat, serves the regulation of temperature and
  is in this sense equivalent to sweating (e.g. in man) when heat
  accumulates. Another effect of stimulation not mentioned so far
  is constriction of the pupils, followed by a drawing-across of
  the nictitating membrane.</p>

  <p>To summarize, we are dealing with symptoms
  which are characteristic of a decrease in the influence due to
  the sympathetic system, and of an increase of parasympathetically
  transmitted excitation. Regarding the physiological effect, such
  reactions bring functional relaxation to the individual organs,
  or protection against overloading, but indeed protection above
  all. Where the digestive processes are concerned, the complex
  serving restoration is mediated by separate mechanisms. Since we
  give these related effects a common denominator in their
  functional aspect, the term "trophotropic system" is appropriate.
  Moreover the experimental findings show that a circumscribed
  region of the diencephalon corresponds to it, namely the anterior
  part of the hypothalamus, the area praeoptica, and the septum
  pellucidum as well. With this, a central, fairly clearly
  demonstrable division of the two partners of the vegetative
  nervous system becomes manifest. This is all the more noteworthy,
  as they are most intimately interwoven in their peripheral
  terminal territories. Important, too, is the establishment that
  there is no evidence in the trophotropic zone of a central
  organization corresponding to particular organs. It emerges
  conclusively from the effects obtained from the most varied sites
  of stimulation falling in the area named that here too no
  grouping is found in contrast, for example in the formation of
  nuclei; each particular syndrome shows a fairly large scatter.
  This does not, however, conceal the fact that some effects are
  preferentially released from certain larger areas. It is
  different in this respect from the ergotropic zone, where the
  group organization is more consistent.</p>

  <p>We take a step forward, when we turn our
  attention to the observations from which it emerges that
  reciprocal mutual connections operate between the
  sympathetic-ergotropic and the parasympathetic-trophotropic
  areas, indeed in the sense that at each moment they produce a
  dynamic equilibrium adapted to the situation at any given moment
  of the organism as a whole. In this equilibrium the unity of the
  central regulation of the whole vegetative system is expressed.
  In the broad view, competition is a constructive principle!</p>

  <p>With this statement, we could conclude our
  exposition, that is, if we wanted to confine it to a more
  narrowly conceived theme. But among the fundamental results of
  the experimental exploration of the diencephalons alone was the
  finding that the effects produced from this part of the brain are
  not restricted to the vegetative system. Indeed the rule is that
  they are associated with somatomotor symptoms. When I refer to
  this, I do not have in mind the functions which testify to a
  higher order regulation of bodily posture within the framework of
  the extra-pyramidal motor system. What we are discussing here
  concerns the motor symptomatology which stands in a specific
  relationship to the vegetative function. This is where our
  interest lies, if we attend briefly to this state of affairs. So
  let us look at a new stage in the integration of the organ
  functions in the total performance. In this way, for example, we
  can understand the experimental finding, that in many cases where
  the stimulus applied to the diencephalon causes defaecation, this
  is not brought about simply by peristalsis of the colon and
  rectum. In particular, where a stimulus is applied to the most
  rostrally situated regions, the cat adopts the normal posture for
  the physiological deposition of faeces; therefore the stimulus
  activates the skeletal musculature, which is innervated by the
  cerebrospinal axis, and which is also responsible for the
  abdominal muscular pressure. It was possible to make the same
  observation during micturition. The synergistic coordination
  between the function released through the vegetative nervous
  system and the somatomotor complement is manifest. An improvement
  in the result is obtained, partly in the form of a speeding-up of
  the process, and partly in the way soiling is avoided.</p>

  <p>Particularly impressive is the synergistic
  coordination of mechanisms controlled by the vegetative nervous
  system with cerebrospinal innervated activities in the defence
  mechanism which is accompanied by emotion. This had already been
  the subject of discussion, but without any particular light being
  thrown on the structure of the action as a whole in relation to
  the systematic involvement of somatomotor phenomena. Dilation of
  the pupils, bristling of the hair are the vegetative components,
  and snuffling and spitting as somatomotor processes complete the
  picture intended to scare off the opponent. The aimed blow with
  the paw conclusively presupposes a visual orientation, which,
  while compulsive in affect, nevertheless fits in adaptively
  because of the intervention of the cortex. Thus one sees how the
  various levels make their contribution to the full success of a
  complete activity, and one understands how individual functions
  are associated in stages in an activity carried out by the
  organism as a whole.</p>

  <p>According to this view of how the
  diencephalon plays a decisive role in activity which progresses
  from the part to the whole, it will come as no surprise if still
  other observations could be made which lead in another direction.
  Thus it has been seen that under defined experimental conditions
  a constriction of the pupil and a drawing-across of the
  nictitating membrane may be caused from a certain region of the
  diencephalon. A slowly developing narrowing of the palpebral
  fissure accompanies these events, which reflect a decrease in the
  sympathetic innervation, which - particularly in the pupil -
  occurs with an increase in parasympathetic influence. These
  effects also are not infrequently associated with certain
  symptoms under the nervous control of the central nervous system:
  the drooping of the upper eyelid develops into an active closing
  of the lid. Simultaneously the head droops, whereupon, as the
  syndrome develops further, the whole animal lies down. It is
  necessary to observe this process accurately in its development
  and in the final stage; it will be noticed, as you will realize,
  that the cat does not simply collapse, as is the case with
  generalized loss of tone. Under the influence of gradual
  relaxation the animal choses its place and curls up. Altogether a
  picture results like that known under physiological conditions
  only in the sleeping cat. In a certain sense one is presented
  with the mirror-image of the emotionally aroused cat with
  increased excitability; for the readiness to react to sensory
  stimuli is markedly decreased, whereby - as in the normal
  sleeping cat - the tickle reflex of the ear stays "awake".
  Behaviour towards olfactory stimuli is also relatively little
  inhibited, which are effective as a more potent arousal stimulus,
  thereby proving the reversibility of the whole process. In other
  respects, as has been mentioned, the preparedness for energetic
  activity is reduced to a minimum. Clearly, in the competition
  between ergotropic and trophotropic systems the former forfeits
  some of its influence on the organism as a whole in favour of an
  excess of the latter. But it must always be borne in mind that we
  are dealing with the result of artificial stimulation, and indeed
  in a limited area. To explain the gradual development of this
  inhibition of activity as the result of destruction in the
  hypothalamus is misleading. On the other hand it is correct that
  one is dealing with a protective function controlled from the
  diencephalon, which avoids exhaustion and produces the conditions
  for an undisturbed recovery. The latter - judging by the
  physiological sleep - particularly concerns the higher centres.
  For the rest, as regards the where and the why,
  electroencephalography, e.g. in the line of research by Jasper,
  and biochemistry have the say in the matter now. So the
  investigations, which have been reported here, have, as is the
  rule, in addition to a clear understanding also brought into
  focus the formulation of new questions.</p>

  <p>Now that we have come full cycle with the
  investigation in which the integrating activity of the
  diencephalon was experimentally differentiated, I would very much
  like to show some more pictures, with which the spoken word will
  be clarified. The time available, of course, permits only a
  limited selection of slides and a film. But I think they are
  enough to provide an objective representation of what has been
  said.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>1. The following were shown, as <i>lantern
  slides</i>: rise in blood pressure, fall in blood pressure,
  increase of respiration, slowing of respiration; in the
  <i>film</i>: methodology - dilation of pupils, retraction of the
  nictitating membrane, defaecation, retching, panting - licking
  movements, chewing movements, sniffing movements - affective
  reactions: spitting, bristling of hair, leaping to attack, urge
  to eat, urge to flee - atonia as an effect of stimulation -
  adynamia as an effect of exclusion - sleep as the effect of
  stimulation.<br>
  <br>
  2. The following localizing findings were presented: medium
  section of the cat's brain and further sagittal sections with
  symbols marked in (lowering blood pressure, raising blood
  pressure, pupil dilation, pupil constriction, affective defence,
  hunger drive).</p>
