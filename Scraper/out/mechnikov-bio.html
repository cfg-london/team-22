  <h1>Ilya Mechnikov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mechnikov.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ilya
  Ilyich Mechnikov</b> was born on May 15, 1845*, in a village near
  Kharkoff in Russia. He was the son of an officer of the Imperial
  Guard, who was a landowner in the Ukraine steppes. His mother,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nevakhowitch, was of Jewish origin.<br>
  <br>
  Mechnikov went to school at Kharkoff and was, even when he was a
  little boy, passionately interested in natural history, on which
  he used to give lectures to his small brothers and to other
  children. He was at that time especially interested in botany and
  geology. When he left school he went to the University of
  Kharkoff to study natural sciences, and worked there so hard that
  he was able to complete the four year course in two years.
  Graduating at Kharkoff, he went, first to study marine fauna at
  Heligoland, and then to the University of Giessen, where he worked under
  Leuckart. Subsequently he went to the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen and the Munich Academy, where he worked in von
  Siebold's laboratory. While he was at Giessen, he discovered, in
  1865, intracellular digestion in one of the flatworms, an
  observation which was to influence his later discoveries. At
  Naples he prepared a thesis for his Doctorate on the embryonic
  development of the cuttle-fish <i>Sepiola</i> and the Crustacean
  <i>Nelalia</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1867 he returned to Russia, having been appointed docent at
  the new University of Odessa and from there he went to take up a
  similar appointment at the University of St. Petersburg. But in
  1870 he was appointed Titular Professor of Zoology and
  Comparative Anatomy at the University of Odessa.<br>
  <br>
  At St. Petersburg he met his first wife, Ludmilla Feodorovitch,
  who suffered from tuberculosis so severe that she had to be
  carried to church in a chair for the wedding. For five years
  Mechnikov did all he could to save her life, but she died on
  April 20, 1873. Broken by this loss, troubled by weak eyesight
  and heart troubles and by difficulties in the University,
  Mechnikov became, at this time, so pessimistic that he tried to
  take his own life by swallowing a large dose of opium; but,
  fortunately for himself and for the world, he did not die. It was
  in Odessa, in fact, that he met his second wife, Olga, whom he
  married in 1875. In 1880 his second wife had a severe attack of
  typhoid fever and, although she did not die, Mechnikov, whose
  health was still poor, again tried to take his own life. This
  time, however, he decided, in order to save his wife and others
  embarrassment, to do this by means of the scientific experiment
  of inoculating himself with relapsing fever to find out whether
  it was transmissible by the blood. The attack of relapsing fever
  that followed was severe, but it did not kill him.<br>
  <br>
  In 1882, after his recovery from this disease, Mechnikov resigned
  his appointment at Odessa because of difficulties in the
  University during the period of reactionary government which
  followed the assassination of Alexander II.<br>
  <br>
  He then went to Messina to continue, in a private laboratory he
  set up there; his work on comparative embryology, and it was here
  that he discovered the phenomenon of phagocytosis with which his
  name will always be associated. This discovery was made when
  Mechnikov observed, in the larvae of starfishes, mobile cells
  which might, he thought, serve as part of the defences of these
  organisms and, to test this idea, he introduced into them small
  thorns from a tangerine tree which had been prepared as a
  Christmas tree for his children. Next morning he found the thorns
  surrounded by the mobile cells, and, knowing that, when
  inflammation occurs in animals which have a blood vascular
  system, leucocytes escape from their blood vessels, it occurred
  to him that these leucocytes might take up and digest bacteria
  that get into the body.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to Odessa, Mechnikov visited Vienna on the way and
  explained his ideas to Claus, Professor of Zoology there and it
  was Claus who suggested the term <i>phagocyte</i> for the mobile
  cells which act in this way. Ultimately in 1883, Mechnikov gave,
  at Odessa, his first paper on phagocytosis. Apart from its
  fundamental importance in immunology, the discovery had a marked
  influence on Mechnikov himself. It completely changed his outlook
  on life; he abandoned his pessimistic philosophy and determined
  to find further proof of his hypothesis.<br>
  <br>
  Some proof of it he found in the small fresh-water Crustacean
  <i>Daphnia</i>, in which he found that fungal spores which
  attacked it were themselves attacked by the phagocytes of the
  crustacean. He then studied anthrax bacilli and found that the
  more virulent strains of these were not attacked by the
  phagocytes, while the less virulent strains were.<br>
  <br>
  During this period Mechnikov had been appointed Director of an
  Institute established in 1886 in Odessa to carry out Pasteur's
  vaccine treatment of rabies, but there was much local hostility
  to this treatment. Mechnikov found that, partly because he was
  not a medical man, circumstances became so difficult that, in
  1888, he left Odessa and went to Paris to ask Pasteur for his
  advice. Pasteur gave him a laboratory and an appointment in the
  Pasteur Institute. Here he remained for the rest of
  his life.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from his work on phagocytosis, Mechnikov had, during his
  earlier period of scientific activity, published many papers on
  the embryology of invertebrates. These included work on the
  embryology of insects, published in 1866, and, in 1886, his
  studies of the embryology of Medusae. At the Pasteur Institute in
  Paris Mechnikov was engaged in work associated with the
  establishment of his theory of cellular immunity, which, like
  many great advances in science, encountered considerable
  hostility. He published, during this period, several papers and
  two volumes on the comparative pathology of inflammation (1892),
  and his treatise entitled <i>L'Immunit&eacute; dans les Maladies
  Infectieuses</i> (Immunity in infectious diseases, 1901). In 1908
  he was awarded, together with <a href="index.html">Paul
  Ehrlich</a>, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to this work he, together with Roux, proved that
  syphilis can be transmitted to monkeys. Later he took up the
  study of the flora of the human intestine and developed a theory
  that senility is due to poisoning of the body by the products of
  certain of these bacteria. To prevent the multiplication of these
  organisms he proposed a diet containing milk fermented by bacilli
  which produce large amounts of lactic acid and for a time this
  diet became widely popular.<br>
  <br>
  Mechnikov received many distinctions, among which were the
  honorary D. Sc. of the University of Cambridge, the Copley Medal of the
  Royal Society of which he was a Foreign Member, the honorary
  memberships of the Academy of Medicine in Paris, and the
  Academies of Sciences and of Medicine in St. Petersburg. In
  addition, he was a corresponding member of several other
  societies and a Foreign Member of the Swedish Medical
  Society.<br>
  <br>
  Photographs taken of him when he was working at the Pasteur
  Institute show him with long hair and an unkempt beard. It is
  said of him that at this time he usually wore overshoes in all
  weathers and carried an umbrella, his pockets being overfull with
  scientific papers, and that he always wore the same hat, and
  often, when he was excited, sat on it.<br>
  <br>
  From 1913 onwards Mechnikov began to suffer from heart attacks
  and, although he rallied for a time and recovered from the
  distress which the 1914-1918 War caused him, he died on July 15,
  1916.</p>
