  <h1>Arthur Harden - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="harden.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Arthur Harden</b> was born in
  Manchester, England, on October 12, 1865; his father was Albert
  Tyas Harden and his mother Eliza Macalister. He was educated at a
  private school in Victoria Park (1873-1877) and at Tettenhall
  College, Staffordshire (1877-1881). He entered The Owens College
  in the University
  of Manchester in 1882, studying under Sir H.E. Roscoe, and
  graduated in 1885 with first-class honours in chemistry. In 1886
  he was awarded the Dalton Scholarship in Chemistry and he spent
  twelve months during 1887-1888 working with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1973/index.html">Otto Fischer</a> at Erlangen. He
  returned to Manchester as lecturer and demonstrator, and remained
  until 1897 when he was appointed chemist to the newly founded
  British Institute of Preventive Medicine, which later became the
  Lister Institute. In 1907 he was appointed Head of the
  Biochemical Department, a position which he held until his
  retirement in 1930, and in 1912 he received the title of Emeritus
  Professor of Chemistry, University of London. He continued his scientific
  work at the Institute after his retirement.<br>
  <br>
  Before he went to London, Harden had studied the action of light
  on mixtures of carbon dioxide and chlorine. He entered the
  Institute with an excellent chemical background and applied his
  methods to the investigation of biological phenomena (among
  others: the chemical action of bacteria and alcoholic
  fermentation). He studied the breakdown products of glucose but
  he was soon to be drawn to the problem of the chemistry of the
  yeast cell. His classic study of the chemistry of the
  fermentation of sugar by yeast juice, which have advanced the
  knowledge of the processes of intermediary metabolism in all
  living forms, lasted for many years and provided a stepping-stone
  for many research workers in allied fields. Harden himself
  contributed to the vitamin field with a series of papers on the
  antiscorbutic and antineuritic vitamins and their occurrence in
  food and drinks.<br>
  <br>
  Harden was Joint Editor (with W.M. Bayliss) of <i>The Biochemical
  Journal</i> from 1913 to 1938, and, in addition wrote numerous
  papers in scientific journals. He is the author of <i>Alcoholic
  Fermentation</i>, <i>A New View of the Origin of Dalton's Atomic
  Theory</i>, and <i>Chemistry for Advanced Studies</i> (with Sir
  H.E. Roscoe), <i>Inorganic Chemistry for Advanced Students</i>,
  and <i>An Elementary Course of Practical Organic Chemistry</i>
  (with F.C. Garrett).<br>
  <br>
  Harden was knighted in 1926. He was honorary Doctor of Science,
  University of Athens and honorary Doctor of Laws, Universities of
  Manchester
  and Liverpool. A Fellow of the Royal Society (1909), he
  received the Davy Medal in 1935.<br>
  <br>
  He married Georgina Sydney Bridge, daughter of C. Wynyard Bridge
  of Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1900. They had no children. His
  wife died in January, 1928, and Sir Arthur on June 17, 1940, at
  his home in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.</p>
