  <h1>Gabriel Lippmann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lippmann.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Gabriel Lippmann</b> was born
  of French parents at Hollerich, Luxembourg on August 16, 1845.
  The family moved to Paris and he received his early education at
  home. In 1858 he entered the Lyc&eacute;e Napoleon and ten years
  later he was admitted to the &Eacute;cole Normale. His school career was not
  markedly successful, for he concentrated only on the work which
  interested him and neglected that which did not appeal to his
  taste, and he failed the examination which would have qualified
  him as a teacher. In 1873, he was appointed to a Government
  scientific mission visiting Germany to study methods for teaching
  science: he worked with K&uuml;hne and Kirchhoff in Heidelberg and
  with Helmholtz in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  Lippmann joined the Faculty of Science in Paris in 1878 and in
  1883 he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics. Three
  years later he became Professor of Experimental Physics,
  succeeding Jamin, and he was appointed Director of the Research
  Laboratory which was subsequently transferred to the Sorbonne. He
  retained this position until his death.<br>
  <br>
  Lippmann, of original and independent mind, made many valuable
  fundamental contributions to many different branches of physics,
  especially electricity, thermodynamics, optics and
  photochemistry. In Heidelberg he studied the relationship between
  electrical and capillary phenomena: this led to the development,
  amongst other instruments, of his extraordinarily sensitive
  capillary electrometer.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Lippmann had evolved the general theory of his process
  for the photographic reproduction of colour in 1886 but the
  practical execution presented great difficulties. However, after
  years of patient and skilful experiment, he was able to
  communicate the process to the Academy of Sciences in 1891,
  although the photographs were somewhat defective due to the
  varying sensitivity of the photographic film. In 1893, he was
  able to present to the Academy photographs taken by A. and L.
  Lumi&egrave;re in which the colours were produced with perfect
  ortho-chromatism. He published the complete theory in 1894.<br>
  <br>
  In 1895, Lippmann evolved a method of eliminating the personal
  equation in measurements of time, using photographic
  registration, and he studied the eradication of irregularities of
  pendulum clocks, devising a method of comparing the times of
  oscillation of two pendulums of nearly equal period. He
  contributed to astronomy with his invention of the coelostat, a
  device which immobilizes the image of a star and its surrounding
  stars so that a photograph may be taken. He was also responsible
  for many more ingenious devices and improvements to standard
  instruments to the benefit of many branches of physics.<br>
  <br>
  His work is mainly recorded in communications to the Paris
  Academy of Sciences where his papers are noted for their
  conciseness and originality. His method of reproducing colours in
  photography, based on the interference phenomenon, gained him the
  Nobel Prize for Physics for 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Lippmann became a member of the Academy of Sciences in
  1886 and served as its President in 1912. He was a member of the
  Board of the Bureau des Longitudes and a Foreign Member of the
  Royal Society of London.<br>
  <br>
  In 1888 Lippmann married the daughter of the writer V.
  Cherbuliez, member of the French Academy.<br>
  <br>
  He died at sea on July 13, 1921, during his return from a journey
  to North America as a member of a mission headed by Marshal
  Fayolle.</p>
