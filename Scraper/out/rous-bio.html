  <h1>Peyton Rous - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rous.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Peyton Rous</b> was born in Baltimore in
  1879. His mother's ancestors were Huguenots who settled in
  Virginia after the Edict of Nantes. Just before the Civil War in
  the 1860's her father, foreseeing disaster, bought land in Texas,
  moving his big family there after it ended. There he became a
  judge &laquo;riding three counties&raquo;, and the family
  throve.<br>
  <br>
  His father, a Baltimorean of English forebears, married his
  mother while visiting Texas, and returning home became an
  exporter of grain to Europe. His father died early, leaving his
  mother with three small children and only scanty means to support
  them. Yet she would not return to the security of her Texas kin
  because she was bent on obtaining the best possible education for
  her children; and what with makeshifts of one sort or another in
  Baltimore she did it!<br>
  <br>
  During his second year in the Johns Hopkins
  Medical School - after getting a B.A. from its University in
  1900 - Peyton Rous scraped the skin of a finger on a tuberculous
  bone while doing an autopsy and soon a &laquo;corpse
  tubercle&raquo; formed there. The disease travelled to his
  axillary glands, and after their removal he was told no more
  could be done than &laquo;to go away and try to get well&raquo;.
  Peyton Rous went to Texas, there an uncle got him a job &laquo;for
  his keep&raquo; on a ranch near Quanah; and in early spring a
  friend living in the town told him he was sending &laquo;two
  covered wagons&raquo; full of hardware to the Spur Ranch, 125
  miles west of the railway, and asked if Peyton would like to go
  along with them. On reaching &laquo;The Spur&raquo; Peyton Rous was
  given the job of helping on horseback in the &laquo;round
  ups&raquo; of cattle scattered on its huge expanse, and of course
  he slept on the ground like everyone. During exhilarating months
  there Peyton learned a superb fact not taught at college, namely
  that uneducated men can be as great-hearted and lovable as those
  who know much. This has been a continual source of cheer to him
  ever since.<br>
  <br>
  Back at the Medical School after having lost (!) a year, he
  graduated in 1905 and became an interne in its Hospital. Then,
  finding himself unfit to be a &laquo;real doctor&raquo;, he turned
  to medical research instead, and for this purpose became an
  Instructor in Pathology at the University of Michigan on a beggarly salary.
  His work in the laboratory turned out to be mainly that of a
  technician because the University had small funds only, but with
  noble generosity Professor Alfred Warthin, head of the
  Department, came to his rescue, actually offering to &laquo;teach
  Summer School&raquo; in his stead, and give Peyton the sum thus
  earned, if he would study German hard and use the money to go for
  the summer to a certain hospital in Dresden where morbid anatomy
  was taught. Dresden in 1907! Exquisite city in an exquisite land,
  with no hint of war in the air!<br>
  <br>
  After his return Dr. Warthin told Peyton Rous that the Rockefeller
  Institute for Medical Research was casting a wide net of
  grants for beginners, and he asked him if Peyton would like him
  to apply for one that would free Peyton for experimental work.
  That grant enabled Rous to find out enough about lymphocytes to
  be deemed worth publishing in the <i>Journal of Experimental
  Medicine</i>, edited by Simon Flexner, who was also the director
  of the Institute; and after another few months Flexner asked Rous
  to take over the laboratory for cancer research which Flexner was
  quitting to learn more about poliomyelitis, then crippling many
  American children.<br>
  <br>
  Since these happenings in 1909 the life of Peyton Rous as a
  working scientist has been halcyon. Soon after beginning it he
  was able to prove that some &laquo;spontaneous&raquo; chicken
  tumours, to all appearances classical neoplasms, are actually
  started off and driven by viruses which determine their forms as
  well. These findings led him to spend several years trying to get
  similar agents from mouse cancers; but, failing in this, he left
  off working with tumours in 1915, turning instead to the study of
  other problems in physiological pathology. The results of the
  study encouraged Rous to undertake further efforts in the same
  field, and he did not return to the theme of cancer until 1934
  when a unique opportunity was offered to him. Dr. Richard Shope,
  a close friend on the Institute staff, asked Rous to work with a
  virus which Shope had discovered and found to be responsible for
  the giant warts often present on the skin of wild rabbits in the
  southwestern U.S.A. Were they perhaps real tumours? Rous could
  not resist this generous challenge and he has worked ever since
  not only with the &laquo;warts&raquo; themselves - which proved to
  be benign tumours from which cancers frequently take off - but
  with other problems of neoplasms.<br>
  <br>
  Investigation on cancer means more to the public than that on any
  other disease. It may be partly for that reason that Rous has
  received more than a few honours and awards. Many universities
  have given him honorary degrees. He is a Foreign Member of the
  Royal
  Society of England, as also of its Royal Society of Medicine,
  and that of Denmark, and the Norwegian Academy of Science and
  Letters. The Weizmann Institute of Science has appointed Rous an
  Honorary Fellow and the Academy of Medicine in Paris a Foreign
  Correspondent. The Kovalenko Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, and the Distinguished
  Service Award of the American Cancer Society were given to him. Rous also
  received a Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association, as also a
  United Nations
  Prize for Cancer Research; and during 1966 a National Medal of
  Science has come to him from the U S.A., and the Paul
  Ehrlich-Ludwig Darmst&auml;dter Award from the Federal Republic
  of Germany.<br>
  <br>
  In 1920 Peyton Rous became a Member of the Rockefeller Institute,
  and in 1945, when 65 years old, he became a Member Emeritus but
  continued to be busy in the laboratory as was the case until his
  death. Recently the Rockefeller Institute has become the
  Rockefeller University. It supported the work of Rous as amply as
  was his good fortune in the past.<br>
  <br>
  Peyton Rous married Marion Eckford deKay; she was the daughter of
  a scholarly commentator on the arts. They brought to each other
  different likings that have delightfully widened the enjoyment of
  their lives together. They have three daughters: Marion, Ellen
  and Phoebe. Marion's husband, <a href="../1963/index.html">Alan
  Hodgkin</a> is a Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge University
  and received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963.
  Phoebe married Thomas J. Wilson who died in 1969; he was formerly
  Director of the Harvard University Press.</p>

  <p>Dr Peyton Rous* died on the 16th of
  February, 1970.</p>

  <p class="smalltext">* In this biography, which is based on Rous's own autobiographical 
              note, nothing has been said about the work on blood and liver which 
              occupied him between 1915 and 1934. In particular Rous has not mentioned 
              the pioneer research on blood transfusion with J.R. Turner and O.H. 
              Robertson which led to the establishment in 1917 of the world's 
              first blood bank near the front line in Belgium.</p>
