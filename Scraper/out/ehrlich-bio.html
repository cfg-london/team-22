  <h1>Paul Ehrlich - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="ehrlich.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Paul Ehrlich</b> was born on March 14,
  1854 at Strehlen, in Upper Silesia<a href="#footnote">*</a>,
  Germany. He was the son of Ismar Ehrlich and his wife Rosa
  Weigert, whose nephew was the great bacteriologist Karl
  Weigert.<br>
  <br>
  Ehrlich was educated at the Gymnasium at Breslau and subsequently
  at the Universities of Breslau, Strassburg, Freiburg-im-Breisgau
  and Leipzig. In 1878 he obtained his doctorate of medicine by
  means of a dissertation on the theory and practice of staining
  animal tissues. This work was one of the results of his great
  interest in the aniline dyes discovered by W. H. Perkin in
  1853.<br>
  <br>
  In 1878 he was appointed assistant to Professor Frerichs at the
  Berlin Medical Clinic, who gave him every facility to continue
  his work with these dyes and the staining of tissues with them.
  Ehrlich showed that all the dyes used could be classified as
  being basic, acid or neutral and his work on the staining of
  granules in blood cells laid the foundations of future work on
  haematology and the staining of tissues.<br>
  <br>
  In 1882 Ehrlich published his method of staining the tubercle
  bacillus that <a href="../1905/index.html">Koch</a> had
  discovered and this method was the basis of the subsequent
  modifications introduced by Ziehl and Neelson, which are still
  used today. From it was also derived the Gram method of staining
  bacteria so much used by modern bacteriologists.<br>
  <br>
  In 1882 Ehrlich became Titular Professor and in 1887 he
  qualified, as a result of his thesis <i>Das
  Sauerstoffbed&uuml;rfnis des Organismus</i> (The need of the
  organism for oxygen) as a Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer or
  instructor) in the Faculty of Medicine in the University of
  Berlin. Later he became an Associate Professor there and Senior
  House Physician to the Charit&eacute; Hospital in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  In 1890 Robert Koch, Director of the newly established Institute
  for Infectious Diseases, appointed Ehrlich as one of his
  assistants and Ehrlich then began the immunological studies with
  which his name will always be associated.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of 1896 an Institute for the control of therapeutic
  sera was established at Steglitz in Berlin and Ehrlich was
  appointed its Director. Here he did further important work on
  immunology, especially on haemolysins. He also showed that the
  toxin-antitoxin reaction is, as chemical reactions are,
  accelerated by heat and retarded by cold and that the content of
  antitoxin in antitoxic sera varied so much for various reasons
  that it was necessary to establish a standard by which their
  antitoxin content could be exactly measured. This he accomplished
  with <a href="../1901/index.html">von Behring</a>'s
  antidiphtheritic serum and thus made it possible to standardize
  this serum in units related to a fixed and invariable standard.
  The methods of doing this that Ehrlich then established formed
  the basis of all future standardization of sera. This work and
  his other immunological studies led Ehrlich to formulate his
  famous side-chain theory of immunity.<br>
  <br>
  In 1897 Ehrlich was appointed Public Health Officer at
  Frankfurt-am-Main and when, in 1899, the Royal Institute of
  Experimental Therapy was established at Frankfurt, Ehrlich became
  its Director. He also became Director of the Georg Speyerhaus,
  which was founded by Frau Franziska Speyer and was built
  next-door to Ehrlich's Institute. These appointments marked the
  beginning of the third phase of Ehrlich's many and varied
  researches. He now devoted himself to chemotherapy, basing his
  work on the idea, which had been implicit in his doctorate thesis
  written when he was a young man, that the chemical constitution
  of drugs used must be studied in relation to their mode of action
  and their affinity for the cells of the organisms against which
  they were directed. His aim was, as he put it, to find chemical
  substances which have special affinities for pathogenic
  organisms, to which they would go, as antitoxins go to the toxins
  to which they are specifically related, and would be, as Ehrlich
  expressed it, &laquo;magic bullets&raquo; which would go straight
  to the organisms at which they were aimed.<br>
  <br>
  To achieve this, Ehrlich tested, with the help of his assistants,
  hundreds of chemical substances selected from the even larger
  number of these that he had collected. He studied, among other
  subjects, the treatment of trypanosomiasis and other protozoal
  diseases and produced trypan red, which was, as his Japanese
  assistant Shiga showed, effective against trypanosomes. He also
  established, with A. Bertheim, the correct structural formula of
  atoxyl, the efficiency of which against certain experimental
  trypanosomiases was known. This work opened a way of obtaining
  numerous new organic compounds with trivalent arsenic which
  Ehrlich tested.<br>
  <br>
  At this time, the spirochaete that causes syphilis was discovered
  by Schaudinn and Hoffmann in Berlin, and Ehrlich decided to seek
  a drug that would be effective especially against this
  spirochaete. Among the arsenical drugs already tested for other
  purposes was one, the 606th of the series tested, which had been
  set aside in 1907 as being ineffective. But when Ehrlich's former
  colleague Kitasato sent a pupil of his, named Hata, to work at
  Ehrlich's Institute, Ehrlich, learning that Hata had succeeded in
  infecting rabbits with syphilis, asked him to test this discarded
  drug on these rabbits. Hata did so and found that it was very
  effective.<br>
  <br>
  When hundreds of experiments had repeatedly proved its efficacy
  against syphilis, Ehrlich announced it under the name
  &laquo;Salvarsan&raquo;. Subsequently, further work on this subject
  was done and eventually it turned out that the 914th arsenical
  substance to which the name &laquo;Neosalvarsan&raquo; was given,
  was, although its curative effect was less, more easily
  manufactured and, being more soluble, became more easily
  administered. Ehrlich had, like so many other discoverers before
  him, to battle with much opposition before Salvarsan or
  Neosalvarsan were accepted for the treatment of human syphilis;
  but ultimately the practical experience prevailed and Ehrlich
  became famous as one of the main founders of chemotherapy.<br>
  <br>
  During the later years of his life, Ehrlich was concerned with
  experimental work on tumours and on his view that sarcoma may
  develop from carcinoma, also on his theory of athreptic immunity
  to cancer.<br>
  <br>
  The indefatigable industry shown by Ehrlich throughout his life,
  his kindness and modesty, his lifelong habit of eating little and
  smoking incessantly 25 strong cigars a day, a box of which he
  frequently carried under one arm, his invariable insistence on
  the repeated proof by many experiments of the results he
  published, and the veneration and devotion shown to him by all
  his assistants have been vividly described by his former
  secretary, Martha Marquardt, whose biography of him has given us
  a detailed picture of his life in Frankfurt. In Frankfurt the
  street in which his Institute was situated was named Paul
  Ehrlichstrasse after him, but later, when the Jewish persecution
  began, this name was removed because Ehrlich was a Jew. After the
  Second World War, however, when his birth-place, Strehlen, came
  under the jurisdiction of the Polish authorities, they renamed it
  Ehrlichstadt, in honour of its great son.<br>
  <br>
  Ehrlich was an ordinary, foreign, corresponding or honorary
  member of no less than 81 academies and other learned bodies in
  Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France,
  Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, ltaly, The Netherlands,
  Norway, Roumania, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, the U.S.A. and
  Venezuela. He held honorary doctorates of the Universities of
  Chicago, G&ouml;ttingen,
  Oxford, Athens and Breslau, and was also
  honoured by Orders in Germany, Russia, Japan, Spain, Roumania,
  Serbia, Venezuela, Denmark (Commander Cross of the Danebrog
  Order), and Norway (Commander Cross of the Royal St. Olaf
  Order).<br>
  <br>
  In 1887 he received the Tiedemann Prize of the Senckenberg
  Naturforschende Gesellschaft at Frankfurt/Main, in 1906 the
  Prize of Honour at the XVth International Congress of Medicine at
  Lisbon, in 1911 the Liebig Medal of the German Chemical Society, and in 1914
  the Cameron Prize of Edinburgh. In 1908 he shared with
  Metchnikoff the highest scientific distinction, the Nobel
  Prize.<br>
  <br>
  The Prussian Government elected him Privy Medical Counsel in
  1897, promoted him to a higher rank of this Counsel in 1907 and,
  in 1911, raised him to the highest rank, Real Privy Counsel with
  the title of Excellency.<br>
  <br>
  Ehrlich married, in 1883, Hedwig Pinkus, who was then aged 19.
  They had two daughters, Stephanie (Mrs. Ernst Schwerin) and
  Marianne (Mrs. Edmund Landau).<br>
  <br>
  When the First World War broke out in 1914 he was much distressed
  by it and at Christmas of that year he had a slight stroke. He
  recovered quickly from this, but his health which had never,
  apart from a tuberculous infection in early life which had made
  it necessary for him to spend two years in Egypt, failed him, now
  began to decline and when, in 1915, he went to Bad Homburg for a
  holiday, he had, on August 20 of that year, a second stroke which
  ended his life.</p>
