  <h1>Linus Pauling - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pauling.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Linus Carl Pauling</b> was born in
  Portland, Oregon, on 28th February, 1901, the son of a druggist,
  Herman Henry William Pauling, who, though born in Missouri, was
  of German descent, and his wife, Lucy Isabelle Darling, born in
  Oregon of English-Scottish ancestry.<br>
  <br>
  Linus attended the public elementary and high schools in the town
  of Condon and the city of Portland, Oregon, and entered the
  Oregon State College in 1917, receiving the degree of B.Sc. in
  chemical engineering in 1922. During the years 1919-1920 he
  served as a full-time teacher of quantitative analysis in the
  State College, after which he was appointed a Teaching Fellow in
  Chemistry in the California Institute of Technology and was a
  graduate student there from 1922 to 1925, working under Professor
  Roscoe G. Dickinson and Richard C. Tolman. In 1925 he was awarded
  the Ph.D. (<i>summa cum laude</i>) in chemistry, with minors in
  physics and mathematics.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1919 his interest lay in the field of molecular structure
  and the nature of the chemical bond, inspired by papers by
  <a href="../1932/index.html">Irving Langmuir</a> on the
  application of the Lewis theory of the sharing of pairs of
  electrons between atoms to many substances. In 1921 he suggested,
  and attempted to carry out, an experiment on the orientation of
  iron atoms by a magnetic field, through the electrolytic
  deposition of a layer of iron in a strong magnetic field and the
  determination of the orientation of the iron crystallises by
  polishing and etching the deposit, and microscopic examination of
  the etch figures. With Professor Dickinson, he began in 1922 the
  experimental determination of the structures of some crystals,
  and also started theoretical work on the nature of the chemical
  bond.<br>
  <br>
  Since his appointment to the Staff of California Institute of
  Technology, Professor Pauling was elected Research Associate in
  1925; National Research Fellow in Chemistry, 1925-1926; Fellow of
  the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, 1926-1927 (through
  this last he worked in European Universities with Sommerfeld,
  <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schr&ouml;dinger</a>, and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a>); Assistant
  Professor of Chemistry, 1927-1929; Associate Professor,
  1929-1931; Professor, 1931, when he was the first recipient of
  the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry - the
  Langmuir Prize - and Chairman of the Division of Chemistry and
  Chemical Engineering, and Director of the Gates and Crellin
  laboratories of Chemistry, 1936-1958. In 1963, he was awarded the
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1962/index.html">Nobel Peace
  Prize</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Pauling is a member of numerous professional societies in the
  U.S.A. as well as in many European countries, India, Japan and
  Chile. Awards, medals, and honorary degrees were showered upon
  him in America and Europe, and in addition he was elected
  Rationalist of the Year for 1960 and Humanist of the Year for
  1961. Several books have come from his pen, ranging from his most
  famous one <i>The Nature of the Chemical Bond, and the Structure
  of Molecules and Crystals</i> (1939, 1949, 1960) via <i>General
  Chemistry</i> (1947, 1953), which was translated into nine
  languages, to <i>No More War!</i> (1958, 1959,1962).<br>
  <br>
  The subjects of the papers he published reflect his great
  scientific versatility: about 350 publications in the fields of
  experimental determination of the structure of crystals by the
  diffraction of X-rays and the interpretation of these structures
  in terms of the radii and other properties of atoms; the
  application of quantum mechanics to physical and chemical
  problems, including dielectric constants, X-ray doublets,
  momentum distribution of electrons in atoms, rotational motion of
  molecules in crystals, Van der Waals forces, etc.; the structure
  of metals and intermetallic compounds, the theory of
  ferromagnetism; the nature of the chemical bond, including the
  resonance phenomenon in chemistry; the experimental determination
  of the structure of gas molecules by the diffraction of
  electrons; the structure of proteins; the structure of antibodies
  and the nature of serological reactions; the structure and
  properties of hemoglobin and related substances; abnormal
  hemoglobin molecules in relation to the hereditary hemolytic
  anemias; the molecular theory of general anesthesia; an
  instrument for determining the partial pressure of oxygen in a
  gas; and other subjects.<br>

  Pauling married Ava Helen Miller of Beaver Creek, Oregon, in
  1923. She is of English-Scottish and German descent. They have
  four children, Linus (Carl) Jr. (1925), Peter Jeffress (1931),
  Linda Helen (1932) and Edward Crellin (1937), and thirteen
  grandchildren.</p>
