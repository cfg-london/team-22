  <h1>Subramanyan Chandrasekhar - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chandrasekhar.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Lahore (then a part
  of British India) on the 19th of October 1910, as the first son
  and the third child of a family of four sons and six daughters.
  My father, Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar, an officer in
  Government Service in the Indian Audits and Accounts Department,
  was then in Lahore as the Deputy Auditor General of the
  Northwestern Railways. My mother, Sita (ne&eacute; Balakrishnan)
  was a woman of high intellectual attainments (she translated into
  Tamil, for example, Henrik Ibsen's <i>A Doll House</i>), was
  passionately devoted to her children, and was intensely ambitious
  for them.<br>
  <br>
  My early education, till I was twelve, was at home by my parents
  and by private tuition. In 1918, my father was transferred to
  Madras where the family was permanently established at that
  time.<br>
  <br>
  In Madras, I attended the Hindu High School, Triplicane, during
  the years 1922-25. My university education (1925-30) was at the
  Presidency College. I took my bachelor's degree, B.Sc. (Hon.), in
  physics in June 1930. In July of that year, I was awarded a
  Government of India scholarship for graduate studies in Cambridge, England. In
  Cambridge, I became a research student under the supervision of
  Professor R.H. Fowler (who was also responsible for my admission
  to Trinity
  College). On the advice of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Professor P.A.M. Dirac</a>,
  I spent the third of my three undergraduate years at the Institut f&ouml;r Teoretisk
  Fysik in Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
  I took my Ph.D. degree at Cambridge in the summer of 1933. In the
  following October, I was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity
  College for the period 1933-37. During my Fellowship years at
  Trinity, I formed lasting friendships with several, including Sir
  Arthur Eddington and Professor E.A. Milne.<br>
  <br>
  While on a short visit to Harvard University (in Cambridge,
  Massachusetts), at the invitation of the then Director, Dr.
  Harlow Shapley, during the winter months (January-March) of 1936,
  I was offered a position as a Research Associate at the
  University of Chicago by Dr. Otto Struve and President Robert
  Maynard Hutchins. I joined the faculty of the University of
  Chicago in January 1937. And I have remained at this
  University ever since.<br>
  <br>
  During my last two years (1928-30) at the Presidency College in
  Madras, I formed a friendship with Lalitha Doraiswamy, one year
  my junior. This friendship matured; and we were married (in
  India) in September 1936 prior to my joining the University of
  Chicago. In the sharing of our lives during the past forty-seven
  years, Lalitha's patient understanding, support, and
  encouragement have been the central facts of my life.<br>
  <br>
  After the early preparatory years, my scientific work has
  followed a certain pattern motivated, principally, by a quest
  after perspectives. In practise, this quest has consisted in my
  choosing (after some trials and tribulations) a certain area
  which appears amenable to cultivation and compatible with my
  taste, abilities, and temperament. And when after some years of
  study, I feel that I have accumulated a sufficient body of
  knowledge and achieved a view of my own, I have the urge to
  present my point of view, ab initio, in a coherent account with
  order, form, and structure.<br>
  <br>
  There have been seven such periods in my life: stellar structure,
  including the theory of white dwarfs (1929-1939); stellar
  dynamics, including the theory of Brownian motion (1938-1943);
  the theory of radiative transfer, including the theory of stellar
  atmospheres and the quantum theory of the negative ion of
  hydrogen and the theory of planetary atmospheres, including the
  theory of the illumination and the polarization of the sunlit sky
  (1943-1950); hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, including
  the theory of the Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection (1952-1961); the
  equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of
  equilibrium, partly in collaboration with Norman R. Lebovitz
  (1961-1968); the general theory of relativity and relativistic
  astrophysics (1962-1971); and the mathematical theory of black
  holes (1974- 1983). The monographs which resulted from these
  several periods are:</p>
