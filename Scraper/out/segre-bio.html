  <h1>Emilio Segr&egrave; - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="segre.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Emilio Segr&egrave;</b> was born in
  Tivoli, Rome, on February 1st, 1905, as the son of Giuseppe
  Segr&egrave;, industrialist, and Amelia Treves. He went to school
  in Tivoli and Rome, and entered the University of Rome
  as a student of engineering in 1922. In 1927 he changed over to
  physics and took his doctor's degree in 1928 under Professor
  <a href="../1938/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a>, the first one
  tmder the latter's sponsorship.<br>
  <br>
  He served in the Italian Army in 1928 and 1929, and entered the
  University of Rome as assistant to Professor Corbino in 1929. In
  1930 he had a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship and worked with
  Professor Otto Stern at Hamburg, Germany, and Professor Pieter
  Zeeman at Amsterdam, Holland. In 1932 he returned to Italy and
  was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Rome,
  working continuously with Professor Fermi and others. In 1936 he
  was appointed Director of the Physics Laboratory at the
  University of Palermo, where he remained until I938.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938 Professor Segr&egrave; came to Berkeley,
  California, first as a research associate in the Radiation
  Laboratory and later as a lecturer in the Physics Department.
  From 1943 to 1946 he was a group leader in the Los Alamos
  Laboratory of the Manhattan Project. In 1946 he returned to the
  University of California at Berkeley as a Professor of Physics,
  and still occupies that position.<br>
  <br>
  The work of Professor Segr&egrave; has been mainly in atomic and
  nuclear physics. In the first field he worked in atomic
  spectroscopy, making contributions to the spectroscopy of
  forbidden lines and the study of the Zeeman effect. Except for a
  short interlude on molecular beams, all his work until 1934 was
  in atomic spectroscopy. In 1934 he started the work in nuclear
  physics by collaborating with Professor Fermi on neutron
  research. He participated in the discovery of slow neutrons and
  in the pioneer neutron work carried on in Rome 1934-1935. Later
  he was interested in radiochemistry and discovered together with
  Professor Perrier the element technetium, together with Corson
  and Mackenzie the element astatine, and together with Kennedy,
  Seaborg, and Wahl, plutonium-239 and its fission
  properties.<br>
  <br>
  His other investigations in nuclear physics cover many subjects,
  e.g., isomerism, spontaneous fission, and lately high-energy
  physics. Here he, his associates and students have made
  contributions to the study of the interaction between nucleons
  and on the related polarization phenomena. In 1955 together with
  Chamberlain, Wiegand, and Ypsilantis he discovered the
  antiproton. The study of antinucleons is now his major subject of
  research.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Segr&egrave; has taught in temporary appointments at
  Columbia
  University, New York, at the University of
  Illinois, at the University of Rio de Janeiro and in several other
  institutions. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A), of the
  Academy of Sciences at Heidelberg (Germany), of the Accademia
  Nazionale dei Lincei of Italy, and of other learned societies. He
  has received the Hofmann Medal of the German Chemical Society and
  the Cannizzaro Medal of the Italian Accademia dei Lincei. He is
  an Honorary Professor of San Marcos University in Peru and has an
  honorary doctor's degree of the University of Palermo, Italy.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Segr&egrave; is married to Elfriede Spiro; they have a
  son, Claudio, and two daughters, Amelia and Fausta.</p>
