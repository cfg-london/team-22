  <h1>Walther Bothe - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bothe.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Walther Bothe</b> was born on
  January 8, 1891, at Oranienburg, near Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  From 1908 until 1912 he studied physics at the University of
  Berlin, where he was a pupil of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Max Planck</a>, obtaining
  his doctorate just before the outbreak of the 1914-1918 war. From
  1913 until 1930 he worked at the Physikalisch-Technische
  Reichsanstalt in the same city, becoming a Professor
  Extraordinary in the University there. In 1930 he was appointed
  Professor of Physics, and Director of the Institute of Physics at
  the University of Giessen.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932 he was appointed Director of the Institute of Physics at
  the University of Heidelberg, in succession to Philipp
  Lenard, becoming in 1934 Director of the Institute of Physics at
  the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research
     in that city. At the end of the Second World War, when this
     Institute was taken over for other purposes, Bothe returned to
     the Department of Physics in the University, where he taught
     until the illness which had handicapped him for several years
     compelled him to restrict the scope of his work. He was able,
     however, to supervise the work of the Institute of Physics in
     the Max Planck Institute and he continued to do this until his
     death in Heidelberg on February 8, 1957.<br>
  <br>
  Bothe's scientific work coincided with the opening up of the vast
  field of nuclear physics and the results he obtained led to new
  outlooks and methods.<br>
  <br>
  He was, during the First World War, taken prisoner by the
  Russians and spent a year in captivity in Siberia. This year he
  devoted to mathematical studies and to learning the Russian
  language; in 1920 he was sent back to Germany.<br>
  <br>
  He then collaborated with H. Geiger at the
  Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin. Together with
  Geiger, whose influence determined much of his scientific work,
  he published, in 1924, his method of coincidence, by which
  important discoveries were subsequently made. It is based on the
  fact that, when a single particle passes through two or more
  Geiger counters, the pulses from each counter are practically
  coincident in time. The pulse from each counter is then sent to a
  coincidence circuit which indicates pulses that are coincident in
  time. Arrays of Geiger counters in coincidence select particles
  moving in a given direction and the method can be used, for
  example, to measure the angular distribution of cosmic rays.
  Bothe applied this method to the study of the Compton effect and
  to other problems of physics. Together he and Geiger clarified
  ideas about the small angle scattering of light rays and Bothe
  summarized their work on this problem in his <i>Handbuch</i>
  article published in 1926 and 1933, establishing the foundations
  of modern methods for the analysis of scatter processes. From
  1923 until 1926 Bothe concentrated, especially on experimental
  and theoretical work on the corpuscular theory of light. He had,
  some months before the discovery of the Compton effect, observed,
  in a Wilson chamber filled with hydrogen, the short track of the
  recoil electrons of X-rays and he did further work on the
  direction of the emission of photo electrons. Together he and
  Geiger related the Compton effect to the theory of <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Bohr</a>, Kramers, and Slater, and the
  results of their work provided strong support for the corpuscular
  theory of light.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927 Bothe further clarified, by means of his coincidence
  method, ideas about light quanta in a paper on light quanta and
  interference.<br>
  <br>
  In the same year he began to study the transformation of light
  elements by bombardment with alpha rays. The resulting fission
  products had, until then, been seen by the eye only as
  scintillations, but Bothe, in collaboration with Fr&auml;nz, made
  it possible to count them by means of their needle counter.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929, in collaboration with W. Kolh&ouml;rster, Bothe
  introduced a new method for the study of cosmic and ultraviolet
  rays by passing them through suitably arranged Geiger counters,
  and by this method demonstrated the presence of penetrating
  charged particles in the rays, and defined the paths of
  individual rays.<br>
  <br>
  For his discovery of the method of coincidence and the
  discoveries subsequently made by it, which laid the foundations
  of nuclear spectroscopy, Bothe was awarded, jointly with Max
  Born, the <a href="index.html">Nobel Prize for Physics for
  1954</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1930 Bothe, in collaboration with H. Becker, bombarded
  beryllium of mass 9 (and also boron and lithium) with alpha rays
  derived from polonium, and obtained a new form of radiation that
  was even more penetrating than the hardest gamma rays derived
  from radium, and this led to the discovery of the neutron, made
  by <a href="../1935/index.html">Sir James Chadwick</a> in
  1932.<br>
  <br>
  At Heidelberg, Bothe was able, after much difficulty, to obtain
  the money necessary for building a cyclotron. He worked, during
  the 1939-1945 war, on the diffusion theory of neutrons and on
  measurements related to these.<br>
  <br>
  In June 1940 he published his <i>Atlas of Cloud-Chamber
  Figures</i>.<br>
  <br>
  He was a member of the Academies of Sciences of Heidelberg and
  G&ouml;ttingen, and a Corresponding Member of the Saxon Academy
  of Sciences, Leipzig. He was awarded the Max Planck Medal and the
  Grand Cross of the Order for Federal Services. In 1952, he was
  made a Knight of the Order of Merit for Science and the
  Arts.<br>
  <br>
  Bothe's remarkable gifts were not restricted to physics. He had
  an astonishing gift of concentration and his habit of carefully
  making the best use of his time enabled him to work at great
  speed. In the laboratory he was often a difficult and strict
  master, at his best in discussions in small classes there, but in
  the evenings at home he was, with his Russian wife, very
  hospitable and all the difficulties of the day were then
  forgotten.<br>
  <br>
  To his hobbies and recreations he gave the same concentration and
  intensity of effort that he gave to his scientific work. Chief
  among them were music and painting. He went to many musical
  concerts and himself played the piano, being especially fond of
  Bach and Beethoven. During his holidays he visited the mountains
  and did many paintings in oil and water colour. In these his
  style was his own. He admired the French impressionists and was
  eager and vigorous in his discussions of the merits and demerits
  of various artists.<br>
  <br>
  Bothe married Barbara Below of Moscow. Her death preceded his by
  some years. They had two children.</p>
