  <h1>Yasser Arafat - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="arafat.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Mohammed Abdel-Raouf Arafat As Qudwa
  al-Hussaeini</b> was born on 24 August 1929 in Cairo<a href=
  "#not1">**</a>, his father a textile merchant who was a
  Palestinian with some Egyptian ancestry, his mother from an old
  Palestinian family in Jerusalem. She died when Yasir, as he was
  called, was five years old, and he was sent to live with his maternal uncle
  in Jerusalem, the capital of the British Mandate of Palestine. He has revealed
  little about his childhood, but one of his earliest memories is of British
  soldiers breaking into his uncle's house after midnight, beating members of
  the family and smashing furniture.</p>

  <p>After four years in Jerusalem, his father
  brought him back to Cairo, where an older sister took care of him
  and his siblings. Arafat never mentions his father, who was not
  close to his children. Arafat did not attend his father's funeral
  in 1952.</p>

  <p>In Cairo, before he was seventeen Arafat
  was smuggling arms to Palestine to be used against the British
  and the Jews. At nineteen, during the war between the Jews and
  the Arab states, Arafat left his studies at the University of
  Faud I (later Cairo University) to fight against the Jews in the
  Gaza area. The defeat of the Arabs and the establishment of the
  state of Israel left him in such despair that he applied for a
  visa to study at the University of Texas. Recovering his spirits
  and retaining his dream of an independent Palestinian homeland,
  he returned to Faud University to major in engineering but spent
  most of his time as leader of the Palestinian students.</p>

  <p>He did manage to get his degree in 1956,
  worked briefly in Egypt, then resettled in Kuwait, first being
  employed in the department of public works, next successfully
  running his own contracting firm. He spent all his spare time in
  political activities, to which he contributed most of the
  profits. In 1958 he and his friends founded Al-Fatah, an
  underground network of secret cells, which in 1959 began to
  publish a magazine advocating armed struggle against Israel. At
  the end of 1964 Arafat left Kuwait to become a full-time
  revolutionary, organising Fatah raids into Israel from
  Jordan.</p>

  <p>It was also in 1964 that the Palestine
  Liberation Organisation (PLO) was established, under the
  sponsorship of the Arab League, bringing together a number of
  groups all working to free Palestine for the Palestinians. The
  Arab states favoured a more conciliatory policy than Fatah's, but
  after their defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Fatah
  emerged from the underground as the most powerful and best
  organised of the groups making up the PLO, took over that
  organisation in 1969 when Arafat became the chairman of the PLO
  executive committee. The PLO was no longer to be something of a
  puppet organisation of the Arab states, wanting to keep the
  Palestinians quiet, but an independent nationalist organisation,
  based in Jordan.</p>

  <p>Arafat developed the PLO into a state
  within the state of Jordan with its own military forces. King
  Hussein of Jordan, disturbed by its guerrilla attacks on Israel
  and other violent methods, eventually expelled the PLO from his
  country. Arafat sought to build a similar organisation in
  Lebanon, but this time was driven out by an Israeli military
  invasion. He kept the organization alive, however, by moving its
  headquarters to Tunis. He was a survivor himself, escaping death
  in an airplane crash, surviving any assassination attempts by
  Israeli intelligence agencies, and recovering from a serious
  stroke.</p>

  <p>His life was one of constant travel, moving
  from country to country to promote the Palestinian cause, always
  keeping his movements secret, as he did any details about his
  private life. Even his marriage to Suha Tawil, a Palestinian half
  his age, was kept secret for some fifteen months. She had already
  begun significant humanitarian activities at home, especially for
  disabled children, but the prominent part she took in the public
  events in Oslo was a surprise for many Arafat-watchers. Since
  then, their daughter, Zahwa, named after Arafat's mother, has
  been born.</p>

  <p>The period after the expulsion from Lebanon
  was a low time for Arafat and the PLO. Then the <i>intifada</i>
  (shaking) protest movement strengthened Arafat by directing world
  attention to the difficult plight of the Palestinians. In 1988
  came a change of policy. In a speech at a special United Nations
  session held in Geneva, Switzerland, Arafat declared that the PLO
  renounced terrorism and supported "the right of all parties
  concerned in the Middle East conflict to live in peace and
  security, including the state of Palestine, Israel and other
  neighbours".</p>

  <p>The prospects for a peace agreement with
  Israel now brightened. After a setback when the PLO supported
  Iraq in the Persian Gulf War of 1991, the peace process began in
  earnest, leading to the Oslo Accords of 1993.</p>

  <p>This agreement included provision for the
  Palestinian elections which took place in early 1996, and Arafat
  was elected President of the Palestine Authority. Like other Arab
  regimes in the area, however, Arafat's governing style tended to
  be more dictatorial than democratic. When the right-wing
  government of Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in Israel in 1996,
  the peace process slowed down considerably. Much depends upon the
  nature of the new Israeli government, which will result from the
  elections to be held in 1999.</p>
