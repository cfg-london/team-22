  <h1>William F. Giauque - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="giauque.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>William Francis Giauque</b> was born
  in Niagara Falls, Canada, of U.S. parentage, on May 12, 1895, the
  first of three children of William Tecumseh Sherman Giauque and
  Isabella Jane Duncan.<br>
  <br>
  He attended public grammar schools principally in Michigan.
  Following the death of his father, in 1908, the family returned
  to Niagara Falls, Canada, where he received his secondary school
  education in the Niagara Falls Collegiate Institute. After
  graduation he sought employment in various power plants at
  Niagara Falls for financial reasons and because he had planned
  for many years to become an electrical engineer and wanted
  preliminary experience. He was unable to obtain this type of
  work. At this point chance entered decisively in the form of a
  newspaper advertisement of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company in
  Niagara Falls, New York, which led him to accept employment in
  their laboratory. The well-organized operations in this chemical
  plant, together with problems which he saw in course of solution,
  captured his interest and caused him to decide to become a
  chemical engineer.<br>
  <br>
  After two years employment he entered the College of Chemistry of
  the University of California, where he received the B.S. degree
  with highest honors in 1920, was a University Fellow for the year
  1920-1921 and James M. Goewey Fellow 1921-1922. He received the
  Ph.D. degree in chemistry with a minor in physics in 1922.<br>
  <br>
  Although his undergraduate work at the university was selected
  with the idea of an engineering career, he soon acquired a liking
  for fundamental research. The emphasis on scientific
  investigation by the group of faculty and students associated
  with Professor Gilbert N. Lewis was the major influence.<br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Instructor of Chemistry in 1922 and after
  passing through the intermediate grades of professorship he
  became Professor of Chemistry in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  His interest in the third law of thermodynamics as a field of
  research was aroused by the experimental work for his Ph.D.
  research under Professor G.E. Gibson. This work, which was
  concerned with the relative entropies of glycerine crystals and
  glass, had its origin in discussions of Professors Lewis and
  Gibson.<br>
  <br>
  The principal objective of his researches has been to demonstrate
  through a considerable number and variety of accurate tests that
  the third law of thermodynamics is a basic natural law.<br>
  <br>
  The researches of his students and himself have included a large
  number of accurate entropy determinations from low temperature
  measurements, particularly on condensed gases. The entropies and
  other thermodynamic properties of many gases have also been
  determined from quantum statistics and molecular energy levels
  available from band spectra and other sources.<br>
  <br>
  Correlated investigations of the entropy of oxygen from its
  incompletely interpreted band spectrum and from low-temperature
  heat capacity measurements with Dr. H.L. Johnston, led to the
  discovery of oxygen isotopes 17 and 18 in the Earth's atmosphere
  and the fact that chemists and physicists were unknowingly using
  different atomic weight scales.<br>
  <br>
  Investigation of the effect of magnetic fields on the entropies
  of paramagnetic substances led to the invention of the adiabatic
  demagnetization method of producing temperatures considerably
  below 1&deg; absolute. This method was first demonstrated in
  collaboration with Dr. D.P. MacDougall.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Giauque's scientific work has been described in some 75
  papers.<br>
  <br>
  He has received the Chandler Medal and the honorary degree of
  Sc.D. from Columbia University, an honorary LL.D. from the
  University of California, and the Elliott Cresson Medal from the
  Franklin Institute. In 1951 he received the Willard Gibbs Medal
  and in 1956 the Gilbert Newton Lewis Medal. He was Faculty
  Research Lecturer of the University of California in 1948. He is
  a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American
  Philosophical Society, the American Chemical Society, Institut
  International du Froid, and is Fellow of the American Physical
  Society and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932 he married Dr. Muriel Frances Ashley. They have two sons,
  William Francis Ashley G. and Robert David Ashley G.</p>
