He was presented by Professor Mats Jonson, Chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics.<br/><br/>Summary: Instruments attached to rockets and satellites fired into space have explored the X-ray universe since 1950. What was once an unknown background of X-ray emission turned out to contain millions of X-ray sources, both galactic and extra-galactic. Thanks to the development of increasingly sophisticated instruments, the sensitivity to detect X-ray sources has improved 1,000 million times and the resolution has improved significantly over the last 50 years. Among the long list of observations and discoveries achieved through X-ray astronomy are binary stars and the first evidence for the existence of black holes.</p></div>
