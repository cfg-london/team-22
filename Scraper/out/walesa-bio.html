  <h1>Lech Walesa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="walesa.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Lech
  Walesa</b> was born on September 29, 1943 in Popowo, Poland.
  After graduating from vocational school, he worked as a car
  mechanic at a machine center from 1961 to 1965. He served in the
  army for two years, rose to the rank of corporal, and in 1967 was
  employed in the Gdansk shipyards as an electrician. In 1969 he
  married Danuta Golos and they have eight children.</p>

  <p>During the clash in December 1970 between
  the workers and the government, he was one of the leaders of the
  shipyard workers and was briefly detained. In 1976, however, as a
  result of his activities as a shop steward, he was fired and had
  to earn his living by taking temporary jobs.</p>

  <p>In 1978 with other activists he began to
  organise free non-communist trade unions and took part in many
  actions on the sea coast. He was kept under surveillance by the
  state security service and frequently detained.</p>

  <p>In August 1980 he led the Gdansk shipyard
  strike which gave rise to a wave of strikes over much of the
  country with Walesa seen as the leader. The primary demands were
  for workers' rights. The authorities were forced to capitulate
  and to negotiate with Walesa the Gdansk Agreement of August 31,
  1980, which gave the workers the right to strike and to organise
  their own independent union.</p>

  <p>The Catholic Church supported the movement,
  and in January 1981 Walesa was cordially received by Pope John
  Paul II in the Vatican. Walesa himself has always regarded his
  Catholicism as a source of strength and inspiration. In the years
  1980-81 Walesa travelled to Italy, Japan, Sweden, France and
  Switzerland as guest of the <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">International Labour Organisation</a>. In
  September 1981 he was elected Solidarity Chairman at the First
  National Solidarity Congress in Gdansk.</p>

  <p>The country's brief enjoyment of relative
  freedom ended in December 1981, when General Jaruzelski, fearing
  Soviet armed intervention among other considerations, imposed
  martial law, "suspended" Solidarity, arrested many of its
  leaders, and interned Walesa in a country house in a remote
  spot.</p>

  <p>In November 1982 Walesa was released and
  reinstated at the Gdansk shipyards. Although kept under
  surveillance, he managed to maintain lively contact with
  Solidarity leaders in the underground. While martial law was
  lifted in July 1983, many of the restrictions were continued in
  civil code. In October 1983 the announcement of Walesa's Nobel
  prize raised the spirits of the underground movement, but the
  award was attacked by the government press.</p>

  <p>The Jaruzelski regime became even more
  unpopular as economic conditions worsened, and it was finally
  forced to negotiate with Walesa and his Solidarity colleagues.
  The result was the holding of parliamentary elections which,
  although limited, led to the establishment of a non-communist
  government. Under <a href="../1990/index.html">Mikhail
  Gorbachev</a> the Soviet Union was no longer prepared to use
  military force to keep communist parties in satellite states in
  power.</p>

  <p>Walesa, now head of the revived Solidarity
  labour union, began a series of meetings with world leaders.</p>

  <p>In April 1990 at Solidarity's second
  national congress, Walesa was elected chairman with 77.5% of the
  votes. In December 1990 in a general ballot he was elected
  President of the Republic of Poland. He served until defeated in
  the election of November 1995.</p>

  <p>Walesa has been granted many honorary
  degrees from universities, including Harvard University
  and the University of Paris. Other honors include the Medal
  of Freedom (Philadelphia, U.S.A.); the Award of Free World
  (Norway); and the European Award of Human Rights.</p>
