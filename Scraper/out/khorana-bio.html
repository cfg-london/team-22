  <h1>H. Gobind Khorana - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="khorana.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Har Gobind Khorana</b> was born of Hindu
  parents in Raipur, a little village in Punjab, which is now part
  of eastern Pakistan. The correct date of his birth is not known;
  that shown in documents is January 9th, 1922. He is the youngest
  of a family of one daughter and four sons. His father was a
  &laquo;patwari&raquo;, a village agricultural taxation clerk in the
  British Indian system of government. Although poor, his father
  was dedicated to educating his children and they were practically
  the only literate family in the village inhabited by about 100
  people.<br>
  <br>
  Har Gobind Khorana attended D.A.V. High School in Multan (now
  West Punjab); Ratan Lal, one of his teachers, influenced him
  greatly during that period. Later, he studied at the Punjab
  University in Lahore where he obtained an M. Sc. degree. Mahan
  Singh, a great teacher and accurate experimentalist, was his
  supervisor.<br>
  <br>
  Khorana lived in India until 1945, when the award of a Government
  of India Fellowship made it possible for him to go to England and
  he studied for a Ph. D. degree at the University of
  Liverpool. Roger J. S. Beer supervised his research, and, in
  addition, looked after him diligently. It was the introduction of
  Khorana to Western civilization and culture.<br>
  <br>
  Khorana spent a postdoctoral year (1948-1949) at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische
  Technische Hochschule in Zurich with Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1975/index.html">Vladimir Prelog</a>. The
  association with Professor Prelog molded immeasurably his thought
  and philosophy towards science, work, and effort.<br>
  <br>
  After a brief period in India in the fall of 1949, Khorana
  returned to England where he obtained a fellowship to work with
  Dr. (now Professor) G. W. Kenner and Professor (now Lord)
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1957/index.html">A. R. Todd</a>. He
  stayed in Cambridge from 1950 till 1952. Again, this stay proved
  to be of decisive value to Khorana. Interest in both proteins and
  nucleic acids took root at that time.<br>
  <br>
  A job offer in 1952 from Dr. Gordon M. Shrum of British Columbia
  (now Chancellor of Simon Fraser University, British Columbia) took him
  to Vancouver. The British Columbia Research Council offered at
  that time very little by way of facilities, but there was
  &laquo;all the freedom in the world&raquo;, to use Dr. Shrum's
  words, to do what the researcher liked to do. During the
  following years, with Dr. Shrum's inspiration and encouragement
  and frequent help and scientific counsel from Dr. Jack Campbell
  (now Head of the Department of Microbiology at the University of British
  Columbia), a group began to work in the field of biologically
  interesting phosphate esters and nucleic acids. Among the many
  devoted and loyal colleagues of this period, there should, in
  particular, be mention of Dr. Gordon M. Tener (now a Professor in
  the Biochemistry Department of the University of British
  Columbia), who contributed much to the spiritual and intellectual
  well-being of the group.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960 Khorana moved to the Institute for Enzyme Research at the
  University of Wisconsin. He became a naturalized citizen of the
  United States. As of the fall of 1970 Khorana has been Alfred P.
  Sloan Professor of Biology and Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology.<br>
  <br>
  Har Gobind Khorana was married in 1952 to Esther Elizabeth
  Sibler, who is of Swiss origin. Esther brought a consistent sense
  of purpose into his life at a time when, after six years' absence
  from the country of his birth, Khorana felt out of place
  everywhere and at home nowhere. They have three children: Julia
  Elizabeth (born May 4th, 1953), Emily Anne (born October 18th,
  1954), and Dave Roy (born July 26th, 1958).</p>
