  <h1>Gerd Binnig - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="binnig.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Frankfurt, W. Germany, on
  7.20., '47 as the first of two sons. My childhood was very much
  influenced by the Second World War, which had only just ended. We
  children had great fun playing among the ruins of the demolished
  buildings, but naturally were too young to realize that much more
  than just buildings had been destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  Until the age of 31, I lived partly in Frankfurt and partly in
  Offenbach, a nearby city. I attended school in both cities, and
  it was in Frankfurt that I started to study physics. Already as a
  child about 10 years of age, I had decided to become a physicist
  without actually knowing what it involved. While studying
  physics, I started to wonder whether I had really made the right
  choice. Especially theoretical physics seemed so technical, so
  relatively unphilosophical and unimaginative. In those years, I
  concentrated more on playing music with friends in a beat-band
  rather than on physics. My mother had introduced me to classical
  music very early in life, and I believe this played an important
  role in my subsequent development. Unfortunately, I started
  playing the violin rather late, at the age of 15 only, but
  thoroughly enjoyed being a member of our school orchestra. My
  brother was responsible for my transition from classics to beat
  by his perpetually immersing me with the sounds of the Beatles
  and the Rolling Stones, until I finally really liked that kind of
  music, and even started composing songs and playing in various
  beat-bands. In this way, I first learned how difficult teamwork
  can be, how much fun it is to be creative, and how unpredictable
  the reaction of an audience can be.<br>
  <br>
  My education in physics gained some significance when I began my
  diploma work in Prof. Dr. W. Martienssen's group, under Dr. E.
  Hoenig's guidance. I realized that actually <i>doing</i> physics
  is much more enjoyable than just learning it. Maybe 'doing it' is
  the right way of learning, at least as far as I am
  concerned.<br>
  <br>
  I have always been a great admirer of Prof. Martienssen,
  especially of his ability to grasp and state the essence of the
  scientific context of a problem. Dr. Hoenig introduced me to
  experimenting, and exhibited great patience when I asked him very
  stupid questions in trying to catch up on what I had missed over
  all the previous years.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969, Lore Wagler became my wife. We had both been studying
  for quite a long time - Lore is now a psychologist - so only
  recently did we decide to have children: a daughter born in
  Switzerland in 1984, and a son born in California in 1986. This
  was the absolute highlight and most wonderful experience of my
  whole life. However, fatherhood is not without its sacrifice. For
  the time being, nearly all my hobbies, like music (singing,
  playing the guitar and the violin), and sports (soccer, tennis,
  skiing, sailing and playing golf) have had to take a back
  seat.<br>
  <br>
  It was in 1978 that Lore - my private psychotherapist - convinced
  me to accept an offer from the IBM Z&uuml;rich Research
  Laboratory to join a physics group. This turned out to be an
  extremely important decision, as it was here I met Heinrich
  Rohrer. His way of viewing physics, combined with his humanity
  and sense of humor, fully restored my somewhat lost curiosity in
  physics. My years at Ruschlikon, and in IBM Research in general,
  have been very exciting, not only because of the development of
  the STM, but also because of the stimulating and pleasant
  atmosphere created by the people working there, and by those
  responsible. Working together in a team with Heinrich Rohrer,
  Christoph Gerber and Edmund Weibel was an extraordinarily
  delightful experience, and one for which I shall be eternally
  grateful. It is also extremely gratifying that our work was
  recognized far afield. We were first awarded the German Physics
  Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize, the King
  Faisal Prize, and now the ultimate crown, the Nobel Prize for
  Physics. Life certainly does not become easier for a scientist
  once his work has exceeded a certain significance. But while
  prizes do add some complications, I must admit they also have
  their compensations!</p>

  In 1990 I joined the Supervisory Board of the Daimler Benz
  Holding and presently I am involved in a few political
  activities.</p>
