  <h1>Richard Willst&auml;tter - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="willstatter.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Richard Martin Willst&auml;tter</b> was 
              born in Karlsruhe in Baden on August 13, 1872, and went to school 
              first in his home town and then, when his parents moved house, at 
              the Technical School in Nuremberg. When he was 18 he went to the 
              University of Munich where he studied Science, entered the Department 
              of Chemistry under <a href=
  "../1905/index.html">Baeyer</a> and stayed there for the following fifteen years, 
              first as a student, from 1896 as a lecturer - pursuing his scientific 
              work independently - until in early 1902 he became J. Thiele's successor 
              as Extraordinary Professor.<br>
              <br>
              As a young man he studied principally the structure and synthesis 
              of plant alkaloids such as atropine and cocaine. In this, as in 
              his later work on quinone and quinone type compounds which are the 
              basis of many dyestuffs, he sought to acquire skill in chemical 
              methods in order to prepare himself for the extensive and more difficult 
              work of investigating plant and animal pigments. For this undertaking 
              the working facilities which the Munich laboratory afforded him 
              were too limited and he was glad to accept the first offer of a 
              Professorial Chair which he received in the summer of 1905. It was 
              thus that he came to Zurich to the Federal Technical College.<br>
              <br>
              These seven years in Switzerland were for him the best and most 
              significant. But while research and teaching brought him great satisfaction, 
              at the same time he suffered personal misfortune and soon became 
              lonely. He enjoyed his work in Zurich so much that he did not think 
              of those years as a waiting period until he was called back to Germany 
              in 1912. For the Jubilee of the University of Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm 
              had established a Society for the Promotion of Scientific Knowledge 
              and this body had founded an Institute of Chemistry in Berlin/Dahlem. 
              He was offered a Research Laboratory here in conjunction with an 
              honorary professorship at the University of Berlin.<br>
              <br>
              In the two short years before the outbreak of the first World War 
              he was able with a team of collaborators to round off his investigations 
              into chlorophyll and, in connexion with that, to complete some work 
              on haemoglobin and, in rapid succession, to carry out his studies 
              of anthocyanes, the colouring matter of flowers and fruits. These 
              investigations into plant pigments, especially the work on chlorophyll, 
              were honoured by the award of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1915), 
              just at the time when he had decided to accept a call to the University 
              of Munich and again, as successor to his old teacher Adolf von Baeyer, 
              take an active part in university teaching; for, as things were 
              then, the even tenour of scientific life at Dahlem was gone.<br>
              <br>
              In the period that followed Willst&auml;tter continued on lines 
              of fundamental importance, and his brilliant and fruitful work is 
              regarded today as a pioneering achievement. The investigations into 
              photosynthesis and into the nature and activity of the enzymes were 
              precursory of modern Biochemistry. At that time the method so far 
              developed of concentrating enzymes through adsorption did not make 
              it possible to attain to the crystallized enzymes. In this connexion, 
              Willst&auml;tter carried out important studies of adsorbents, metal 
              hydroxides, hydrogels and silicic acids. In addition he was quick 
              to give his attention also to problems of theoretical chemistry. 
              Thus he achieved the first synthesis of cyclo-octatetraene, and 
              went on to compare it with benzene; so also he set up experiments 
              to produce cyclobutadiene.<br>
              <br>
              Willst&auml;tter's career came to a tragic end when, as a gesture 
              against increasing antisemitism, he announced his retirement in 
              1924. Expressions of confidence by the Faculty, by his students 
              and by the Minister failed to shake the fifty-three year old scientist 
              in his decision to resign. He lived on in retirement in Munich, 
              maintaining contact only with those of his pupils who remained in 
              the Institute and with his successor, <a href=
  "../1927/index.html">Heinrich Wieland</a>, whom he had nominated. Dazzling offers 
              both at home and abroad were alike rejected by him. In 1938 he fled 
              from the Gestapo with the help of his pupil A. Stoll and managed 
              to emigrate to Switzerland, losing all but a meagre part of his 
              belongings.<br>
              <br>
              Willst&auml;tter was married to Sophie Leser, the daughter of a 
              Heidelberg University professor. They had one son, Ludwig, and 
              one daughter, Ida Margarete.<br>
              <br>
              The old man passed the last three years of his life in Muroalto 
              near Locarno writing his Biography (<i>Aus meinem Leben</i>, edited 
              by A. Stoll, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, 1949; English edition <i>From 
              my Life</i>, Benjamin, New York, 1965) until he died on 3rd August, 
              1942, of a heart attack.<br>
              <br>
              In 1956 a memorial to Richard Willst&auml;tter was unveiled in Muroalto.<br>
              <br>
              In an epilogue written by A. Stoll to Willst&auml;tter's Biography 
              the list of honours and distinctions accorded to this great scholar 
              in every part of the civilized world alone occupies no less than 
              three pages.</p>
