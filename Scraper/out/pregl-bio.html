  <h1>Fritz Pregl - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pregl.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fritz Pregl</b> was born in Laibach<a href="#not">*</a> on September 3, 1869, and attended the local "Gymnasium" (grammar
  school), from where he proceeded to the University of
  Graz to study medicine. He received his M.D. in 1894, but
  even prior to graduation he became assistant lecturer for
  physiology and histology under Alexander Rollett, taking over the
  chair when Rollett died in 1903. During this time Pregl also
  acquired a thorough knowledge of all branches of chemistry under
  the guidance of Professor Skraup.<br>
  <br>
  In 1904 he went to Germany, where he studied for short periods
  under Gustav v. H&uuml;fner in T&uuml;bingen, <a href=
  "../1909/index.html">W. Ostwald</a> in Leipzig and <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a> in Berlin. On his return to
  Graz in 1905 Pregl worked at the Medico-Chemical Institute under
  K.B. Hofmann and was appointed forensic chemist for the Graz
  circuit in 1907. At that time he started investigating the
  components of albuminous bodies and the analysis of bile acids.
  His work, however, was handicapped by the lack of sufficient
  starting materials and this fact impelled him to look for methods
  requiring smaller amounts when making quantitative analyses of
  elements in compounds.<br>
  <br>
  The years 1910-1913, whilst professor at Innsbruck
  University, were almost entirely devoted to developing the
  method of quantitative organic micro-analysis. Pregl continued
  with this work when he was recalled to Graz University in 1913;
  he was appointed Dean of the Medical Faculty for the year
  1916-1917 and Vice-Chancellor of Graz University for
  1920-1921.<br>
  <br>
  Initially Pregl's scientific work had been mainly in the fields
  of physiology and physiological chemistry; later he turned to the
  study of the constitution of chemical compounds, in particular
  the investigation of bile acids. By 1912 he was able, by using
  his own methods of quantitative micro-analysis, to make
  measurements of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, and halogen,
  using only 5-13 mg of starting materials with results as accurate
  as those obtained by macro-analysis. Later he perfected his
  techniques so that as little as 3-5 mg were adequate. Pregl also
  contributed a number of micromethods for measuring atomic groups
  and developed a series of apparatus, including a sensitive
  microbalance, necessary for his work.<br>
  <br>
  Recognition for his work was first accorded with the Lieben Prize
  for Chemistry from the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna
  (1914), an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the University
  of G&ouml;ttingen (1920 ); in 1921 he was elected Corresponding
  Member by the Academy of Sciences in Vienna. The greatest and
  most unexpected honour was the award of the Nobel Prize for
  Chemistry by the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1923/pregl-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> in 1923. O. Hammarsten,
  the Chairman of the Nobel Committee at the time, pointed out that
  it was not for a discovery, but for modifying and improving
  existing methods that Pregl was awarded the prize.<br>
  <br>
  Pregl had, in the early stages of his investigations, avoided
  publishing individual reports on his experiments, until he had
  convinced himself that his methods did not only work in his own,
  but also in other laboratories. He then, in 1917, set down his
  findings in a monograph entitled <i>Die quantitative
  Microanalyse</i> (published by J. Springer, Berlin). A second
  edition was published in 1923 and a third revised and enlarged
  edition (256 pages) appeared in 1930. Later editions were revised
  by Dr. H. Roth. The seventh edition was published in 1958 by
  Springer in Vienna. Pregl's monograph has also been translated
  into French and English.<br>
  <br>
  Following the award of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1923,
  chemists from all over the world came to the Medico-Chemical
  Institute in Graz to study Pregl's techniques of quantitative
  organic micro-analysis under his guidance.<br>
  <br>
  Pregl never married, and died after a short illness at the age of
  61 at Graz on December 13, 1930. Shortly before his death he put
  a considerable amount of money at the disposal of the Vienna
  Academy of Sciences for the promotion of micro-chemical research,
  stipulating that the interest from this fund was to be used each
  year to award a prize for outstanding work to Austrian
  micro-chemists. Since then, the Vienna Academy of Sciences has
  awarded this prize as the "Fritz Pregl Prize".</p>
