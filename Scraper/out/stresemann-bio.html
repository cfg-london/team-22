  <h1>Gustav Stresemann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stresemann.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Gustav Stresemann</b> (May 10, 1878-October 3, 1929) was
  the son of a prosperous owner of a restaurant and tavern. In his
  early years he helped in the family business and, since he was a
  lonely boy, assiduously pursued his studies. After attending the
  Andreas Real Gymnasium in Berlin, Stresemann studied literature,
  philosophy, and political economy at Berlin and Leipzig. During
  these student days, he discovered that he had powers of
  leadership as well as a capacity for literary attainment. He
  wrote critical essays on the <i>Utopia</i> of Thomas More
  and the lyrics of D.F. Strauss, historical pieces on Bismarck
  (and later, on Napoleon), and acted as spokesman for his student
  association. His dissertation for his doctorate, an economic
  investigation of the bottled beer trade in Berlin, was both
  practical and theoretical, assessing the pressures of big
  business capitalism on the independent middle class of
  Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  Stresemann entered the real world of commerce in 1901 at the age
  of twenty-two as a clerk in the Association of German Chocolate
  Manufacturers in Dresden. A year later he took over the business
  management of the local branch of the Manufacturers Alliance, an
  association of entrepreneurs. With his organizing talent and his
  persuasiveness, he increased the number of members in the
  alliance from 180 in 1902 to 1,000 in 1904 and to approximately
  5,000 in 1912. Although he represented capital, Stresemann
  nonetheless supported the idea, novel at the time, that
  management should accept labor's right to organize and should
  recognize its representatives as official negotiators of
  collective bargaining demands.<br>
  <br>
  Always convinced of the relationship between economics and
  politics, however, Stresemann sought elective office. In 1906 he
  was elected to a seat on the town council of Dresden, which he
  held until 1912; in 1907 he won election to the Reichstag. In
  1917 he was elected leader of the National Liberal Party.<br>
  <br>
  While in Dresden, Stresemann married K&auml;the Kleefeld; they
  had two sons. One of Stresemann's biographers remarks that his
  devotion to his wife was &laquo;the axis on which his whole life
  turned [so that he was free to fling] his entire intellect and
  energy, his almost superhuman powers of concentration, into his
  one concern, politics&raquo;<sup><a href=
  "#not_1">1</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  Stresemann passionately supported Germanic policy both before and
  during World War I. He believed in force, in authority, in
  discipline. He argued as early as 1907 for the creation of a
  strong navy, seeing in it the instrument by which to extend and
  protect German overseas trade; in 1916, he supported unrestricted
  submarine warfare; he helped to defeat the government of
  Bethmann-Hollweg which he thought too temperate; he opposed the
  Treaty of Versailles.<br>
  <br>
  Dismayed, however, to discover Germany's true military position
  in the fall of 1918, Stresemann found his ideas of the world
  changing. Disillusioned with an imperial government that believed
  in force yet did not possess adequate force, and indeed realizing
  that the policy of force and conquest in itself is ultimately
  ruinous, he began to see the world as a jigsaw of political and
  commercial interrelationships, each nation an individual piece in
  the puzzle and each fitting into another.<br>
  <br>
  A month after the armistice of November 11, 1918, Stresemann
  formed the German People's Party, was elected to the national
  assembly which gathered at Weimar in 1919 to frame a new
  constitution, was elected to the new Reichstag in 1920 and spent
  the next three years in opposition. From August 13 to November
  23, 1923, Stresemann was chancellor of a coalition government. In
  his short-lived ministry he dealt firmly with insurrection in
  Saxony, restored order in Bavaria after Hitler's <i>Putsch</i>
  failed, ended the passive resistance of Germans in the Ruhr to
  the French occupying forces, and began the work of stabilizing
  Germany's currency.<br>
  <br>
  In 1924 Stresemann's successor chose him as his secretary of
  foreign affairs, an office he was to fill with such distinction
  under four governments that he was called the greatest master of
  German foreign policy since Bismarck. He enjoyed immediate
  success with the acceptance of the Dawes Plan, which restructured
  reparations on the basis of Germany's ability to pay. With his
  note of February 9, 1925, he took the initiative in arriving at a
  rapprochement with the Western Allies, especially with France, in
  guaranteeing the maintenance of the boundaries established at
  Versailles. After careful preparation for a conference, Gustav
  Stresemann, <a href="index.html">Aristide Briand</a>, and
  <a href="../1925/index.html">Austen Chamberlain</a>, along with
  representatives of the other four nations involved, met at
  Locarno, Switzerland, to draw up mutual security pacts. The three
  were a study in contrasts: Chamberlain, tall, elegant, monocled,
  schoolmasterish, cool; Briand, slightly stooped, hair disheveled,
  moustached, informal, amused; Stresemann, stiffly erect, bald
  head reflecting the light, cautiously formal. But they shared a
  common goal: to provide general security so that political and
  economic stability could be achieved<sup><a href=

  <br>
  After initialing the Locarno Pact on October 16, Stresemann
  hurried home to insure its acceptance by the government. In a
  speech broadcast to the nation on November 3, 1925, he appealed
  for support, saying: &laquo;Locarno may be interpreted as
  signifying that the States of Europe at last realize that they
  cannot go on making war upon each other without being involved in
  common ruin.&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_3">3</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  As another part of his peace offensive, Stresemann signed a
  rapprochement with Russia, called the Treaty of Berlin, in April
  of 1926. And, following an unsuccessful trip to Geneva in March,
  he finally saw on September 8, 1926, the unanimous acceptance of
  Germany's admission into the League of Nations.<br>
  <br>
  Despite his health, which declined rapidly after the Christmas of
  1927, and against medical advice, Stresemann retained his
  position as German foreign minister. In 1929 at The Hague, he
  accepted the Young Plan which named June 30, 1930, as the final
  date for the evacuation of the Ruhr.<br>
  <br>
  Stresemann did not live to see that evacuation. The victim of a
  stroke, he died in Berlin in October of 1929.</p>
