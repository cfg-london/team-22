  <h1>Elihu Root - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="root.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Elihu
  Root</b> (February 15, 1845-February 7, 1937), who became one of
  the most brilliant administrators in American history, was born
  in Clinton, New York, son of a professor of mathematics at
  Hamilton
  College. Perhaps it was inevitable that the father and
  Elihu's elder brother, who was also a mathematician, should be
  nicknamed &laquo;Cube&raquo; and &laquo;Square&raquo;. At Hamilton
  College, Elihu was graduated first in his class in 1864 at the
  age of nineteen. He taught school for one year, was graduated
  from the Law School of New York University in 1867, founded a law firm
  after one year of practice, and by the age of thirty had
  established himself as a prominent lawyer specializing in
  corporate affairs. He became a wealthy man in the thirty or so
  years which he devoted to legal practice, acting as counsel to
  banks, railroads, and some of the great financiers of the day.
  His comprehensive grasp of legal principles, his formidable power
  of analysis, his creative genius in discovering solutions to
  problems, his disciplined attention to detail, and his skill in
  expression, whether written or oral, earned him recognition from
  his colleagues as the leader of the American bar.<br>
  <br>
  Although he had participated in local Republican politics in New
  York, he was little known as a political figure when, in 1899,
  President McKinley invited him to become his
  secretary of war. Since the nation was just emerging from the
  Spanish-American War, it seemed an unlikely appointment. But
  President McKinley, with remarkable insight, said that he needed
  a lawyer in the post, not a military man, and Root accepted the
  call of what he called &laquo;the greatest of all our clients, the
  government of our country&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  As secretary of war from 1899 to 1904, Root performed the
  services that moved Henry L. Stimson, himself a later secretary of war,
  to say that &laquo;no such intelligent, constructive, and vital
  force&raquo; had occupied that post in American history<a href=
  "#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>. He reorganized the administrative
  system of the War Department, established new procedures for
  promotion, founded the War College, enlarged West Point, opened
  schools for special branches of the service, created a general
  staff, strengthened control over the National Guard, restored
  discipline within the department. He was most concerned, however,
  about the three dependencies acquired as a result of the war. He
  devised a plan for returning Cuba to the Cubans; wrote a
  democratic charter for the governance of the Philippines,
  designing it to insure free government, to protect local customs,
  and to bring eventual self-determination; and eliminated tariffs
  on Puerto Rican goods imported into the United States.<br>
  <br>
  He returned to his private legal practice in 1904, but in 1905 at
  President <a href="../1906/index.html">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s
  invitation, accepted the post of secretary of state. His record
  is impressive. He brought the consular service under Civil
  Service, thus removing it from the &laquo;spoils system&raquo;;
  maintained the &laquo;open door&raquo; policy in the Far East, a
  policy he had helped to formulate as secretary of war; negotiated
  the so-called &laquo;Gentlemen's Agreement&raquo; with Japan which
  dealt with emigration of Japanese to America; strengthened
  amicable relations with South America in 1906 during an
  unprecedented diplomatic tour; sponsored the Central American
  Peace Conference held in Washington in 1907 which resulted in the
  creation of the Central American Court of Justice, an
  international tribunal for the judicial settlement of disputes;
  negotiated some forty reciprocal arbitration treaties; along with
  Lord Bryce, resolved current American-Canadian problems and
  instituted the Permanent American-Canadian Joint High Commission
  for the settlement of future problems.<br>
  <br>
  A United States senator from 1909 to 1915, Elihu Root took an
  active role in settling the North Atlantic fisheries dispute, in
  opposing a bill which would have exempted U.S. shipping from
  paying tolls to use the Panama Canal while levying charges
  against other nations' shipping, and in pressing for
  international arbitration.<br>
  <br>
  In 1915 he declined candidacy for reelection to the Senate and
  even declined, at least publicly, nomination by the Republican
  Party for the presidency of the United States. Although seventy
  years of age, he continued to be active as an elder statesman. He
  opposed <a href="../1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s
  neutrality policy but supported him during the war; he accepted
  Wilson's appointment as ambassador extraordinary to head a
  special diplomatic mission to Russia in 1917; on the 1919 Treaty
  of Versailles and the League of Nations he took a middle stance
  between Wilson on the one hand and the
  &laquo;irreconcilables&raquo; on the other; as a delegate to the
  Washington Naval Conference of 1921-1922, he took a leading role
  in drafting the Five-Power Treaty limiting naval armament.<br>
  <br>
  Root dedicated a large portion of his life to the cause of
  international arbitration. He, more than any other, formulated
  the plan to create the Central American Court of Justice. In 1907
  he instructed the American delegates to the Hague Conference to
  support the founding of a World Court; in 1920, at the request of
  the Council of the League of Nations, he served on a committee to
  devise plans for the Permanent Court of International Justice
  which was set up in 1921; in 1929 after intermittent discussion
  between the League and the United States concerning certain
  reservations the Senate had insisted upon in its 1926
  ratification of the Protocol for U. S. participation in the
  court, Root, on his eighty-fourth birthday, left for Geneva where
  he convinced the delegates from fifty-five nations to accept a
  revised Protocol; he later appeared before the Senate Foreign
  Relations Committee to urge ratification, but the Senate failed
  to act at that time and eventually declined to ratify at
  all.<br>
  <br>
  Root was the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
  and helped to found its European counterpart. He believed that
  international law, along with its accompanying machinery,
  represented mankind's best chance to achieve world peace, but
  like the hardheaded realist he was, he also believed that it
  would take much time, wisdom, patience, and toil to implement it
  effectively.</p>
