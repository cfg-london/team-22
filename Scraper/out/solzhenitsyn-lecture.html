  <h3>1</h3>

  <p>Just as that puzzled savage who has picked
  up - a strange cast-up from the ocean? - something unearthed from
  the sands? - or an obscure object fallen down from the sky? -
  intricate in curves, it gleams first dully and then with a bright
  thrust of light. Just as he turns it this way and that, turns it
  over, trying to discover what to do with it, trying to discover
  some mundane function within his own grasp, never dreaming of its
  higher function.<br>
  <br>
  So also we, holding Art in our hands, confidently consider
  ourselves to be its masters; boldly we direct it, we renew,
  reform and manifest it; we sell it for money, use it to please
  those in power; turn to it at one moment for amusement - right
  down to popular songs and night-clubs, and at another - grabbing
  the nearest weapon, cork or cudgel - for the passing needs of
  politics and for narrow-minded social ends. But art is not
  defiled by our efforts, neither does it thereby depart from its
  true nature, but on each occasion and in each application it
  gives to us a part of its secret inner light.<br>
  <br>
  But shall we ever grasp the whole of that light? Who will dare to
  say that he has DEFINED Art, enumerated all its facets? Perhaps
  once upon a time someone understood and told us, but we could not
  remain satisfied with that for long; we listened, and neglected,
  and threw it out there and then, hurrying as always to exchange
  even the very best - if only for something new! And when we are
  told again the old truth, we shall not even remember that we once
  possessed it.<br>
  <br>
  One artist sees himself as the creator of an independent
  spiritual world; he hoists onto his shoulders the task of
  creating this world, of peopling it and of bearing the
  all-embracing responsibility for it; but he crumples beneath it,
  for a mortal genius is not capable of bearing such a burden. Just
  as man in general, having declared himself the centre of
  existence, has not succeeded in creating a balanced spiritual
  system. And if misfortune overtakes him, he casts the blame upon
  the age-long disharmony of the world, upon the complexity of
  today's ruptured soul, or upon the stupidity of the public.<br>
  <br>
  Another artist, recognizing a higher power above, gladly works as
  a humble apprentice beneath God's heaven; then, however, his
  responsibility for everything that is written or drawn, for the
  souls which perceive his work, is more exacting than ever. But,
  in return, it is not he who has created this world, not he who
  directs it, there is no doubt as to its foundations; the artist
  has merely to be more keenly aware than others of the harmony of
  the world, of the beauty and ugliness of the human contribution
  to it, and to communicate this acutely to his fellow-men. And in
  misfortune, and even at the depths of existence - in destitution,
  in prison, in sickness - his sense of stable harmony never
  deserts him.<br>
  <br>
  But all the irrationality of art, its dazzling turns, its
  unpredictable discoveries, its shattering influence on human
  beings - they are too full of magic to be exhausted by this
  artist's vision of the world, by his artistic conception or by
  the work of his unworthy fingers.<br>
  <br>
  Archaeologists have not discovered stages of human existence so
  early that they were without art. Right back in the early morning
  twilights of mankind we received it from Hands which we were too
  slow to discern. And we were too slow to ask: FOR WHAT PURPOSE
  have we been given this gift? What are we to do with it?<br>
  <br>
  And they were mistaken, and will always be mistaken, who prophesy
  that art will disintegrate, that it will outlive its forms and
  die. It is we who shall die - art will remain. And shall we
  comprehend, even on the day of our destruction, all its facets
  and all its possibilities?<br>
  <br>
  Not everything assumes a name. Some things lead beyond words. Art
  inflames even a frozen, darkened soul to a high spiritual
  experience. Through art we are sometimes visited - dimly, briefly
  - by revelations such as cannot be produced by rational
  thinking.<br>
  <br>
  Like that little looking-glass from the fairy-tales: look into it
  and you will see - not yourself - but for one second, the
  Inaccessible, whither no man can ride, no man fly. And only the
  soul gives a groan ...</p><br>

  <h3>2</h3>

  <p>One day Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic
  remark: "Beauty will save the world". What sort of a statement is
  that? For a long time I considered it mere words. How could that
  be possible? When in bloodthirsty history did beauty ever save
  anyone from anything? Ennobled, uplifted, yes - but whom has it
  saved?<br>
  <br>
  There is, however, a certain peculiarity in the essence of
  beauty, a peculiarity in the status of art: namely, the
  convincingness of a true work of art is completely irrefutable
  and it forces even an opposing heart to surrender. It is possible
  to compose an outwardly smooth and elegant political speech, a
  headstrong article, a social program, or a philosophical system
  on the basis of both a mistake and a lie. What is hidden, what
  distorted, will not immediately become obvious.<br>
  <br>
  Then a contradictory speech, article, program, a differently
  constructed philosophy rallies in opposition - and all just as
  elegant and smooth, and once again it works. Which is why such
  things are both trusted and mistrusted.<br>
  <br>
  In vain to reiterate what does not reach the heart.<br>
  <br>
  But a work of art bears within itself its own verification:
  conceptions which are devised or stretched do not stand being
  portrayed in images, they all come crashing down, appear sickly
  and pale, convince no one. But those works of art which have
  scooped up the truth and presented it to us as a living force -
  they take hold of us, compel us, and nobody ever, not even in
  ages to come, will appear to refute them.<br>
  <br>
  So perhaps that ancient trinity of Truth, Goodness and Beauty is
  not simply an empty, faded formula as we thought in the days of
  our self-confident, materialistic youth? If the tops of these
  three trees converge, as the scholars maintained, but the too
  blatant, too direct stems of Truth and Goodness are crushed, cut
  down, not allowed through - then perhaps the fantastic,
  unpredictable, unexpected stems of Beauty will push through and
  soar TO THAT VERY SAME PLACE, and in so doing will fulfil the
  work of all three?<br>
  <br>
  In that case Dostoevsky's remark, "Beauty will save the world",
  was not a careless phrase but a prophecy? After all HE was
  granted to see much, a man of fantastic illumination.<br>
  <br>
  And in that case art, literature might really be able to help the
  world today?<br>
  <br>
  It is the small insight which, over the years, I have succeeded
  in gaining into this matter that I shall attempt to lay before
  you here today.</p><br>

  <p>In order to mount this platform from which
  the Nobel lecture is read, a platform offered to far from every
  writer and only once in a lifetime, I have climbed not three or
  four makeshift steps, but hundreds and even thousands of them;
  unyielding, precipitous, frozen steps, leading out of the
  darkness and cold where it was my fate to survive, while others -
  perhaps with a greater gift and stronger than I - have perished.
  Of them, I myself met but a few on the Archipelago of
  GULAG<a href="#not_2"><sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></a>,
  shattered into its fractionary multitude of islands; and beneath
  the millstone of shadowing and mistrust I did not talk to them
  all, of some I only heard, of others still I only guessed. Those
  who fell into that abyss already bearing a literary name are at
  least known, but how many were never recognized, never once
  mentioned in public? And virtually no one managed to return. A
  whole national literature remained there, cast into oblivion not
  only without a grave, but without even underclothes, naked, with
  a number tagged on to its toe. Russian literature did not cease
  for a moment, but from the outside it appeared a wasteland! Where
  a peaceful forest could have grown, there remained, after all the
  felling, two or three trees overlooked by chance.<br>
  <br>
  And as I stand here today, accompanied by the shadows of the
  fallen, with bowed head allowing others who were worthy before to
  pass ahead of me to this place, as I stand here, how am I to
  divine and to express what THEY would have wished to say?<br>
  <br>
  This obligation has long weighed upon us, and we have understood
  it. In the words of Vladimir Solov'ev:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Even in chains we ourselves must
    complete<br>
    That circle which the gods have mapped out for us.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Frequently, in painful camp seethings, in a
  column of prisoners, when chains of lanterns pierced the gloom of
  the evening frosts, there would well up inside us the words that
  we should like to cry out to the whole world, if the whole world
  could hear one of us. Then it seemed so clear: what our
  successful ambassador would say, and how the world would
  immediately respond with its comment. Our horizon embraced quite
  distinctly both physical things and spiritual movements, and it
  saw no lop-sidedness in the indivisible world. These ideas did
  not come from books, neither were they imported for the sake of
  coherence. They were formed in conversations with people now
  dead, in prison cells and by forest fires, they were tested
  against THAT life, they grew out of THAT existence.<br>
  <br>
  When at last the outer pressure grew a little weaker, my and our
  horizon broadened and gradually, albeit through a minute chink,
  we saw and knew "the whole world". And to our amazement the whole
  world was not at all as we had expected, as we had hoped; that is
  to say a world living "not by that", a world leading "not there",
  a world which could exclaim at the sight of a muddy swamp, "what
  a delightful little puddle!", at concrete neck stocks, "what an
  exquisite necklace!"; but instead a world where some weep
  inconsolate tears and others dance to a light-hearted
  musical.<br>
  <br>
  How could this happen? Why the yawning gap? Were we insensitive?
  Was the world insensitive? Or is it due to language differences?
  Why is it that people are not able to hear each other's every
  distinct utterance? Words cease to sound and run away like water
  - without taste, colour, smell. Without trace.<br>
  <br>
  As I have come to understand this, so through the years has
  changed and changed again the structure, content and tone of my
  potential speech. The speech I give today.<br>
  <br>
  And it has little in common with its original plan, conceived on
  frosty camp evenings.</p><br>

  <h3>4</h3>

  <p>From time immemorial man has been made in
  such a way that his vision of the world, so long as it has not
  been instilled under hypnosis, his motivations and scale of
  values, his actions and intentions are determined by his personal
  and group experience of life. As the Russian saying goes, "Do not
  believe your brother, believe your own crooked eye." And that is
  the most sound basis for an understanding of the world around us
  and of human conduct in it. And during the long epochs when our
  world lay spread out in mystery and wilderness, before it became
  encroached by common lines of communication, before it was
  transformed into a single, convulsively pulsating lump - men,
  relying on experience, ruled without mishap within their limited
  areas, within their communities, within their societies, and
  finally on their national territories. At that time it was
  possible for individual human beings to perceive and accept a
  general scale of values, to distinguish between what is
  considered normal, what incredible; what is cruel and what lies
  beyond the boundaries of wickedness; what is honesty, what
  deceit. And although the scattered peoples led extremely
  different lives and their social values were often strikingly at
  odds, just as their systems of weights and measures did not
  agree, still these discrepancies surprised only occasional
  travellers, were reported in journals under the name of wonders,
  and bore no danger to mankind which was not yet one.<br>
  <br>
  But now during the past few decades, imperceptibly, suddenly,
  mankind has become one - hopefully one and dangerously one - so
  that the concussions and inflammations of one of its parts are
  almost instantaneously passed on to others, sometimes lacking in
  any kind of necessary immunity. Mankind has become one, but not
  steadfastly one as communities or even nations used to be; not
  united through years of mutual experience, neither through
  possession of a single eye, affectionately called crooked, nor
  yet through a common native language, but, surpassing all
  barriers, through international broadcasting and print. An
  avalanche of events descends upon us - in one minute half the
  world hears of their splash. But the yardstick by which to
  measure those events and to evaluate them in accordance with the
  laws of unfamiliar parts of the world - this is not and cannot be
  conveyed via soundwaves and in newspaper columns. For these
  yardsticks were matured and assimilated over too many years of
  too specific conditions in individual countries and societies;
  they cannot be exchanged in mid-air. In the various parts of the
  world men apply their own hard-earned values to events, and they
  judge stubbornly, confidently, only according to their own scales
  of values and never according to any others.<br>
  <br>
  And if there are not many such different scales of values in the
  world, there are at least several; one for evaluating events near
  at hand, another for events far away; aging societies possess
  one, young societies another; unsuccessful people one, successful
  people another. The divergent scales of values scream in
  discordance, they dazzle and daze us, and in order that it might
  not be painful we steer clear of all other values, as though from
  insanity, as though from illusion, and we confidently judge the
  whole world according to our own home values. Which is why we
  take for the greater, more painful and less bearable disaster not
  that which is in fact greater, more painful and less bearable,
  but that which lies closest to us. Everything which is further
  away, which does not threaten this very day to invade our
  threshold - with all its groans, its stifled cries, its destroyed
  lives, even if it involves millions of victims - this we consider
  on the whole to be perfectly bearable and of tolerable
  proportions.<br>
  <br>
  In one part of the world, not so long ago, under persecutions not
  inferior to those of the ancient Romans', hundreds of thousands
  of silent Christians gave up their lives for their belief in God.
  In the other hemisphere a certain madman, (and no doubt he is not
  alone), speeds across the ocean to DELIVER us from religion -
  with a thrust of steel into the high priest! He has calculated
  for each and every one of us according to his personal scale of
  values!<br>
  <br>
  That which from a distance, according to one scale of values,
  appears as enviable and flourishing freedom, at close quarters,
  and according to other values, is felt to be infuriating
  constraint calling for buses to be overthrown. That which in one
  part of the world might represent a dream of incredible
  prosperity, in another has the exasperating effect of wild
  exploitation demanding immediate strike. There are different
  scales of values for natural catastrophes: a flood craving two
  hundred thousand lives seems less significant than our local
  accident. There are different scales of values for personal
  insults: sometimes even an ironic smile or a dismissive gesture
  is humiliating, while for others cruel beatings are forgiven as
  an unfortunate joke. There are different scales of values for
  punishment and wickedness: according to one, a month's arrest,
  banishment to the country, or an isolation-cell where one is fed
  on white rolls and milk, shatters the imagination and fills the
  newspaper columns with rage. While according to another, prison
  sentences of twenty-five years, isolation-cells where the walls
  are covered with ice and the prisoners stripped to their
  underclothes, lunatic asylums for the sane, and countless
  unreasonable people who for some reason will keep running away,
  shot on the frontiers - all this is common and accepted. While
  the mind is especially at peace concerning that exotic part of
  the world about which we know virtually nothing, from which we do
  not even receive news of events, but only the trivial,
  out-of-date guesses of a few correspondents.<br>
  <br>
  Yet we cannot reproach human vision for this duality, for this
  dumbfounded incomprehension of another man's distant grief, man
  is just made that way. But for the whole of mankind, compressed
  into a single lump, such mutual incomprehension presents the
  threat of imminent and violent destruction. One world, one
  mankind cannot exist in the face of six, four or even two scales
  of values: we shall be torn apart by this disparity of rhythm,
  this disparity of vibrations.<br>
  <br>
  A man with two hearts is not for this world, neither shall we be
  able to live side by side on one Earth.</p><br>

  <h3>5</h3>

  <p>But who will co-ordinate these value
  scales, and how? Who will create for mankind one system of
  interpretation, valid for good and evil deeds, for the unbearable
  and the bearable, as they are differentiated today? Who will make
  clear to mankind what is really heavy and intolerable and what
  only grazes the skin locally? Who will direct the anger to that
  which is most terrible and not to that which is nearer? Who might
  succeed in transferring such an understanding beyond the limits
  of his own human experience? Who might succeed in impressing upon
  a bigoted, stubborn human creature the distant joy and grief of
  others, an understanding of dimensions and deceptions which he
  himself has never experienced? Propaganda, constraint, scientific
  proof - all are useless. But fortunately there does exist such a
  means in our world! That means is art. That means is
  literature.<br>
  <br>
  They can perform a miracle: they can overcome man's detrimental
  peculiarity of learning only from personal experience so that the
  experience of other people passes him by in vain. From man to
  man, as he completes his brief spell on Earth, art transfers the
  whole weight of an unfamiliar, lifelong experience with all its
  burdens, its colours, its sap of life; it recreates in the flesh
  an unknown experience and allows us to possess it as our
  own.<br>
  <br>
  And even more, much more than that; both countries and whole
  continents repeat each other's mistakes with time lapses which
  can amount to centuries. Then, one would think, it would all be
  so obvious! But no; that which some nations have already
  experienced, considered and rejected, is suddenly discovered by
  others to be the latest word. And here again, the only substitute
  for an experience we ourselves have never lived through is art,
  literature. They possess a wonderful ability: beyond distinctions
  of language, custom, social structure, they can convey the life
  experience of one whole nation to another. To an inexperienced
  nation they can convey a harsh national trial lasting many
  decades, at best sparing an entire nation from a superfluous, or
  mistaken, or even disastrous course, thereby curtailing the
  meanderings of human history.<br>
  <br>
  It is this great and noble property of art that I urgently recall
  to you today from the Nobel tribune.<br>
  <br>
  And literature conveys irrefutable condensed experience in yet
  another invaluable direction; namely, from generation to
  generation. Thus it becomes the living memory of the nation. Thus
  it preserves and kindles within itself the flame of her spent
  history, in a form which is safe from deformation and slander. In
  this way literature, together with language, protects the soul of
  the nation.<br>
  <br>
  (In recent times it has been fashionable to talk of the levelling
  of nations, of the disappearance of different races in the
  melting-pot of contemporary civilization. I do not agree with
  this opinion, but its discussion remains another question. Here
  it is merely fitting to say that the disappearance of nations
  would have impoverished us no less than if all men had become
  alike, with one personality and one face. Nations are the wealth
  of mankind, its collective personalities; the very least of them
  wears its own special colours and bears within itself a special
  facet of divine intention.)<br>
  <br>
  But woe to that nation whose literature is disturbed by the
  intervention of power. Because that is not just a violation
  against "freedom of print", it is the closing down of the heart
  of the nation, a slashing to pieces of its memory. The nation
  ceases to be mindful of itself, it is deprived of its spiritual
  unity, and despite a supposedly common language, compatriots
  suddenly cease to understand one another. Silent generations grow
  old and die without ever having talked about themselves, either
  to each other or to their descendants. When writers such as
  Achmatova and Zamjatin - interred alive throughout their lives -
  are condemned to create in silence until they die, never hearing
  the echo of their written words, then that is not only their
  personal tragedy, but a sorrow to the whole nation, a danger to
  the whole nation.<br>
  <br>
  In some cases moreover - when as a result of such a silence the
  whole of history ceases to be understood in its entirety - it is
  a danger to the whole of mankind.</p><br>

  <h3>6</h3>

  <p>At various times and in various countries
  there have arisen heated, angry and exquisite debates as to
  whether art and the artist should be free to live for themselves,
  or whether they should be for ever mindful of their duty towards
  society and serve it albeit in an unprejudiced way. For me there
  is no dilemma, but I shall refrain from raising once again the
  train of arguments. One of the most brilliant addresses on this
  subject was actually <a href="../1957/index.html">Albert
  Camus'</a> Nobel speech, and I would happily subscribe to his
  conclusions. Indeed, Russian literature has for several decades
  manifested an inclination not to become too lost in contemplation
  of itself, not to flutter about too frivolously. I am not ashamed
  to continue this tradition to the best of my ability. Russian
  literature has long been familiar with the notions that a writer
  can do much within his society, and that it is his duty to do
  so.<br>
  <br>
  Let us not violate the RIGHT of the artist to express exclusively
  his own experiences and introspections, disregarding everything
  that happens in the world beyond. Let us not DEMAND of the
  artist, but - reproach, beg, urge and entice him - that we may be
  allowed to do. After all, only in part does he himself develop
  his talent; the greater part of it is blown into him at birth as
  a finished product, and the gift of talent imposes responsibility
  on his free will. Let us assume that the artist does not OWE
  anybody anything: nevertheless, it is painful to see how, by
  retiring into his self-made worlds or the spaces of his
  subjective whims, he CAN surrender the real world into the hands
  of men who are mercenary, if not worthless, if not insane.<br>
  <br>
  Our Twentieth Century has proved to be more cruel than preceding
  centuries, and the first fifty years have not erased all its
  horrors. Our world is rent asunder by those same old cave-age
  emotions of greed, envy, lack of control, mutual hostility which
  have picked up in passing respectable pseudonyms like class
  struggle, racial conflict, struggle of the masses, trade-union
  disputes. The primeval refusal to accept a compromise has been
  turned into a theoretical principle and is considered the virtue
  of orthodoxy. It demands millions of sacrifices in ceaseless
  civil wars, it drums into our souls that there is no such thing
  as unchanging, universal concepts of goodness and justice, that
  they are all fluctuating and inconstant. Therefore the rule -
  always do what's most profitable to your party. Any professional
  group no sooner sees a convenient opportunity to BREAK OFF A
  PIECE, even if it be unearned, even if it be superfluous, than it
  breaks it off there and then and no matter if the whole of
  society comes tumbling down. As seen from the outside, the
  amplitude of the tossings of western society is approaching that
  point beyond which the system becomes metastable and must fall.
  Violence, less and less embarrassed by the limits imposed by
  centuries of lawfulness, is brazenly and victoriously striding
  across the whole world, unconcerned that its infertility has been
  demonstrated and proved many times in history. What is more, it
  is not simply crude power that triumphs abroad, but its exultant
  justification. The world is being inundated by the brazen
  conviction that power can do anything, justice nothing.
  Dostoevsky's DEVILS - apparently a provincial nightmare fantasy
  of the last century - are crawling across the whole world in
  front of our very eyes, infesting countries where they could not
  have been dreamed of; and by means of the hijackings,
  kidnappings, explosions and fires of recent years they are
  announcing their determination to shake and destroy civilization!
  And they may well succeed. The young, at an age when they have
  not yet any experience other than sexual, when they do not yet
  have years of personal suffering and personal understanding
  behind them, are jubilantly repeating our depraved Russian
  blunders of the Nineteenth Century, under the impression that
  they are discovering something new. They acclaim the latest
  wretched degradation on the part of the Chinese Red Guards as a
  joyous example. In shallow lack of understanding of the age-old
  essence of mankind, in the naive confidence of inexperienced
  hearts they cry: let us drive away THOSE cruel, greedy
  oppressors, governments, and the new ones (we!), having laid
  aside grenades and rifles, will be just and understanding. Far
  from it! . . . But of those who have lived more and understand,
  those who could oppose these young - many do not dare oppose,
  they even suck up, anything not to appear "conservative". Another
  Russian phenomenon of the Nineteenth Century which Dostoevsky
  called SLAVERY TO PROGRESSIVE QUIRKS.<br>
  <br>
  The spirit of Munich has by no means retreated into the past; it
  was not merely a brief episode. I even venture to say that the
  spirit of Munich prevails in the Twentieth Century. The timid
  civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the
  onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity, other than
  concessions and smiles. The spirit of Munich is a sickness of the
  will of successful people, it is the daily condition of those who
  have given themselves up to the thirst after prosperity at any
  price, to material well-being as the chief goal of earthly
  existence. Such people - and there are many in today's world -
  elect passivity and retreat, just so as their accustomed life
  might drag on a bit longer, just so as not to step over the
  threshold of hardship today - and tomorrow, you'll see, it will
  all be all right. (But it will never be all right! The price of
  cowardice will only be evil; we shall reap courage and victory
  only when we dare to make sacrifices.)<br>
  <br>
  And on top of this we are threatened by destruction in the fact
  that the physically compressed, strained world is not allowed to
  blend spiritually; the molecules of knowledge and sympathy are
  not allowed to jump over from one half to the other. This
  presents a rampant danger: THE SUPPRESSION OF INFORMATION between
  the parts of the planet. Contemporary science knows that
  suppression of information leads to entropy and total
  destruction. Suppression of information renders international
  signatures and agreements illusory; within a muffled zone it
  costs nothing to reinterpret any agreement, even simpler - to
  forget it, as though it had never really existed. (Orwell
  understood this supremely.) A muffled zone is, as it were,
  populated not by inhabitants of the Earth, but by an
  expeditionary corps from Mars; the people know nothing
  intelligent about the rest of the Earth and are prepared to go
  and trample it down in the holy conviction that they come as
  "liberators".<br>
  <br>
  A quarter of a century ago, in the great hopes of mankind, the
  United Nations Organization was born. Alas, in an immoral world,
  this too grew up to be immoral. It is not a United Nations
  Organization but a United Governments Organization where all
  governments stand equal; those which are freely elected, those
  imposed forcibly, and those which have seized power with weapons.
  Relying on the mercenary partiality of the majority UNO jealously
  guards the freedom of some nations and neglects the freedom of
  others. As a result of an obedient vote it declined to undertake
  the investigation of private appeals - the groans, screams and
  beseechings of humble individual PLAIN PEOPLE - not large enough
  a catch for such a great organization. UNO made no effort to make
  the Declaration of Human Rights, its best document in twenty-five
  years, into an OBLIGATORY condition of membership confronting the
  governments. Thus it betrayed those humble people into the will
  of the governments which they had not chosen.<br>
  <br>
  It would seem that the appearance of the contemporary world rests
  solely in the hands of the scientists; all mankind's technical
  steps are determined by them. It would seem that it is precisely
  on the international goodwill of scientists, and not of
  politicians, that the direction of the world should depend. All
  the more so since the example of the few shows how much could be
  achieved were they all to pull together. But no; scientists have
  not manifested any clear attempt to become an important,
  independently active force of mankind. They spend entire
  congresses in renouncing the sufferings of others; better to stay
  safely within the precincts of science. That same spirit of
  Munich has spread above them its enfeebling wings.<br>
  <br>
  What then is the place and role of the writer in this cruel,
  dynamic, split world on the brink of its ten destructions? After
  all we have nothing to do with letting off rockets, we do not
  even push the lowliest of hand-carts, we are quite scorned by
  those who respect only material power. Is it not natural for us
  too to step back, to lose faith in the steadfastness of goodness,
  in the indivisibility of truth, and to just impart to the world
  our bitter, detached observations: how mankind has become
  hopelessly corrupt, how men have degenerated, and how difficult
  it is for the few beautiful and refined souls to live amongst
  them?<br>
  <br>
  But we have not even recourse to this flight. Anyone who has once
  taken up the WORD can never again evade it; a writer is not the
  detached judge of his compatriots and contemporaries, he is an
  accomplice to all the evil committed in his native land or by his
  countrymen. And if the tanks of his fatherland have flooded the
  asphalt of a foreign capital with blood, then the brown spots
  have slapped against the face of the writer forever. And if one
  fatal night they suffocated his sleeping, trusting Friend, then
  the palms of the writer bear the bruises from that rope. And if
  his young fellow citizens breezily declare the superiority of
  depravity over honest work, if they give themselves over to drugs
  or seize hostages, then their stink mingles with the breath of
  the writer.<br>
  <br>
  Shall we have the temerity to declare that we are not responsible
  for the sores of the present-day world?</p><br>

  <p>However, I am cheered by a vital awareness
  of WORLD LITERATURE as of a single huge heart, beating out the
  cares and troubles of our world, albeit presented and perceived
  differently in each of its corners.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from age-old national literatures there existed, even in
  past ages, the conception of world literature as an anthology
  skirting the heights of the national literatures, and as the sum
  total of mutual literary influences. But there occurred a lapse in
  time: readers and writers became acquainted with writers of other
  tongues only after a time lapse, sometimes lasting centuries, so
  that mutual influences were also delayed and the anthology of
  national literary heights was revealed only in the eyes of
  descendants, not of contemporaries.<br>
  <br>
  But today, between the writers of one country and the writers and
  readers of another, there is a reciprocity if not instantaneous
  then almost so. I experience this with myself. Those of my books
  which, alas, have not been printed in my own country have soon
  found a responsive, worldwide audience, despite hurried and often
  bad translations. Such distinguished western writers as Heinrich
  B&ouml;ll have undertaken critical analysis of them. All these
  last years, when my work and freedom have not come crashing down,
  when contrary to the laws of gravity they have hung suspended as
  though on air, as though on NOTHING - on the invisible dumb
  tension of a sympathetic public membrane; then it was with
  grateful warmth, and quite unexpectedly for myself, that I learnt
  of the further support of the international brotherhood of
  writers. On my fiftieth birthday I was astonished to receive
  congratulations from well-known western writers. No pressure on
  me came to pass by unnoticed. During my dangerous weeks of
  exclusion from the Writers' Union the WALL OF DEFENCE advanced by
  the world's prominent writers protected me from worse
  persecutions; and Norwegian writers and artists hospitably
  prepared a roof for me, in the event of my threatened exile being
  put into effect. Finally even the advancement of my name for the
  Nobel Prize was raised not in the country where I live and write,
  but by Francois Mauriac and his colleagues. And later still
  entire national writers' unions have expressed their support for
  me.<br>
  <br>
  Thus I have understood and felt that world literature is no
  longer an abstract anthology, nor a generalization invented by
  literary historians; it is rather a certain common body and a
  common spirit, a living heartfelt unity reflecting the growing
  unity of mankind. State frontiers still turn crimson, heated by
  electric wire and bursts of machine fire; and various ministries
  of internal affairs still think that literature too is an
  "internal affair" falling under their jurisdiction; newspaper
  headlines still display: "No right to interfere in our internal
  affairs!" Whereas there are no INTERNAL AFFAIRS left on our
  crowded Earth! And mankind's sole salvation lies in everyone
  making everything his business; in the people of the East being
  vitally concerned with what is thought in the West, the people of
  the West vitally concerned with what goes on in the East. And
  literature, as one of the most sensitive, responsive instruments
  possessed by the human creature, has been one of the first to
  adopt, to assimilate, to catch hold of this feeling of a growing
  unity of mankind. And so I turn with confidence to the world
  literature of today - to hundreds of friends whom I have never
  met in the flesh and whom I may never see.<br>
  <br>
  Friends! Let us try to help if we are worth anything at all! Who
  from time immemorial has constituted the uniting, not the
  dividing, strength in your countries, lacerated by discordant
  parties, movements, castes and groups? There in its essence is
  the position of writers: expressers of their native language -
  the chief binding force of the nation, of the very earth its
  people occupy, and at best of its national spirit.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that world literature has it in its power to help
  mankind, in these its troubled hours, to see itself as it really
  is, notwithstanding the indoctrinations of prejudiced people and
  parties. World literature has it in its power to convey condensed
  experience from one land to another so that we might cease to be
  split and dazzled, that the different scales of values might be
  made to agree, and one nation learn correctly and concisely the
  true history of another with such strength of recognition and
  painful awareness as it had itself experienced the same, and thus
  might it be spared from repeating the same cruel mistakes. And
  perhaps under such conditions we artists will be able to
  cultivate within ourselves a field of vision to embrace the WHOLE
  WORLD: in the centre observing like any other human being that
  which lies nearby, at the edges we shall begin to draw in that
  which is happening in the rest of the world. And we shall
  correlate, and we shall observe world proportions.<br>
  <br>
  And who, if not writers, are to pass judgement - not only on
  their unsuccessful governments, (in some states this is the
  easiest way to earn one's bread, the occupation of any man who is
  not lazy), but also on the people themselves, in their cowardly
  humiliation or self-satisfied weakness? Who is to pass judgement
  on the light-weight sprints of youth, and on the young pirates
  brandishing their knives?<br>
  <br>
  We shall be told: what can literature possibly do against the
  ruthless onslaught of open violence? But let us not forget that
  violence does not live alone and is not capable of living alone:
  it is necessarily interwoven with falsehood. Between them lies
  the most intimate, the deepest of natural bonds. Violence finds
  its only refuge in falsehood, falsehood its only support in
  violence. Any man who has once acclaimed violence as his METHOD
  must inexorably choose falsehood as his PRINCIPLE. At its birth
  violence acts openly and even with pride. But no sooner does it
  become strong, firmly established, than it senses the rarefaction
  of the air around it and it cannot continue to exist without
  descending into a fog of lies, clothing them in sweet talk. It
  does not always, not necessarily, openly throttle the throat,
  more often it demands from its subjects only an oath of
  allegiance to falsehood, only complicity in falsehood.<br>
  <br>
  And the simple step of a simple courageous man is not to partake
  in falsehood, not to support false actions! Let THAT enter the
  world, let it even reign in the world - but not with my help. But
  writers and artists can achieve more: they can CONQUER FALSEHOOD!
  In the struggle with falsehood art always did win and it always
  does win! Openly, irrefutably for everyone! Falsehood can hold
  out against much in this world, but not against art.<br>
  <br>
  And no sooner will falsehood be dispersed than the nakedness of
  violence will be revealed in all its ugliness - and violence,
  decrepit, will fall.<br>
  <br>
  That is why, my friends, I believe that we are able to help the
  world in its white-hot hour. Not by making the excuse of
  possessing no weapons, and not by giving ourselves over to a
  frivolous life - but by going to war!<br>
  <br>
  Proverbs about truth are well-loved in Russian. They give steady
  and sometimes striking expression to the not inconsiderable harsh
  national experience:<br>
  <br>
  ONE WORD OF TRUTH SHALL OUTWEIGH THE WHOLE WORLD.<br>
  <br>
  And it is here, on an imaginary fantasy, a breach of the
  principle of the conservation of mass and energy, that I base
  both my own activity and my appeal to the writers of the whole
  world.</p>
