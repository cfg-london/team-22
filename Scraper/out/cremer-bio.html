  <h1>Randal Cremer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cremer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>William
  Randal Cremer</b> (March 18, 1828<a href=
  "#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>-July 22, 1908) was born in the small
  town of Fareham, England, not far from Portsmouth, into a working
  class family at a time when intense misery was the workingman's
  lot. His father, a coach painter, deserted the family while the
  boy was still an infant. His mother, an indomitable woman, raised
  her son and two daughters despite stringent poverty and even sent
  her son to school - a church school, for she was a strong
  Methodist. At fifteen he was apprenticed to an uncle in the
  building trades, eventually becoming a full-fledged carpenter.
  During this time he supplemented his meager formal education by
  attending lectures. On one occasion he heard a lecture on peace
  in which the speaker suggested that international disputes be
  settled by arbitration, an idea that Cremer never forgot.<br>
  <br>
  Cremer moved to London in 1852. There his capacity for
  administration was recognized in 1858 when, at the age of thirty,
  he was elected to a council of those running a campaign for the
  nine-hour day; later in that year he was one of seven who
  directed labor during a lockout of 70,000 men. He was
  instrumental in forming a single union for his trade: the
  Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners; he participated in
  the formation of the International Working Men's Association but
  withdrew his support when the Association was taken over by more
  revolutionary thinkers.<br>
  <br>
  Inevitably, it occurred to Cremer that labor should be actively
  represented in Parliament. He stood for Warwick in 1868 on a
  liberal platform calling for the vote by ballot, compulsory
  education, Irish disestablishment, direct taxation, land reform,
  amendment of the laws governing labor unions, creation of courts
  of conciliation to handle labor-management disputes and of
  international boards of arbitration to adjudicate disputes among
  nations. He was defeated then and again in 1874. But after the
  third Reform Bill of 1885 created the new constituency of
  Haggerston in suburban London, which consisted almost entirely of
  workingmen, he was elected to Parliament in 1885, 1886, and 1892.
  Defeated in 1895, he was reelected in 1900, retaining his seat
  until his death.<br>
  <br>
  Cremer used his power as a member of Parliament and his prestige
  as a labor leader to advance his passionate belief that peace was
  the only acceptable state for mankind and arbitration the method
  by which it could be achieved. A committee of workingmen which he
  formed in 1870 to promote England's neutrality during the
  Franco-Prussian conflict became the Workmen's Peace Association
  in 1871 and it, in turn, provided the keystone for the
  International Arbitration League, an association to which he
  thereafter contributed both his time and his money.<br>
  <br>
  In 1887, two years after entering Parliament, Cremer secured 234
  signatures of members of Commons to a resolution addressed to the
  President and the Congress of the United States urging them to
  conclude with the government of Great Britain a treaty
  stipulating that disputes arising between the two governments
  which defied settlement by diplomacy should be referred to
  arbitration. In that same year Cremer, heading a delegation of
  British statesmen, presented the resolution to President
  Cleveland.<br>
  <br>
  The resolution excited the interest of <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy</a> and other
  French deputies who invited Cremer and his colleagues to an
  exploratory meeting in Paris in 1888. As a result of this meeting
  the Interparliamentary
  Union<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was formed and its
  first meeting held in Paris in 1889, with representatives from
  eight nations in attendance. Cremer was elected vice-president of
  the Union and secretary of the British section.<br>
  <br>
  Cremer was a lonely man: his first wife died in 1876, his second
  in 1884; there were no children. He lived simply, enjoyed nature,
  worked long hours. He was also a generous man. The cash value of
  the Nobel Peace Prize in 1903 was about &pound;8,000. He
  immediately gave &pound;7,000 to the League of which he was
  secretary and later an additional &pound;1,000.<br>
  <br>
  Stricken by pneumonia, he died on July 22, 1908.</p>

  Prix Nobel,</i> the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, the
  (London) <i>Times</i>, <i>Who's Who</i>, the <i>Guide to
  Periodical Literature</i>, and the <i>Annual Register</i> give
  1838 as the year of Cremer's birth. Sir Randal's biographer,
  Howard Evans, gives 1828. Investigation confirms this latter
  date. The following entry appears in the baptismal register of
  the Wesleyan Chapel, Daniel Street, Portsea, Portsmouth
  (RG4/563): &laquo;William Randall, son of George Morris and
  Harriett Cremer, was born March 18, 1828, and baptized July 6th,
  1828. Residence Fareham by me, W. Toase, Minister.&raquo; This
  information was sent to the editor by C.F. Coghlan, correspondent
  and trustee of the Cremer Cottages Charity, in a letter dated
  October 21, 1969, Fareham, Hants, England. The name
  <i>Randall</i> is here written with two &laquo;l's&raquo;, but
  Cremer always wrote his name with one &laquo;l&raquo;.<br>
