  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not_1" id="not_1"></a>1. <i>Les
  Prix Nobel,</i> the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, the
  (London) <i>Times</i>, <i>Who's Who</i>, the <i>Guide to
  Periodical Literature</i>, and the <i>Annual Register</i> give
  1838 as the year of Cremer's birth. Sir Randal's biographer,
  Howard Evans, gives 1828. Investigation confirms this latter
  date. The following entry appears in the baptismal register of
  the Wesleyan Chapel, Daniel Street, Portsea, Portsmouth
  (RG4/563): &laquo;William Randall, son of George Morris and
  Harriett Cremer, was born March 18, 1828, and baptized July 6th,
  1828. Residence Fareham by me, W. Toase, Minister.&raquo; This
  information was sent to the editor by C.F. Coghlan, correspondent
  and trustee of the Cremer Cottages Charity, in a letter dated
  October 21, 1969, Fareham, Hants, England. The name
  <i>Randall</i> is here written with two &laquo;l's&raquo;, but
  Cremer always wrote his name with one &laquo;l&raquo;.<br>
