  <h1>Richard L.M. Synge - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="synge.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Richard Laurence Millington Synge</b>
  was born at Liverpool on October 28th, 1914, as the son of
  Laurence Millington Synge, of Liverpool Stock Exchange, and
  Katharine Charlotte Swan. In 1928 he went to Winchester College,
  where he studied mainly classics until 1931, thereafter natural
  science. In 1933 he entered Trinity College, University of
  Cambridge and studied physics, chemistry and physiology for
  Part I of the Natural Sciences Tripos (1935) and biochemistry for
  Part II (1936). During 1936-1939 he was a research student under
  supervision of Mr. N.W. Pirie in the University Biochemical
  Laboratory headed by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/index.html">Sir Frederick G.
  Hopkins</a>, and during 1939-1941 at the Wool Industries Research
  Association at Leeds. He obtained his Ph.D. degree at Cambridge
  in 1941. In the same year, he joined the staff of the Wool
  Industries Research Association at Leeds and in 1943 that of the
  Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London, in the
  Biochemistry Department under W.T.J. Morgan. Since 1948, he has
  been Head of the Department of Protein Chemistry at the Rowett
  Research Institute at Bucksburn, Aberdeen.<br>
  <br>
  The circumstances of his work up to 1945, including the
  collaborative work on partition chromatography and related
  topics, are described in the Nobel Lectures by A.J.P. Martin and
  himself. They gave the first demonstration of partition
  chromatography to the Biochemical Society at its meeting at the
  National Institute for Medical Research, London, on June 7th,
  1941 [<i>Chem.Ind.(Lond.),</i> 19 (1941) 487], the first
  published description appearing in the <i>Biochemical
  Journal,</i> 35 (1941) 1358.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1945 Dr. Synge has been mainly interested in analytical
  problems concerning the larger peptide molecules, as antibiotics
  and as intermediates in protein metabolism. From 1942 to 1948 he
  worked almost exclusively with the antibiotic peptides of the
  gramicidin group. In 1946-1947 he spent eight months with
  Professor <a href="../1948/index.html">Tiselius</a> at Uppsala,
  studying the application of his adsorption methods to these
  compounds.<br>
  <br>
  At the Rowett Research Institute, directed by D.P. Cuthbertson,
  he has been particularly concerned with the digestion of proteins
  by the ruminant animal and its associated micro-organisms, with
  peptides, proteins and other components of plant material, and
  with physico-chemical methods for the purification of
  intermediates in the metabolism of proteins. Work begun about
  1950 with D.L. Mould and A. Tiselius on electrokinetic
  ultrafiltraltion of various polysaccharides has been developed in
  a number of directions to take advantage of molecular-sieve
  effects, especially in the presence of hydrogen-bond breaking
  solvents.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958-1959, he spent a year at Ruakura Animal Research Station,
  Hamilton, New Zealand, working with E.P. White on isolation of
  the toxic fungal component sporidesmin.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Synge was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in
  1950 and of the Royal Institute of Chemistry in 1952. He is an
  honorary member of the American Society of Biological
  Chemists.<br>
  <br>
  In 1943 he married Ann Stephen, daughter of the late Adrian and
  Karin Stephen, psychoanalysts. They have four daughters and three
  sons, in order of decreasing age: Jane, Elizabeth, Matthew
  Millington, Patrick Millington, Alexander Millington, Charlotte,
  and Mary.</p>
