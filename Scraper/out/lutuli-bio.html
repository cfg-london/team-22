  <h1>Albert Lutuli - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lutuli.jpg" class="bio-img"> Chief of his
  tribe and president-general of the African National Congress,
  <b>Albert John Lutuli</b><a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
  (1898?-July 21, 1967) was the leader of ten million black
  Africans in their nonviolent campaign for civil rights in South
  Africa. A man of noble bearing, charitable, intolerant of hatred,
  and adamant in his demands for equality and peace among all men,
  Lutuli forged a philosophical compatibility between two cultures
  - the Zulu culture of his native Africa and the
  Christian-democratic culture of Europe.<br>
  <br>
  Lutuli was heir to a tradition of tribal leadership. His
  grandfather was chief of his small tribe at Groutville in the
  Umvoti Mission Reserve near Stanger, Natal, and was succeeded by
  a son. Lutuli's father was a younger son, John Bunyan Lutuli, who
  became a Christian missionary and spent most of the last years of
  his life in the missions among the Matabele of Rhodesia. Lutuli's
  mother, Mtonya Gumede, spent part of her childhood in the
  household of King Cetewayo but was raised in Groutville. She
  joined her husband in Rhodesia where her third son, Albert John,
  was born in what Lutuli calculates would probably have been 1898.
  Exactly when her husband died is not known, but by 1906 she and
  Albert John were back in Groutville.<br>
  <br>
  Supported by a mother who was determined that he get an
  education, Albert John Lutuli went to the local Congregationalist
  mission school for his primary work. He then studied at a
  boarding school called Ohlange Institute for two terms before
  transferring to a Methodist institution at Edendale, where he
  completed a teachers' course about 1917. After leaving a job as
  principal of an intermediate school, which he held for two years
  (he was also the entire staff, he says in his
  autobiography)<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a> - he completed
  the Higher Teachers' Training Course at Adams College, attending
  on a scholarship. To provide financial support for his mother, he
  declined a scholarship to University College at Fort Hare and
  accepted an appointment at Adams, as one of two Africans to join
  the staff.<br>
  <br>
  A professional educator for the next fifteen years, Lutuli then
  and afterwards contended that education should be made available
  to all Africans, that it should be liberal and not narrowly
  vocational in nature, and that its quality should be equal to
  that made available to white children. In 1928 he became
  secretary of the African Teacher's Association and in 1933 its
  president.<br>
  <br>
  Lutuli was also active in Christian church work, being a lay
  preacher for many years. As an adviser to the organized church,
  he became chairman of the South African Board of the
  Congregationalist Church of America, president of the Natal
  Mission Conference, and an executive member of the Christian
  Council of South Africa. He was a delegate to the International
  Missionary Conference in Madras in 1938 and in 1948 spent nine
  months on a lecture tour of the United States, sponsored by two
  missionary organizations.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927 Lutuli married a fellow teacher, Nokukhanya Bhengu. They
  established their permanent home in Groutville, where in 1929 the
  first of their seven children was born. In 1933 the tribal elders
  asked Lutuli to become chief of the tribe. For two years he
  hesitated, for he was loath to give up his profession and the
  financial security it afforded. He accepted the call in early
  1936 and, until removed from this office by the government in
  1952, devoted himself for the next seventeen years to the 5,000
  people who made up his tribe. He performed the judicial function
  of a magistrate, the mediating function of an official acting as
  representative of his people and at the same time as
  representative of the central government, the tribal function of
  a presiding dignitary at traditional festivities, and the
  executive function of a leader seeking a better life for his
  people.<br>
  <br>
  As the restrictions imposed by the Union government on nonwhites
  became increasingly complete, Lutuli's concern for his race
  transcended the tribal level to encompass the welfare of all
  black South Africans, and indeed of all South Africans. In 1936
  the government disenfranchised the only Africans who had had
  voting rights - those in Cape Province; in 1948 the Nationalist
  Party, in control of the government, adopted the policy of
  apartheid, or "total apartness"; in the 1950s the laws known as
  the Pass Laws, circumscribing the freedom of movement of
  Africans, were tightened; and throughout this period laws were
  added which put limitations on the African in almost every aspect
  of his life.<a href="#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  In 1944 Lutuli joined the African National Congress (ANC), an
  organization somewhat analogous to the American NAACP<a href=
  "#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a>, whose objective was to secure
  universal enfranchisement and the legal observance of human
  rights. In 1945 he was elected to the Committee of the Natal
  Provincial Division of ANC and in 1951 to the presidency of the
  Division. The next year he joined with other ANC leaders in
  organizing nonviolent campaigns to defy discriminatory laws. The
  government, charging Lutuli with a conflict of interest, demanded
  that he withdraw his membership in ANC or forfeit his office as
  tribal chief. Refusing to do either voluntarily, he was dismissed
  from his chieftainship, for chiefs hold office at the pleasure of
  the government even though elected by tribal elders.<br>
  <br>
  A month later Lutuli was elected president-general of ANC.
  Responding immediately, the government sought to minimize his
  effectiveness as a leader by banning him from the larger South
  African centers and from all public meetings for two years. Upon
  the expiration of that ban, he went to Johannesburg to address a
  meeting but at the airport was served with a second ban confining
  him to a twenty-mile radius of his home for another two years.
  When this second ban expired, he attended an ANC conference in
  1956, only to be arrested and charged with treason a few months
  later, along with 155 others. After being held in custody for
  about a year during the preliminary hearings, he was released in
  December, 1957, and the charges against him and sixty-four others
  were dropped.<br>
  <br>
  Lutuli's return to active leadership in 1958 was cut short by the
  imposition of a third ban, this time a five-year ban prohibiting
  him from publishing anything and confining him to a fifteen-mile
  radius of his home. The ban was temporarily lifted while he
  testified at the continuing treason trials (which ended with a
  verdict in1961 absolving ANC of Communist subservience and of
  plotting the violent overthrow of the government). It was lifted
  again in March, 1960, to permit his arrest for publicly burning
  his pass - a gesture of solidarity with those demonstrators
  against the Pass Laws who had died in the "Sharpeville massacre".
  The Pan-Africanist Congress, not the African National Congress,
  had called the demonstration, but in the ensuing state of
  emergency that was officially declared, Parliament outlawed both
  organizations and apprehended their leaders. Lutuli was found
  guilty, fined, given a jail sentence that was suspended because
  of the precarious state of his health, and returned to the
  isolation of Groutville. One final time the ban was lifted, this
  time for ten days in early December of 1961 to permit Lutuli and
  his wife to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremonies in
  Oslo.<br>
  <br>
  A fourth ban to run for five years confining Lutuli to the
  immediate vicinity of his home was issued in May, 1964, the day
  before the expiration of the third ban. Still, Lutuli remained
  undiminished in the public mind.<br>
  <br>
  The South African Colored People's Congress nominated him for
  president, the National Union of South African Students made him
  its honorary president, the students of Glasgow University
  voted him their rector, the New York City Protestant Council
  conferred an award on him. Despite the publication ban, his
  autobiography circulated in the outside world, and his name
  appeared on human rights petitions presented to the UN.<br>
  <br>
  For fifteen years or so before his death, Lutuli suffered from
  high blood pressure and once had a slight stroke. With age, his
  hearing and eyesight also became impaired - perhaps a factor in
  his death. For in July, 1967, at the age of sixty-nine, he was
  fatally injured when he was struck by a freight train as he
  walked on the trestle bridge over the Umvoti River near his
  home.</p>
