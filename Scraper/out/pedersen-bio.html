  <h1>Charles J. Pedersen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pedersen.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Pusan, Korea, on
  October 3, 1904. My father Brede Pedersen, was a Norwegian marine
  engineer who left home as a young man and shipped out as an
  engineer on a steam freighter to the Far East. He eventually
  arrived in Korea and joined the fleet of the Korean customs
  service, which was administered by the British. Later, he
  abandoned seafaring and became a mechanical engineer at the Unsan
  Mines in what is now the northwestern section of present-day
  North Korea.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Takino Yasui, was born in 1874 in Japan. She had
  accompanied her family to Korea when they decided to enter
  large-scale trade in soybeans and silkworms. They established
  headquarters not far from the Unsan Mines, where she met my
  father. I had a sister, Astrid, five years my senior, and an
  elder brother who died in childhood prior to my birth.<br>
  <br>
  The Unsan Mines were an American gold and lumber concession, 500
  square miles in area. Because the mines were administered by
  Americans, there was an effort to make life there as American as
  possible. English was the spoken language, and it was the
  language I learned as a child. Foreign language schools did not
  exist in Korea at that time and so at the age of 8 years I was
  sent to Japan to attend a convent school in Nagasaki. When I was
  10 years old my mother took me to Yokohama, and I began my
  studies at St. Joseph College. St. Joseph's was a preparatory
  school run by a Roman Catholic religious order of priests and
  brothers called the Society of Mary, also known as the
  Marianists. There I received a general secondary education and
  took my first course in chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  When it came time for university, I chose, with my father's
  encouragement, to study in America. I selected the University of
  Dayton because it was in Ohio were we had family and friends and
  because it too was run by the Society of Mary. After taking a
  bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at the University of
  Dayton, I went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where
  I obtained a master's degree in organic chemistry. I did not
  remain at MIT to take a Ph.D.; I was still being supported by my
  father, and I was anxious to begin working. In 1927, I obtained
  employment at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Delaware,
  through the good offices of Professor James F. Norris, a very
  prominent professor and my research advisor. At Du Pont, I was
  fortunate enough to be directed to research at Jackson Laboratory
  by William S. Calcott. I remained at Du Pont for my entire
  42-year career as a chemist.<br>
  <br>
  As a new scientist I was initially set to work on a series of
  typical problems, which I solved successfully. After a while, I
  began to search for oil-solvable precipitants for copper, and I
  found the first good metal deactivator for petroleum products. As
  a result of this work, I developed a great interest in the
  affects of various ligands on the catalytic properties of copper
  and the transition elements generally and worked in the field for
  several years.<br>
  <br>
  I next expanded my interests in the oxidative degradation of the
  substrates I was working on, namely petroleum products and
  rubber. By the mid-1940s I was in full career, having established
  myself in the field of antioxidants and independent in terms of
  the problems I might choose. In 1947, I was appointed research
  associate, then the highest title that a Du Pont Company
  researcher could attain. Also at that time, I married Susan Ault
  and settled in the town of Salem, New Jersey, where I have lived
  ever since.<br>
  <br>
  During the late '40s and '50s my scientific interests became more
  varied. I became interested in the photochemistry of some new
  phthalocyanine adducts and of quinoneimine dioxides. I developed
  polymerization initiators and even made some novel polymers. In
  1960 I returned to investigations in coordination chemistry, and
  decided to study the effects of bi- and multidentate phenolic
  ligands on the catalytic properties of the vanadyl group, VO. In
  the course of these investigations one of my experiments yielded
  an unexpected small quantity of unknown white crystals which I
  eventually identified as dibenzo18-crown-6, first crown ether.
  The last nine years of my career were spent in the further study
  of crown ethers. I retired from Du Pont in 1969. During my
  retirement, I have pursued interests in fishing, gardening, bird
  study and poetry.</p>
