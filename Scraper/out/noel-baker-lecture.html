  <h2><br>Peace and the Arms Race</h2>

  <p>Yesterday I tried to express my gratitude
  for the honor which I have received. Why has it come? [Mr. Gunnar
    Jahn, in his <a href="press.html">presentation speech</a>, gave part of the answer.] I have
    been of all men the most fortunate of all. I was my father's son.
    I was close friends with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1933/index.html">Norman Angell</a>. I spoke
    with him as a student at Cambridge in the Cambridge Union when he
    made his first and very brilliant public speech. On August 4,
    1914, I was with him in his chambers in the Temple and listened
    to Big Ben strike midnight as the Horse Artillery thundered along
    the Embankment to Victoria to entrain for France. And we knew
    that the guns were already firing, that the First World War had
    come. When that war was over, fate decreed that I should work
    for <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/index.html">Robert Cecil</a>,
    for <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1934/index.html">Arthur
  Henderson</a>, for <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1922/index.html">Fridtjof Nansen</a><a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I could tell a thousand stories of how
  Cecil and Henderson helped to create and shape the League of
  Nations, build up the International Court, develop world
  cooperation in many spheres; of how they turned the policy of
  all-round armament reduction from general phrases into practical
  proposals on which a treaty could be made; of how they built up
  and led the worldwide body of informed opinion which the major
  governments could have used in 1932 to carry through a plan of
  drastic disarmament, if they had had the vision and the nerve
  that were required; of how, when this great opportunity - the
  greatest in history - had been wasted, they still battled on for
  the cause for which they stood.</p>

  <p>It was for these great achievements, for
  their unfaltering courage, that you honored them in days gone by,
  and I like to think that you are still honoring them today.</p>

  <p>And Fridtjof Nansen? To all his friends and
  colleagues, Nansen was the most gifted and, in all true elements
  of human greatness, the greatest of great men. He was as great an
  international statesman as he was a great explorer of the frozen
  North. Indeed, the best way to understand his international work
  is to recall how he first won his immense, unprecedented
  fame.</p>

  <p>The whole world still remembers how he
  crossed the Greenland ice cap when all others had failed; he
  decided, against the advice of other experts, to force his party
  through the dangerous drifting ice floes and to land them on the
  savage, uninhabited eastern coast; once they were ashore, there
  could be no turning back.</p>

  <p>When he set out to reach the Pole, again
  with every expert voice against him, he called his ship
  <i>Fram</i> because once he had jammed her in the ice field of
  the Arctic Ocean, there was only one way which she could travel:
  Forward; again there could be no possibility of turning back.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Fram</i> had accomplished half
  its journey, it was already farther North than men had ever been;
  it was certain that in another eighteen months, it would emerge
  victorious on the other side, with Nansen's theories proved.</p>

  <p>But it would miss the Pole; so Nansen, with
  Johansen<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a> - only one companion -
  set out with dogs and sledges to try to reach it, to return by
  kayak to Franz Josef Land, and to winter there. He had no
  wireless; he could never find the <i>Fram</i> again; it was a
  journey of 1.100 miles, with dangers of many kinds in every mile.
  Was there ever such courage and such resolution as Nansen showed
  when he said good-by to Sverdrup<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>,
  standing in the moonlight on the glittering ice field beside the
  <i>Fram</i>?</p>

  <p>The Nansen who stormed the diplomatic
  fortress of Geneva was the Nansen who stormed the barriers of the
  Polar Sea.</p>

  <p>When the Nobel Committee gave him the Nobel
  Peace Prize in 1922, it was for the "humanitarian" work he did as
  High Commissioner of the League of Nations. How richly he had
  earned it! By what he did to help in cleaning up the wreckage
  left in Europe by the storms of war, he brought the League of
  Nations a new authority, made it an instrument of reconciliation,
  a symbol of hope and reconstruction to the peoples of the
  world.</p>

  <p>And his success had long-term results when
  the United Nations replaced the League: UNRRA, the UN Refugee
  Organization, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the
  work he had begun; the High Commissioner for Refugees, World
  Refugee Year, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), UN Technical
  Assistance and Economic Aid - it is not fantastic to suggest that
  they all stemmed from his achievements of long ago. And yet - all
  of this pales into insignificance beside the historical
  importance of what he did in the strictly political and
  diplomatic developments of his day.</p>

  <p>Nansen believed with passion that the world
  needed a new international system based not on force but law; he
  knew, all too intimately, and he hated the inner workings of the
  power politics and the secret old diplomacy of the past; he threw
  all his strength and all his courage into battling for the
  new.</p>

  <p>He went to the First Assembly of the League
  as leader of the Norwegian delegation, his Prime Minister as
  Number Two sitting by his side. An early episode showed what kind
  of delegate he was going to be.</p>

  <p>He was a member, with Lord Cecil, of a
  small committee which examined the claim of Albania for admission
  to the League. Italy, for reasons of power politics which later
  years made plain, opposed admission; Britain and France gave
  Italy their support.</p>

  <p>But Nansen and Cecil were convinced that
  Albania was a nation and should come in. They were defeated in
  the small committee; and Cecil asked Nansen if they should fight
  the question in the full Assembly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly we should", was Nansen's quick
  reply.</p>

  <p><br>
  "But we shall have all the great powers against us", Cecil warned
  him.</p>

  <p><br>
  "Of course we shall", said Nansen, as if that were of no account
  at all.</p>

  <p>To <i>him</i>, it was of no account,
  because he believed their case was right. As spokesman of one of
  the smallest members of the League, he was more than ready to
  challenge the powers that had just won the war, when they sought
  to introduce power politics in the League. And his contemptuous
  scorn was justified by the event. In the open debate in the full
  Assembly, Nansen and Cecil, Norway and South Africa, were
  victors. The great powers were routed, and Albania became a
  member of the League.</p>

  <p>How often was that episode repeated!</p>

  <p>Nansen and Cecil secured publicity for the
  Committees of the Assembly, and later for the Council and
  Commissions of the League. "Publicity", said Cecil, "is the
  lifeblood of the League." A maxim worth remembering today.</p>

  <p>Motta of Switzerland urged that Germany
  should be invited to join the League; he called down upon his
  head a Gallic torrent of Ciceronian eloquence from Viviani, the
  ex-prime minister and the greatest orator of France. It was
  Nansen who followed Viviani and said that Motta had been right.
  Years later it was Nansen who persuaded <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1926/index.html">Stresemann</a> and Luther that
  they must come in<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In 1923, Mussolini<a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> used a frontier incident as an excuse to
  seize the island of Corfu. Greece, in a panic, appealed both to
  the League and to the Allied Council of Ambassadors in Paris;
  Cecil, with his own government half against him, upheld the
  competence of the League; it was Nansen who rallied the Assembly
  in his support, who organized the smaller nations, answered
  Mussolini's threats, spoke up in the Assembly and destroyed the
  specious arguments of the Fascist delegates<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>"Nansen", said Cecil, "was a pillar round
  whom the whole of the representatives assembled gathered in order
  to enforce what they believed to be right and just."</p>

  <p>Nansen, at that grim Corfu Assembly, beyond
  all question saved the League, he may well have stopped a war; he
  rescued Corfu from an unscrupulous aggressor bent on empire
  building; Venizelos<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> told me it
  was the League's greatest triumph and that without Nansen it
  could never have been done.</p>

  <p>The mandates, slavery, forced labor, the
  compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court, collective
  security, the admission of Russia, the constitutional development
  of the League - on all these things he was a leader; on all, in
  Cecil's phrase "he gave to others something of his courage and
  determination"; in all, in Cecil's metaphor, "his ship was still
  the <i>Fram</i>". But one issue, above all others, seemed to him
  most urgently important - disarmament.</p>

  <p>Let me end this brief and halting panegyric
  of Norway's modern Viking hero with a quotation from what he said
  in a Nobel speech in 1926<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>"The problem of how to get rid of war is
  the first of all questions, not only in international, but in
  national politics as well...</p>

  <p>If we do not get rid of war, if we do not
  end it altogether, if we do not reduce and limit armaments,
  then... we may be very sure that in the future, as in the past,
  armaments will breed counter-armaments; they will breed alliances
  and counter-alliances, suspicion and distrust;... they will
  produce international crises, they will lead at first, perhaps,
  to small local wars, but in the long run, and inevitably, to a
  great world war like that we have seen in our own day and
  generation.</p>

  <p>If we retain our armaments, if we do not
  carry through the work of disarmament which the League of Nations
  has so successfully begun, war will certainly ensue."</p>

  <p>In 1926 these words were spoken; in 1933,
  when Nansen spoke no more in Geneva for Norway and for mankind,
  there came the failure of the Disarmament Conference, the
  abandonment of the Covenant system, the return to stark power
  politics, the melancholy sequence of Manchuria, the Chaco,
  Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, Munich, and the Second World War which
  Nansen had foreseen<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>And today, thirty-three years later, where
  do we stand about the arms race, which Nansen thought the supreme
  issue of the age? The arms race still goes on; but now far more
  ferocious, far more costly, far more full of perils, than it was
  then.</p>

  <p>What are the perils of the arms race? I
  take an old and inoffensive illustration - the facts are
  well-established and the men are gone.</p>

  <p>In 1905 the British Admiralty decided to
  produce a great deterrent, to make it plain that Germany could
  never win a war and had better drop her challenge to the British
  fleet. They laid down the Dreadnought, a battleship so powerful
  that it could sink the whole German Navy without peril to itself.
  [Even before the Dreadnought was commissioned, a prime minister
  newly come to power and Lord Balfour, the prime minister of the
  government which had agreed to its construction, admitted in the
  House of Commons that the Dreadnought might have been a grave
  mistake. And so it proved]</p>

  <p>It had made obsolete overnight twenty-eight
  German battleships and armored cruisers. But the Germans built
  Dreadnoughts in reply; and they made obsolete not twenty-eight
  but eighty-three British battleships and cruisers that could have
  taken on even the most powerful vessel in the German fleet. [In
  1906 we had an immense margin of thirty-four ships of the line
  over the German, Austrian, and Italian fleets combined.]</p>

  <p>In other words, the Dreadnought was not
  needed for national defense<a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>.
  But ten years later, in the Battle of Jutland<a href=
  "#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>, where only Dreadnoughts counted, our
  margin was only two to one; if our commanders had made mistakes
  which fortunately they avoided, we might have lost the battle and
  the war.</p>

  <p>Strategically, the Dreadnought was an error
  of the gravest kind; politically, it was an absolute disaster. It
  gave enormous power to Tirpitz<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>
  and the elements in Germany who wanted war; year by year, the
  race in Dreadnoughts led to panics and to counter-panics in
  Germany and Britain; by 1909 our foreign minister, Lord
  Grey<a href="#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>, said it had become the
  most important single factor in increasing European tension and
  the risk of war.</p>

  <p>In 1912 Sir Winston Churchill, then at the
  Admiralty, and Bethmann- Hollweg, the German chancellor<a href=
  "#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>, both warned their governments that if
  it were not stopped, it would bring war within two years. Their
  prediction was fulfilled, almost to the very day.</p>

  <p>When the war was over, Lord Grey wrote his
  famous verdict<a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a>: "The enormous
  growth of armaments in Europe, the sense of insecurity and fear
  caused by them - it was these that made war inevitable. This is
  the truest reading of history, the lesson that the present should
  be learning from the past."</p>

  <p>[It was because they, like all the
  statesmen who had fought the war, agreed with Lord Grey's
  verdict, that Lloyd George and Balfour helped Hughes of the
  United States<a href="#not16"><sup>16</sup></a> to make the
  Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, a treaty that ended an angry and
  feverish naval race between the U.S., Britain, and Japan by
  making large reductions in their battleships and aircraft
  carriers and by establishing the famous ratio 15:15:9. This
  treaty provided a splendid prelude to the general disarmament
  agreement which, under the Covenant, the League of Nations was to
  make.] But, alas, no general disarmament treaty was ever made.
  When after lengthy preparations, the Disarmament Conference met
  in 1932, President Hoover<a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a> put
  forward a proposal for a further cut in navies, with a ratio of
  10:10:6; a drastic cut in armies, with the abolition of all tanks
  and heavy mobile guns; the abolition of all aircraft that could
  carry bombs - a first - stage plan, designed to lead at later
  stages to the level of armaments imposed on Germany by the Treaty
  of Versailles.</p>

  <p>That plan was enthusiastically welcomed by
  Germany, Russia, Italy, and all the middle and smaller powers. I
  well remember the joy of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1921/index.html">Dr. Christian
  Lange</a><a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a> and his Norwegian
  colleagues when it was proposed. It might have led the Conference
  to full success, if Britain had agreed.</p>

  <p>Many people in Britain wanted to agree,
  among them Mr. Baldwin, the deputy prime minister<a href=
  "#not19"><sup>19</sup></a> and leader of the Conservative Party.
  Indeed, he wanted to go much further, and to abolish all
  battleships of over 10.000 tons displacement, all aircraft
  carriers, and all military aircraft of every kind. This would
  have meant as well the abolition of the submarine, and with such
  a lead from the leading naval power, the Conference could not
  have failed. But there was a conflict in the British Cabinet; Mr.
  Baldwin was defeated by a narrow margin; a British admiral was
  allowed to say in the Conference<a href=
  "#not20"><sup>20</sup></a> that "battleships are more precious
  than rubies to those who possess them"; by those words he killed
  the Hoover Plan.</p>

  <p>After having been so near success, the
  Conference failed; the arms race swiftly gained a new momentum;
  the major governments went back to the sordid principles of power
  politics; Abyssinia and the Covenant were betrayed; the Second
  World War came by precisely the process which Nansen and Cecil
  and Henderson had predicted.</p>

  <p>And what happened in the war? What part was
  played by the battleships for which such great hopes had been
  destroyed? They were almost useless; while, as Norwegian sailors
  know as well as we do, the submarines, for the second time in
  thirty years, almost brought us to our knees.</p>

  <p>And today? The arms race has gone on;
  aircraft have become a deadly menace to surface shipping; the
  nuclear-powered submarine, the nuclear missile have sealed the
  doom in any future war of the merchant convoys without which
  Britain cannot live.</p>

  <p>Not only so: in 1906, before the
  Dreadnought was commissioned, Admiral Lord Fisher, its inventor,
  could say that it was "absurd to talk of anything endangering our
  naval supremacy".</p>

  <p>After a half-century of the arms race, in
  which battleships have played so regrettable a part, we are only
  third in naval power; we have learnt how a new weapon of great
  offensive power, introduced by one nation, spreads to other
  nations and undermines the national defense of the nation which
  introduced it first; how it stimulates the general arms race and
  brings new weapons which, in naval warfare, now threaten the very
  life of nations which depend upon the sea; how, even on the plane
  of naval armaments alone, at every stage, 1906, 1932, 1955, a
  treaty of armament reduction and limitation would have been an
  incomparably better measure of national defense than the
  launching or maintenance of more powerful vessels for naval
  war.</p>

  <p>But all this is still more true of the
  other, "modern" means of war. Look at the facts of our present
  arms race.</p>

  <p>Lord Grey thought the competition before
  1914 was frenzied madness; before 1939 the pace was hotter still;
  since 1945 it has been far beyond what anyone could have dreamed
  of in 1939.</p>

  <p>In 1914 the nations had something over five
  million men in their standing peacetime forces; today they have
  more than sixteen million. In 1914 they were spending about
  &pound;500 million a year on preparing for war; today they are
  spending &pound;40,000 million.</p>

  <p>The most significant figure is what we
  spend on military research; on using scientists of genius to
  "improve" existing weapons and to develop new ones that are
  cheaper, more destructive, swifter in delivery than those we have
  today.</p>

  <p>In 1938<a href="#not21"><sup>21</sup></a>
  Britain spent less than &pound;6 million on military research; in
  1953, &pound;100 million; in 1959, &pound;210 million - by official
  figures, and allowing for the change of prices, more than twenty
  times what we were spending twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>The United States in 1940 spent &pound;5
  million on military research - even less than us. In 1958, they
  spent &pound;1.900 million - nine times our figure; and no doubt
  the Soviet Union spent even more. The results, in every class of
  armament, have been revolutionary; Britain is now equipping her
  land forces with new weapons, from the rifle to tanks that will
  be transportable by air; France is making bombing aircraft with
  twice the speed of sound.</p>

  <p>But the great changes since 1945 are in the
  so-called "modern" weapons. The bloodcurdling history of the
  nuclear bomb is familiar to us all. In 1945 the Hiroshima weapon
  multiplied by 2.000 the explosive power of the ten ton
  "blockbuster" which our pilots had dropped on Berlin; it is the
  yardstick of nuclear armament, so we must remember what it
  did.</p>

  <p>It killed 100.000 people in an instant of
  time; it crippled, burnt, blinded, riddled with radiation
  sickness 100.000 more; in 1959 scores of people have died a
  lingering, hideous death as the result of a bomb dropped fourteen
  years ago. A city as large as Oslo was utterly destroyed: houses,
  factories, offices, barracks, docks - nothing remained.</p>

  <p>In 1954 the so-called H-bomb - the first
  primitive, unliftable thermonuclear device - multiplied by almost
  a thousand the power of the Hiroshima bomb. A British Home Office
  Manual on Civil Defense tells us that a ten-megaton bomb - ten
  million tons of Nobel's high explosive - much smaller than the
  weapon of 1954 - would wipe out London: total annihilation of the
  center, and around it an unbroken circle of roaring flame, from
  which it would be a miracle if anything escaped.</p>

  <p>And the pace of the advance in weapons is
  still increasing. In four years, since the government ceased
  discussing "comprehensive" disarmament and started seeking for
  "partial" measures instead, we have seen: the production of the
  supersonic bomber; the development of the "intermediate" missile,
  to have a range of 1.200 or 1.500 miles; the intercontinental
  missile, which may be "operational" by 1961, with the Soviet
  Union then producing fifteen a month; the adaptation of the
  H-bomb into weapons which can be carried by a fighter-bomber, and
  into warheads for the intercontinental missile.</p>

  <p>We have seen the introduction of the
  nuclear-powered submarine, with all its menace, and the Polaris
  nuclear missile, which may soon be fired from underwater. We have
  seen the great development of chemical and biological methods of
  conducting war.</p>

  <p>The Pugwash Scientists, so generously
  helped by Mr. Cyrus Eaton of the United States<a href=
  "#not22"><sup>22</sup></a>, have shown this year that poison gas
  and "biologicals" may well become weapons for the mass
  elimination of human life. Goering<a href=
  "#not23"><sup>23</sup></a> tried a nerve gas, which he called
  "Tabun", on a herd of goats; they went mad and massacred each
  other, before the few survivors died, after hours of agonizing
  pain.</p>

  <p>An American general has told us that our
  nerve gas is ten times as potent now; others say even more.
  "Biologicals" may be just as potent, and, if they start a
  large-scale epidemic, more horrifying still.</p>

  <p>No doubt with the best of motives [- I say
  nothing against the General Staffs - no doubt] the major military
  governments have kept secret the facts about their chemical and
  biological work; General Staffs have used euphemistic phrases
  like the "tactical atomic bomb" or the "low-yield thermonuclear
  device" - phrases against which the scientists who made these
  weapons openly revolt.</p>

  <p>But it is vital that the citizens of every
  country should realize the true nature of the present arms race.
  What are the salient facts?</p>

  <p>First, it is by far the most potent factor
  in the conduct of our international affairs.</p>

  <p>Second, it is the strangest paradox in
  history; every new weapon is produced for national defense; but
  all experts are agreed that the modern, mass-destruction,
  instantaneous delivery weapons have destroyed defense.</p>

  <p>Third, it is a patent error to speak as
  though, for an indefinite future, there will be two military
  "giants", and no more. If the arms race goes on, in ten years
  there may be six or even more, and who knows which nation will be
  the greatest giant.</p>

  <p>Fourth, the advance in weapons has already
  brought us within measurable distance of the sudden, decisive,
  irreparable knockout blow.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ellis Johnson, the head of the Johns
  Hopkins Operations Analysis Office, which does tactical and
  strategic studies for the American army, believes that such a
  crushing attack by Russia on the United States is possible today.
  Others believe that the United States, with 10.000 megaton bombs
  and a vast delivery system from land bases and from the sea, will
  soon be able to knock out Russia, without the danger of
  reply.</p>

  <p>Fifth, military research is not standing
  still: the highest authorities tell us that weapon "progress"
  will be as great in the next fifteen years as in the past. The
  dangers of the weapons will continually increase.</p>

  <p>Sixth, we are continually being
  "conditioned" to their use. Fifty years ago the Hague Conventions
  codified the laws of war, forbidding gas or other poison, the use
  of fire bombing from the air, attacks on open towns and
  civilians, either on land or sea.</p>

  <p>Within ten years all these rules had been
  violated in the First World War. But the Second World War was
  incomparably more degraded and degrading than the First.</p>

  <p>In the First War, we had poison gas - I was
  at Ypres when the chlorine cloud was first released - a gas wall
  a hundred feet high and two miles long; I saw the French Colonial
  Troops flying in terror and throwing away their weapons as they
  ran; I saw the Canadian soldiers choking to death, with an evil
  yellow froth oozing from their mouths; we had poison gas, but no
  gas chambers; we knew the ferocious cruelty that sometimes goes
  with dare - all heroism, but not the organized sadism of the
  concentration camp. We had spying and treason and executions, but
  not the Gestapo's torture chambers, with the thumbscrew and the
  rack.</p>

  <p>And what is happening to us now, as we
  prepare for the Third Great War?</p>

  <p>When Hitler was exterminating seven million
  Jews in Poland, we had millions of German prisoners in our hands;
  we did not kill them; we took no reprisals of any kind. But now
  governments are constantly asserting that if they or their allies
  are attacked, they will instantly reply with weapons that will
  wipe out tens of millions of men and women and little children,
  who may bear no shadow of personal responsibility for what their
  government has done.</p>

  <p>What is left of the morality on which our
  Western civilization has been built?</p>

  <p>How can we end the arms race?</p>

  <p>I start with a forthright proposition: it
  makes no sense to talk about disarming unless you believe that
  war, <i>all</i> war, can be abolished. The Western governments
  declared precisely that in the UN Commission in 1952. "The goal
  of disarmament", they said, "is not to regulate, but to prevent
  war, by making war inherently, as it is constitutionally under
  the Charter, impossible as a means of settling disputes between
  nations. To achieve this goal, all states must cooperate to
  establish an open and substantially disarmed world, in which
  armed forces and armaments will be reduced to such a point&#8230;
  that no state will be in a condition of armed preparedness to
  start a war."<a href="#not24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

  <p>That was the objective declared by the
  Western governments eight years ago; it is the objective which
  Mr. Khruschev declared in the General Assembly in September
  last<a href="#not25"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Unless there is an iron resolution to make
  it the supreme object of international policy and to realize it
  now, I believe all talks about disarmament will fail.</p>

  <p>This<a href="#not26"><sup>26</sup></a>
  rules out attempts to "limit" war by new laws or understandings
  about how weapons will be used. I fear we should not get far with
  the kind of "partial" measures which have been debated for the
  last four years. Everyone would favor "partial" measures, if they
  were real, if they created confidence, if nothing better could be
  done.</p>

  <p>Some people honestly believe that small
  steps will be much easier to take than large ones. They quote
  proverbs to support their point - the crude English: "Don't bite
  off more than you can chew"; the elegant French: "The better is
  the enemy of the good"; the Russian: "The slower you ride, the
  further you go". Well, in Russia I should have thought it would
  depend on whether you had a pack of wolves howling hungrily at
  your horse's heels. We have a pack of wolves, the modern weapons,
  howling at our heels.</p>

  <p>I prefer the words of our great economist
  and political thinker, John Stuart Mill: "Against a great evil, a
  small remedy does not produce a small result; it produces no
  result at all." Or the saying of Lloyd George: "The most
  dangerous thing in the world is to try to leap a chasm in two
  jumps." There is a great chasm, a great gulf, between the armed
  world of today and the disarmed world which we must have on some
  near tomorrow.</p>

  <p>I will not discuss the "partial" measures
  which have been debated in recent years: the "cut-off" of new
  nuclear weapons; measures against surprise attack; exchange of
  budgetary information; and the rest - in my view, except as part
  of a general disarmament treaty, they were almost bound to
  fail.</p>

  <p>I rejoice that, for the present, they have
  been set aside, that the new Committee of Ten will meet to
  discuss a "comprehensive" plan for general and complete
  disarmament, and that its mandate is to prepare detailed
  proposals within the shortest practicable time<a href=
  "#not27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Some people say the Committee should work
  on Mr. Khruschev's proposals made in the Assembly the other day.
  Others seem to think that it would be dangerous to start on a
  Kremlin basis, to appear to let the Kremlin have the lead. They
  remind me of a Scottish minister of the Kirk, who, after a period
  of draught, when the crops were withering in the corn fields, was
  asked by the farmers of his parish to pray to the Almighty to
  send some rain. "No, no", he replied, "I cannot do that while the
  wind is in the East!"</p>

  <p>Can we really not negotiate on proposals
  that come to us from the East? I should have thought that that
  might be the very moment when we had the greatest prospect of
  success; that, perhaps, Dr. Christian Lange's "golden hour of
  opportunity" had come again. But first, they say, we <i>must</i>
  know: Is Mr. Khruschev genuinely sincere?</p>

  <p>I answer the doubters' question in three
  ways. First, perhaps no one knows if Mr. Khruschev is sincere,
  and we shall never know unless we start a serious negotiation
  with him without delay. Second, if we do negotiate, we shall know
  within a week if he is sincere or not; that is certain. Third, if
  we do <i>not</i> soon start a serious negotiation on the basis of
  the mandate which the General Assembly has defined, then
  <i>he</i> may say, and others will believe, that it is we who are
  not sincere.</p>

  <p>The words "general and complete
  disarmament" are Mr. Khruschev's; he proposed the elimination of
  all armaments and all armed forces within four years, leaving
  nations with militias bearing small arms to maintain order within
  their states. He proposed as well a general and complete
  inspection and control, with no reservations or limitations of
  any kind. In other words, he proposed an ultimate objective, and
  a timetable of the stages by which it should be reached.</p>

  <p>His objective, I repeat, is simply that
  declared by the Western governments in 1952; and, unless I
  misread the speeches in the Assembly, there is no one who rejects
  this as the final purpose now.</p>

  <p>Is the timetable too ambitious? Of course,
  there are dangers in avoidable delay; but four years is very
  short for so vast and revolutionary a change; in all good faith,
  it might take six, or eight, or ten; I hope Mr. Khruschev will be
  elastic about the point, provided real disarmament is being
  pursued.</p>

  <p>In any case, I hope the new Committee of
  Ten will remember what was said by an American delegate some
  years ago: that the further you carry disarmament, the easier it
  becomes; the technical problems grow simpler, the inspection more
  certain to succeed.</p>

  <p>Of course, there must be a first-stage
  treaty, by which the initial reductions will be made.</p>

  <p>In our British United Nations Association
  Statement we set out what we believe would be a wise first-stage
  agreement: reductions of manpower army, navy, air force all
  together - to one or at most 1.5 million men for Russia, China,
  and America, with lower "ceilings" for other nations; a
  corresponding reduction of conventional weapons; agreement to
  abolish, by prescribed measures, all the weapons of mass
  destruction, including the existing stocks; budgetary reduction
  and limitation; and of course the appropriate measures of
  inspection and control.</p>

  <p>We believe the first-stage treaty should
  also make quite clear, at least in principle, the further
  reductions to be made in stages two and three; the whole
  negotiation will be far easier if the steps to the ultimate
  objective are made plain in everybody's mind.</p>

  <p>How practical is this program? Are there
  vast, unsolved technical problems to be faced? Well, a treaty of
  general disarmament will be a long and complex document. But,
  broadly, Salvador de Madariaga's<a href=
  "#not28"><sup>28</sup></a> words [spoken in 1932] are true
  [today]: "Technical difficulties are political objections in
  uniform".</p>

  <p>And, in fact, nearly all the technical
  problems of reducing armies, navies; and air forces, of reducing
  or abolishing conventional armaments, of reducing and limiting
  military budgets, were already solved long years ago. The London
  and Washington Naval Treaties<a href="#not29"><sup>29</sup></a>,
  the Reports of the Disarmament Conference of 1932, Sir Anthony
  Eden's Draft Disarmament Convention<a href=
  "#not30"><sup>30</sup></a> of March, 1933 - these provide model
  [treaty] clauses from which the Committee of Ten might well
  begin.</p>

  <p>But there is one new technical difficulty
  to be faced - the clandestine nuclear stock. Suppose the nuclear
  powers agree to abolish all their A- and H-bombs, how could they
  be certain a disloyal government, planning to conquer or
  blackmail the world, would not keep a part - ten percent, twenty
  percent - of their existing stocks in a lead and concrete hideout
  that no one could ever find?</p>

  <p>"It is now a fact", said Sir Winston
  Churchill in the House of Commons, "that a quantity of plutonium,
  perhaps less than would fill this Box on the table... would
  suffice to produce weapons which would give indisputable world
  domination to any great power which was the only one to have
  it."<a href="#not31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

  <p>This has been the crux of the deadlock of
  recent years. Some governments have argued that the only
  safeguard is for the nuclear powers to retain a great part of
  their stocks to act as a deterrent to aggression, that total
  abolition will only be safe when there is some new Geiger
  counter, some miraculous new instrument or method that will
  detect the faintly radioactive H-bomb behind its concrete
  shield.</p>

  <p>But if we wait for this Geiger counter, we
  may wait for decades, as Mr. Stassen<a href=
  "#not32"><sup>32</sup></a> said in 1957; or we may wait forever.
  What happens while we are waiting?</p>

  <p>Will France stop making nuclear weapons?
  Will China, with its vast potential power ? If France and China,
  then surely Japan, India, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, and others
  will join the nuclear club - there are now a dozen countries
  which, within a decade, could mobilize the necessary materials
  and skills. Simply waiting for a Geiger counter means the gravest
  risk of all. Is there nothing else that we can do?</p>

  <p>Of course there is. We could abolish the
  "means of delivery", the military aircraft and the missiles by
  which nuclear weapons can be used. That is quite easy; Mr.
  Khruschev has proposed it; there is no problem of control-bombers
  and missiles could not be made or tested without UN inspectors
  finding out, nor could troops be given training in their use.</p>

  <p>Second, we can agree, as in principle I
  understand we have agreed, to abolish the land, sea, and air
  forces without which no government could embark upon aggressive
  war.</p>

  <p>Third, we could set up general and complete
  control of all the means, including nuclear plants, by which war
  can be prepared; I discussed this in great detail with Mr.
  Khruschev and his colleagues, and I am sure that, for real
  disarmament, they will agree.</p>

  <p>These three measures are the real
  safeguards, far better than any Geiger counter; they would remove
  the whole temptation to keep a secret nuclear stock. The risk of
  accepting such a system would be incomparably less than the risk
  of allowing the arms race to go on.</p>

  <p>Disarmament is not a policy by itself; it
  is part of the general policy of the UN. But it is a vital part
  of that policy; without it, the UN institutions can never
  function as they should.</p>

  <p>For every nation, it is the safest and most
  practicable system of defense. Defeatism about the past is a
  grievous error; the Disarmament Conference of 1932 was not
  inevitably bound to fail; failure was due to human errors we can
  plainly see.</p>

  <p>Sir Winston Churchill called the Second War
  "the most unnecessary war in history". [Defeatism about the past
  is a grievous error;] defeatism about the future is a crime. The
  danger is not in trying to do too much, but in trying to do too
  little. Nansen said here in 1926 that "in the big things of life,
  it is vitally important to leave no line of retreat... We must
  destroy the bridges behind us which lead back to the old policy
  and the old system, both of which are such utter
  failures."<a href="#not33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the age when the atom has been split,
  the moon encircled, diseases conquered, is disarmament so
  difficult a matter that it must remain a distant dream? To answer
  "Yes" is to despair of the future of mankind.</p>

  <p>"Politics", it is said, "is the art of the
  possible." How often that weary clich&eacute; provides excuse for
  defeatist surrender, before the real difficulties of a problem
  have been faced! [Democracy is the art of mobilizing popular
  opinion in support of reforms that are technically possible and
  that the people want. Disarmament is technically - I repeat I -
  far simpler than any other method of national defense. Who doubts
  that all the peoples want it?]</p>

  <p>Nansen was the first to say what others
  have repeated, that "the difficult is what takes a little while;
  the impossible is what takes a little longer". If politics is the
  art of the possible, statesmanship is the art, in Nansen's sense,
  of the impossible; and it is statesmanship that our perplexed and
  tortured humanity requires today.</p>

  <p>But even with statesmanship of that high
  order, we may have a long and dangerous voyage still before us,
  full of hazards and, it may be, storms; if at last we are to
  reach our destination, our ship must be the <i>Fram</i>.</p>
