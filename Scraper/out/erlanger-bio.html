  <h1>Joseph Erlanger - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="erlanger.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Joseph
  Erlanger</b> was born on January 5, 1874, at San Francisco,
  California. He is the son of Herman and Sarah Erlanger.<br>
  <br>
  Studying chemistry at the University of California, he received
  the degree of B.S. of that University and later went to Johns Hopkins
  University to study medicine, where he obtained his M.D.
  degree in 1899. After a year of hospital training at the Johns Hopkins
  Hospital, he was appointed assistant in the Department of
  Physiology at the Medical School there. Until 1906 he stayed
  there, being successively Instructor, Associate, and Associate
  Professor. He was then appointed the first Professor of
  Physiology in the newly established Medical School of the
  University of Wisconsin, where one of his pupils was <a href=
  "index.html">H. S. Gasser</a>, who later collaborated with him.
  In 1910 he was appointed Professor of Physiology in the
  reorganized Medical School of the Washington University, St.
  Louis. In 1946 he retired as chairman of this school and is now
  emeritus professor there.<br>
  <br>
  Erlanger's chief research has been done in the fields of
  electrophysiology and the physiology of the circulatory system.
  He has studied the principles of sphygmomanometry and devised a
  recording sphygmomanometer, with which he studied, in man, the
  influence of pulse pressure on kidney secretion and on
  orthostatic albuminuria. Later, he devised a clamp with which the
  auriculo-ventricular bundle of the mammalian heart could be
  reversibly blocked, and with this device he studied the problems
  associated with the functions of this bundle.<br>
  <br>
  In 1922, in collaboration with Gasser, Erlanger adapted the
  cathode-ray oscillograph for the study of nerve action potentials
  and this led to the work for which Erlanger and Gasser were given
  the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 1944. Erlanger has
  also worked on metabolism of dogs with shortened intestines, on
  traumatic shock and on the mechanism of the production of sound
  in arteries.<br>
  <br>
  Erlanger has received honorary doctorates of the Universities of
  California, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.<br>
  <br>
  In 1906, he married Aim&eacute;e Hirstel, who died in 1959. They
  had three children, Margaret (b. 1908), Ruth Josephine (b. 1910),
  Herman (1912-1959).</p>
