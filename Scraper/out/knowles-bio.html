  <h1>William S. Knowles - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="knowles.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  Taunton, Massachusetts on June 1, 1917, but I actually grew up in
  nearby New Bedford. My family background was heavily slanted
  toward business and seafaring matters. I can't think of any
  relatives that ever went into science. My family gave me the best
  in education. To my father, business was the highest calling, but
  to my mother, medicine was the top profession. She would probably
  have gone to medical school if she had been born in a more
  enlightened era.</p>

  <p>I went to boarding school at Berkshire in
  western Massachusetts, definitely the most beautiful part of the
  state. I'll never forget the fall colors on the Berkshires. In
  those days I was terrible at athletics and never made a team, but
  quite easily led my class in academics. I was particularly good
  at math and science. I also got a good lesson in New England
  thrift. To get free ice for our physics experiments we had to
  wait until it snowed.</p>

  <p>On graduating, I was easily admitted to
  Harvard. In
  that era all one had to do was pass the College Board exams. If
  any one in my family went to college that was where he went. My
  father spent a year there and quit to go into the textile
  business. At this point I was strongly advised that I was too
  young socially to go to college so I took a second senior year at
  Andover, another boarding school. At that time many students did
  this. At Andover I took my first chemistry course from a teacher
  named Bushy Graham and was fascinated by the subject. I remember
  him trying to explain Avagadro's number and his discussion of the
  dangers of hydrogen and oxygen. At the end of the year, I took a
  competitive exam and won my first prize, the $50 Boylston prize
  in chemistry.</p>

  <p>That summer I took a cruise on a 75-foot
  schooner with no engine, sailing from Gloucester, Massachusetts
  to Norway. We sailed around the Baltic ending up at Stockholm. I
  didn't think of it at the time, but we spent most of three weeks
  on the north Atlantic with no contact at all with the outside
  world. Today one is always in touch with home base even if you go
  to the South Pole or the Moon. Memories of this sailing trip have
  always been vivid. On one instance we were mistakenly arrested in
  Tallin, Estonia and got a ride in the paddy wagon. Later we were
  released without comment. Little did I think that one day years
  later I would be returning to Stockholm to share the Nobel Prize
  in Chemistry.</p>

  <p>At Harvard I majored in chemistry with a
  strong inclination toward math. I took the minimum of humanities.
  I was told I'd be a natural for physical chemistry but taking
  organic with Louis Fieser changed my mind. It was there I got my
  introduction to optical isomerism and the tetrahedral carbon
  atom. At Harvard competition was fierce and I always got a solid
  B, but not the straight A's of many of my class mates. These were
  the days when most got a gentleman's C.</p>

  <p>On graduating in 1939 I was strongly
  advised to go elsewhere to graduate school. I went to Columbia with
  Professor Elderfield and worked on making simple analogs of the
  cardiac aglucones. These were tested at Eli Lilly for cardiac
  activity. Bob Elderfield was at his best when he talked steroids
  when he was at Rockefeller Institute. Paralleling Nobel's
  experience I too had an explosion. Mine came when distilling
  diazomethane. No one was hurt, but a bottle of intermediate that
  I had labored on for months was destroyed.</p>

  <p>In those days Professor Elderfield spent a
  lot of time away on the anti-malarial project in the military,
  and we were on our own a lot. Professor Nelson Leonard, long at
  the University of
  Illinois in Champagne, was in our research group. Later he
  consulted at Monsanto.</p>

  <p>New York was an exciting place to be in
  those war years and my draft board forced Columbia to push me out
  sooner than would ordinarily happen. In those days industry would
  hire any chemist that could breathe. In 1942, I started in
  Dayton, Ohio at the Thomas and Hochwalt laboratories, which had
  recently joined Monsanto. Most of my assignments were pretty
  mundane, like making super pure hexamethylenetetramine to be used
  for making the explosive cyclonite.</p>

  <p>In 1944, I was transferred to St. Louis to
  work on plasticizers and intermediates. We did make a lot of
  benzyl benzoate as a mite repellant for soldiers clothing. We
  later had a DDT project which never got into production until the
  war was over. More interesting, we had a synthetic process for
  vanillin but lost out to lignin as a way to get that desirable
  molecule. In those days we did get involved with the custom
  manufacture of the antibiotic chloramphenicol and made 10-15000
  lbs. before it was taken off the market because a very small
  percentage of patients developed aplastic anemia. At the time my
  dog had a fungus on her chest that wouldn't heal and resisted
  treatment. I made an ointment with our product and it cleared up
  in two days. She lived to 17 years.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the war the discovery that
  cortisone might become a large volume pharmaceutical caused
  Monsanto to engage Professor Woodward with the hope of
  commercializing his synthetic approach. I was selected to join
  this effort since I had a steroid background.</p>

  <p>Actually I got to spend nine months in his
  lab at Cambridge on this total synthesis. The experience working
  with the "great man" is one I'll never forget. For the first
  three months in his lab he would come in at noon and say, "Let's
  go to Schrafts." We would spend an hour or more scribbling
  chemical structures on the menu or placemats. His phenomenal
  memory was beyond anything I'd ever seen. In those days he never
  kept a file or wrote a reference. He'd just say look on page so
  and so in Beilstein and you'll find something on that. He lost
  some of this ability as he grew older and it bothered him. He
  really hoped Monsanto would commercialize his steroid synthesis,
  but the Mexican yam with its high content of diosgenin eventually
  killed our effort. Our program for cortisone got fairly well
  along. We made a few milligrams of racemic cortisone and we had
  resolved an early intermediate which we intended to carry through
  to the real thing. It was made too complex to compete with the
  lowly yam.</p>

  <p>Later in the fifties I got involved in
  kinetic studies using my long forgotten math background. These
  studies led to improvements in several of our processes by
  doubling production with little or no additional capital. In
  those days, industry was hungry for chemicals and much effort was
  spent to get more out in the same equipment.</p>

  <p>Monsanto had developed a separate line of
  advancement for those who wished to stay in technology and I rose
  to the top of that ladder before I even thought of asymmetric
  hydrogenations. I was one who liked to work with my hands as well
  as my brain. Chemical research in the lab was ideal for filling
  this need. The work on the asymmetric project, which started in
  the mid-sixties, is the subject of my lecture. Obviously, I kept
  active in this area until I retired in 1986, and continued in a
  consulting capacity for several years after.</p>

  <p>On the home front we had purchased a cabin
  in Jackson Hole, Wyoming 25 years ago and have spent summers and
  some winter skiing time there ever since. It is there that our
  four children and four grand children often meet. On several
  occasions, Professor Kagan has visited us there and we've been
  able to talk asymmetric hydrogenations. I have always loved doing
  things outdoors, including fly-fishing, hiking and biking. When
  things are going wrong I find splitting wood quite
  therapeutic.</p>

  <p>I received a number of awards for our
  work.</p>
