  <h1>Alan G. MacDiarmid - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="macdiarmid.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born a Kiwi (a New Zealander) in
  Masterton, New Zealand on April 14, 1927, and still am a Kiwi by
  New Zealand law, although I became a naturalized United States
  citizen many years ago in order to have the right to vote in US
  elections and, hence, voice my political opinions in a meaningful
  way. My father, an engineer, was unemployed for four years during
  the Great Depression which hit New Zealand rather severely in the
  early 1930s. Since jobs were believed to be more plentiful in the
  vicinity of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, located
  at the bottom of the North Island, we moved to Lower Hutt a few
  miles from Wellington. There my two older brothers and my elder
  sister were able to find jobs while I and my younger sister were
  still at primary school.</p>

  <p>My mother and father set the stage for
  nurturing a warm, loving united, mutually supportive family who
  always pulled together and also helped others outside the family
  in need when necessary. Although we did not have too much food,
  my mother was always inviting other, less fortunate people to
  meals. On such occasions, my older brothers and sister would
  frequently remind me and my younger sister at meals not to ask
  for more food by saying to us out loud at the table, "FHB," which
  meant, "Family Hold Back," i.e., don't eat too much! We had no
  phone or refrigerator. In one of the houses we lived in Lower
  Hutt, our hot water came from water pipes embedded in the brick
  at the back of the open fireplace in the living room. This
  resulted in our weekly bath night - where the younger children
  used the bath water from the older children, to which we were
  allowed to add more hot water if any still remained! For most of
  my time at primary school, I went to school barefooted, like most
  of the other kids. The soles of our feet literally became
  leather!</p>

  <p>Even though I have been away from New
  Zealand for about 50 years, my brothers and sisters and I (my
  parents passed on several years ago) are still very closely
  connected to each other. Throughout the decades we have
  telephoned each other about every ten days and we all keep up to
  date with what we are each doing. Shortly after learning of my
  being a recipient of the Nobel Prize I was speaking to one of my
  brothers in New Zealand by phone and I said how lucky I was to
  have been raised in a poor family which was also a close loving
  family. The fact that we were poor made us self reliant and
  conscious of the value of money. The fact that we were closely
  knit taught us the important aspects of interpersonal
  relationships. Everyone expects "the important things" in life
  that such as birthday and Christmas presents, but it is the
  "little unimportant" actions which actually are the real
  important things. These put the flesh on the skeleton of any
  relationship. Several hundred of these each week - the
  unimportant, the unexpected, the unnecessary, "the little
  things", are the things that really count. We are lucky to have
  been brought up in this environment, but there is a statement on
  the wall of my study at home in suburban Philadelphia which
  reads, "I am a very lucky person and the harder I work the
  luckier I seem to be"!</p>

  <p>It is my home life while growing up through
  high school, which I consider to have been the single most
  important factor in any success which I may have had in life. As
  my parents always said, "...an 'A's grade in a class is not a
  sign of success." Success is knowing that you have done your best
  and have exploited your God-given or gene-given abilities to the
  next maximum extent. More than this, no one can do.</p>

  <p>For a period in grade school, I attended a
  two-room school in Keri Keri (town population, 600) where most of
  my school chums were Maori boys and girls from whom I learned so
  much. During much of my time at grade school I had an early
  morning, pre-school job delivering milk on my bicycle for Mr.
  Bradley, who had a few cows in a nearby paddock. My mother was
  superb - she would get up with me while it was still dark to make
  me hot tea to send me on my way. When I started high school it
  was necessary to give up my Milk route. Instead, I delivered the
  "Evening Post" newspaper on my bicycle after school.</p>

  <p>When my father retired (on a very small
  pension) and moved away from Wellington, it was necessary for me
  to leave Hutt Valley High School after only three years at the
  age of 16 and take a low-paying, part-time job as "lab
  boy"/janitor in the chemistry department at Victoria University
  College, as it was then known. The total student population
  was 1200; the Chemistry Department had a faculty of 2! I boarded
  with friends of my parents and, as a part-time student, took only
  two courses - one in chemistry and one in mathematics. During
  this time I became a resident at Weir House, the University
  dormitory for men. This I found to be one of the most enjoyable
  and maturing times of my life where I made many good friends from
  the other ninety residents, with some of whom I still keep in
  close contact. I remained a part-time student throughout my B.Sc.
  and M.Sc. studies at Victoria University College. After
  completing my B.Sc. degree I graduated to the position of
  demonstrator. Since the age of 17 I have supported myself
  financially, assisted later only by scholarships and fellowships
  for which I am most grateful.</p>

  <p>My interest in chemistry was kindled when I
  was about ten years old at which time I found one of my father's
  old chemistry text books dating back to the late 1800's when he
  was studying engineering. I spent hours pouring over the pages in
  complete confusion but with burning curiosity! Some clarification
  of a type occurred when I rode my bicycle to the public library
  in Lower Hutt and entered the children's section. There, on the
  right hand side on the bottom shelf, in the new books section,
  was a book with a bright blue cover. It was called, "The Boy
  Chemist." I took it out and continually renewed it by borrowing
  it for over a year and carried out most of the experiments in it.
  One of my duties as lab boy, when I was not washing dirty labware
  or sweeping floors, was to prepare demonstration chemicals for
  Mr. A.D. "Bobbie" Monro, the lecturer in first-year chemistry. On
  one occasion he asked me to prepare some
  S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> - beautiful bright orange crystals.
  When it became time for me to start my M.Sc. thesis, I asked Mr.
  Monro if I could look at some of its chemistry. He agreed. This
  resulted in my first publication in 1949. Its derivatives were
  highly colored. Color continued to be one of the driving forces
  in my future career in chemistry. I love color. Little did I know
  that thirty years later this was going to be a key factor which
  would shape my professional life.</p>

  <p>In 1950, I had the good fortune to receive
  a Fullbright fellowship from the U.S. State Department to do a
  Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in the USA where I studied
  under Professor Norris F. Hall, majoring in Inorganic Chemistry,
  studying the rate of exchange in <sup>14</sup>C-tagged complex
  metal cyanides. It was at the University of Wisconsin that I
  became president of the International Club - the largest student
  organization on campus and had the crucial chance meeting of my
  life when I met my future wife, Marian Mathieu, at an
  International Club dance. During this time I was elected by the
  Department of Chemistry to the position of Knapp Research Fellow
  and had the privilege of living rent free in the beautiful old
  ex-governor's mansion on the shores of Lake Mendota.</p>

  <p>When I was still at the University of
  Wisconsin I was successful in obtaining a New Zealand Shell
  graduate scholarship to study silicon hydrides at Cambridge University,
  England under the directorship of Professor H.J. Emel&eacute;us. It
  was there that Marian and I were married in the chapel at my
  college, Sidney Sussex College.</p>

  <p>After a brief appointment as a junior
  faculty member at Queens College of the University of St.
  Andrews, Scotland, I accepted a junior position on the
  faculty of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
  Pennsylvania where I have been for the past 45 years and
  became father of three daughters and a son and grandparent of
  nine lovely boys and girls. I grew to love teaching and the
  stimulation of young fresh inquiring minds. I am still fully
  engaged in teaching as well as research and indeed have requested
  to teach a section of first-year chemistry at Penn later this
  year.</p>

  <p>I had the good fortune to meet my future
  friend and colleague, Professor Alan J. Heeger, Professor of
  Physics at the University of Pennsylvania. On one occasion he
  came to my office and informed me that Mort Labes, Professor of
  Chemistry at Temple University, had published a paper on a highly
  conducting material. I asked Heeger its formula and he replied,
  "sss-nnn-ex". Being an inorganic chemist, I wrote down on a piece
  of paper, "(Sn)<sub>x</sub>" and said, "Of course you expect it
  to be conducting, it's a metal!" To which Heeger replied on
  paper, "No, not (Sn)<sub>x</sub>, but (SN)<sub>x</sub>! This was
  the beginning of our each learning each other's scientific
  language. I told him that I had made the precursor to
  (SN)<sub>x</sub>, i. e. S<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub> during my
  M.Sc. thesis work in New Zealand. He asked me if I could make
  some (SN)<sub>x</sub> - as golden crystals. We were ultimately
  successful, and co-published many papers together, on this
  conducting polymer.</p>

  <p>When I was a Visiting Professor at Kyoto
  University in Japan, lecturing on molecular silicon
  compounds, I visited Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1975 and
  described our work on (SN)<sub>x</sub>, Hideki Shirakawa and I
  met over a cup of green tea after a lecture I gave and as I was
  showing a sample of our golden (SN)<sub>x</sub>, he showed me a
  sample of his silvery (CH)<sub>x</sub>.</p>

  <p>I asked him how he had made this silvery
  film of polyacetylene and he replied that this occurred because
  of a misunderstanding between the japanese language and that of a
  foreign student who had just joined his group. Shirakawa had been
  polymerizing ordinary acetylene welding gas using a Ziegler-Natta
  catalyst and had been obtaining a rather uninteresting
  black-brown powder. He told the new student to repeat this work
  using a concentration of the catalyst which was milli-molar. A
  few days later the student came back and said that the stirring
  bar would not go around in the flask. Shirakawa went to the
  laboratory and, sure enough, instead of the black brown powder,
  there were lumps of silvery-pinkish jelly floating around.
  Shirakawa asked what the student had done and the student replied
  that he had done exactly as Shirakawa had told him; he had made
  the catalyst with a concentration of "x-molar"- in other words,
  he had made the catalyst 1000 times more concentrated than
  Shirakawa had told him! Shirakawa was most intrigued by this
  observation, since as all good chemists know, a catalyst should
  only increase the rate of a chemical reaction and should not
  alter the nature of the product. This then started Shirakawa
  investigating this silvery form of polyacetylene. I asked
  Shirakawa if he could join me for a year at the University of
  Pennsylvania since I was already interested in conducting
  materials such as the golden (SN)<sub>x</sub> films. He stated
  that he could and when he arrived we tried to make the silvery
  polyacetylene, (CH)<sub>x</sub>, more pure and, hence, increase
  its conductivity. However, we found that the purer we made the
  (CH)<sub>x</sub>, by elemental analysis, the lower was its
  conductivity! Since we had found previously that by adding
  bromine to the golden (SN)<sub>x</sub> material, we could
  increase its conductivity tenfold, we thought that perhaps the
  impurity in the polyacetylene was acting as a dopant and was
  actually increasing the conductivity of the polyacetylene, rather
  than decreasing it. We therefore decided to add some bromine to
  the silvery (CH)<sub>x</sub> films and immediately, within a few
  minutes at room temperature, the conductivity increased many
  millions of times. We then collaborated with my colleague,
  Professor Alan Heeger, who was well-versed in the physics of
  conducting materials. The rest is history! When Alan left Penn
  almost 10 years ago, my ongoing collaboration with my good friend
  Professor Art Epstein (Physics Dept, Ohio State
  Univ.) continued at an even more rapid pace.</p>

  <p>We all owe so much to those who have gone
  before us - "we stand on the shoulders of giants."</p>

  <p>Copies of the very last transparencies
  given in my Nobel Lecture are reproduced below. They carry a very
  special message to all of us.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>S<i>eeking the Great <b>White Bird</b> of
  Absolute Truth</i></p>

  <p>The dependency of any one person's research
  on the labors of scores of earlier scientific pioneers is
  illustrated very beautifully by a few sentences of this variation
  from a book by Olive Schreiner, written at the turn of the
  century, entitled, "The Story of an African Farm." I would like
  to share with you this adapted portion.</p>

  <p>The story concerns a young hunter who, in
  his youth, heard about the great white bird of "absolute truth"
  which lived at the very top of a high mountain far in the east.
  He had spent all his life seeking it without success - and now he
  was growing old.</p>

  <p>The old thin hands cut the stone ill and
  jaggedly, for the fingers were stiff and bent. The beauty and
  strength of the man were gone.</p>

  <p>At last, an old, wizened, shrunken face
  looked out above the rocks. He saw the eternal mountains still
  rising to the white clouds high above him.</p>

  <p>The old hunter folded his tired hands and
  lay down by the precipice where he had worked away his life.</p>

  <p>I have sought," he said, "for long years I
  have labored; but I have not found her. By the rough and twisted
  path hewn by countless others before me, I have slowly and
  laboriously climbed. I have not rested. I have not repined. And I
  have not seen her; now my strength is gone. Where I lie down,
  worn out, other men will stand, young and fresh. By the steps
  that I, and those before me, have cut, they will climb; by the
  stairs that we have built, they will mount. They will never know
  those who made them, their names are forgotten in the mists of
  time. At the clumsy work they will laugh; when the stones roll,
  they will curse us; but they will mount, and on our work they
  will climb, and by our stair! They will find her, and through
  us!"</p>

  <p>The tears rolled from beneath the shriveled
  eyelids. If truth had appeared above him in the clouds now, he
  could not have seen her, the mist of death was in his eyes.</p>

  <p><b>... Then slowly from the white sky
  above, through the still air, came something falling ... falling
  ... falling. Softly it fluttered down and dropped on to the
  breast of the dying man. He felt it with his hands -</b></p>
