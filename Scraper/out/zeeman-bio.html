  <h1>Pieter Zeeman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="zeeman.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Pieter Zeeman</b> was born on May
  25, 1865, at Zonnemaire, a small village in the isle of Schouwen,
  Zeeland, The Netherlands, as the son of the local clergyman
  Catharinus Forandinus Zeeman and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i>
  Wilhelmina Worst. After having finished his secondary school
  education at Zierikzee, the main town of the island, he went to
  Delft for two years to receive tuition in the classical
  languages, an adequate knowledge of which was required at that
  time for entrance to the university. Taking up his abode at the
  house of Dr. J.W. Lely, conrector of the Gymnasium and brother of
  Dr. C. Lely (Minister of Public Works and known for initiating
  and developing the work for reclamation of the Zuyderzee), Zeeman
  came into an environment which was beneficial for the development
  of his scientific talents. It was here also that he came into
  contact with <a href="../1913/index.html">Kamerlingh Onnes (Nobel
  Prize in Physics for 1913)</a>, who was twelve years his senior.
  Zeeman's wide reading, which included a proper mastery of works
  such as Maxwell's <i>Heat</i>, and his passion for performing
  experiments amazed Kamerlingh Onnes in no small degree, and
  formed the basis for a fruitful friendship between the two
  scientists.<br>
  <br>
  Zeeman entered Leyden University in 1885 and became mainly a
  pupil of Kamerlingh Onnes (mechanics) and Lorentz (experimental
  physics): the latter was later to share the Nobel Prize with him.
  An early reward came in 1890 when he was appointed assistant to
  Lorentz, enabling him to participate in an extensive research
  programme which included the study of the Kerr effect - an
  important foundation for his future great work. He obtained his
  doctor's degree in 1893, after which he left for F. Kohlrausch's
  institute at Strasbourg, where for one semester he carried out
  work under E. Cohn. He returned to Leyden in 1894 and became
  "privaat-docent" (extra-mural lecturer) from 1895 to 1897.<br>
  <br>
  In 1897, the year following his great discovery of the magnetic
  splitting of spectral lines, he was called to a lectureship at
  the University of
  Amsterdam; in 1900 came his appointment as Extraordinary
  Professor. In 1908 <a href="../1910/index.html">Van der Waals
  (Nobel Prize in Physics for 1910)</a> reached the retiring age of
  70 and Zeeman was chosen as his successor, at the same time
  functioning as Director of the Physics Laboratory. In 1923 a new
  laboratory, specially erected for him, was put at his disposal, a
  prominent feature being a concrete block weighing a quarter of a
  million kilograms, erected free from the floor, as a suitable
  platform for vibration-free experiments. The institute is now
  known as the Zeeman Laboratory of Amsterdam University. Many
  world-famous scientists have visited Zeeman there or worked with
  him for some time. He remained in this dual function for 35 years
  - on numerous occasions refusing an invitation to occupy a Chair
  abroad - until in 1935 he had to resign on account of his
  pensionable age. An accomplished teacher and of kind disposition
  he was much loved by his pupils. One of these was C.J. Bakker,
  who was from 1955 until his untimely death in an aircraft
  accident in 1960 the General Director of the Organisation Europ&eacute;enne pour la Recherche Nucl&eacute;aire (CERN) at Geneva. Another worker
  in his laboratory was S. Goudsmit, who in 1925 with G.E.
  Uhlenbeck originated the concept of electron spin.<br>
  <br>
  Zeeman's talent for natural science first became apparent in
  1883, when, while still attending the secondary school, he gave
  an apt description and drawing of an aurora borealis - then
  clearly to be observed in his country - which was published in
  <i>Nature</i>. (The Editor praised the meticulous observations of
  &laquo;Professor Zeeman in his observatory at
  Zonnemaire&raquo;!)<br>
  <br>
  Zeeman's main theme of investigation has always concerned optical
  phenomena. His first treatise <i>Mesures relatives du
  ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de Kerr</i>, written in 1892, was rewarded
  with a Gold Medal from the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haarlem;
  his doctor's thesis dealt with the same subject. In Strasbourg he
  studied the propagation and absorption of electrical waves in
  fluids. His principal work, however, was the study of the
  influence of magnetism on the nature of light radiation, started
  by him in the summer of 1896, which formed a logical continuation
  of his investigation into the Kerr effect. The discovery of the
  so-called Zeeman effect, for which he has been awarded the Nobel
  Prize, was communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences in
  Amsterdam - through H. Kamerlingh Onnes (1896) and J.D. van der
  Waals (1897) - in the form of papers entitled <i>Over den Invloed
  eener Magnetisatie op den Aard van het door een Stof uitgezonden
  Licht</i> (On the influence of a magnetization on the nature of
  light emitted by a substance) and <i>Over Doubletten en
  Tripletten in het Spectrum teweeggebracht door Uitwendige
  Magnetische Krachten</i> (On doublets and triplets in the
  spectrum caused by external magnetic forces) I, II and III. (The
  English translations of these papers appeared in <i>The
  Philosophical Magazine</i>; of the first paper a French version
  appeared in <i>Archives N&eacute;erlandaises des Sciences Exactes
  et Naturelles</i>, and in a short form in German in
  <i>Verhandlungen der Physikalischen Gesellschaft zu
  Berlin</i>.)<br>
  <br>
  The importance of the discovery can at once be judged by the fact
  that at one stroke the phenomenon not only confirmed Lorentz'
  theoretical conclusions with regard to the state of polarization
  of the light emitted by flames, but also demonstrated the
  negative nature of the oscillating particles, as well as the
  unexpectedly high ratio of their charge and mass (<i>e/m</i>).
  Thus, when in the following year the discovery of the existence
  of free electrons in the form of cathode rays was established by
  <a href="../1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a>, the identity of
  electrons and the oscillating light particles could be
  established from the negative nature and the <i>e/m</i> ratio of
  the particles. The growing number of observations made by other
  investigators on studying the effects of using various substances
  as light emitters - not all of them explicable by Lorentz'
  original theory (the so-called &laquo;anomalous Zeeman
  effect&raquo; could only adequately be explained at a later date,
  with the advent of Bohr's atomic theory, quantum wave mechanics,
  and the concept of the electron spin) - was assembled by him in
  his book <i>Researches in Magneto-Optics</i> (London 1913, German
  translation in 1914). Not only has the Zeeman effect thrown much
  light on the mechanism of light radiation and on the nature of
  matter and electricity, but its immense importance lies in the
  fact that even to this day it offers the ultimate means for
  revealing the intimate structure of the atom and the nature and
  behaviour of its components. It still serves as the final test in
  any new theory of the atom.<br>
  <br>
  Already in his second communication Zeeman expressed the opinion
  that the accepted existence of strong magnetic fields on the
  surface of the sun could be verified, since these should alter
  spectral lines derived from the celestial body. (It is typical of
  Zeeman to extend physical concepts into the realm of celestial
  phenomena.) In a letter to him (1908) the astronomer G.E. Hale,
  Director of Mount Wilson Observatory, corroborated this opinion
  by means of photographs which indicated that in solar vortices
  the spectral lines indeed appeared to be affected by magnetic
  fields. Even the theoretical prediction concerning the probable
  interrelationship between the directions of polarization and
  those of the magnetic fields was subsequently confirmed by
  Hale.<br>
  <br>
  With regard to Zeeman's activities outside the field of the
  magnetic splitting of spectral lines, mention should first be
  made of his work on the Doppler effect in optics and in canal
  rays (laboratory tests). A second field of study was that on the
  propagation of light in moving media (justification of the
  existence of the Lorentz-term in the Fresnel drag coefficient).
  Other investigations were those into the influence of the
  magnetic moment of the nucleus on the hyperfine structure of
  spectral lines. He also succeeded, with J. de Gier, in
  discovering a number of new isotopes (<sup>38</sup>Ar,
  <sup>64</sup>Ni, amongst others) by means of Thomson's parabola
  mass spectrograph. Zeeman's predilection for testing fundamental
  laws also found expression in his verification - carried out with
  an accuracy of &lt; 1: 10<sup>7</sup> - of the equality of heavy
  and inert masses.<br>
  <br>
  Zeeman was Honorary Doctor of the Universities of G&ouml;ttingen, Oxford, Philadelphia, Strasbourg,
  Li&egrave;ge,
  Ghent, Glasgow, Brussels and Paris. He was also a member or honorary
  member of numerous learned academies, including the very rare
  distinction of Associ&eacute; Etranger of the Acad&eacute;mie des
  Sciences of Paris. He was also member and Chairman of the
  Commission Internationale des Poids et Mesures, Paris. Appointed
  member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam in 1898, he
  served as the Secretary of the Mathematical-Physical Section from
  1912 to 1920. Among the other distinctions may be mentioned the
  Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London, the Prix Wilde of
  the Academie des Sciences of Paris, the Baumgartner-Preis of the
  Akademie der Wissenschaften of Vienna, the Matteucci Medal of the
  Italian Society of Sciences, the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute of
  Philadelphia, the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of
  Sciences of Washington. He was also made a Knight of the
  Order of Orange-Nassau and Commander of the Order of the
  Netherlands Lion.<br>
  <br>
  Outside his field of study Zeeman showed much interest in
  literature and the stage. An entertaining host, he loved to
  invite his collaborators and pupils to dine with him at his home,
  an event preceded by a learned talk in his study and followed by
  a gathering in the family circle.<br>
  <br>
  Zeeman married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret in 1895; they had one son
  and three daughters. During the last year of his professorship he
  suffered from ill-health. He died after a short illness on
  October 9, 1943.</p>
