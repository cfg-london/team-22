  <h1>Bruce Merrifield - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="merrifield.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Bruce
  Merrifield</b> was born in Fort Worth, Texas, July 15, 1921, the
  only son of George E. and Lorene (Lucas) Merrifield. In the
  spring of 1923 they drove across the southwest desert to settle
  in California where they lived in several cities throughout the
  state. He attended nine grade schools and two high schools before
  graduating from Montebello High School in 1939. His interest in
  chemistry began there and he also enjoyed the astronomy club
  where he ground a mirror and built a small reflecting telescope.
  As a senior he managed to be runner up in the annual science
  contest and in the process learned a valuable lesson in the
  scientific method.<br>
  <br>
  College began at Pasadena Junior College and at the end of two years
  he transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles
  (UCLA). After
  graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the Philip R.
  Park Research Foundation taking care of an animal colony and
  assisting with growth experiments on synthetic amino acid diets.
  One of these was the experiment by Geiger that first demonstrated
  that the essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for
  growth to occur.<br>
  <br>
  It soon became clear that more education was necessary and he
  returned to graduate school at the UCLA chemistry department with
  professor of biochemistry M.S. Dunn to develop microbiological
  methods for the quantitation of the pyrimidines. Graduation was
  on June 19, 1949, on June 20 he and Elizabeth Furlong were
  married, and on June 21 they left California for New York City
  and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.<br>
  <br>
  At the Institute, later Rockefeller University, he worked as an
  Assistant for Dr. D.W. Woolley who was to have a profound
  influence on his career. They worked on a dinucleotide growth
  factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth
  factors that Woolley had discovered earlier. These studies led to
  the need for peptide synthesis and, eventually, to the idea for
  solid phase peptide synthesis in 1959. The development and
  application of the technique have occupied him and his laboratory
  up to the present date. He is very proud of the fact that his
  office was once occupied by the great pioneer peptide chemist,
  Max Bergmann, and has been inspired by the knowledge that his
  laboratories were once filled with names like Leonidas Zervas,
  Joseph Fruton, Klaus Hoffmann, Emil Smith, <a href=
  "../1972/index.html">William Stein, and Stanford Moore</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime his wife, Libby, who was a biologist by training,
  stayed home in Cresskill, New Jersey, and raised their six
  children who now range in age from 19 to 32 years. They have been
  the great joy in the life of their parents; and now Jim has a
  daughter, Kelly, who is the pride of the whole family. Three
  years ago Libby joined the Merrifield laboratory at Rockefeller
  University.<br>
  <br>
  He was a Nobel Guest Professor at Uppsala
  University in 1968 and was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of
  Sciences in 1972. He has received several awards for his work
  on peptide chemistry including the Lasker Award for Basic Medical
  Research (1969), the Gairdner Award (1970), the Intra-Science
  Award (1970), the American Chemical Society Award for Creative
  Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry (1972), the Nichols Medal
  (1973), the Instrument Specialties Company Award of the University of Nebraska (1977), and the 2nd Alan E.
  Pierce Award of the American Peptide Symposium (1979).<br>
  <br>
  He has received honorary degrees from the University of
  Colorado (1969), Uppsala University (1970), Yale University
  (1971), Newark College of Engineering (1972), the Medical College of Ohio
  (1972), Colgate
  University (1977), and Boston College (1984). In 1984 he was appointed the
  John D. Rockefeller Jr. Professor of the Rockefeller
  University.</p>
