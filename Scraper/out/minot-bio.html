  <h1>George R. Minot - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="minot.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George
  Richards Minot</b> was born on December 2, 1885, at Boston,
  Massachusetts, U.S.A. His ancestor, George Minot, had migrated to
  America in 1630, from Saffron Walden, England. His father, James
  Jackson Minot, was a physician, and his mother was Elizabeth
  Whitney.<br>
  <br>
  In his youth Minot was interested in butterflies and moths, and
  he published two articles on butterflies. He went to Harvard University
  and there took his A.B. degree in 1908, his M.D. in 1912, and
  gained an honorary degree of Sc.D. in 1928.<br>
  <br>
  He did his hospital training at the Massachusetts
  General Hospital and then worked at Johns Hopkins Hospital
  and Medical School, under W. S. Thayer and W. H. Howell.<br>
  <br>
  In 1915 he was appointed Assistant in Medicine at the Harvard Medical
  School and the Massachusetts General Hospital and was later
  appointed to a more senior post there.<br>
  <br>
  In 1922 he became Physician-in-Chief of the Collis P. Huntington
  Memorial Hospital of Harvard University, and later was appointed
  to the Staff of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  In 1928 he was elected Professor of Medicine at Harvard
  University and Director of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory and
  Visiting Physician to the Boston City Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  Minot early became, when he was a medical student, interested in
  the disorders of the blood with which his name is associated and
  he published during his life many papers on this and other
  subjects. Arthritis, cancer, dietary deficiencies, the part
  played by diet (vitamin B deficiency) in the production of
  so-called alcoholic polyneuritis and the social aspects of
  disease were among the subjects of his papers. Further he studied
  the coagulation of the blood, blood transfusion, the blood
  platelets and the reticulocytes as well as certain blood
  disorders, and he described an atypical familial haemorrhagic
  condition associated with prolonged anaemia. He also studied the
  condition of the blood in certain cases of industrial
  poisoning.<br>
  <br>
  Among his other interests were leucaemia, disorders of the
  lymphatic tissues and polycythaemia, but his most important
  contributions to knowledge were made in his studies of anaemia.
  His name will always be associated with the therapy of pernicious
  anaemia, in which he first became interested in 1914, but it was
  not until later that he, like <a href="murphy-bio.html">William
  P. Murphy</a>, became impressed by the work of <a href=
  "whipple-bio.html">George Hoyt Whipple</a> on the treatment of
  experimental forms of anaemia in dogs, and in 1926 he and Murphy
  described the effective treatment of pernicious anaemia by means
  of liver. For this work he and Murphy and Whipple were awarded,
  in 1934, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.
  Subsequently, Minot, in collaboration with Edwin J. Cohn,
  extended this work by showing the efficacy of certain fractions
  of liver substance and he demonstrated the value of reticulocyte
  reactions in the evaluation of therapeutic procedures. He also
  added to knowledge of gastro-intestinal functions and of iron
  therapy for anaemia, and to knowledge of other aspects of this
  group of diseases.<br>
  <br>
  Minot was member or fellow of numerous medical and allied
  organizations in his own country and abroad, and served as Editor
  of several medical publications. Among the many honours and
  distinctions he received, may be mentioned: the Cameron Prize in
  Practical Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh, in 1930 (jointly
  with W. P. Murphy), the Popular Science Monthly Gold Medal and
  Annual Award for 1930 (jointly with G. H. Whipple), and the John
  Scott Medal of the City of Philadelphia.<br>
  <br>
  On June 29, 1915, Minot married Marian Linzee Weld; there were
  two daughters and one son by this marriage.<br>
  <br>
  After a long and busy life, during which he made many important
  contributions to medical knowledge, especially to that of
  diseases of the blood, Minot died, full of honours, in 1950.</p>
