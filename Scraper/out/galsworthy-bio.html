  <h1>John Galsworthy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="galsworthy.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John Galsworthy</b> (1867-1933) was
  educated at Harrow and studied law at New College,
  Oxford. He travelled widely and at the age of twenty-eight began
  to write, at first for his own amusement. His first stories were
  published under the pseudonym John Sinjohn and later were
  withdrawn. He considered <i>The Island Pharisees</i> (1904) his
  first important work. As a novelist Galsworthy is chiefly known
  for his <i>roman fleuve, The Forsyte Saga</i>. The first novel of
  this vast work appeared in 1906. <i>The Man of Property</i> was a
  harsh criticism of the upper middle classes, Galsworthy's own
  background. Galsworthy did not immediately continue it; fifteen
  years and with them the First World War intervened until he
  resumed work on the history of the Forsytes with <i>In
  Chancery</i> (1920) and <i>To Let</i> (1921). Meanwhile he had
  written a considerable number of novels, short stories, and
  plays. <i>The Forsyte Saga</i> was continued y the three volumes
  of <i>A Modern Comedy</i>, <i>The White Monkey</i> (1924), <i>The
  Silver Spoon</i> (1926), <i>Swan Song</i> (1928), and its two
  interludes <i>A Silent Wooing</i> and <i>Passersby</i> (1927). To
  these should be added <i>On Forsyte Change</i> (1930), a
  collection of short stories. With growing age Galsworthy came
  more and more to identify himself with the world of his novels,
  which at first he had judged very harshly. This development is
  nowhere more evident than in the author's changing attitude
  toward Soames Forsyte, the &laquo;man of property&raquo;, who
  dominates the first part of the work.<br>

  Galsworthy was a dramatist of considerable technical skill. His
  plays often took up specific social grievances such as the double
  standard of justice as applied to the upper and lower classes in
  <i>The Silver Box</i> (1906) and the confrontation of capital and
  labour in <i>Strife</i> (1909). <i>Justice</i> (1910), his most
  famous play, led to a prison reform in England. Galsworthy's
  reaction o the First World War found its expression in <i>The
  Mob</i> (1914), in which the voice of a statesman is drowned in
  the madness of the war-hungry masses; and in enmity of the two
  families of <i>The Skin Game</i> (1920).</p>
