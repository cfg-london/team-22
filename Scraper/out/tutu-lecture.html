  <h1>Desmond Tutu - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture<a href="#footnote">*</a>,
  December 11, 1984</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>Before I left South Africa, a land I love
  passionately, we had an emergency meeting of the Executive
  Committee of the South African Council of Churches with the
  leaders of our member churches. We called the meeting because of
  the deepening crisis in our land, which has claimed nearly 200
  lives this year alone. We visited some of the trouble-spots on
  the Witwatersrand. I went with others to the East Rand. We
  visited the home of an old lady. She told us that she looked
  after her grandson and the children of neighbors while their
  parents were at work. One day the police chased some pupils who
  had been boycotting classes, but they disappeared between the
  township houses. The police drove down the old lady's street. She
  was sitting at the back of the house in her kitchen, whilst her
  charges were playing in the front of the house in the yard. Her
  daughter rushed into the house, calling out to her to come
  quickly. The old lady dashed out of the kitchen into the living
  room. Her grandson had fallen just inside the door, dead. He had
  been shot in the back by the police. He was 6 years old. A few
  weeks later, a white mother, trying to register her black servant
  for work, drove through a black township. Black rioters stoned
  her car and killed her baby of a few months old, the first white
  casualty of the current unrest in South Africa. Such deaths are
  two too many. These are part of the high cost of apartheid.</p>

  <p>Everyday in a squatter camp near Cape Town,
  called K.T.C., the authorities have been demolishing flimsy
  plastic shelters which black mothers have erected because they
  were taking their marriage vows seriously. They have been reduced
  to sitting on soaking mattresses, with their household effects
  strewn round their feet, and whimpering babies on their laps, in
  the cold Cape winter rain. Everyday the authorities have carried
  out these callous demolitions. What heinous crime have these
  women committed, to be hounded like criminals in this manner? All
  they have wanted is to be with their husbands, the fathers of
  their children. Everywhere else in the world they would be highly
  commended, but in South Africa, a land which claims to be
  Christian, and which boasts a public holiday called Family Day,
  these gallant women are treated so inhumanely, and yet all they
  want is to have a decent and stable family life. Unfortunately,
  in the land of their birth, it is a criminal offence for them to
  live happily with their husbands and the fathers of their
  children. Black family life is thus being undermined, not
  accidentally, but by deliberate Government policy. It is part of
  the price human beings, God's children, are called to pay for
  apartheid. An unacceptable price.</p>

  <p>I come from a beautiful land, richly
  endowed by God with wonderful natural resources, wide expanses,
  rolling mountains, singing birds, bright shining stars out of
  blue skies, with radiant sunshine, golden sunshine. There is
  enough of the good things that come from God's bounty, there is
  enough for everyone, but apartheid has confirmed some in their
  selfishness, causing them to grasp greedily a disproportionate
  share, the lion's share, because of their power. They have taken
  87 of the land, though being only about 20 of our population. The
  rest have had to make do with the remaining 13. Apartheid has
  decreed the politics of exclusion. 73 of the population is
  excluded from any meaningful participation in the political
  decision-making processes of the land of their birth. The new
  constitution, making provision of three chambers, for whites,
  coloreds, and Indians, mentions blacks only once, and thereafter
  ignores them completely. Thus this new constitution, lauded in
  parts of the West as a step in the right direction, entrenches
  racism and ethnicity. The constitutional committees are composed
  in the ratio of 4 whites to 2 coloreds and 1 Indian. 0 black. 2 +
  1 can never equal, let alone be more than, 4. Hence this
  constitution perpetuates by law and entrenches white minority
  rule. Blacks are expected to exercise their political ambitions
  in unviable, poverty-stricken, arid, bantustan homelands,
  ghettoes of misery, inexhaustible reservoirs of cheap black
  labor, bantustans into which South Africa is being balkanized.
  Blacks are systematically being stripped of their South African
  citizenship and being turned into aliens in the land of their
  birth. This is apartheid's final solution, just as Nazism had its
  final solution for the Jews in Hitler's Aryan madness. The South
  African Government is smart. Aliens can claim but very few
  rights, least of all political rights.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of apartheid's ideological
  racist dream, over 3.000.000 of God's children have been uprooted
  from their homes, which have been demolished, whilst they have
  then been dumped in the bantustan homeland resettlement camps. I
  say dumped advisedly: only things or rubbish is dumped, not human
  beings. Apartheid has, however, ensured that God's children, just
  because they are black, should be treated as if they were things,
  and not as of infinite value as being created in the image of
  God. These dumping grounds are far from where work and food can
  be procured easily. Children starve, suffer from the often
  irreversible consequences of malnutrition - this happens to them
  not accidentally, but by deliberate Government policy. They
  starve in a land that could be the bread basket of Africa, a land
  that normally is a net exporter of food.</p>

  <p>The father leaves his family in the
  bantustan homeland, there eking out a miserable existence, whilst
  he, if he is lucky, goes to the so-called white man's town as a
  migrant, to live an unnatural life in a single sex hostel for 11
  months of the year, being prey there to prostitution,
  drunkenness, and worse. This migratory labor policy is declared
  Government policy, and has been condemned, even by the white
  Dutch Reformed Church,<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> not
  noted for being quick to criticize the Government, as a cancer in
  our society. This cancer, eating away at the vitals of black
  family life, is deliberate Government policy. It is part of the
  cost of apartheid, exorbitant in terms of human suffering.</p>

  <p>Apartheid has spawned discriminatory
  education, such as Bantu Education, education for serfdom,
  ensuring that the Government spends only about one tenth on one
  black child per annum for education what it spends on a white
  child. It is education that is decidedly separate and unequal. It
  is to be wantonly wasteful of human resources, because so many of
  God's children are prevented, by deliberate Government policy,
  from attaining to their fullest potential. South Africa is paying
  a heavy price already for this iniquitous policy because there is
  a desperate shortage of skilled manpower, a direct result of the
  short-sighted schemes of the racist regime. It is a moral
  universe that we inhabit, and good and right equity matter in the
  universe of the God we worship. And so, in this matter, the South
  African Government and its supporters are being properly hoisted
  with their own petard.</p>

  <p>Apartheid is upheld by a phalanx of
  iniquitous laws, such as the Population Registration Act, which
  decrees that all South Africans must be classified ethnically,
  and duly registered according to these race categories. Many
  times, in the same family one child has been classified white
  whilst another, with a slightly darker hue, has been classified
  colored, with all the horrible consequences for the latter of
  being shut out from membership of a greatly privileged caste.
  There have, as a result, been several child suicides. This is too
  high a price to pay for racial purity, for it is doubtful whether
  any end, however desirable, can justify such a means. There are
  laws, such as the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, which
  regard marriages between a white and a person of another race as
  illegal. Race becomes an impediment to a valid marriage. Two
  persons who have fallen in love are prevented by race from
  consummating their love in the marriage bond. Something beautiful
  is made to be sordid and ugly. The Immorality Act decrees that
  fornication and adultery are illegal if they happen between a
  white and one of another race. The police are reduced to the
  level of peeping Toms to catch couples red-handed. Many whites
  have committed suicide rather than face the disastrous
  consequences that follow in the train of even just being charged
  under this law. The cost is too great and intolerable.</p>

  <p>Such an evil system, totally indefensible
  by normally acceptable methods, relies on a whole phalanx of
  draconian laws such as the security legislation which is almost
  peculiar to South Africa. There are the laws which permit the
  indefinite detention of persons whom the Minister of Law and
  Order has decided are a threat to the security of the State. They
  are detained at his pleasure, in solitary confinement, without
  access to their family, their own doctor, or a lawyer. That is
  severe punishment when the evidence apparently available to the
  Minister has not been tested in an open court - perhaps it could
  stand up to such rigorous scrutiny, perhaps not; we are never to
  know. It is a far too convenient device for a repressive regime,
  and the minister would have to be extra special not to succumb to
  the temptation to circumvent the awkward process of testing his
  evidence in an open court, and thus he lets his power under the
  law to be open to the abuse where he is both judge and
  prosecutor. Many, too many, have died mysteriously in detention.
  All this is too costly in terms of human lives. The minister is
  able, too, to place people under banning orders without being
  subjected to the annoyance of the checks and balances of due
  process. A banned person for 3 or 5 years becomes a non-person,
  who cannot be quoted during the period of her banning order. She
  cannot attend a gathering, which means more than one other
  person. Two persons together talking to a banned person are a
  gathering! She cannot attend the wedding or funeral of even her
  own child without special permission. She must be at home from
  6:00 PM of one day to 6:00 AM of the next and on all public
  holidays, and from 6:00 PM on Fridays until 6:00 AM on Mondays
  for 3 years. She cannot go on holiday outside the magisterial
  area to which she has been confined. She cannot go to the cinema,
  nor to a picnic. That is severe punishment, inflicted without the
  evidence allegedly justifying it being made available to the
  banned person, nor having it scrutinized in a court of law. It is
  a serious erosion and violation of basic human rights, of which
  blacks have precious few in the land of their birth. They do not
  enjoy the rights of freedom of movement and association. They do
  not enjoy freedom of security of tenure, the right to participate
  in the making of decisions that affect their lives. In short,
  this land, richly endowed in so many ways, is sadly lacking in
  justice.</p>

  <p>Once a Zambian and a South African, it is
  said, were talking. The Zambian then boasted about their Minister
  of Naval Affairs. The South African asked, "But you have no navy,
  no access to the sea. How then can you have a Minister of Naval
  Affairs?" The Zambian retorted, "Well, in South Africa you have a
  Minister of Justice, don't you?"</p>

  <p>It is against this system that our people
  have sought to protest peacefully since 1912 at least, with the
  founding of the African National Congress. They have used the
  conventional methods of peaceful protest - petitions,
  demonstrations, deputations, and even a passive resistance
  campaign. A tribute to our people's commitment to peaceful change
  is the fact that the only South Africans to win the Nobel Peace
  Prize are both black. Our people are peace-loving to a fault. The
  response of the authorities has been an escalating intransigence
  and violence, the violence of police dogs, tear gas, detention
  without trial, exile, and even death. Our people protested
  peacefully against the Pass Laws in 1960, and 69 of them were
  killed on March 21, 1960, at Sharpeville, many shot in the back
  running away. Our children protested against inferior education,
  singing songs and displaying placards and marching peacefully.
  Many in 1976, on June 16th and subsequent times, were killed or
  imprisoned. Over 500 people died in that uprising. Many children
  went into exile. The whereabouts of many are unknown to their
  parents. At present, to protest that self-same discriminatory
  education, and the exclusion of blacks from the new
  constitutional dispensation, the sham local black government,
  rising unemployment, increased rents and General Sales Tax, our
  people have boycotted and demonstrated. They have staged a
  successful two-day stay away. Over 150 people have been killed.
  It is far too high a price to pay. There has been little
  revulsion or outrage at this wanton destruction of human life in
  the West. In parenthesis, can somebody please explain to me
  something that has puzzled me. When a priest goes missing and is
  subsequently found dead, the media in the West carry his story in
  very extensive coverage.<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> I
  am glad that the death of one person can cause so much concern.
  But in the self-same week when this priest is found dead, the
  South African Police kill 24 blacks who had been participating in
  the protest, and 6.000 blacks are sacked for being similarly
  involved, and you are lucky to get that much coverage. Are we
  being told something I do not want to believe, that we blacks are
  expendable and that blood is thicker than water, that when it
  comes to the crunch, you cannot trust whites, that they will club
  together against us? I don't want to believe that is the message
  being conveyed to us.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, we see before us a land
  bereft of much justice, and therefore without peace and security.
  Unrest is endemic, and will remain an unchanging feature of the
  South African scene until apartheid, the root cause of it all, is
  finally dismantled. At this time, the Army is being quartered on
  the civilian population. There is a civil war being waged. South
  Africans are on either side. When the African National Congress
  and the Pan-Africanist Congress<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> were banned in 1960, they declared
  that they had no option but to carry out the armed struggle. We
  in the South African Council of Church have said we are opposed
  to all forms of violence - that of a repressive and unjust
  system, and that of those who seek to overthrow that system.
  However, we have added that we understand those who say they have
  had to adopt what is a last resort for them. Violence is not
  being introduced into the South African situation <i>de novo</i>
  from outside by those who are called terrorists or freedom
  fighters, depending on whether you are oppressed or an oppressor.
  The South African situation is violent already, and the primary
  violence is that of apartheid, the violence of forced population
  removals, of inferior education, of detention without trial, of
  the migratory labor system, etc.</p>

  <p>There is war on the border of our country.
  South African faces fellow South African. South African soldiers
  are fighting against Namibians who oppose the illegal occupation
  of their country by South Africa, which has sought to extend its
  repressive system of apartheid, unjust and exploitative.</p>

  <p>There is no peace in Southern Africa. There
  is no peace because there is no justice. There can be no real
  peace and security until there be first justice enjoyed by all
  the inhabitants of that beautiful land. The Bible knows nothing
  about peace without justice, for that would be crying "peace,
  peace, where there is no peace". God's Shalom, peace, involves
  inevitably righteousness, justice, wholeness, fullness of life,
  participation in decision-making, goodness, laughter, joy,
  compassion, sharing and reconciliation.</p>

  <p>I have spoken extensively about South
  Africa, first because it is the land I know best, but because it
  is also a microcosm of the world and an example of what is to be
  found in other lands in differing degree - when there is
  injustice, invariably peace becomes a casualty. In El Salvador,
  in Nicaragua, and elsewhere in Latin America, there have been
  repressive regimes which have aroused opposition in those
  countries. Fellow citizens are pitted against one another,
  sometimes attracting the unhelpful attention and interest of
  outside powers, who want to extend their spheres of influence. We
  see this in the Middle East, in Korea, in the Philippines, in
  Kampuchea, in Vietnam, in Ulster, in Afghanistan, in Mozambique,
  in Angola, in Zimbabwe, behind the Iron Curtain.</p>

  <p>Because there is global insecurity, nations
  are engaged in a mad arms race, spending billions of dollars
  wastefully on instruments of destruction, when millions are
  starving. And yet, just a fraction of what is expended so
  obscenely on defense budgets would make the difference in
  enabling God's children to fill their stomachs, be educated, and
  given the chance to lead fulfilled and happy lives. We have the
  capacity to feed ourselves several times over, but we are daily
  haunted by the spectacle of the gaunt dregs of humanity shuffling
  along in endless queues, with bowls to collect what the charity
  of the world has provided, too little too late. When will we
  learn, when will the people of the world get up and say, Enough
  is enough. God created us for fellowship. God created us so that
  we should form the human family, existing together because we
  were made for one another. We are not made for an exclusive
  self-sufficiency but for interdependence, and we break the law of
  our being at our peril. When will we learn that an escalated arms
  race merely escalates global insecurity? We are now much closer
  to a nuclear holocaust than when our technology and our spending
  were less.</p>

  <p>Unless we work assiduously so that all of
  God's children, our brothers and sisters, members of our one
  human family, all will enjoy basic human rights, the right to a
  fulfilled life, the right of movement, of work, the freedom to be
  fully human, with a humanity measured by nothing less than the
  humanity of Jesus Christ Himself, then we are on the road
  inexorably to self-destruction, we are not far from global
  suicide; and yet it could be so different.</p>

  <p>When will we learn that human beings are of
  infinite value because they have been created in the image of
  God, and that it is a blasphemy to treat them as if they were
  less than this and to do so ultimately recoils on those who do
  this? In dehumanizing others, they are themselves dehumanized.
  Perhaps oppression dehumanizes the oppressor as much as, if not
  more than, the oppressed. They need each other to become truly
  free, to become human. We can be human only in fellowship, in
  community, in koinonia, in peace.</p>

  <p>Let us work to be peacemakers, those given
  a wonderful share in Our Lord's ministry of reconciliation. If we
  want peace, so we have been told, let us work for justice. Let us
  beat our swords into ploughshares.</p>

  <p>God calls us to be fellow workers with Him,
  so that we can extend His Kingdom of Shalom, of justice, of
  goodness, of compassion, of caring, of sharing, of laughter, joy
  and reconciliation, so that the kingdoms of this world will
  become the Kingdom of our God and of His Christ, and He shall
  reign forever and ever. Amen. Then there will be a fulfillment of
  the wonderful vision in the Revelation of St. John the Divine
  (Rev. 6:9ff):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>9. After this I beheld, and lo, a great
    multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and
    kindreds and people and tongues, stood before the throne and
    before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their
    hands,</p>

    <p>10. And cried with a loud voice saying,
    "Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and unto
    the Lamb".</p>

    <p>11. And all the angels stood round about
    the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell
    before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God</p>

    <p>12. saying, "Amen; Blessing and glory and
    wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be unto
    our God forever and ever. Amen".</p>
  </blockquote>
