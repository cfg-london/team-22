  <h2>What Desires Are Politically Important?</h2>
  <p>Your Royal Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>I have chosen this subject for my lecture
  tonight because I think that most current discussions of politics
  and political theory take insufficient account of psychology.
  Economic facts, population statistics, constitutional
  organization, and so on, are set forth minutely. There is no
  difficulty in finding out how many South Koreans and how many
  North Koreans there were when the Korean War began. If you will
  look into the right books you will be able to ascertain what was
  their average income per head, and what were the sizes of their
  respective armies. But if you want to know what sort of person a
  Korean is, and whether there is any appreciable difference
  between a North Korean and a South Korean; if you wish to know
  what they respectively want out of life, what are their
  discontents, what their hopes and what their fears; in a word,
  what it is that, as they say, &laquo;makes them tick&raquo;, you
  will look through the reference books in vain. And so you cannot
  tell whether the South Koreans are enthusiastic about UNO, or would prefer
  union with their cousins in the North. Nor can you guess whether
  they are willing to forgo land reform for the privilege of voting
  for some politician they have never heard of. It is neglect of
  such questions by the eminent men who sit in remote capitals,
  that so frequently causes disappointment. If politics is to
  become scientific, and if the event is not to be constantly
  surprising, it is imperative that our political thinking should
  penetrate more deeply into the springs of human action. What is
  the influence of hunger upon slogans? How does their
  effectiveness fluctuate with the number of calories in your diet?
  If one man offers you democracy and another offers you a bag of
  grain, at what stage of starvation will you prefer the grain to
  the vote? Such questions are far too little considered. However,
  let us, for the present, forget the Koreans, and consider the
  human race.<br>
  <br>
  All human activity is prompted by desire. There is a wholly
  fallacious theory advanced by some earnest moralists to the
  effect that it is possible to resist desire in the interests of
  duty and moral principle. I say this is fallacious, not because
  no man ever acts from a sense of duty, but because duty has no
  hold on him unless he desires to be dutiful. If you wish to know
  what men will do, you must know not only, or principally, their
  material circumstances, but rather the whole system of their
  desires with their relative strengths.<br>
  <br>
  There are some desires which, though very powerful, have not, as
  a rule, any great political importance. Most men at some period
  of their lives desire to marry, but as a rule they can satisfy
  this desire without having to take any political action. There
  are, of course, exceptions; the rape of the Sabine women is a
  case in point. And the development of northern Australia is
  seriously impeded by the fact that the vigorous young men who
  ought to do the work dislike being wholly deprived of female
  society. But such cases are unusual, and in general the interest
  that men and women take in each other has little influence upon
  politics.<br>
  <br>
  The desires that are politically important may be divided into a
  primary and a secondary group. In the primary group come the
  necessities of life: food and shelter and clothing. When these
  things become very scarce, there is no limit to the efforts that
  men will make, or to the violence that they will display, in the
  hope of securing them. It is said by students of the earliest
  history that, on four separate occasions, drought in Arabia
  caused the population of that country to overflow into
  surrounding regions, with immense effects, political, cultural,
  and religious. The last of these four occasions was the rise of
  Islam. The gradual spread of Germanic tribes from southern Russia
  to England, and thence to San Francisco, had similar motives.
  Undoubtedly the desire for food has been, and still is, one of
  the main causes of great political events.<br>
  <br>
  But man differs from other animals in one very important respect,
  and that is that he has some desires which are, so to speak,
  infinite, which can never be fully gratified, and which would
  keep him restless even in Paradise. The boa constrictor, when he
  has had an adequate meal, goes to sleep, and does not wake until
  he needs another meal. Human beings, for the most part, are not
  like this. When the Arabs, who had been used to living sparingly
  on a few dates, acquired the riches of the Eastern Roman Empire,
  and dwelt in palaces of almost unbelievable luxury, they did not,
  on that account, become inactive. Hunger could no longer be a
  motive, for Greek slaves supplied them with exquisite viands at
  the slightest nod. But other desires kept them active: four in
  particular, which we can label acquisitiveness, rivalry, vanity,
  and love of power.<br>
  <br>
  Acquisitiveness - the wish to possess as much as possible of
  goods, or the title to goods - is a motive which, I suppose, has
  its origin in a combination of fear with the desire for
  necessaries. I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who
  had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They
  lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they
  spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing
  potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had
  experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar
  manner. Similarly the Arab chieftains on their silken Byzantine
  divans could not forget the desert, and hoarded riches far beyond
  any possible physical need. But whatever may be the
  psychoanalysis of acquisitiveness, no one can deny that it is one
  of the great motives - especially among the more powerful, for,
  as I said before, it is one of the infinite motives. However much
  you may acquire, you will always wish to acquire more; satiety is
  a dream which will always elude you.<br>
  <br>
  But acquisitiveness, although it is the mainspring of the
  capitalist system, is by no means the most powerful of the
  motives that survive the conquest of hunger. Rivalry is a much
  stronger motive. Over and over again in Mohammedan history,
  dynasties have come to grief because the sons of a sultan by
  different mothers could not agree, and in the resulting civil war
  universal ruin resulted. The same sort of thing happens in modern
  Europe. When the British Government very unwisely allowed the
  Kaiser to be present at a naval review at Spithead, the thought
  which arose in his mind was not the one which we had intended.
  What he thought was, &laquo;I must have a Navy as good as
  Grandmamma's&raquo;. And from this thought have sprung all our
  subsequent troubles. The world would be a happier place than it
  is if acquisitiveness were always stronger than rivalry. But in
  fact, a great many men will cheerfully face impoverishment if
  they can thereby secure complete ruin for their rivals. Hence the
  present level of taxation.<br>
  <br>
  Vanity is a motive of immense potency. Anyone who has much to do
  with children knows how they are constantly performing some
  antic, and saying &laquo;Look at me&raquo;. &laquo;Look at me&raquo;
  is one of the most fundamental desires of the human heart. It can
  take innumerable forms, from buffoonery to the pursuit of
  posthumous fame. There was a Renaissance Italian princeling who
  was asked by the priest on his deathbed if he had anything to
  repent of. &laquo;Yes&raquo;, he said, &laquo;there is one thing. On
  one occasion I had a visit from the Emperor and the Pope
  simultaneously. I took them to the top of my tower to see the
  view, and I neglected the opportunity to throw them both down,
  which would have given me immortal fame&raquo;. History does not
  relate whether the priest gave him absolution. One of the
  troubles about vanity is that it grows with what it feeds on. The
  more you are talked about, the more you will wish to be talked
  about. The condemned murderer who is allowed to see the account
  of his trial in the press is indignant if he finds a newspaper
  which has reported it inadequately. And the more he finds about
  himself in other newspapers, the more indignant he will be with
  the one whose reports are meagre. Politicians and literary men
  are in the same case. And the more famous they become, the more
  difficult the press-cutting agency finds it to satisfy them. It
  is scarcely possible to exaggerate the influence of vanity
  throughout the range of human life, from the child of three to
  the potentate at whose frown the world trembles. Mankind have
  even committed the impiety of attributing similar desires to the
  Deity, whom they imagine avid for continual praise.<br>
  <br>
  But great as is the influence of the motives we have been
  considering, there is one which outweighs them all. I mean the
  love of power. Love of power is closely akin to vanity, but it is
  not by any means the same thing. What vanity needs for its
  satisfaction is glory, and it is easy to have glory without
  power. The people who enjoy the greatest glory in the United
  States are film stars, but they can be put in their place by the
  Committee for Un-American Activities, which enjoys no glory
  whatever. In England, the King has more glory than the Prime
  Minister, but the Prime Minister has more power than the King.
  Many people prefer glory to power, but on the whole these people
  have less effect upon the course of events than those who prefer
  power to glory. When Bl&uuml;cher, in 1814, saw Napoleon's
  palaces, he said, &laquo;Wasn't he a fool to have all this and to
  go running after Moscow.&raquo; Napoleon, who certainly was not
  destitute of vanity, preferred power when he had to choose. To
  Bl&uuml;cher, this choice seemed foolish. Power, like vanity, is
  insatiable. Nothing short of omnipotence could satisfy it
  completely. And as it is especially the vice of energetic men,
  the causal efficacy of love of power is out of all proportion to
  its frequency. It is, indeed, by far the strongest motive in the
  lives of important men.<br>
  <br>
  Love of power is greatly increased by the experience of power,
  and this applies to petty power as well as to that of potentates.
  In the happy days before 1914, when well-to-do ladies could
  acquire a host of servants, their pleasure in exercising power
  over the domestics steadily increased with age. Similarly, in any
  autocratic regime, the holders of power become increasingly
  tyrannical with experience of the delights that power can afford.
  Since power over human beings is shown in making them do what
  they would rather not do, the man who is actuated by love of
  power is more apt to inflict pain than to permit pleasure. If you
  ask your boss for leave of absence from the office on some
  legitimate occasion, his love of power will derive more
  satisfaction from a refusal than from a consent. If you require a
  building permit, the petty official concerned will obviously get
  more pleasure from saying &laquo;No&raquo; than from saying
  &laquo;Yes&raquo;. It is this sort of thing which makes the love of
  power such a dangerous motive.<br>
  <br>
  But it has other sides which are more desirable. The pursuit of
  knowledge is, I think, mainly actuated by love of power. And so
  are all advances in scientific technique. In politics, also, a
  reformer may have just as strong a love of power as a despot. It
  would be a complete mistake to decry love of power altogether as
  a motive. Whether you will be led by this motive to actions which
  are useful, or to actions which are pernicious, depends upon the
  social system, and upon your capacities. If your capacities are
  theoretical or technical, you will contribute to knowledge or
  technique, and, as a rule, your activity will be useful. If you
  are a politician you may be actuated by love of power, but as a
  rule this motive will join itself on to the desire to see some
  state of affairs realized which, for some reason, you prefer to
  the status quo. A great general may, like Alcibiades, be quite
  indifferent as to which side he fights on, but most generals have
  preferred to fight for their own country, and have, therefore,
  had other motives besides love of power. The politician may
  change sides so frequently as to find himself always in the
  majority, but most politicians have a preference for one party to
  the other, and subordinate their love of power to this
  preference. Love of power as nearly pure as possible is to be
  seen in various different types of men. One type is the soldier
  of fortune, of whom Napoleon is the supreme example. Napoleon
  had, I think, no ideological preference for France over Corsica,
  but if he had become Emperor of Corsica he would not have been so
  great a man as he became by pretending to be a Frenchman. Such
  men, however, are not quite pure examples, since they also derive
  immense satisfaction from vanity. The purest type is that of the
  <i>eminence grise</i> - the power behind the throne that never
  appears in public, and merely hugs itself with the secret
  thought: &laquo;How little these puppets know who is pulling the
  strings.&raquo; Baron Holstein, who controlled the foreign policy
  of the German Empire from 1890 to 1906, illustrates this type to
  perfection. He lived in a slum; he never appeared in society; he
  avoided meeting the Emperor, except on one single occasion when
  the Emperor's importunity could not be resisted; he refused all
  invitations to Court functions, on the ground that he possessed
  no court dress. He had acquired secrets which enabled him to
  blackmail the Chancellor and many of the Kaiser's intimates. He
  used the power of blackmail, not to acquire wealth, or fame, or
  any other obvious advantage, but merely to compel the adoption of
  the foreign policy he preferred. In the East, similar characters
  were not very uncommon among eunuchs.<br>
  <br>
  I come now to other motives which, though in a sense less
  fundamental than those we have been considering, are still of
  considerable importance. The first of these is love of
  excitement. Human beings show their superiority to the brutes by
  their capacity for boredom, though I have sometimes thought, in
  examining the apes at the zoo, that they, perhaps, have the
  rudiments of this tiresome emotion. However that may be,
  experience shows that escape from boredom is one of the really
  powerful desires of almost all human beings. When white men first
  effect contact with some unspoilt race of savages, they offer
  them all kinds of benefits, from the light of the gospel to
  pumpkin pie. These, however, much as we may regret it, most
  savages receive with indifference. What they really value among
  the gifts that we bring to them is intoxicating liquor which
  enables them, for the first time in their lives, to have the
  illusion for a few brief moments that it is better to be alive
  than dead. Red Indians, while they were still unaffected by white
  men, would smoke their pipes, not calmly as we do, but
  orgiastically, inhaling so deeply that they sank into a faint.
  And when excitement by means of nicotine failed, a patriotic
  orator would stir them up to attack a neighbouring tribe, which
  would give them all the enjoyment that we (according to our
  temperament) derive from a horse race or a General Election. The
  pleasure of gambling consists almost entirely in excitement.
  Monsieur Huc describes Chinese traders at the Great Wall in
  winter, gambling until they have lost all their cash, then
  proceeding to lose all their merchandise, and at last gambling
  away their clothes and going out naked to die of cold. With
  civilized men, as with primitive Red Indian tribes, it is, I
  think, chiefly love of excitement which makes the populace
  applaud when war breaks out; the emotion is exactly the same as
  at a football match, although the results are sometimes somewhat
  more serious.<br>
  <br>
  It is not altogether easy to decide what is the root cause of the
  love of excitement. I incline to think that our mental make-up is
  adapted to the stage when men lived by hunting. When a man spent
  a long day with very primitive weapons in stalking a deer with
  the hope of dinner, and when, at the end of the day, he dragged
  the carcass triumphantly to his cave, he sank down in contented
  weariness, while his wife dressed and cooked the meat. He was
  sleepy, and his bones ached, and the smell of cooking filled
  every nook and cranny of his consciousness. At last, after
  eating, he sank into deep sleep. In such a life there was neither
  time nor energy for boredom. But when he took to agriculture, and
  made his wife do all the heavy work in the fields, he had time to
  reflect upon the vanity of human life, to invent mythologies and
  systems of philosophy, and to dream of the life hereafter in
  which he would perpetually hunt the wild boar of Valhalla. Our
  mental make-up is suited to a life of very severe physical labor.
  I used, when I was younger, to take my holidays walking. I would
  cover twenty-five miles a day, and when the evening came I had no
  need of anything to keep me from boredom, since the delight of
  sitting amply sufficed. But modern life cannot be conducted on
  these physically strenuous principles. A great deal of work is
  sedentary, and most manual work exercises only a few specialized
  muscles. When crowds assemble in Trafalgar Square to cheer to the
  echo an announcement that the government has decided to have them
  killed, they would not do so if they had all walked twenty-five
  miles that day. This cure for bellicosity is, however,
  impracticable, and if the human race is to survive - a thing
  which is, perhaps, undesirable - other means must be found for
  securing an innocent outlet for the unused physical energy that
  produces love of excitement. This is a matter which has been too
  little considered, both by moralists and by social reformers. The
  social reformers are of the opinion that they have more serious
  things to consider. The moralists, on the other hand, are
  immensely impressed with the seriousness of all the permitted
  outlets of the love of excitement; the seriousness, however, in
  their minds, is that of Sin. Dance halls, cinemas, this age of
  jazz, are all, if we may believe our ears, gateways to Hell, and
  we should be better employed sitting at home contemplating our
  sins. I find myself unable to be in entire agreement with the
  grave men who utter these warnings. The devil has many forms,
  some designed to deceive the young, some designed to deceive the
  old and serious. If it is the devil that tempts the young to
  enjoy themselves, is it not, perhaps, the same personage that
  persuades the old to condemn their enjoyment? And is not
  condemnation perhaps merely a form of excitement appropriate to
  old age? And is it not, perhaps, a drug which - like opium - has
  to be taken in continually stronger doses to produce the desired
  effect? Is it not to be feared that, beginning with the
  wickedness of the cinema, we should be led step by step to
  condemn the opposite political party, dagoes, wops, Asiatics,
  and, in short, everybody except the fellow members of our club?
  And it is from just such condemnations, when widespread, that
  wars proceed. I have never heard of a war that proceeded from
  dance halls.<br>
  <br>
  What is serious about excitement is that so many of its forms are
  destructive. It is destructive in those who cannot resist excess
  in alcohol or gambling. It is destructive when it takes the form
  of mob violence. And above all it is destructive when it leads to
  war. It is so deep a need that it will find harmful outlets of
  this kind unless innocent outlets are at hand. There are such
  innocent outlets at present in sport, and in politics so long as
  it is kept within constitutional bounds. But these are not
  sufficient, especially as the kind of politics that is most
  exciting is also the kind that does most harm. Civilized life has
  grown altogether too tame, and, if it is to be stable, it must
  provide harmless outlets for the impulses which our remote
  ancestors satisfied in hunting. In Australia, where people are
  few and rabbits are many, I watched a whole populace satisfying
  the primitive impulse in the primitive manner by the skillful
  slaughter of many thousands of rabbits. But in London or New York
  some other means must be found to gratify primitive impulse. I
  think every big town should contain artificial waterfalls that
  people could descend in very fragile canoes, and they should
  contain bathing pools full of mechanical sharks. Any person found
  advocating a preventive war should be condemned to two hours a
  day with these ingenious monsters. More seriously, pains should
  be taken to provide constructive outlets for the love of
  excitement. Nothing in the world is more exciting than a moment
  of sudden discovery or invention, and many more people are
  capable of experiencing such moments than is sometimes
  thought.<br>
  <br>
  Interwoven with many other political motives are two closely
  related passions to which human beings are regrettably prone: I
  mean fear and hate. It is normal to hate what we fear, and it
  happens frequently, though not always, that we fear what we hate.
  I think it may be taken as the rule among primitive men, that
  they both fear and hate whatever is unfamiliar. They have their
  own herd, originally a very small one. And within one herd, all
  are friends, unless there is some special ground of enmity. Other
  herds are potential or actual enemies; a single member of one of
  them who strays by accident will be killed. An alien herd as a
  whole will be avoided or fought according to circumstances. It is
  this primitive mechanism which still controls our instinctive
  reaction to foreign nations. The completely untravelled person
  will view all foreigners as the savage regards a member of
  another herd. But the man who has travelled, or who has studied
  international politics, will have discovered that, if his herd is
  to prosper, it must, to some degree, become amalgamated with
  other herds. If you are English and someone says to you,
  &laquo;The French are your brothers&raquo;, your first instinctive
  feeling will be, &laquo;Nonsense. They shrug their shoulders, and
  talk French. And I am even told that they eat frogs.&raquo; If he
  explains to you that we may have to fight the Russians, that, if
  so, it will be desirable to defend the line of the Rhine, and
  that, if the line of the Rhine is to be defended, the help of the
  French is essential, you will begin to see what he means when he
  says that the French are your brothers. But if some
  fellow-traveller were to go on to say that the Russians also are
  your brothers, he would be unable to persuade you, unless he
  could show that we are in danger from the Martians. We love those
  who hate our enemies, and if we had no enemies there would be
  very few people whom we should love.<br>
  <br>
  All this, however, is only true so long as we are concerned
  solely with attitudes towards other human beings. You might
  regard the soil as your enemy because it yields reluctantly a
  niggardly subsistence. You might regard Mother Nature in general
  as your enemy, and envisage human life as a struggle to get the
  better of Mother Nature. If men viewed life in this way,
  cooperation of the whole human race would become easy. And men
  could easily be brought to view life in this way if schools,
  newspapers, and politicians devoted themselves to this end. But
  schools are out to teach patriotism; newspapers are out to stir
  up excitement; and politicians are out to get re-elected. None of
  the three, therefore, can do anything towards saving the human
  race from reciprocal suicide.<br>
  <br>
  There are two ways of coping with fear: one is to diminish the
  external danger, and the other is to cultivate Stoic endurance.
  The latter can be reinforced, except where immediate action is
  necessary, by turning our thoughts away from the cause of fear.
  The conquest of fear is of very great importance. Fear is in
  itself degrading; it easily becomes an obsession; it produces
  hate of that which is feared, and it leads headlong to excesses
  of cruelty. Nothing has so beneficent an effect on human beings
  as security. If an international system could be established
  which would remove the fear of war, the improvement in everyday
  mentality of everyday people would be enormous and very rapid.
  Fear, at present, overshadows the world. The atom bomb and the
  bacterial bomb, wielded by the wicked communist or the wicked
  capitalist as the case may be, make Washington and the Kremlin
  tremble, and drive men further along the road toward the abyss.
  If matters are to improve, the first and essential step is to
  find a way of diminishing fear. The world at present is obsessed
  by the conflict of rival ideologies, and one of the apparent
  causes of conflict is the desire for the victory of our own
  ideology and the defeat of the other. I do not think that the
  fundamental motive here has much to do with ideologies. I think
  the ideologies are merely a way of grouping people, and that the
  passions involved are merely those which always arise between
  rival groups. There are, of course, various reasons for hating
  communists. First and foremost, we believe that they wish to take
  away our property. But so do burglars, and although we disapprove
  of burglars our attitude towards them is very different indeed
  from our attitude towards communists - chiefly because they do
  not inspire the same degree of fear. Secondly, we hate the
  communists because they are irreligious. But the Chinese have
  been irreligious since the eleventh century, and we only began to
  hate them when they turned out Chiang Kai-shek. Thirdly, we hate
  the communists because they do not believe in democracy, but we
  consider this no reason for hating Franco. Fourthly, we hate them
  because they do not allow liberty; this we feel so strongly that
  we have decided to imitate them. It is obvious that none of these
  is the real ground for our hatred. We hate them because we fear
  them and they threaten us. If the Russians still adhered to the
  Greek Orthodox religion, if they had instituted parliamentary
  government, and if they had a completely free press which daily
  vituperated us, then - provided they still had armed forces as
  powerful as they have now - we should still hate them if they
  gave us ground for thinking them hostile. There is, of course,
  the <i>odium theologicum</i>, and it can be a cause of enmity.
  But I think that this is an offshoot of herd feeling: the man who
  has a different theology feels strange, and whatever is strange
  must be dangerous. Ideologies, in fact, are one of the methods by
  which herds are created, and the psychology is much the same
  however the herd may have been generated.<br>
  <br>
  You may have been feeling that I have allowed only for bad
  motives, or, at best, such as are ethically neutral. I am afraid
  they are, as a rule, more powerful than more altruistic motives,
  but I do not deny that altruistic motives exist, and may, on
  occasion, be effective. The agitation against slavery in England
  in the early nineteenth century was indubitably altruistic, and
  was thoroughly effective. Its altruism was proved by the fact
  that in 1833 British taxpayers paid many millions in compensation
  to Jamaican landowners for the liberation of their slaves, and
  also by the fact that at the Congress of Vienna the British
  Government was prepared to make important concessions with a view
  to inducing other nations to abandon the slave trade. This is an
  instance from the past, but present-day America has afforded
  instances equally remarkable. I will not, however, go into these,
  as I do not wish to become embarked in current
  controversies.<br>
  <br>
  I do not think it can be questioned that sympathy is a genuine
  motive, and that some people at some times are made somewhat
  uncomfortable by the sufferings of some other people. It is
  sympathy that has produced the many humanitarian advances of the
  last hundred years. We are shocked when we hear stories of the
  ill-treatment of lunatics, and there are now quite a number of
  asylums in which they are not ill-treated. Prisoners in Western
  countries are not supposed to be tortured, and when they are,
  there is an outcry if the facts are discovered. We do not approve
  of treating orphans as they are treated in <i>Oliver Twist</i>.
  Protestant countries disapprove of cruelty to animals. In all
  these ways sympathy has been politically effective. If the fear
  of war were removed, its effectiveness would become much greater.
  Perhaps the best hope for the future of mankind is that ways will
  be found of increasing the scope and intensity of sympathy.<br>
  <br>
  The time has come to sum up our discussion. Politics is concerned
  with herds rather than with individuals, and the passions which
  are important in politics are, therefore, those in which the
  various members of a given herd can feel alike. The broad
  instinctive mechanism upon which political edifices have to be
  built is one of cooperation within the herd and hostility towards
  other herds. The co-operation within the herd is never perfect.
  There are members who do not conform, who are, in the
  etymological sense, &laquo;egregious&raquo;, that is to say,
  outside the flock. These members are those who have fallen below,
  or risen above, the ordinary level. They are: idiots, criminals,
  prophets, and discoverers. A wise herd will learn to tolerate the
  eccentricity of those who rise above the average, and to treat
  with a minimum of ferocity those who fall below it.<br>
  <br>
  As regards relations to other herds, modern technique has
  produced a conflict between self-interest and instinct. In old
  days, when two tribes went to war, one of them exterminated the
  other, and annexed its territory. From the point of view of the
  victor, the whole operation was thoroughly satisfactory. The
  killing was not at all expensive, and the excitement was
  agreeable. It is not to be wondered at that, in such
  circumstances, war persisted. Unfortunately, we still have the
  emotions appropriate to such primitive warfare, while the actual
  operations of war have changed completely. Killing an enemy in a
  modern war is a very expensive operation. If you consider how
  many Germans were killed in the late war, and how much the
  victors are paying in income tax, you can, by a sum in long
  division, discover the cost of a dead German, and you will find
  it considerable. In the East, it is true, the enemies of the
  Germans have secured the ancient advantages of turning out the
  defeated population and occupying their lands. The Western
  victors, however, have secured no such advantages. It is obvious
  that modern war is not good business from a financial point of
  view. Although we won both the world wars, we should now be much
  richer if they had not occured. If men were actuated by
  self-interest, which they are not - except in the case of a few
  saints - the whole human race would cooperate. There would be no
  more wars, no more armies, no more navies, no more atom bombs.
  There would not be armies of propagandists employed in poisoning
  the minds of Nation A against Nation B, and reciprocally of
  Nation B against Nation A. There would not be armies of officials
  at frontiers to prevent the entry of foreign books and foreign
  ideas, however excellent in themselves. There would not be
  customs barriers to ensure the existence of many small
  enterprises where one big enterprise would be more economic. All
  this would happen very quickly if men desired their own happiness
  as ardently as they desired the misery of their neighbours. But,
  you will tell me, what is the use of these utopian dreams ?
  Moralists will see to it that we do not become wholly selfish,
  and until we do the millennium will be impossible.<br>

  I do not wish to seem to end upon a note of cynicism. I do not
  deny that there are better things than selfishness, and that some
  people achieve these things. I maintain, however, on the one
  hand, that there are few occasions upon which large bodies of
  men, such as politics is concerned with, can rise above
  selfishness, while, on the other hand, there are a very great
  many circumstances in which populations will fall below
  selfishness, if selfishness is interpreted as enlightened
  self-interest.<br>
  <br>
  And among those occasions on which people fall below
  self-interest are most of the occasions on which they are
  convinced that they are acting from idealistic motives. Much that
  passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of
  power. When you see large masses of men swayed by what appear to
  be noble motives, it is as well to look below the surface and ask
  yourself what it is that makes these motives effective. It is
  partly because it is so easy to be taken in by a facade of
  nobility that a psychological inquiry, such as I have been
  attempting, is worth making. I would say, in conclusion, that if
  what I have said is right, the main thing needed to make the
  world happy is intelligence. And this, after all, is an
  optimistic conclusion, because intelligence is a thing that can
  be fostered by known methods of education.</p>
