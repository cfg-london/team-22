  <h1>Andrew V. Schally - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schally.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born in
  Wilno, Poland on November 30, 1926, being of Polish,
  Austro-Hungarian, French and Swedish ancestry. My father, a
  professional soldier trained in the military academies of Vienna,
  Austria and St. Cyr, France, had to leave his family when the
  Second World War broke out to fight with the Allied Forces. My
  life and outlook were influenced by the harsh childhood which I
  spent in the Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe, but I was fortunate to
  survive the holocaust while living among the Jewish-Polish
  Community in Roumania. I used to speak Polish, Roumanian,
  Yiddish, Italian and some German and Russian, but I have almost
  completely forgotten them, and my French in which I used to excel
  is also now far from fluent. In 1945, I moved via Italy and
  France to England and Scotland. In spite of post-war economic and
  nutritional austerity, the United Kingdom seemed like a paradise
  to me because of the respect for human rights. Since that time, I
  have always had a profound friendship for the British. I received
  my high school diploma in Scotland in 1946 and afterwards studied
  chemistry in London. I adored English and Scottish association
  football and I even tried out as an inside forward for some
  English and Scottish football clubs, but since I could not devote
  enough time to training I never made regular First Division
  teams. However, since 1946 I have always stayed in excellent
  physical shape by swimming daily and practicing other sports.
  "Mens sana in corpore sano" has always truly been my motto. In
  England I also developed a great liking for classical music,
  especially Beethoven, Brahms and Liszt.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in medical research started at the age of 23, when I
  joined the National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR, MRC)
  Mill Hill, London, England. I was fortunate to work with and be
  exposed to the stimulating influences of such scientists as Dr.
  D. F. Elliott, Sir Charles Harington, Dr. <a href=
  "../1972/index.html">R.R. Porter</a>, Dr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/index.html">A.J.P. Martin</a>, Dr. R.
  Pitt-Rivers, Dr. J. Gross, Dr. T. S. Work, Dr. H.
  Fraenkel-Conrat, and Dr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1975/index.html">W. Cornforth</a>, several
  of whom later won Nobel Prizes for chemistry or physiology and
  medicine. Although my position was very junior at Mill Hill, my
  work was appreciated and this was a source of tremendous
  satisfaction for me, inasmuch as this recognition came from
  scientists of such caliber. I learned much in those 2 1/2 years,
  not only technical expertise but also the philosophy of research
  and a systematic approach to scientific investigations. These
  years of instruction (1950-1952) were decisive in providing
  inspiration, training, and laboratory discipline and profoundly
  influenced the course of my career. In fact, it was at NIMR, Mill
  Hill where I endured my "baptism of fire" in medical research and
  became addicted to it. In May, 1952, I moved to Montreal, Canada
  where I was given the opportunity to work and study at McGill University.
  There I learned endocrinology from the brilliant lectures by
  Professor D. L. Thomson and from my work with Dr. M. Saffran in
  the laboratory of experimental therapeutics of the Allan Memorial
  Institute of Psychiatry headed by Dr. R. A. Cleghorn. The work at
  this laboratory was devoted to ACTH and adrenal cortical
  steroids. That period marked the beginning of my interest in the
  relationship between brain function and endocrine activity, and
  it was there in 1954 that my involvement in the hypothalamic
  field began.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955, using <i>in vitro</i> systems, Dr. M. Saffran and I
  demonstrated the presence of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)
  in hypothalamic and neurohypophysial tissue. This was the first
  experimental proof of the existence of hypothalamic hormones
  regulating pituitary function postulated with prophetic insight
  by Dr. G. W. Harris. I obtained my doctorate at McGill University
  in May, 1957, and in September of the same year I was able to
  secure a position which enabled me to continue my work on CRF at
  Baylor
  University College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, where I was
  associated with Dr. <a href="index.html">R. Guillemin</a>. My
  years in Houston (1957-1962) where I was Assistant Professor of
  Physiology and a Senior Research Fellow of the U.S. Public Health
  Service were discouraging and frustrating because of problems
  with the isolation of CRF. Our failure to obtain enough CRF to
  determine its structure tended to cast doubt on the initial
  findings. We encountered much skepticism, but I remained unshaken
  in my confidence in the correctness of the observations on CRF
  and in the postulation of other hypothalamic hormones regulating
  anterior pituitary function.<br>
  <br>
  In 1961 I spent about one month at the Institute of Biochemistry
  in Uppsala with Dr. J. Porath where I gained useful experience in
  the use of Sephadex and column electrophoresis. I also visited
  Dr. V. Mutt and the late Professor E. Jorpes in Stockholm, in
  connection with our collaboration on gastrointestinal hormones,
  and I was encouraged that they and other astute scientists had
  confidence in our work and the foresight to appreciate the
  possible scientific and medical importance of hypothalamic
  hormones.<br>
  <br>
  I was grateful for the opportunities I was given in the United
  States, for which I felt a complete allegiance, and in 1962
  became a naturalized citizen. When Dr. Joe Meyer, then head of
  the Veterans Administration (VA) basic research, offered in June,
  1962, to set up a VA laboratory devoted to research on the
  hypothalamus and make me its chief, I accepted since this gave me
  a clear opportunity to be in complete command of such an effort.
  The support of a number of individuals, including Dr. E. H.
  Bresler, then Associate Chief of Staff for Research of the New
  Orleans VA Hospital, Dr. C. Y. Bowers and Dr. G. Burch of the
  Department of Medicine of Tulane University School of Medicine,
  and Dr. W. Locke of the Ochsner Foundation Hospital, was
  instrumental in helping me establish the laboratory in New
  Orleans. In December of 1962, I was appointed Chief of the
  Endocrine and Polypeptide Laboratories at the VA Hospital in New
  Orleans and Associate Professor of Medicine at Tulane
  University, and, in 1966, Professor. The earliest members of
  our 1962 VA-Tulane team were T. W. Redding, W. H. Carter, and M.
  Tanaka. They have stayed with me all these years, and without
  their devoted help we could not have resolved the many problems
  associated with our work on TRH in 1969, LH-RH in 1971, and
  porcine somatostatin in 1975. Working in a clinical environment,
  I became more aware of the need for better diagnosis and
  treatment of patients than I had been before. It occurred to me
  early that problems with infertility on the one hand and the
  necessity for population control on the other would make a
  breakthrough in the control of reproduction particularly
  desirable from the standpoint of society, and therefore I became
  especially interested in reproductive endocrinology. To broaden
  our knowledge of reproductive processes at the brain level, we
  studied the central effects of contraceptive steroids and
  clomiphene. In some of the early studies on LH-RH, before its
  isolation, we collaborated with one of the pioneers of the
  hypothalamus and the man I always admired deeply, Professor C. H.
  (Tom) Sawyer and also with Drs. J. Hilliard, D. Holtkamp, A.
  Parlow and W. F. White.<br>
  <br>
  It was my good fortune that in 1964 Dr. A. J. Kastin and in 1965
  Dr. A. Arimura came to join our laboratory. Dr. Abba Kastin was
  mainly interested in continuing his work on control of release of
  MSH and in helping us in clinical work on hypothalamic hormones.
  He quickly became my best friend and a most efficient
  collaborator. Dr. Akira Arimura was an experienced physiologist
  and endocrinologist. Because of his great knowledge, enthusiasm
  and very hard work, he made great contributions in all phases of
  our program, and also broadened it with many independent ideas,
  especially in immunology. Other excellent collaborators at that
  time included Drs. I. Ishida, A. Kuroshima, T. Saito, and S.
  Sawano from Japan, and Dr. E. E. Muller from Italy.<br>
  <br>
  All during the period since 1962, I had been hard at work on TRH
  with Cy Bowers and Tom Redding. In 1966, we reported for the
  first time the isolation of porcine TRH and determined that it
  contained three amino acids (glutamic acid, histidine, and
  proline) in equimolar ratio, but did not take full advantage of
  this original early finding, as we were preoccupied with parallel
  studies on reproduction and growth hormone-releasing hormone
  (GH-RH). However, when R. Burgus and R. Guillemin announced at
  the 1969 Tucson, Arizona, conference that they also found the
  same three amino acids in ovine TRH, I realized that we had the
  right substance. The same year I established the correct amino
  acid sequence of porcine TRH with Dr. R. M. G. Nair in New
  Orleans. Subsequently, with help from Drs. F. Enzmann and J.
  B&oslash;ler working in K. Folkers laboratory in Austin, Texas, we
  were able to determine the structure of porcine TRH and
  synthesize it. We have shared the credit with R. Burgus, W. Vale
  and R. Guillemin, who elucidated the structure of ovine TRH at
  about the same time.<br>
  <br>
  The identification of TRH removed the skepticism surrounding the
  work on the hypothalamus and I realized that many workers would
  now be attracted to the field. We therefore redoubled our efforts
  on LH-RH.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965, in Mexico City, I met Dr. C. Gual of the National
  Institute of Nutrition who invited me to collaborate with him in
  the clinical testing of hypothalamic hormones in Mexico. We took
  advantage of this invitation and in 1968 demonstrated, with Cy
  Bowers, that preparations of natural TRH are active in humans.
  Subsequently, again in collaboration with Carlos Gual, Abba
  Kastin and I established that highly purified porcine LH-RH
  unequivocally released LH and FSH in men and women under a
  variety of conditions. It was clear that LH-RH might be useful
  clinically and this encouraged us to continue the agonizing
  effort involved in the isolation of this hormone. Although I
  consider myself an endocrinologist or neuroendocrinologist, with
  considerable interest in clinical endocrine research and not a
  biochemist, I personally carried out the isolation work on TRH,
  LH-RH, somatostatin, and other hormones. Only a person such as
  myself with strong faith in the presence of these materials would
  have the patience to go through the many fastidious steps of the
  isolation procedure, since the effort required in isolating
  exceedingly small quantities of gradually purer and purer
  materials from a crude hypothalamic exctract is so enormous. I
  was able to isolate a small amount (800 &micro;g) of LH-RH from
  160,000 hypothalami and proved it to be a polypeptide. This tiny
  amount of material was passed to our chemists, Dr. H. Matsuo and
  Dr. Y. Baba, with suggestions for a structural approach. Since I
  did not think that amounts of LH-RH on hand would be enough to
  complete our structural work, I decided to isolate additional
  amounts of LH-RH. Drs. Matsuo and Baba worked hard and
  efficiently, and we were able to determine the complete structure
  of LH-RH with the 800 &micro;g material. After confirming the
  structure by synthesis, we were in a position to present our
  findings at the Endocrine Society meeting in San Francisco,
  California, in June 1971. It was one of the high points in my
  life to be able to report for the first time the solution to the
  problem which had preoccupied me and others for so long.<br>
  <br>
  Physiological and subsequently immunological studies with natural
  and synthetic LH-RH in our laboratory by Drs. A. Arimura, L.
  Debeljuk, J. Reeves and M. Saito, and with others demonstrated
  that LH-RH was indeed the physiological hormone. With the
  synthetic LH-RH readily available, Dr. Kastin and I continued to
  carry out a variety of clinical studies in Mexico in association
  with Dr. Gual and later with Drs. A. Zarate and D.
  Gonzalez-Barcena. I also did parallel clinical tests with Dr. J.
  Zanartu in Chile and in Argentina with Drs. L. Schwarzstein, N.
  Aparicio, and the late R. Mancini.<br>
  <br>
  The importance of analogs, particularly with respect to the
  possibility of developing a new birth control method was
  uppermost in my mind. I was very fortunate in being able to
  induce Dr. D. H. Coy, a superb peptide chemist and his wife
  Esther, also a researcher, to join our laboratory in 1972. More
  than 300 analogs of LH-RH were synthesized by the Coys with the
  help of Drs. Y. Hirotsu, K. Nikolics and J. Sepr&ouml;di in our
  laboratory between 1972 and 1977. We were particularly interested
  in stimulatory long-acting superactive analogs for clinical use
  and in inhibitory analogs which would block LH and FSH release.
  We were joined in this important work by researchers from many
  countries. The work of Drs. J. Vilchez from Venezuela, A. de la
  Cruz from Peru, E. Pedroza from Colombia, and N. Nishi from Japan
  established in 1976 that the antagonists of LH-RH can indeed
  completely block ovulation in animals. Very recently with Dr. D.
  Gonzalez-Barcena in Mexico we showed that these analogs are also
  active in humans. This of course raises the possibility that such
  analogs could eventually form the basis of a new birth control
  method. However, much work is still needed to make my dream of
  being able to control reproduction at the central level come
  true.<br>
  <br>
  In 1971, immediately after solving the LH-RH problem, I decided
  to reinforce our attacks on PIF and GH-RF next, but six years of
  hard work with Dr. A. Arimura and Drs. J. Sandow from Germany, A.
  Dupont from Canada and J. Takahara from Japan resulted only in a
  demonstration that hypothalamic catecholamines and gamma-amino
  butyric acid (GABA) may be involved in the control of release of
  prolactin, but did not yet lead to the development of any
  clinical agents. In our preoccupation with PIF and GH-RH, we did
  not work on factors inhibiting growth hormone release but after
  P. Brazeau and collaborators in 1973 announced the isolation and
  structure of ovine somatostatin, we purified this hormone from
  porcine hypothalami, determined its structure and synthesized it.
  We also carried out much physiological and immunological work
  (some in collaboration with Dr. F. Labrie in Quebec, Canada), as
  well as clinical work which convinced us of its importance.
  Particularly important was the establishment of a
  radioimmunoassay for somatostatin by Dr. Arimura. The clinical
  work on somatostatin was carried out mainly in England. Brilliant
  clinicians Professor R. Hall from the Royal Victoria Infirmary in
  Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Professor G. M. Besser of St.
  Bartholomew's Hospital in London were our leaders of two clinical
  teams which also included excellent collaborators such as Drs. A.
  Gomez-Pan, D. Evered, C. Mortimer, S. R. Bloom, and others. These
  clinical studies in England (based in part on some of our
  suggestions) showed that somatostatin inhibits the release of GH,
  TSH, glucagon, insulin, and gastrin. Basic studies carried out in
  England in collaboration Dr. A. Gomez-Pan and in Poland with
  Professor S. Konturek showed that somatostatin also inhibits
  gastric acid and pepsin secretion, and the release of duodenal
  hormones, secretin and cholecystokinin. Since the immunological
  work of Dr. Arimura showed the presence of somatostatin in the
  pancreas, stomach and intestine, we then suggested that this
  substance may be involved in the control of secretion not only of
  the pituitary, but also of the pancreas, stomach and duodenum.
  Since somatostatin has multiple short-lived effects, Drs. D. H.
  Coy and C. Meyers are achieving considerable success in the
  synthesis of long-acting and selective analogs of somatostatin,
  some of which could be more practical clinical agents.<br>
  <br>
  Also among our present projects is the isolation of all the
  compounds with PIF activity, of PRH, GH-RH, CRF, and other
  hypothalamic substances. In addition to authoring or co-authoring
  many publications, I take satisfaction from the fact that I
  helped Dr. W. Locke write a book for clinical
  endocrinologists.<br>
  <br>
  Since much work with hypothalamic hormones and their analogs is
  being carried out in Latin America and Spain, my ability to
  communicate in Spanish and Portuguese has aided me greatly, and
  resulted in the formation of many beautiful friendships. However,
  the greatest reward for learning Spanish and Portuguese came
  when, in 1974, in the course of my work in Brazil I met a very
  charming endocrinologist, Ana Maria de Medeiros-Comaru (M.D.).
  Our friendship soon deepened into love and led to our
  marriage.<br>
  <br>
  I have had the satisfaction that my work in the hypothalamus was
  honored by top U.S., Canadian and Spanish awards: Van Meter Prize
  of the American Thyroid Association; Ayerst-Squibb Award of the
  U.S. Endocrine Society; William S. Middleton Award, the highest
  award of the VA; Charles Mickle Award of the University of
  Toronto; Gairdner Foundation International Award, Canada; Edward
  T. Tyler Award; Borden Award of the Association of American
  Medical Colleges; Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, and
  the Laude Award, Spain. In 1973 I was made a Senior Medical
  Investigator by the Veterans Administration, an honor reserved
  for only a few. When I learned about my Nobel Prize, I was too
  grateful and too moved to be overcome with joy, but that came a
  few hours later when my friends from all over the world began to
  phone or wire. However, I do not feel that these prizes will have
  an adverse effect on my future productivity. I am still as keen
  as ever to make new discoveries and useful contributions to
  endocrinology.</p>
