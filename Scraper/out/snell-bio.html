  <h1>George D. Snell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="snell.jpg" class="bio-img"> My parents
  were both New Englanders, though my father was born in Minnesota
  where his father had moved from Massachusetts to join a frontier
  community. My father moved east as a young man, and for a number
  of years was YMCA secretary in Haverhill, Massachusetts.
  Subsequently he invented and worked in the application of a
  device for winding induction coils used in ignitors for the
  motorboat engines of that day. I was born in Bradford,
  Massachusetts, a suburb of Haverhill, in December 1903, the
  youngest of three children. My parents moved when I was four to
  the home built by my great grandfather in Brookline,
  Massachusetts, and it was in the excellent Brookline public
  schools that I received my pre-college education.<br>
  <br>
  Science and mathematics were my favorite subjects. In spare time
  I read books on astronomy and physics as well as the usual
  boyhood classics. But I also enjoyed sports, and a group of five
  or six youngsters used to gather at our house to play touch
  football or scrub baseball in our yard or a neighboring vacant
  lot. Imaginative stories and games also were very much a part of
  my childhood.<br>
  <br>
  In 1900, three years before I was born, my mother's parents had
  purchased a run-down farmhouse and 70 acres of land in South
  Woodstock, Vermont. The house was gradually restored and
  furnished, and the summers I spent at "the farm" were among the
  delights of my childhood and youth. An interest in gardening,
  farming, and forestry have been a permanent legacy of the
  experience this home provided.<br>
  <br>
  Music was a major interest of the whole family. My mother played
  the piano, and we did a great deal of family singing in which
  friends often joined. It has been a source of great pleasure that
  my wife is also a pianist.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Darmouth College in 1922 and again found science and
  mathematics my favorite subjects. A course in genetics taught by
  Professor John Gerould proved particularly fascinating, and it
  was that course that led me to the choice of a career. When the
  decision was finally made to enter graduate school, it was on
  Professor Gerould's advice that I enrolled as a graduate student
  with Harvard's Professor Castle, the first American biologist to
  look for Mendelian inheritance in mammals.<br>
  <br>
  My thesis work on linkage in mice largely determined my future
  work. Two years spent teaching and two years as a postdoctoral
  fellow under Herman Muller studying the genetic effect of x-rays
  on mice served to convince me that research was my real love. If
  it was to be research, mouse genetics was the clear choice and
  the Jackson
  Laboratory, founded in 1929 by Dr. Clarence Cook Little, one
  of Castle's earlier students, almost the inevitable selection as
  a place to work. The Laboratory was a small institution when I
  joined the staff of seven in 1935, but under the talented
  leadership of Dr. Little and his successor, Earl Green, it has
  grown into the world center for studies in mammalian genetics. I
  owe a great deal to it for providing the ideal home for my
  subsequent research.<br>
  <br>
  It was in Bar Harbor that I met and married Rhoda Carson, and
  where we raised our three sons, Thomas, Roy and Peter.<br>
  <br>
  I have always enjoyed sports, with skiing, which I learned at
  Dartmouth, and tennis perhaps being my two favorites.<br>
  <br>
  While for 25 years I concentrated almost exclusively on studies
  of histocompatibility genes and especially of the <i>H-2</i>
  complex, and for 35 years have pursued these subjects to some
  degree, I also have become involved in other areas. While working
  under Dr. Castle, I spent parts of two summers at Woods Hole with
  Dr. Phineas Whiting, an earlier student of Castle, studying the
  genetics of the parasitic wasp, <i>Habrobracon</i>. An outcome of
  this work was a paper on The Role of Male Parthenogenesis in the
  Evolution of the Social Hymenoptera. The problems of social
  evolution have remained a continuing interest, to which I am now
  returning in a more active way in retirement. The two years with
  Muller at the University of Texas resulted in the first
  demonstration of the induction by x-rays of chromosomal changes
  in mammals. My first several years at the Jackson Laboratory were
  spent in continuation of this work, and especially in the
  detailed genetic analysis of two of the induced reciprocal
  translocations. In the late 1930s, I became involved in problems
  of gene nomenclature in mice, and this, together with problems of
  strain nomenclature, remained a concern for many years. The
  efforts of the Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for mice
  have led to the universal acceptance of a well organized and
  convenient nomenclature system for this species. Some
  experiments, which I carried out at about the same time that I
  was becoming interested in histocompatibility genetics, led to
  the discovery of immunological enhancement, the curious inversion
  of the expected growth inhibition seen with certain tumors when
  transplanted to pre-injected mice. I soon found that I was not
  the first person to have seen this phenomenon, but the mouse
  system proved very amenable to further exploitation. I had to
  drop this topic in favor of the genetic studies, but it has been
  interesting to see it grow through the work of Dr. Nathan Kaliss
  and many others into a major area of research with possible
  implications for organ transplantation in man. A final interest,
  developed jointly with Dr. Marianna Cherry during my last few
  years at the Jackson Laboratory, concerned serologically
  demonstrable alloantigens of lymphocytes.<br>
  <br>
  Much of the work sketched above was carried out on a
  collaborative basis. I cannot here give names, but I owe a great
  debt to the many wonderful people with whom it has been my
  privilege to work in these studies.</p>
