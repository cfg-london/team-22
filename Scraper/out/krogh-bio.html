  <h1>August Krogh - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="krogh.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Schack
  August Steenberg Krogh</b> was born at Grenaa, Jutland, Denmark,
  on November 15, 1874. He was the son of Viggo Krogh, shipbuilder,
  and Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drechmann. Even as a schoolboy August
  was much interested in the natural sciences and spent a great
  deal of his time in experimentation. He was greatly stimulated by
  his teacher and friend William S&ouml;rensen, D. Sc., who
  especially advised him to take interest in physiology. After
  having entered the University of Copenhagen in 1893 he started to study
  medicine but soon devoted himself to zoology. In 1897 he began to
  work in the Laboratory of Medical Physiology under the famous
  Professor Christian Bohr. When he had passed his examination in
  zoology, he became Bohr's assistant. In 1908 an Associate
  Professorship in Zoophysiology was created for Krogh at the
  University of Copenhagen, and eight years later this was changed
  to an ordinary chair, which Krogh held till 1945, when he
  retired. His work went on, however, in the private laboratory at
  Gjentofte, erected for him with the aid of the Carlsberg and the
  Scandinavian Insulin Foundations.<br>
  <br>
  Krogh's scientific work embraces a number of different fields. As
  a young student he started (1896) in his private room some
  experiments on the hydrostatic mechanism of the Corethra larva,
  the results of which were not published, however, until 1911. In
  this connection he worked out methods for microscopical analyses
  of the gas contained in the air bladders of the larvae and was
  able to prove that these organs functioned like the diving tanks
  of a submarine, their content being regulated until equilibrium
  with the surrounding water was restored. In 1902 Krogh took part
  in an expedition to Disko, North Greenland, where he studied the
  CO<sub>2</sub> tension and the oxygen content in the water of
  springs, streams and the sea. This led to important results about
  the role of the oceans in the regulation of the CO<sub>2</sub> of
  the atmosphere and also set out the principles of tonometric
  measurement of dissolved gases which he later applied to
  physiological problems (1904).<br>
  <br>
  As Bohr's assistant Krogh became interested in problems connected
  with the gas exchange of the living organism. At the age of 32
  years (1906) he won the Seegen prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences for a paper on the
  expiration of free nitrogen from the body. Very careful
  experiments with chrysalides, eggs and mice showed an extremely
  slight production of gaseous nitrogen which might be accounted
  for as being due to excretion of ammonia or, in the case of eggs,
  as the setting free of physically dissolved nitrogen from the
  body.<br>
  <br>
  Krogh's dissertation (1903) contained a study of the gas exchange
  in the frog. He found that, whereas the skin respiration was
  relatively constant, great variations occurred with regard to
  lung respiration. This part of the gas exchange was influenced
  from the vagi. Krogh interpreted this result as another example
  of the oxygen secretion that had been assumed by Bohr to take
  place in the lungs. However, he soon began to doubt the
  correctness of this conclusion - the observations might be
  explained by a vasomotor action of the vagi - as well as the
  whole doctrine of gas secretion in the lungs. Partly in
  collaboration with his wife, Dr. Marie Krogh, he subjected the
  whole question of the nature of the gas exchange in the lungs to
  a new examination. For this purpose he constructed his well-known
  microtonometer, where the tension equalization with blood takes
  place against an air bubble of about 0.01 ml. The relative
  surface therefore being very great, equilibrium is quickly
  obtained, and, by the micromethods for gas analysis developed by
  Krogh, the final composition of the air bubble could easily be
  ascertained. The gas tension of the circulating arterial blood
  was thus determined and compared to that in the lung alveoli as
  obtained at the end of expiration. It turned out that the oxygen
  tension was always higher in the alveolar air than in the
  arterial blood, so that diffusion alone was sufficient to explain
  the gas exchange (1910). These fundamental experiments were thus
  opposed to the views of Bohr and of J. S. Haldane, but they were
  later confirmed and extended by J. Barcroft in Cambridge and
  others and are now generally accepted.<br>
  <br>
  The results obtained shed new light on the whole complex of
  mechanisms that enable the organism to answer the varying
  &laquo;call for oxygen&raquo;. A number of classical problems such
  as the binding of gases in the blood, their transport by the
  blood flow and the exchange of oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> in the
  tissues attracted Krogh's attention, and to all of these he has
  made important contributions.<br>
  <br>
  In collaboration with Bohr and K. A. Hasselbalch the influence of
  the CO<sub>2</sub> tension on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation
  curve of the blood was demonstrated. This investigation, which is
  of fundamental importance for the modern conception of the
  chemical combinations of the respiratory gases in the blood, was
  made possible by the technique developed by Krogh. It became
  extended by J. Christiansen, C. G. Douglas and J. S. Haldane's
  finding that the oxygen tension also influences the
  CO<sub>2</sub> curve of the blood (1914).<br>
  <br>
  Together with J. Lindhard, Krogh, adopted an idea that had been
  introduced by A. Bornstein and developed their nitrous oxide
  method for the determination of the general blood flow, which has
  been of great importance for the further development in this
  field. A considerable increase occurred during muscular work.
  This was attributed to variations in the filling of the heart
  during diastole. The supply of venous blood must therefore be
  variable within wide limits and must during rest almost always be
  inadequate to fill the ventricles. This conclusion was
  strengthened by Krogh in an analysis of the underlying mechanism
  1912), which also led to the conclusion that the portal system
  acts as a general regulator of the pressure in the central veins
  and thereby on the output of the heart. Another important result
  of the determinations of the blood flow was the demonstration of
  an increased utilization of the oxygen of the blood during
  muscular work. Since the oxygen pressure of the resting muscles
  was, as found by several authors, rather low, the higher
  utilization must be explained by an increase in the diffusion
  surface. Krogh came to this conclusion after he had made
  experiments on the diffusion capacity of animal tissues, and
  these considerations were the reason for his famous studies of
  the capillaries during rest and work. As is well known, he thus
  arrived at the conclusion that during muscular work new
  capillaries which have been closed, are opened, thus enlarging
  the surface from which the oxygen can diffuse. These
  investigations resulted in the Nobel Prize in 1920. They were
  greatly extended by Krogh in the following years, as shown in his
  book <i>The Anatomy and Physiology of the Capillaries</i> (1922)
  and several further publications. Other comprehensive
  investigations on heavy muscular work were performed under the
  auspices of the League of Nations by Krogh and his school (1934),
  when a number of important problems were dealt with, such as heat
  regulation, respiratory metabolism, influence of diet on the
  capacity for work, blood sugar, lactic acid, training and
  fatigue, kidney function.<br>
  <br>
  In insects, as well as in vertebrates under standard conditions,
  Krogh demonstrated a regular and constant influence on metabolism
  of the surrounding temperature which could be expressed by
  Arrhenius' formula. He also investigated the effect of certain
  factors on the development in different animals. His rich
  experience with regard to metabolism Krogh summarized in the
  valuable monograph <i>The Respiratory Exchange in Animals and
  Man</i> (1916). Later on (1920) with several collaborators he
  made another important contribution to this series of problems by
  establishing the fact that when fat is catabolized for muscular
  work a loss of 11 % of the heat of combustion takes place, owing
  to the waste when fats are converted to carbohydrates.<br>
  <br>
  The work on the gas exchange during respiration was not confined
  to vertebrates; Krogh also took up the analogous question of the
  mode of function of the tracheal system of insects. Analyses of
  the air from the tracheal tubes of the common grasshopper showed
  comparatively low oxygen values while the CO<sub>2</sub> output
  was relatively small - probably it is given out directly through
  the body surface to a great extent, whereas oxygen is taken up
  only through the walls of the tracheae. A mechanical ventilation
  of the tracheae is made difficult by their structure - in many
  cases no respiratory movements occur - but experiments by Krogh
  (1920) showed that gas diffusion alone is sufficient to explain
  the oxygen uptake. In the course of his last unpublished studies
  on locusts Krogh found that during flight, when there is an
  enormously increased oxygen uptake in the wing muscles, a special
  arrangement enables a mechanical ventilation of their tracheae to
  occur. In his book <i>The Comparative Physiology of Respiratory
  Mechanisms</i> (1940) Krogh has given a fascinating and lucid
  description of many different ways in which the demand for oxygen
  is met in the animal kingdom.<br>
  <br>
  For several years Krogh and his school have been studying the
  exchange of water and inorganic ions through the surface of
  living cells and membranes, partly with the aid of isotopes as
  indicators. The many facts observed in this work have been
  reviewed by Krogh in his monograph <i>Osmotic Regulations in
  Aquatic Animals</i> (1937) and in a Croonian lecture
  (1946).<br>
  <br>
  Mention should also be made of his numerous additions to
  physiological techniques. His recording spirometer is used in
  many hospitals, his bicycle ergometer is an appreciated working
  machine, his precision pipettes, respiration apparatus, improved
  methods for gas analysis and many other inventions bear witness
  to his constructive skill.<br>
  <br>
  This brief survey is far from complete and is only intended to
  cover the main lines of Krogh's scientific activity. It
  illustrates not only his broad interests and unusual ability to
  take up fundamental problems and derive essential results
  everywhere. By his own work he has emphasized the quantitative
  aspect in physiological research, through his numerous pupils he
  has promoted such ideas into different fields of medicine.<br>

  Krogh was given Honorary Doctorates by the Universities of
  Edinburgh,
  Budapest, Lund,
  Harvard,
  G&ouml;ttingen, Oslo, and Oxford. He was made a member of the
  Academy of Sciences, Denmark (1916) and became foreign member of
  many other academies and learned societies, among them The Royal
  Society, London (1937). The same year, he was awarded the
  Baly medal of the Royal College of Physicians, London.<br>
  <br>
  In 1905, Krogh married Birte Marie J&ouml;rgensen, a medical
  student, who obtained her M. D. degree on an important paper,
  entitled <i>Luftdiffusionen gennem Menneskets Lunger</i>, 1914
  (The Diffusion of Gases through the Lungs of Man, <i>J.
  Physiol</i>., 1915) in a field where she had been engaged with
  her husband. She died in 1943. There were four children, one son
  who became Prosector of Anatomy at the University of Aarhus - a
  post he held until his untimely death - and three daughters. The
  youngest of them is a well-known physiologist in U.S.A., having
  above all performed important researches in zoophysiology, mainly
  in collaboration with her former husband, K. Schmidt-Nielsen.</p>
