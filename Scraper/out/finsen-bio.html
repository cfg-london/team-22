  <h1>Niels Ryberg Finsen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="finsen.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Niels
  Ryberg Finsen</b> was born on December 15, 1860, at Thorshavn in
  the Faroe Islands. His father, Hannes Steingrim Finsen, belonged
  to an Icelandic family with traditions reaching back to the 10th
  century, and occupied prominent (from 1871 the highest) positions
  in the administration of the Faroe Islands. The mother, Johanne
  Fr&ouml;man, was also born on Iceland. The boy received his early
  education in schools at Thorshavn and then at Herlufsholm in
  Denmark. Here the Rector declared that &laquo;Niels was a very
  nice boy, but his gifts were small and he was quite devoid of
  energy&raquo;. This may have been due to fagging for older pupils,
  for when the boy was moved to a school at Reykjavik, Iceland, in
  1876, he succeeded much better in spite of the fact that he did
  not initially know the language.</p>

  <p>In 1882 Finsen went to Copenhagen to study
  medicine, taking his final examination in 1890. The same year he
  also became prosector of anatomy at the University of Copenhagen,
  a post he left in 1893 in order to be able to devote more time to
  his scientific work. He still went on with private tutoring of
  medical students, thus gaining a very moderate income for his
  living.</p>

  <p>Already from 1883 and probably several
  years earlier he suffered from an illness which turned out to be
  Pick's disease and is characterized by progressive thickening of
  the connective tissue of certain membranes in the liver, the
  heart and the spleen. This results in impairment of the functions
  of these organs. As time went on, symptoms of heart trouble
  developed in addition to the general weakness and ascites, so
  that Finsen became more and more of an invalid. His last years
  had to be spent in a wheel-chair and his ascites had to be tapped
  no less than 18 times - often as much as 6 litres of fluid were
  withdrawn. That he in spite of this was able to make his
  remarkable contributions to medicine tells of a strong will and
  great energy.</p>

  <p>He has himself given the following short
  description of his work.<br>
  <br>
  &laquo;My disease has played a very great role for my whole
  development... The disease was responsible for my starting
  investigations on light: I suffered from anaemia and tiredness,
  and since I lived in a house facing the north, I began to believe
  that I might be helped if I received more sun. I therefore spent
  as much time as possible in its rays. As an enthusiastic medical
  man I was of course interested to know <i>what benefit</i> the
  sun really gave. I considered it from the physiological point of
  view but got no answer. I drew the conclusion that I was right
  and the physiology wrong. From this time (about 1888) I collected
  all possible observations about animals seeking the sun, and my
  conviction that the sun had a useful and important effect on the
  organism (especially the blood?) became stronger and stronger.
  What this useful effect really was, I could not find; I have been
  working for this goal ever since but have not been able to find
  exactly what I have been seeking, though we have gone somewhat
  forward.</p>

  <p>My intention was even then (about 15 years
  ago) to use the beneficial effects of the sun in the form of sun
  bathing or artificial light baths; but I understood that it would
  be inappropriate to bring it into practical use if the theory was
  not built upon scientific investigations and definite facts.</p>

  <p>During my work towards this goal I
  encountered several effects of light. I then devised the
  treatment of small-pox in red light (1893) and further the
  treatment of lupus (1895). Both these things are therefore in a
  sense side-issues, but they completely occupied my time for
  several years and have partly drawn me away from my main
  goal.</p>

  <p>During the last few years, I have, however,
  become convinced that it does not help to wait until I find the
  answer I am looking for in the laboratory, but that it is
  justified to work <i>also</i> with clinical experiments. Thus
  both approaches can be carried out simultaneously in the effort
  to reach the final goal.&raquo;</p>

  <p>In beautiful but simple experiments Finsen
  demonstrated that the most refractive rays from the sun
  (&laquo;the chemical rays&raquo;) or from an electric arc may have
  a stimulating effect on the tissues. If the irradiation is too
  strong, however, it may give rise to tissue damage, but this may
  to some extent be prevented by pigmentation of the skin as in the
  negro or in those much exposed to the sun. In small-pox Finsen
  thought that the multiple scars might be avoided if the patient
  was protected from the chemical rays. The experiments with such
  patients were successful. On the other hand chemical rays free
  from heat rays might be used to obtain a useful effect either by
  concentration on particular area - and this led to the treatment
  of <i>lupus vulgaris</i> or other skin diseases - or employed as
  general sun-baths, which on Finsen's suggestion was tried in
  cases of tuberculosis. The results were promising but as a rule
  the northern climate was not well suited for such therapy. As is
  well known, this kind of treatment has been found to be excellent
  in places where the sun is rich in chemical rays, e.g. in the
  Alps where the absorption of these rays by the atmosphere is
  rather small. The treatment of surgical tuberculosis in this way
  by O. Bernhard and A. Rollier at high elevations in Switzerland
  has been specially successful.</p>

  <p>Finsen himself proved very convincingly
  that the concentrated chemical rays may exercise very beneficial
  effects in the disfiguring disease <i>lupus vulgaris</i>. This is
  due to a bactericidal as well as a general stimulating effect on
  the tissues. He has developed the technique by numerous practical
  methods, and the Finsen Institute was erected in Copenhagen as
  early as 1896, being enlarged some years later due to the
  generosity of two Danish donors, Mr. Hageman and Mr.
  J&ouml;rgensen, and the Danish Government. It has served as the
  model for numerous similar institutes in different parts of the
  world, and together they have greatly reduced the number of cases
  of lupus.</p>

  <p>Finsen's work contained a definite and
  important recent discovery and was therefore well qualified for a
  Nobel Prize. Moreover he was still a young man. Of course it was
  known that his health was not good, but it was obviously thought
  that the Prize might be of considerable importance. This was soon
  found to be the case. When Finsen, on October 17, 1903, received
  the letter with the announcement of the decision, his first words
  were: &laquo;Well, thus it has now been established that the thing
  is Danish&raquo;. When the usual Nobel festivities took place at
  Stockholm on December 10, 1903, he himself was sitting at his
  home in his wheel-chair receiving congratulations from his
  personnel and from numerous friends. He then made it known that
  he would donate 50,000 crowns of the Prize to the Institute and
  another 60,000 crowns to a sanatorium for heart and liver
  diseases which had also been founded by him. One immediate
  consequence was that each of his two main donors gave 50,000
  crowns to the Finsen Institute. Thus in spite of Finsen's failing
  health his ideas were spread still further and his creation - the
  Institute - was helped.</p>

  <p>Among the many publications by Finsen <i>Om
  Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden</i> (On the effects of light on
  the skin) appeared in 1893 and the classical treatise Om
  Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler (The
  use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine) in 1896.
  This and other papers were published in German in 1899, and <i>La
  Phototh&eacute;rapie</i> appeared in French the same year. The
  results of many of his researches are contained in the
  communications published by his Institute. Finsen tried to
  counteract the symptoms of his illness in various ways, and
  during his last years he kept to a diet poor in salt. This led to
  his last publication, a thorough study of <i>En Ophobning af Salt
  i Organismen</i> (An accumulation of salt in the organism) in
  1904.</p>

  <p>Finsen received the title of Professor in
  1898, and in 1899 he became Knight of the Order of Dannebrog, to
  which a few years later the Silver Cross was added. He was member
  or honorary member of numerous societies in Scandinavia, in
  Iceland, Russia, Germany etc. He received a Danish gold medal for
  merit, and in 1904 the Cameron Prize was given him from the
  University of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In 1892 Finsen married Ingeborg Balslev (b.
  1868), daughter of the bishop Balslev at Ribe. They had four
  children, of which the eldest boy died the day after he was born.
  The second son, Halldor (b. 1896 ) became a physician. One
  daughter, Gudrun (b. 1900) married Professor S. Lomholt, who was
  for many years head of the Department of Skin Diseases of the
  Finsen Institute and is the author of a charming biography of his
  father-in-law. The youngest daughter, Valgerda (b. 1903 ), also
  married.</p>

  <p>Dr. Finsen died on September 24, 1904.</p>
