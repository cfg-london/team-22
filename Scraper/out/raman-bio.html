  <h1>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="raman.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman</b> was
  born at Tiruchirappalli in Southern India on November 7th, 1888. His
  father was a lecturer in mathematics and physics so that from the
  first he was immersed in an academic atmosphere. He entered
  Presidency College, Madras, in 1902, and in 1904 passed his B.A.
  examination, winning the first place and the gold medal in
  physics; in 1907 he gained his M.A. degree, obtaining the highest
  distinctions.<br>
  <br>
  His earliest researches in optics and acoustics - the two fields
  of investigation to which he has dedicated his entire career -
  were carried out while he was a student.<br>
  <br>
  Since at that time a scientific career did not appear to present
  the best possibilities, Raman joined the Indian Finance
  Department in 1907; though the duties of his office took most of
  his time, Raman found opportunities for carrying on experimental
  research in the laboratory of the Indian Association for the
  Cultivation of Science at Calcutta (of which he became Honorary
  Secretary in 1919).<br>
  <br>
  In 1917 he was offered the newly endowed Palit Chair of Physics
  at Calcutta University, and decided to accept it. After 15 years
  at Calcutta he became Professor at the Indian Institute of
  Science at Bangalore (1933-1948), and since 1948 he is Director
  of the Raman Institute of Research at Bangalore, established and
  endowed by himself. He also founded the <i>Indian Journal of
  Physics</i> in 1926, of which he is the Editor. Raman sponsored
  the establishment of the Indian Academy of Sciences and has
  served as President since its inception. He also initiated the
  <i>Proceedings</i> of that academy, in which much of his work has
  been published, and is President of the Current Science
  Association, Bangalore, which publishes <i>Current Science
  (India)</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Some of Raman's early memoirs appeared as Bulletins of the
  <i>Indian Associationfor the Cultivation of Science</i> (Bull. 6
  and 11, dealing with the "Maintenance of Vibrations"; Bull. 15,
  1918, dealing with the theory of the musical instruments of the
  violin family). He contributed an article on the theory of
  musical instruments to the 8th Volume of the <i>Handbuch der
  Physik</i>, 1928. In 1922 he published his work on the "Molecular
  Diffraction of Light", the first of a series of investigations
  with his collaborators which ultimately led to his discovery, on
  the 28th of February, 1928, of the radiation effect which bears
  his name ("A new radiation", <i>Indian J. Phys.</i>, 2 (1928)
  387), and which gained him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics.<br>
  <br>
  Other investigations carried out by Raman were: his experimental
  and theoretical studies on the diffraction of light by acoustic
  waves of ultrasonic and hypersonic frequencies (published
  1934-1942), and those on the effects produced by X-rays on
  infrared vibrations in crystals exposed to ordinary light. In
  1948 Raman, through studying the spectroscopic behaviour of
  crystals, approached in a new manner fundamental problems of
  crystal dynamics. His laboratory has been dealing with the
  structure and properties of diamond, the structure and optical
  behaviour of numerous iridescent substances (labradorite, pearly
  felspar, agate, opal, and pearls).<br>
  <br>
  Among his other interests have been the optics of colloids,
  electrical and magnetic anisotropy, and the physiology of human
  vision.<br>
  <br>
  Raman has been honoured with a large number of honorary
  doctorates and memberships of scientific societies. He was
  elected a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career (1924),
  and was knighted in 1929.</p>
