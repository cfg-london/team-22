  <h1>Steven Chu - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chu.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Ju Chin
  Chu, came to the United States in 1943 to continue his education
  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical
  engineering, and two years later, my mother, Ching Chen Li,
  joined him to study economics. A generation earlier, my mother's
  father earned his advanced degrees in civil engineering at
  Cornell
  while his brother studied physics under Perrin at the Sorbonne
  before they returned to China. However, when my parents married
  in 1945, China was in turmoil and the possibility of returning
  grew increasingly remote, and they decided to begin their family
  in the United States. My brothers and I were born as part of a
  typical nomadic academic career: my older brother was born in
  1946 while my father was finishing at MIT, I was born in St.
  Louis in 1948 while my father taught at Washington
  University, and my younger brother completed the family in
  Queens shortly after my father took a position as a professor at
  the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950, we settled in Garden City, New York, a bedroom community
  within commuting distance of Brooklyn Polytechnic. There were
  only two other Chinese families in this town of 25,000, but to
  our parents, the determining factor was the quality of the public
  school system. Education in my family was not merely emphasized,
  it was our raison d'&ecirc;tre. Virtually all of our aunts and
  uncles had Ph.D.'s in science or engineering, and it was taken
  for granted that the next generation of Chu's were to follow the
  family tradition. When the dust had settled, my two brothers and
  four cousins collected three MDs, four Ph.D.s and a law degree. I
  could manage only a single advanced degree.<br>
  <br>
  In this family of accomplished scholars, I was to become the
  academic black sheep. I performed adequately at school, but in
  comparison to my older brother, who set the record for the
  highest cumulative average for our high school, my performance
  was decidedly mediocre. I studied, but not in a particularly
  efficient manner. Occasionally, I would focus on a particular
  school project and become obsessed with, what seemed to my
  mother, to be trivial details instead of apportioning the time I
  spent on school work in a more efficient way.<br>
  <br>
  I approached the bulk of my schoolwork as a chore rather than an
  intellectual adventure. The tedium was relieved by a few courses
  that seem to be qualitatively different. Geometry was the first
  exciting course I remember. Instead of memorizing facts, we were
  asked to think in clear, logical steps. Beginning from a few
  intuitive postulates, far reaching consequences could be derived,
  and I took immediately to the sport of proving theorems. I also
  fondly remember several of my English courses where the assigned
  reading often led to binges where I read many books by the same
  author.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the importance of education in our family, my life was
  not completely centered around school work or recreational
  reading. In the summer after kindergarten, a friend introduced me
  to the joys of building plastic model airplanes and warships. By
  the fourth grade, I graduated to an erector set and spent many
  happy hours constructing devices of unknown purpose where the
  main design criterion was to maximize the number of moving parts
  and overall size. The living room rug was frequently littered
  with hundreds of metal "girders" and tiny nuts and bolts
  surrounding half-finished structures. An understanding mother
  allowed me to keep the projects going for days on end. As I grew
  older, my interests expanded to playing with chemistry: a friend
  and I experimented with homemade rockets, in part funded by money
  my parents gave me for lunch at school. One summer, we turned our
  hobby into a business as we tested our neighbors' soil for
  acidity and missing nutrients.<br>
  <br>
  I also developed an interest in sports, and played in informal
  games at a nearby school yard where the neighborhood children met
  to play touch football, baseball, basketball and occasionally,
  ice hockey. In the eighth grade, I taught myself tennis by
  reading a book, and in the following year, I joined the school
  team as a "second string" substitute, a position I held for the
  next three years. I also taught myself how to pole vault using
  bamboo poles obtained from the local carpet store. I was soon
  able to clear 8 feet, but was not good enough to make the track
  team.<br>
  <br>
  In my senior year, I took advanced placement physics and
  calculus. These two courses were taught with the same spirit as
  my earlier geometry course. Instead of a long list of formulas to
  memorize, we were presented with a few basic ideas or a set of
  very natural assumptions. I was also blessed by two talented and
  dedicated teachers.<br>
  <br>
  My physics teacher, Thomas Miner was particularly gifted. To this
  day, I remember how he introduced the subject of physics. He told
  us we were going to learn how to deal with very simple questions
  such as how a body falls due to the acceleration of gravity.
  Through a combination of conjecture and observations, ideas could
  be cast into a theory that can be tested by experiments. The
  small set of questions that physics could address might seem
  trivial compared to humanistic concerns. Despite the modest goals
  of physics, knowledge gained in this way would become collected
  wisdom through the ultimate arbitrator - experiment.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to an incredibly clear and precise introduction to
  the subject, Mr. Miner also encouraged ambitious laboratory
  projects. For the better part of my last semester at Garden City
  High, I constructed a physical pendulum and used it to make a
  "precision" measurement of gravity. The years of experience
  building things taught me skills that were directly applicable to
  the construction of the pendulum. Ironically, twenty five years
  later, I was to develop a refined version of this measurement
  using laser cooled atoms in an atomic fountain
  interferometer.<br>
  <br>
  I applied to a number of colleges in the fall of my senior year,
  but because of my relatively lackluster A-average in high school,
  I was rejected by the Ivy League schools, but was accepted at
  Rochester. By comparison, my older brother was
  attending Princeton, two cousins were in Harvard and a third
  was at Bryn Mawr. My
  younger brother seemed to have escaped the family pressure to
  excel in school by going to college without earning a high school
  diploma and by avoiding a career in science. (He nevertheless got
  a Ph.D. at the age of 21 followed by a law degree from Harvard
  and is now a managing partner of a major law firm.) As I prepared
  to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous
  student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family.</p>

  <p><b>The Rochester and Berkeley
  Years</b><br>
  At Rochester, I came with the same emotions as many of the
  entering freshman: everything was new, exciting and a bit
  overwhelming, but at least nobody had heard of my brothers and
  cousins. I enrolled in a two-year, introductory physics sequence
  that used <i>The Feynman Lectures in Physics</i> as the textbook.
  The <i>Lectures</i> were mesmerizing and inspirational. <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">Feynman</a> made physics seem so beautiful
  and his love of the subject is shown through each page. Learning
  to do the problem sets was another matter, and it was only years
  later that I began to appreciate what a magician he was at
  getting answers.<br>
  <br>
  In my sophomore year, I became increasingly interested in
  mathematics and declared a major in both mathematics and physics.
  My math professors were particularly good, especially relative to
  the physics instructor I had that year. If it were not for the
  Feynman Lectures, I would have almost assuredly left physics. The
  pull towards mathematics was partly social: as a lowly
  undergraduate student, several math professors adopted me and I
  was invited to several faculty parties.<br>
  <br>
  The obvious compromise between mathematics and physics was to
  become a theoretical physicist. My heroes were Newton, Maxwell,
  <a href="../1921/index.html">Einstein</a>, up to the contemporary
  giants such as Feynman, <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Gell-Mann</a>, <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Yang</a> and <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Lee</a>. My courses did not stress the
  importance of the experimental contributions, and I was led to
  believe that the "smartest" students became theorists while the
  remainder were relegated to experimental grunts. Sadly, I had
  forgotten Mr. Miner's first important lesson in physics.<br>
  <br>
  Hoping to become a theoretical physicist, I applied to Berkeley, Stanford, Stony Brook (Yang was there!) and Princeton. I chose
  to go to Berkeley and entered in the fall of 1970. At that time,
  the number of available jobs in physics was shrinking and
  prospects were especially difficult for budding young theorists.
  I recall the faculty admonishing us about the perils of
  theoretical physics: unless we were going to be as good as
  Feynman, we would be better off in experimental physics. To the
  best of my knowledge, this warning had no effect on either me or
  my fellow students.<br>
  <br>
  After I passed the qualifying exam, I was recruited by Eugene
  Commins. I admired his breadth of knowledge and his teaching
  ability but did not yet learn of his uncanny ability to bring out
  the best in all of his students. He was ending a series of beta
  decay experiments and was casting around for a new direction of
  research. He was getting interested in astrophysics at the time
  and asked me to think about proto-star formation of a closely
  coupled binary pair. I had spent the summer between Rochester and
  Berkeley at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory trying to
  determine the deceleration of the universe with high red-shift
  radio source galaxies and was drawn to astrophysics. However, in
  the next two months, I avoided working on the theoretical problem
  he gave me and instead played in the lab.<br>
  <br>
  One of my "play-experiments" was motivated by my interest in
  classical music. I noticed that one could hear out-of-tune notes
  played in a very fast run by a violinist. A simple estimate
  suggested that the frequency accuracy, <sub><img src=
  "chu-autobiofig1.gif" alt="delta v"></sub>times the duration of the
  note,<sub><img src="chu-autobiofig2.gif" width="22" height="17"
  alt="delta t"></sub>did not satisfy the uncertainty
  relationship<sub><img src="chu-autobiofig3.gif" width="45"
  height="17" alt="delta v delta t is bigger or equal to 1"></sub>. In order to test the frequency
  sensitivity of the ear, I connected an audio oscillator to a
  linear gate so that a tone burst of varying duration could be
  produced. I then asked my fellow graduate students to match the
  frequency of an arbitrarily chosen tone by adjusting the knob of
  another audio oscillator until the notes sounded the same.
  Students with the best musical ears could identify the center
  frequency of a tone burst that eventually sounded like a "click"
  with an accuracy of <sub><img src="chu-autobiofig4.gif" alt=
  "delta v delta t is approximately 0.1"></sub>.<br>
  <br>
  By this time it was becoming obvious (even to me) that I would be
  much happier as an experimentalist and I told my advisor. He
  agreed and started me on a beta-decay experiment looking for
  "second-class currents", but after a year of building, we
  abandoned it to measure the Lamb shift in high-Z hydrogen-like
  ions. In 1974, Claude and Marie Bouchiat published their proposal
  to look for parity non-conserving effects in atomic transitions.
  The unified theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions
  suggested by <a href="../1979/index.html">Weinberg, Salam</a> and
  <a href="../1979/index.html">Glashow</a> postulated a neutral
  mediator of the weak force in addition to the known charged
  forces. Such an interaction would manifest itself as a very
  slight asymmetry in the absorption of left and right circularly
  polarized light in a magnetic dipole transition. Gene was always
  drawn to work that probed the most fundamental aspects of
  physics, and we were excited by the prospect that a table-top
  experiment could say something decisive about high energy
  physics. The experiment needed a state-of-the-art laser and my
  advisor knew nothing about lasers. I brashly told him not to
  worry; I would build it and we would be up and running in no
  time.<br>
  <br>
  This work was tremendously exciting and the world was definitely
  watching us. Steven Weinberg would call my advisor every few
  months, hoping to hear news of a parity violating effect. Dave
  Jackson, a high energy theorist, and I would sometimes meet at
  the university swimming pool. During several of these encounters,
  he squinted at me and tersely asked, "Got a number yet?" The
  unspoken message was, "How dare you swim when there is important
  work to be done!"<br>
  <br>
  Midway into the experiment, I told my advisor that I had suffered
  enough as a graduate student so he elevated me to post-doc
  status. Two years later, we and three graduate students published
  our first results. Unfortunately, we were scooped: a few months
  earlier, a beautiful high energy experiment at the Stanford Linear
  Collider had seen convincing evidence of neutral weak
  interactions between electrons and quarks. Nevertheless, I was
  offered a job as assistant professor at Berkeley in the spring of
  1978.<br>
  <br>
  I had spent all of my graduate and postdoctoral days at Berkeley
  and the faculty was concerned about inbreeding. As a solution,
  they hired me but also would permit me to take an immediate leave
  of absence before starting my own group at Berkeley. I loved
  Berkeley, but realized that I had a narrow view of science and
  saw this as a wonderful opportunity to broaden myself.</p>

  <p><b>A Random Walk in Science at Bell
  Labs</b><br>
  I joined Bell
  Laboratories in the fall of 1978. I was one of roughly two
  dozen brash, young scientists that were hired within a two year
  period. We felt like the "Chosen Ones", with no obligation to do
  anything except the research we loved best. The joy and
  excitement of doing science permeated the halls. The cramped labs
  and office cubicles forced us to interact with each other and
  follow each others' progress. The animated discussions were
  common during and after seminars and at lunch and continued on
  the tennis courts and at parties. The atmosphere was too electric
  to abandon, and I never returned to Berkeley. To this day I feel
  guilty about it, but I think that the faculty understood my
  decision and have forgiven me.<br>
  <br>
  Bell Labs management supplied us with funding, shielded us from
  extraneous bureaucracy, and urged us not to be satisfied with
  doing merely "good science." My department head, Peter
  Eisenberger, told me to spend my first six months in the library
  and talk to people before deciding what to do. A year later
  during a performance review, he chided me not to be content with
  anything less than "starting a new field". I responded that I
  would be more than happy to do that, but needed a hint as to
  <i>what</i> new field he had in mind.<br>
  <br>
  I spent the first year at Bell writing a paper reviewing the
  current status of x-ray microscopy and started an experiment on
  energy transfer in ruby with Hyatt Gibbs and Sam McCall. I also
  began planning the experiment on the optical spectroscopy of
  positronium. Positronium, an atom made up of an electron and its
  anti-particle, was considered the most basic of all atoms, and a
  precise measurement of its energy levels was a long standing goal
  ever since the atom was discovered in 1950. The problem was that
  the atoms would annihilate into gamma rays after only
  140x10<sup>-9</sup> seconds, and it was impossible to produce
  enough of them at any given time. When I started the experiment,
  there were 12 published attempts to observe the optical
  fluorescence of the atom. People only publish failures if they
  have spent enough time and money so their funding agencies demand
  something in return.<br>
  <br>
  My management thought I was ruining my career by trying an
  impossible experiment. After two years of no results, they
  strongly suggested that I abandon my quest. But I was stubborn
  and I had a secret weapon: his name is Allen Mills. Our strengths
  complemented each other beautifully, but in the end, he helped me
  solve the laser and metrology problems while I helped him with
  his positrons. We finally managed to observe a signal working
  with only ~4 atoms per laser pulse! Two years later and with 20
  atoms per pulse, we refined our methods and obtained one of the
  most accurate measurements of quantum electrodynamic corrections
  to an atomic system.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1983, I became head of the Quantum Electronics
  Research Department and moved to another branch of Bell Labs at
  Holmdel, New Jersey. By then my research interests had broadened,
  and I was using picosecond laser techniques to look at excitons
  as a potential system for observing metal-insulator transitions
  and Anderson localization. With this apparatus, I accidentally
  discovered a counter-intuitive pulse-propagation effect. I was
  also planning to enter surface science by constructing a novel
  electron spectrometer based on threshold ionization of atoms that
  could potentially increase the energy resolution by more than an
  order of magnitude.<br>
  <br>
  While designing the electron spectrometer, I began talking
  informally with Art Ashkin, a colleague at Holmdel. Art had a
  dream to trap atoms with light, but the management stopped the
  work four years ago. An important experiment had demonstrated the
  dipole force, but the experimenters had reached an impasse. Over
  the next few months, I began to realize the way to hold onto
  atoms with light was to first get them very cold. Laser cooling
  was going to make possible all of Art Ashkin's dreams plus a lot
  more. I promptly dropped most of my other experiments and with
  Leo Holberg, my new post-doc, and my technician, Alex Cable,
  began our laser cooling experiment. This brings me to the
  beginning of our work in laser cooling and trapping of atoms and
  the subject of my Nobel Lecture.</p>

  <p><b>Stanford and the future</b><br>
  Life at Bell Labs, like Mary Poppins, was "practically perfect in
  every way". However, in 1987, I decided to leave my cozy ivory
  tower. Ted H&auml;nsch had left Stanford to become co-director of
  the Max
  Planck Institute for Quantum Optics and I was recruited to
  replace him. Within a few months, I also received offers from
  Berkeley and Harvard, and I thought the offers were as good as
  they were ever going to be. My management at Bell Labs was
  successful in keeping me at Bell Labs for 9 years, but I wanted
  to be like my mentor, Gene Commins, and the urge to spawn
  scientific progeny was growing stronger.<br>
  <br>
  Ted Geballe, a distinguished colleague of mine at Stanford who
  also went from Berkeley to Bell to Stanford years earlier,
  described our motives: "The best part of working at a university
  is the students. They come in fresh, enthusiastic, open to ideas,
  unscarred by the battles of life. They don't realize it, but
  they're the recipients of the best our society can offer. If a
  mind is ever free to be creative, that's the time. They come in
  believing textbooks are authoritative but eventually they figure
  out that textbooks and professors don't know everything, and then
  they start to think on their own. Then, I begin learning from
  them."<br>
  <br>
  My students at Stanford have been extraordinary, and I have
  learned much from them. Much of my most important work such as
  fleshing out the details of polarization gradient cooling, the
  demonstration of the atomic fountain clock, and the development
  of atom interferometers and a new method of laser cooling based
  on <a href="../1930/index.html">Raman</a> pulses was done at
  Stanford with my students as collaborators.<br>
  <br>
  While still continuing in laser cooling and trapping of atoms, I
  have recently ventured into polymer physics and biology. In 1986,
  Ashkin showed that the first optical atom trap demonstrated at
  Bell Labs also worked on tiny glass spheres embedded in water. A
  year after I came to Stanford, I set about to manipulate
  individual DNA molecules with the so-called "optical tweezers" by
  attaching micron-sized polystyrene spheres to the ends of the
  molecule. My idea was to use two optical tweezers introduced into
  an optical microscope to grab the plastic handles glued to the
  ends of the molecule. Steve Kron, an M.D./Ph.D. student in the
  medical school, introduced me to molecular biology in the
  evenings. By 1990, we could see an image of a single,
  fluorescently labeled DNA molecule in real time as we stretched
  it out in water. My students improved upon our first attempts
  after they discovered our initial protocol demanded luck as a
  major ingredient. Using our new ability to simultaneously
  visualize and manipulate individual molecules of DNA, my group
  began to answer polymer dynamics questions that have persisted
  for decades. Even more thrilling, we discovered something new in
  the last year: identical molecules in the same initial state will
  choose several distinct pathways to a new equilibrium state. This
  "molecular individualism" was never anticipated in previous
  polymer dynamics theories or simulations.<br>
  <br>
  I have been at Stanford for ten and a half years. The constant
  demands of my department and university and the ever increasing
  work needed to obtain funding have stolen much of my precious
  thinking time, and I sometimes yearn for the halcyon days of Bell
  Labs. Then, I think of the work my students and post-docs have
  done with me at Stanford and how we have grown together during
  this time.</p>
