  <h1>Hugo Theorell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="theorell.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Axel Hugo
  Theodor Theorell</b> was born at Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, on July
  6, 1903. He was the son of Thure Theorell, surgeon-major to the
  First Life Grenadiers practising medicine in Link&ouml;ping, and
  his wife Armida Bill.<br>
  <br>
  Theorell was educated for nine years at a State Secondary School
  in Link&ouml;ping and passed his matriculation examination there
  on May 23, 1921. In September, 1921, he began to study medicine
  at the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1955/theorell-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Karolinska
  Institute</a> and in 1924 he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine.
  He then spent three months studying bacteriology at the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris under Professor Calmette.<br>
  <br>
  In 1930 he obtained his M.D. degree with a thesis on the lipids
  of the blood plasma, and was appointed lecturer in physiological
  chemistry at the Karolinska Institute.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1924, however, Theorell had been on the Staff of the
  Medico-Chemical Institution, first as an associate assistant and
  during the years 1928-1929 as a temporary Associate Professor.
  Here, under Professor Einar Hammarsten, he carried out his first
  work on the influence of the lipids on the sedimentation of the
  blood corpuscles. In 1931 he studied in <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1926/index.html">Svedberg</a>'s institute
  at Uppsala
  University, the molecular weight of myoglobin with the aid of
  the ultracentrifuge.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932 he was appointed Associate Professor in Medical and
  Physiological Chemistry at Uppsala University, and here he
  continued and extended his work on myoglobin. From 1933 until
  1935 Theorell held a Rockefeller Fellowship and worked with
  <a href="../1931/index.html">Otto Warburg</a> at Berlin-Dahlem,
  and here he became interested in oxidation enzymes, a subject to
  which he has given his attention ever since. At Berlin-Dahlem he
  produced, for the first time, the oxidation enzyme called
  &laquo;the yellow ferment&raquo; and he succeeded in splitting it
  reversibly into a coenzyme part, which was found to be
  flavinmononucleotide, and a colourless protein part.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to Sweden in 1935, Theorell worked at the Karolinska
  Institute and in 1936 he was appointed Head of the newly
  established Biochemical Department of the Nobel Medical
  Institute, which was opened in 1937. For ten years this Institute
  was housed in the Karolinska Institute, but in 1947 it was able
  to occupy its own building.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1935, Theorell has, with Swedish and other collaborators,
  carried out researches on various oxidation enzymes, and he has
  contributed especially to our knowledge of cytochrome <i>c</i>,
  peroxidases, catalases, flavoproteins, and
  &laquo;pyridine&raquo;-proteins, particularly the alcohol
  dehydrogenases. For his work on the nature and effects of
  oxidation enzymes he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology
  or Medicine for 1955.<br>
  <br>
  Theorell is a member of learned societies in Sweden, Denmark,
  Norway, Finland, the U.S.A., France, Italy, Poland, Belgium and
  India. He was Chairman of the Swedish Medical Society in
  1947-1948 and 1957-1958, and served as Secretary of that Society
  during 1940-1946, he was a member of the Swedish Society for
  Medical Research during 1942-1950, the State Research Council for
  the Natural Sciences during 1950-1954, and the State Medical Research
  Council as from 1958.<br>
  <br>
  He was also Chairman of the Association of Swedish Chemists from
  1947-1949. Since 1954 he has been Chief Editor of the journal
  <i>Nordisk Medicin</i>. He has been a member of many Government
  Committees and is Chairman of the Swedish National Committee for
  Biochemistry, of the Board of the Wenner-Gren Society and of the
  Wenner-Gren Center Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  His interest in music is shown by the facts that he is also a
  Member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Music and Chairman of the
  Stockholm Symphony Society.<br>
  <br>
  Theorell holds honorary doctorates of the Universities of Paris,
  Pennsylvania,
  Louvain,
  Brussels and Rio de
  Janeiro, and is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of
  London, and the National Academy of Sciences of Washington.<br>
  <br>
  In 1931 he married Elin Margit Elisabeth Alenius. They had one
  daughter, Eva Kristina, who died in 1935, end three sons: Klas
  Thure Gabriel (b. 1935), Henning Hugo (b. 1939), and Per Gunnar
  T&ouml;res (b. 1942). Theorell now lives in Stockholm.</p>
