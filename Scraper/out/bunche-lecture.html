  <h2>Some Reflections on Peace in Our Time</h2>
  <p>In this most anxious period of human
  history, the subject of peace, above every other, commands the
  solemn attention of all men of reason and goodwill. Moreover, on
  this particular occasion, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the
  Nobel Foundation, it is eminently fitting to speak of peace. No
  subject could be closer to my own heart, since I have the honour
  to speak as a member of the international Secretariat of the
    <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United
  Nations</a>.</p>

  <p>In these critical times - times which test
  to the utmost the good sense, the forbearance, and the morality
  of every peace-loving people - it is not easy to speak of peace
  with either conviction or reassurance. True it is that statesmen
  the world over, exalting lofty concepts and noble ideals, pay
  homage to peace and freedom in a perpetual torrent of eloquent
  phrases. But the statesmen also speak darkly of the lurking
  threat of war; and the preparations for war ever intensify, while
  strife flares or threatens in many localities.</p>

  <p>The words used by statesmen in our day no
  longer have a common meaning. Perhaps they never had. Freedom,
  democracy, human rights, international morality, peace itself,
  mean different things to different men. Words, in a constant flow
  of propaganda - itself an instrument of war - are employed to
  confuse, mislead, and debase the common man. Democracy is
  prostituted to dignify enslavement; freedom and equality are held
  good for some men but withheld from others by and in allegedly
  "democratic" societies; in "free" societies, so-called,
  individual human rights are severely denied; aggressive
  adventures are launched under the guise of "liberation". Truth
  and morality are subverted by propaganda, on the cynical
  assumption that truth is whatever propaganda can induce people to
  believe. Truth and morality, therefore, become gravely weakened
  as defences against injustice and war. With what great insight
  did Voltaire, hating war enormously, declare: "War is the
  greatest of all crimes; and yet there is no aggressor who does
  not colour his crime with the pretext of justice."</p>

  <p>To the common man, the state of world
  affairs is baffling. All nations and peoples claim to be for
  peace. But never has peace been more continuously in jeopardy.
  There are no nations today, as in the recent past, insistently
  clamouring for <i>Lebensraum</i> under the duress of readiness to
  resort to war. Still the specter of war looms ominously. Never in
  human history have so many peoples experienced freedom. Yet human
  freedom itself is a crucial issue and is widely endangered.
  Indeed, by some peoples, it has already been gained and lost.</p>

  <p>Peoples everywhere wish and long for peace
  and freedom in their simplest and clearest connotations: an end
  to armed conflict and to the suppression of the inalienable
  rights of man. In a single generation, the peoples of the world
  have suffered the profound anguish of two catastrophic wars; they
  have had enough of war. Who could doubt that the people of Norway
  - ever peaceful, still deeply wounded from an unprovoked, savage
  Nazi aggression - wish peace? Who could doubt that all of the
  peoples of Europe - whose towns and cities, whose peaceful
  countrysides, have been mercilessly ravaged; whose fathers and
  sons, mothers and daughters, have been slaughtered and maimed in
  tragic numbers - wish peace? Who could sincerely doubt that the
  peoples of the Western hemisphere - who, in the common effort to
  save the world from barbaric tyranny, came into the two world
  wars only reluctantly and at great sacrifice of human and
  material resources - wish peace? Who could doubt that the
  long-suffering masses of Asia and Africa wish peace? Who indeed,
  could be so unseeing as not to realize that in modern war victory
  is illusory; that the harvest of war can be only misery,
  destruction, and degradation?</p>

  <p>If war should come, the peoples of the
  world would again be called upon to fight it, but they would not
  have willed it.</p>

  <p>Statesmen and philosophers repeatedly have
  warned that some values - freedom, honour, self- respect - are
  higher than peace or life itself. This may be true. Certainly,
  very many would hold that the loss of human dignity and
  self-respect, the chains of enslavement, are too high a price
  even for peace. But the horrible realities of modern warfare
  scarcely afford even this fatal choice. There is only suicidal
  escape, not freedom, in the death and destruction of atomic war.
  This is mankind's great dilemma. The well-being and the hopes of
  the peoples of the world can never be served until peace - as
  well as freedom, honour and self-respect - is secure.</p>

  <p>The ideals of peace on earth and the
  brotherhood of man have been expounded by philosophers from
  earliest times. If human relations were governed by the sagacity
  of the great philosophers, there would be little danger of war,
  for in their collective wisdom over the centuries they have
  clearly charted the course to free and peaceful living among
  men.</p>

  <p>Throughout the ages, however, man has but
  little heeded the advice of the wise men. He has been -
  fatefully, if not wilfully - less virtuous, less constant, less
  rational, less peaceful than he knows how to be, than he is fully
  capable of being. He has been led astray from the ways of peace
  and brotherhood by his addiction to concepts and attitudes of
  narrow nationalism, racial and religious bigotry, greed and lust
  for power. Despite this, despite the almost continuous state of
  war to which bad human relations have condemned him, he has made
  steady progress. In his scientific genius, man has wrought
  material miracles and has transformed his world. He has harnessed
  nature and has developed great civilizations. But he has never
  learned very well how to live with himself. The values he has
  created have been predominantly materialistic; his spiritual
  values have lagged far behind. He has demonstrated little
  spiritual genius and has made little progress toward the
  realization of human brotherhood. In the contemporary atomic age,
  this could prove man's fatal weakness.</p>

  <p>Alfred Nobel, a half-century ago, foresaw
  with prophetic vision that if the complacent mankind of his day
  could, with equanimity, contemplate war, the day would soon
  inevitably come when man would be confronted with the fateful
  alternative of peace or reversion to the Dark Ages. Man may well
  ponder whether he has not now reached that stage. Man's inventive
  genius has so far outreached his reason - not his capacity to
  reason but his willingness to apply reason - that the peoples of
  the world find themselves precariously on the brink of total
  disaster.</p>

  <p>If today we speak of peace, we also speak
  of the United Nations, for in this era, peace and the United
  Nations have become inseparable. If the United Nations cannot
  ensure peace, there will be none. If war should come, it will be
  only because the United Nations has failed. But the United
  Nations need not fail. Surely, every man of reason must work and
  pray to the end that it will not fail.</p>

  <p>In these critical days, it is a high
  privilege and a most rewarding experience to be associated with
  the United Nations - the greatest peace effort in human history.
  Those who work in and with the organization, perhaps inevitably,
  tend to develop a professional optimism with regard to the
  prospects for the United Nations and, therefore, to the prospects
  for peace. But there is also a sense of deep frustration, which
  flows from the knowledge that mankind could readily live in peace
  and freedom and good neighbourliness if there were but a minimum
  of will to do so. There is the ever present, simple but stark
  truth that though the peoples long primarily for peace, they may
  be prodded by their leaders and governments into needless war,
  which may at worst destroy them, at best lead them once again to
  barbarism.</p>

  <p>The United Nations strives to be realistic.
  It understands well the frailties of man. It is realized that if
  there is to be peace in the world, it must be attained through
  men and with man, in his nature and mores, just about as he now
  is. Intensive effort is exerted to reach the hearts and minds of
  men with the vital pleas for peace and human understanding, to
  the end that human attitudes and relations may be steadily
  improved. But this is a process of international education, or
  better, education for international living, and it is at best
  gradual. Men change their attitudes and habits slowly, and but
  grudgingly divorce their minds from fears, suspicions, and
  prejudices.</p>

  <p>The United Nations itself is but a cross
  section of the world's peoples. It reflects, therefore, the
  typical fears, suspicions, and prejudices which bedevil human
  relations throughout the world. In the delegations from the sixty
  member states and in the international Secretariat in which most
  of them are represented, may be found individual qualities of
  goodness and badness, honesty and subterfuge, courage and
  timorousness, internationalism and chauvinism. It could not be
  otherwise. Still, the activities of all are within the framework
  of a great international organization dedicated to the imperative
  causes of peace, freedom, and justice in the world.</p>

  <p>The United Nations, inescapably, is an
  organization at once of great weakness and great strength.</p>

  <p>Its powers of action are sharply limited by
  the exigencies of national sovereignties. With nationalism per se
  there may be no quarrel. But narrow, exclusively self-centered
  nationalism persists as the outstanding dynamic of world politics
  and is the prime obstacle to enduring peace. The international
  well-being, on the one hand, and national egocentrism, on the
  other, are inevitably at cross-purposes. The procedures and
  processes of the United Nations as a circumscribed international
  parliament are unavoidably complex and tedious.</p>

  <p>The United Nations was established in the
  hope, if not on the assumption, that the five great powers would
  work harmoniously toward an increasingly better world order. The
  existing impasse between West and East and the resultant "cold
  war" were not foreseen by those who formulated the United Nations
  Charter in the spring of 1945 in the misleading, but
  understandably jubilant, atmosphere of war's triumphant end.
  Nevertheless, the United Nations has exhibited a fortunate
  flexibility which has enabled it to adjust to the regrettable
  circumstances of the discord among the great powers and to
  continue to function effectively.</p>

  <p>Reflecting the hopes and aspirations of all
  peoples for peace, security, freedom, and justice, the
  foundations of the United Nations are firmly anchored, and its
  moral sanctions are strong. It is served by a fully competent
  international Secretariat which is devoted to the high principles
  and purposes of the organization. At the head of this Secretariat
  is the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve
  Lie<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>, a great son of Norway, and a
  man whose name will be writ large in the annals of world
  statesmanship and peacemaking. No living man has worked more
  persistently or courageously to save the world from the scourge
  of war than Trygve Lie.</p>

  <p>In its short but turbulent five years, the
  United Nations, until the past few weeks, at least, has
  demonstrated a comforting ability to cope with every dangerous
  crisis that has erupted into violence or threatened to do so. It
  has never been easily done nor as well as might be hoped for, but
  the fact remains that it has been done. In these post-war years,
  the United Nations, in the interest of peace, has been called
  upon to eliminate the threat of local wars, to stop local wars
  already underway, and now in Korea, itself to undertake an
  international police action which amounts to full-scale war. Its
  record has been impressive. Its interventions have been directly
  responsible for checking and containing dangerous armed conflicts
  in Indonesia, Kashmir, and Palestine, and to only a lesser extent
  in Greece<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>That the United Nations has been able to
  serve the cause of peace in this way has been due in large
  measure to the determination of its members to reject the use of
  armed force as an instrument of national policy, and to the new
  techniques of international intervention which it has employed.
  In each instance of a threat to the peace, the United Nations
  projects itself directly into the area of conflict by sending
  United Nations representatives to the area for the purpose of
  mediation and conciliation.</p>

  <p>It was as the head of a United Nations
  mission of this kind that Count Folke Bernadotte<a href=
  "#not3"><sup>3</sup></a> went to Palestine in the spring of 1948.
  On his arrival in the Near East, he found the Arabs and Jews
  locked in a bitter, bloody, and highly emotional war in
  Palestine. He was armed only with the strong demand of the United
  Nations that in the interest of world peace the Palestine problem
  must be settled by peaceful means.</p>

  <p>In one of the most brilliant individual
  feats of diplomatic history, Count Bernadotte, within two weeks
  of his arrival on the scene of conflict, had negotiated a four
  weeks' truce and the guns had ceased firing. In order to
  supervise that truce, he requested of the Secretary-General and
  promptly received an international team of civilian and military
  personnel, numbering some seven hundred men and women. The
  members of this compact and devoted United Nations "peace army"
  in Palestine, many of whom were from the Scandinavian countries
  and all of whom were unarmed, under the early leadership of Count
  Bernadotte wrote a heroic chapter in the cause of
  peacemaking<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Their leader,
  Bernadotte himself, and ten others, gave their lives in this
  effort. The United Nations and the peace-loving world must ever
  be grateful to them.</p>

  <p>We who had the privilege to serve under the
  leadership of Count Bernadotte revere his name. He was a great
  internationalist, a warm-hearted humanitarian, a warrior of
  unflinching courage in the cause of peace, and a truly noble man.
  We who carried on after him were inspired by his self-sacrifice
  and were determined to pay him the one tribute which he would
  have appreciated above all others - the successful completion of
  the task which he had begun, the restoration of peace to
  Palestine.</p>

  <p>In Korea, for the first, and it may be
  fervently hoped, the last time, the United Nations processes of
  peaceful intervention to settle disputes failed. They failed only
  because the North Korean regime stubbornly refused to afford them
  the chance to work and resorted to aggressive force as the means
  of attaining its ends. Confronted with this, the gravest
  challenge to its mandate to preserve the peace of the world, the
  United Nations had no reasonable alternative but to check
  aggressive national force with decisive international force. This
  it has attempted to do, and it was enabled to do so only by the
  firm resolve of the overwhelming majority of its members that the
  peace must be preserved and that aggression shall be struck down
  wherever undertaken or by whom<a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>By virtue of recent setbacks to United
  Nations forces in Korea, as a result of the injection of vast
  numbers of Chinese troops into the conflict, it becomes clear
  that this resolve of its members has not been backed by
  sufficient armed strength to ensure that the right shall prevail.
  In the future, it must be the forces of peace that are
  overwhelming.</p>

  <p>But whatever the outcome of the present
  military struggle in Korea in which the United Nations and
  Chinese troops are now locked, Korea provides the lesson which
  can save peace and freedom in the world if nations and peoples
  will but learn that lesson, and learn it quickly. To make peace
  in the world secure, the United Nations must have readily at its
  disposal, as a result of firm commitments undertaken by all of
  its members, military strength of sufficient dimensions to make
  it certain that it can meet aggressive military force with
  international military force, speedily and conclusively.</p>

  <p>If that kind of strength is made available
  to the United Nations - and under action taken by the General
  Assembly this fall it can be made available - in my view that
  strength will never again be challenged in war and therefore need
  never be employed.</p>

  <p>But military strength will not be enough.
  The moral position of the United Nations must ever be strong and
  unassailable; it must stand steadfastly, always, for the
  right.</p>

  <p>The international problems with which the
  United Nations is concerned are the problems of the
  interrelations of the peoples of the world. They are human
  problems. The United Nations is entitled to believe, and it does
  believe, that there are no insoluble problems of human relations
  and that there is none which cannot be solved by peaceful means.
  The United Nations - in Indonesia, Palestine, and Kashmir - has
  demonstrated convincingly that parties to the most severe
  conflict may be induced to abandon war as the method of
  settlement in favour of mediation and conciliation, at a merciful
  saving of untold lives and acute suffering.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there may yet be some in the
  world who have not learned that today war can settle nothing,
  that aggressive force can never be enough, nor will it be
  tolerated. If this should be so, the pitiless wrath of the
  organized world must fall upon those who would endanger the peace
  for selfish ends. For in this advanced day, there is no excuse,
  no justification, for nations resorting to force except to repel
  armed attack.</p>

  <p>The world and its peoples being as they
  are, there is no easy or quick or infallible approach to a secure
  peace. It is only by patient, persistent, undismayed effort, by
  trial and error, that peace can be won. Nor can it be won
  cheaply, as the taxpayer is learning. In the existing world
  tension, there will be rebuffs and setbacks, dangerous crises,
  and episodes of violence. But the United Nations, with unshakable
  resolution, in the future as in the past, will continue to man
  the dikes of peace. In this common purpose, all states,
  irrespective of size, are vital.</p>

  <p>The small nations, which constitute the
  overwhelming majority in its membership, are a great source of
  strength for the United Nations. Their desire for peace is deep
  seated and constant. The fear, suspicion, and conflict which
  characterize the relations among the great powers, and the
  resultant uncertainty, keep them and their peoples in a state of
  anxious tension and suspense. For the relations among the great
  powers will largely determine their future. A third world war
  would quickly engulf the smaller states, and many of them would
  again provide the battlefields. On many of them, now as before,
  the impact of war would be even more severe than upon the great
  powers. They in particular, therefore, support and often initiate
  measures designed to ensure that the United Nations shall be
  increasingly effective as a practical instrumentality for peace.
  In this regard, the Scandinavian countries contribute signally to
  the constructive effort of the United Nations.</p>

  <p>One legacy of the recent past greatly
  handicaps the work of the United Nations. It can never realize
  its maximum potential for peace until the Second World War is
  fully liquidated. The impasse between West and East has prevented
  the great powers from concluding the peace treaties which would
  finally terminate that last war<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
  It can be little doubted that the United Nations, if called upon,
  could afford valuable aid toward this end. At present, the United
  Nations must work for future peace in the unhappy atmosphere of
  an unconcluded great war, while precluded from rendering any
  assistance toward the liquidation of that war. These, obviously,
  are matters of direct and vital concern to all peace-loving
  nations, whatever their size.</p>

  <p>At the moment, in view of the disturbing
  events in Korea and Indo-China<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>,
  the attention of a fearful world is focused on Asia, seeking an
  answer to the fateful question "peace or war?" But the intrinsic
  importance of Europe in the world peace equation cannot be
  ignored. The peace of Europe, and therefore of the world, can
  never be secure so long as the problem of Germany remains
  unsolved.</p>

  <p>In this regard, those who at the end of the
  last war were inclined to dismiss Europe as a vital factor in
  reckoning the future security and prosperity of the world, have
  had to revise their calculations. For Europe, grievously wounded
  though it was, has displayed a remarkable resiliency and has
  quickly regained its place in the orbit of world affairs.</p>

  <p>But Europe, and the Western world
  generally, must become fully aware that the massive and restive
  millions of Asia and Africa are henceforth a new and highly
  significant factor in all peace calculations. These hitherto
  suppressed masses are rapidly awakening and are demanding, and
  are entitled to enjoy, a full share in the future fruits of
  peace, freedom, and security.</p>

  <p>Very many of these millions are
  experiencing a newfound freedom. Many other millions are still in
  subject status as colonials. The aspirations and demands of those
  who have achieved freedom and those who seek it are the same:
  security, treatment as equals, and their rightful place in the
  brotherhood of nations.</p>

  <p>It is truer today than when Alfred Nobel
  realized it a half-century ago, that peace cannot be achieved in
  a vacuum. Peace must be paced by human progress. Peace is no mere
  matter of men fighting or not fighting. Peace, to have meaning
  for many who have known only suffering in both peace and war,
  must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health, and
  education, as well as freedom and human dignity - a steadily
  better life. If peace is to be secure, long-suffering and
  long-starved, forgotten peoples of the world, the underprivileged
  and the undernourished, must begin to realize without delay the
  promise of a new day and a new life.</p>

  <p>In the world of today, Europe, like the
  rest of the West, is confronted with the urgent necessity of a
  new orientation - a global orientation. The pre-war outlook is as
  obsolete as the pre-war world. There must be an awakening to the
  incontestable fact that the far away, little known and little
  understood peoples of Asia and Africa, who constitute the
  majority of the world's population, are no longer passive and no
  longer to be ignored. The fury of the world ideological struggle
  swirls about them. Their vast numbers will prove a dominant
  factor in the future world pattern of life. They provide virgin
  soil for the growth of democracy, but the West must first learn
  how to approach them understandingly and how to win their trust
  and friendship. There is a long and unsavory history of Western
  imperialism, suppression, and exploitation to be overcome,
  despite the undenied benefits which the West also brought to
  them. There must be an acceleration in the liquidation of
  colonialism. A friendly hand must be extended to the peoples who
  are labouring under the heavy burden of newly won independence,
  as well as to those who aspire to it. And in that hand must be
  tangible aid in generous quantity - funds, goods, foodstuffs,
  equipment, technical assistance.</p>

  <p>There are great issues demanding resolution
  in the world: the clash of the rather loosely defined concepts
  and systems of capitalism and communism; the radically
  contrasting conceptions of democracy, posing extreme views of
  individualism against extreme views of statism; the widespread
  denials of human rights; the understandable impatience of many
  among some two hundred million colonial peoples for the early
  realization of their aspirations toward emancipation; and
  others.</p>

  <p>But these are issues which in no sense may
  be considered as defying solution. The issue of capitalism versus
  communism is one of ideology which in the world of today cannot,
  in fact, be clearly defined. It cannot be clearly defined because
  there are not two worlds, one "capitalist" and one "communist".
  There is but one world - a world of sharp clashes, to be sure -
  with these two doctrines at the opposite ideological poles. In
  between these extremes are found many gradations of the two
  systems and ideologies.</p>

  <p>There is room in the world for both
  capitalism and communism and all gradations of them, providing
  only that neither system is set upon pursuing an aggressively
  imperialistic course.</p>

  <p>The United Nations is opposed to
  imperialism of any kind, ideological or otherwise. The United
  Nations stands for the freedom and equality of all peoples,
  irrespective of race, religion, or ideology. It is for the
  peoples of every society to make their own choices with regard to
  ideologies, economic systems, and the relationship which is to
  prevail between the state and the individual. The United Nations
  is engaged in an historic effort to underwrite the rights of man.
  It is also attempting to give reassurance to the colonial peoples
  that their aspirations for freedom can be realized, if only
  gradually, by peaceful processes.</p>

  <p>There can be peace and a better life for
  all men. Given adequate authority and support, the United Nations
  can ensure this. But the decision really rests with the peoples
  of the world. The United Nations belongs to the people, but it is
  not yet as close to them, as much a part of their conscious
  interest, as it must come to be. The United Nations must always
  be on the people's side. Where their fundamental rights and
  interests are involved, it must never act from mere expediency.
  At times, perhaps, it has done so, but never to its own advantage
  nor to that of the sacred causes of peace and freedom. If the
  peoples of the world are strong in their resolve and if they
  speak through the United Nations, they need never be confronted
  with the tragic alternatives of war or dishonourable appeasement,
  death, or enslavement.</p>

  <p>Amidst the frenzy and irrationality of a
  topsy-turvy world, some simple truths would appear to be
  self-evident.</p>

  <p>As Alfred Nobel finally discerned, people
  are never deterred from the folly of war by the stark terror of
  it. But it is nonetheless true that if in atomic war there would
  be survivors, there could be no victors. What, then, could war
  achieve which could not be better gained by peaceful means? There
  are, to be sure, vital differences and wide areas of conflict
  among the nations, but there is utterly none which could not be
  settled peacefully - by negotiation and mediation - given a
  genuine will for peace and even a modicum of mutual good
  faith.</p>

  <p>But there would appear to be little hope
  that efforts to break the great power impasse could be very
  fruitful in the current atmosphere of fear, suspicion, and mutual
  recrimination. Fear, suspicion, and recrimination in the
  relations among nations tend to be dangerously self-compounding.
  They induce that national hysteria which, in its rejection of
  poise and rationality, can itself be the fatal prelude to war. A
  favourable climate for peaceful negotiation must be created and
  can only be created by painstaking, unremitting effort.
  Conflicting parties must be led to realize that the road to peace
  can never be traversed by threatening to fight at every bend, by
  merely being armed to the teeth, or by flushing every bush to
  find an enemy. An essential first step in a civilized approach to
  peace in these times would call for a moratorium on recrimination
  and reproach.</p>

  <p>There are some in the world who are
  prematurely resigned to the inevitability of war. Among them are
  the advocates of the so-called "preventive war", who, in their
  resignation to war, wish merely to select their own time for
  initiating it. To suggest that war can prevent war is a base play
  on words and a despicable form of warmongering. The objective of
  any who sincerely believe in peace clearly must be to exhaust
  every honourable recourse in the effort to save the peace. The
  world has had ample evidence that war begets only conditions
  which beget further war.</p>

  <p>In the final analysis, the acid test of a
  genuine will to peace is the willingness of disputing parties to
  expose their differences to the peaceful processes of the United
  Nations and to the bar of international public opinion which the
  United Nations reflects. It is only in this way that truth,
  reason, and justice may come to prevail over the shrill and
  blatant voice of propaganda; that a wholesome international
  morality can be cultivated.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of emphasis that the United
  Nations exists not merely to preserve the peace but also to make
  change - even radical change - possible without violent upheaval.
  The United Nations has no vested interest in the status quo. It
  seeks a more secure world, a better world, a world of progress
  for all peoples. In the dynamic world society which is the
  objective of the United Nations, all peoples must have equality
  and equal rights. The rights of those who at any given time may
  be in the minority - whether for reasons of race, religion, or
  ideology - are as important as those of the majority, and the
  minorities must enjoy the same respect and protection. The United
  Nations does not seek a world cut after a single pattern, nor
  does it consider this desirable. The United Nations seeks only
  unity, not uniformity, out of the world's diversity.</p>

  <p>There will be no security in our world, no
  release from agonizing tension, no genuine progress, no enduring
  peace, until, in Shelley's fine words, "reason's voice, loud as
  the voice of nature, shall have waked the nations".</p>
