advocate of political reform and human rights in China and an outspoken
critic of the Chinese communist regime; Liu has been detained, put under
house arrest and imprisoned many times for his writing and activism.
According to his lawyers&rsquo; defence statement in his 2009 trial, Liu has
written nearly 800 essays, 499 of them since 2005. Liu is a drafter and a key
proponent of Charter 08.</p>
<p>Liu was born on December 28, 1955 in Changchun, Jilin. He received a BA
 in literature from Jilin University, and an MA and PhD from Beijing Normal
 University, where he also taught.</p>
<p>In April 1989, he left his position as a visiting scholar at Columbia University
 to return to Beijing to participate in the 1989 Democracy Movement. On June
 2, Liu, along with Hou Dejian, Zhou Duo, and Gao Xin, went on a hunger
 strike in Tiananmen Square to protest martial law and appeal for peaceful
 negotiations between the students and the government. In the early morning
 of June 4, 1989, the four attempted to persuade the students to leave
 Tiananmen Square. After the crackdown, Liu was held in Beijing&rsquo;s Qincheng
 Prison until January 1991, when he was found guilty of &quot;counter-revolutionary
 propaganda and incitement&quot; but exempted from punishment.</p>
<p>In 1996, he was sentenced to three years of Reeducation-Through-Labour
 on charges of &quot;rumor-mongering and slander&quot; and &quot;disturbing social order&quot;
 after drafting the &quot;Anti-Corruption Proposals&quot; and letters appealing for
 official reassessment of the June Fourth crackdown.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2008, Liu was taken away from his Beijing home and
 detained by the Beijing police, and on December 25, 2009, more than a year
 later; he was found guilty of &quot;inciting subversion of state power.&quot; By early
 March 2010, more than 600 co-signatories of Charter 08 signed an online
 &quot;statement of shared responsibility&quot; with Liu for his &quot;crime&quot;.</p>
