  <h1>Paul Greengard - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="greengard.jpg" class="bio-img">My paternal great, great grandfather
  emigrated from Koenigsberg, currently Kaliningrad, to St. Louis during the
  1850s, a time of large-scale movement of Germans, including
  German Jews, to the Mid-Western United States. My paternal
  grandfather moved to Binghamton, New York, where my father was
  born. My father had success in vaudeville as a
  singer/dancer/comedian. He eventually became a businessman
  working first in retail and then in wholesale in the cosmetics
  field.</p>

  <p>I was born on December 11, 1925 in New York
  City under tragic circumstances - my mother, n&eacute;e Pearl
  Meister, died giving birth to me. My father remarried when I was
  13 months old. In contrast to my mother, who had been Jewish, my
  stepmother, who raised me, was Episcopalian. From that time on I
  was brought up in the Christian tradition, celebrating Easter,
  Christmas, etc. I was prevented access to my biological mother's
  family with whom I became familiar only very recently. I have
  been delighted to learn that many members of that family are
  highly creative individuals working in various fields of science,
  government, etc.</p>

  <p>I attended public schools in Brooklyn and
  Queens. During World War II, I spent three years in the Navy as
  an electronics technician. After appropriate training, I was
  assigned to a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that was
  involved in developing an early-warning system to intercept
  Japanese kamikaze planes before they could reach the ships of the
  U.S. fleet.</p>

  <p>After the war, I attended Hamilton College,
  a small liberal arts college located in Clinton, New York, where
  I majored in mathematics and physics, and from which I graduated
  in 1948. I had been interested in going to graduate school in
  theoretical physics, but decided not to do so because at that
  time the only fellowship support for such graduate studies came
  from the Atomic Energy Commission. This was only three years
  after dropping the atomic bombs on Japan, and I didn't want to
  contribute to research the fruits of which might contribute to
  creating more powerful weapons of mass destruction. In thinking
  about various options, I settled on the then nascent field of
  biophysics. At that time there were two groups of academic
  biophysicists. One, at the University of California, was engaged
  in biological and medical applications of radioisotopes. The
  other, at the University of Pennsylvania, headed by Detlev W.
  Bronk, used electrophysiological techniques to study nerve
  function. I chose the latter. Shortly after I arrived in
  Philadelphia, Bronk announced that he was accepting the
  Presidency of The Johns Hopkins University and invited a group of us
  to move there with him and form a new department of biophysics.
  The most senior member of the group was <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/index.html">H. Keffer Hartline</a>, who
  became Chairman of the Department of Biophysics at Johns Hopkins
  and who was later to win a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
  for his work on vision. I did my first laboratory research under
  the supervision of Hartline.</p>

  <p>Shortly after our move to Hopkins, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html">Allen Hodgkin</a> gave a
  lecture on the still unpublished work that he and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html">Andrew Huxley</a> had
  carried out on the ionic basis of the nerve impulse - work that
  was later recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
  Medicine. That work, carried out exclusively with biophysical
  techniques, filled me with admiration. At the same time, the
  elegance of that study made me feel that it might be a long time
  until biophysical techniques would by themselves make further
  major contributions to our understanding of nerve cell function.
  Thus it was Hodgkin's lecture that led me to consider combining
  biophysical and biochemical techniques to understand the
  molecular and cellular basis of how nerve cells work. Since, at
  that time, neuroscience as a field had not yet been created, my
  Ph.D. thesis was carried out under the joint supervision of Frank
  Brink, a distinguished biophysicist in our Department of
  Biophysics, and Sidney Colowick, a prominent biochemist who was a
  Professor in the Department of Biology - I remain to this day
  very grateful for their nurture and support.</p>

  <p>Upon graduation from The Johns Hopkins
  University in 1953, I went to Europe for postdoctoral studies. My
  first year was with Henry McIlwain, at the Maudsley Hospital, of
  the University of London. My second year was with E.C. Slater,
  first at Cambridge University and then at the University of
  Amsterdam. At the end of my six-month period in Amsterdam, I
  returned to London to work in the laboratory of Wilhelm Feldberg,
  who was Head of the Department of Pharmacology at the National
  Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London. At that
  time, the only departments that had both electrophysiological and
  biochemical facilities were pharmacology departments. Feldberg
  was a great scientist and a wonderful human being and provided an
  atmosphere in which I could continue to explore the relationships
  between biochemistry and electrophysiology in the nervous system.
  I seriously considered staying in England, which I found
  particularly compatible with my personality, which at that time
  was relatively reserved. However, the low level of financial
  support for scientific research in England, my ignorance of the
  nuances of the complex British educational system (two sons had
  been born in England), and the lack of central heating all
  conspired towards my returning to the United States. Upon my
  return, I spent one year working in the laboratory of Sidney
  Udenfriend at the NIH following which I became director of the
  Department of Biochemistry at the Geigy Research Laboratories. My
  prime motivation for going to Geigy was the prospect of applying
  basic scientific principles to the development of new drugs for
  the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
  Unfortunately, at that time, Geigy, like most, if not all, other
  pharmaceutical companies, was very conservative with regard to
  the nature of the research programs which they found acceptable.
  It was extremely difficult to obtain authorization to embark on
  innovative research approaches. In 1967, I left Geigy. After
  spending one year as a Visiting Professor, the first semester in
  Alfred Gilman's Department of Pharmacology at Albert Einstein
  College of Medicine and the second semester with Sidney Colowick
  and Earl Sutherland at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, I
  took a position as Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at
  Yale
  University. My years at Yale saw the early development of my
  work on signal transduction in the nervous system. Although I was
  very happy throughout my 15 years at Yale, the offer to move to
  The Rockefeller University was irresistible and so I
  moved to New York in 1983 where I have been located since. It
  has been at Rockefeller that most of the work described in my
  Nobel Lecture was performed.</p>
