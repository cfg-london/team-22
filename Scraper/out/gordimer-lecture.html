  <h1>Nadine Gordimer - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <h2>Writing and Being</h2>

  <p>In the beginning was the Word.<br>
  <br>
  The Word was with God, signified God's Word, the word that was
  Creation. But over the centuries of human culture the word has
  taken on other meanings, secular as well as religious. To have
  the word has come to be synonymous with ultimate authority, with
  prestige, with awesome, sometimes dangerous persuasion, to have
  Prime Time, a TV talk show, to have the gift of the gab as well
  as that of speaking in tongues. The word flies through space, it
  is bounced from satellites, now nearer than it has ever been to
  the heaven from which it was believed to have come. But its most
  significant transformation occurred for me and my kind long ago,
  when it was first scratched on a stone tablet or traced on
  papyrus, when it materialized from sound to spectacle, from being
  heard to being read as a series of signs, and then a script; and
  travelled through time from parchment to Gutenberg. For this is
  the genesis story of the writer. It is the story that <strong>wrote</strong> her
  or him into being.<br>
  <br>
  It was, strangely, a double process, creating at the same time
  both the writer and the very purpose of the writer as a mutation
  in the agency of human culture. It was both ontogenesis as the
  origin and development of an individual being, and the
  adaptation, in the nature of that individual, specifically to the
  exploration of ontogenesis, the origin and development of <strong>the</strong> individual being. For we writers are evolved for that task. Like
  the prisoners incarcerated with the jaguar in Borges'
  story<a href="#not_1"><sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></a>,
  'The God's Script', who was trying to read, in a ray of light
  which fell only once a day, the meaning of being from the marking
  on the creature's pelt, we spend our lives attempting to
  interpret through the word the readings we take in the societies,
  the world of which we are part. It is in this sense, this
  inextricable, ineffable participation, that writing is always and
  at once an exploration of self and of the world; of individual
  and collective being.<br>
  <br>
  Being here.<br>
  <br>
  Humans, the only self-regarding animals, blessed or cursed with
  this torturing higher faculty, have always wanted to know why.
  And this is not just the great ontological question of why we are
  here at all, for which religions and philosophies have tried to
  answer conclusively for various peoples at various times, and
  science tentatively attempts dazzling bits of explanation we are
  perhaps going to die out in our millennia, like dinosaurs, without
  having developed the necessary comprehension to understand as a
  whole. Since humans became self-regarding they have sought, as
  well, explanations for the common phenomena of procreation,
  death, the cycle of seasons, the earth, sea, wind and stars, sun
  and moon, plenty and disaster. With myth, the writer's ancestors,
  the oral story-tellers, began to feel out and formulate these
  mysteries, using the elements of daily life - observable reality
  - and the faculty of the imagination - the power of projection
  into the hidden - to make stories.<br>
  <br>
  Roland Barthes<a href="#not_2"><sup><font size=
  "1">2</font></sup></a> asks, 'What is characteristic of myth?'
  And answers: 'To transform a meaning into form.' Myths are
  stories that mediate in this way between the known and unknown.
  Claude Levi-Strauss<a href="#not_3"><sup><font size=
  "1">3</font></sup></a> wittily de-mythologizes myth as a genre
  between a fairy tale and a detective story. Being here; we don't
  know who-dun-it. But something satisfying, if not the answer, can
  be invented. Myth was the mystery plus the fantasy - gods,
  anthropomorphized animals and birds, chimera, phantasmagorical
  creatures - that posits out of the imagination some sort of
  explanation for the mystery. Humans and their fellow creatures
  were the materiality of the story, but as Nikos
  Kazantzakis<a href="#not_4"><sup><font size=
  "1">4</font></sup></a> once wrote, 'Art is the representation not
  of the body but of the forces which created the body.'<br>
  <br>
  There are many proven explanations for natural phenomena now; and
  there are new questions of being arising out of some of the
  answers. For this reason, the genre of myth has never been
  entirely abandoned, although we are inclined to think of it as
  archaic. If it dwindled to the children's bedtime tale in some
  societies, in parts of the world protected by forests or deserts
  from international megaculture it has continued, alive, to offer
  art as a system of mediation between the individual and being.
  And it has made a whirling comeback out of Space, an Icarus in
  the avatar of Batman and his kind, who never fall into the ocean
  of failure to deal with the gravity forces of life. These new
  myths, however, do not seek so much to enlighten and provide some
  sort of answers as to distract, to provide a fantasy escape route
  for people who no longer want to face even the hazard of answers
  to the terrors of their existence. (Perhaps it is the positive
  knowledge that humans now possess the means to destroy their
  whole planet, the fear that they have in this way themselves
  become the gods, dreadfully charged with their own continued
  existence, that has made comic-book and movie myth escapist.) The
  forces of being remain. They are what the writer, as distinct
  from the contemporary popular mythmaker, still engage today, as
  myth in its ancient form attempted to do.<br>
  <br>
  How writers have approached this engagement and continue to
  experiment with it has been and is, perhaps more than ever, the
  study of literary scholars. The writer in relation to the nature
  of perceivable reality and what is beyond - imperceivable reality
  - is the basis for all these studies, no matter what resulting
  concepts are labelled, and no matter in what categorized
  microfiles writers are stowed away for the annals of literary
  historiography. Reality is constructed out of many elements and
  entities, seen and unseen, expressed, and left unexpressed for
  breathing-space in the mind. Yet from what is regarded as old-hat
  psychological analysis to modernism and post-modernism,
  structuralism and poststructuralism, all literary studies are
  aimed at the same end: to pin down to a consistency (and what is
  consistency if not the principle hidden within the riddle?); to
  make definitive through methodology the writer's grasp at the
  forces of being. But life is aleatory in itself; being is
  constantly pulled and shaped this way and that by circumstances
  and different levels of consciousness. There is no pure state of
  being, and it follows that there is no pure text, 'real' text,
  totally incorporating the aleatory. It surely cannot be reached
  by any critical methodology, however interesting the attempt. To
  deconstruct a text is in a way a contradiction, since to
  deconstruct it is to make another construction out of the pieces,
  as Roland Barthes<a href="#not_5"><sup><font size=
  "1">5</font></sup></a> does so fascinatingly, and admits to, in
  his linguistic and semantical dissection of Balzac's story,
  'Sarrasine'. So the literary scholars end up being some kind of
  storyteller, too.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps there is no other way of reaching some understanding of
  being than through art? Writers themselves don't analyze what
  they do; to analyze would be to look down while crossing a canyon
  on a tightrope. To say this is not to mystify the process of
  writing but to make an image out of the intense inner
  concentration the writer must have to cross the chasms of the
  aleatory and make them the word's own, as an explorer plants a
  flag. <a href="../1923/index.html">Yeats'</a> inner 'lonely
  impulse of delight' in the pilot's solitary flight, and his
  'terrible beauty' born of mass uprising, both opposed and
  conjoined; E. M. Forster's modest 'only connect'; Joyce's chosen,
  wily 'silence, cunning and exile'; more contemporary, <a href=
  "../1982/index.html">Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's</a>
  labyrinth in which power over others, in the person of Simon
  Bolivar, is led to the thrall of the only unassailable power,
  death - these are some examples of the writer's endlessly varied
  ways of approaching the state of being through the word. Any
  writer of any worth at all hopes to play only a pocket-torch of
  light - and rarely, through genius, a sudden flambeau - into the
  bloody yet beautiful labyrinth of human experience, of
  being.<br>
  <br>
  Anthony Burgess<a href="#not_6"><sup><font size=
  "1">6</font></sup></a> once gave a summary definition of
  literature as 'the aesthetic exploration of the world'. I would
  say that writing only begins there, for the exploration of much
  beyond, which nevertheless only aesthetic means can
  express.<br>
  <br>
  How does the writer become one, having been given the word? I do
  not know if my own beginnings have any particular interest. No
  doubt they have much in common with those of others, have been
  described too often before as a result of this yearly assembly
  before which a writer stands. For myself, I have said that
  nothing factual that I write or say will be as truthful as my
  fiction. The life, the opinions, are not the work, for it is in
  the tension between standing apart and being involved that the
  imagination transforms both. Let me give some minimal account of
  myself. I am what I suppose would be called a natural writer. I
  did not make any decision to become one. I did not, at the
  beginning, expect to earn a living by being read. I wrote as a
  child out of the joy of apprehending life through my senses - the
  look and scent and feel of things; and soon out of the emotions
  that puzzled me or raged within me and which took form, found
  some enlightenment, solace and delight, shaped in the written
  word. There is a little Kafka<a href="#not_7"><sup><font size=
  "1">7</font></sup></a> parable that goes like this; 'I have three
  dogs: Hold-him, Seize-him, and Nevermore. Hold-him and Seize-him
  are ordinary little Schipperkes and nobody would notice them if
  they were alone. But there is Nevermore, too. Nevermore is a
  mongrel Great Dane and has an appearance that centuries of the
  most careful breeding could never have produced. Nevermore is a
  gypsy.' In the small South African gold-mining town where I was
  growing up I was Nevermore the mongrel (although I could scarcely
  have been described as a Great Dane ...) in whom the accepted
  characteristics of the townspeople could not be traced. I was the
  Gypsy, tinkering with words second-hand, mending my own efforts
  at writing by learning from what I read. For my school was the
  local library. Proust, Chekhov and Dostoevsky, to name only a few
  to whom I owe my existence as a writer, were my professors. In
  that period of my life, yes, I was evidence of the theory that
  books are made out of other books . . . But I did not remain so
  for long, nor do I believe any potential writer could.<br>
  <br>
  With adolescence comes the first reaching out to otherness
  through the drive of sexuality. For most children, from then on
  the faculty of the imagination, manifest in play, is lost in the
  focus on day dreams of desire and love, but for those who are
  going to be artists of one kind or another the first life-crisis
  after that of birth does something else in addition: the
  imagination gains range and extends by the subjective flex of new
  and turbulent emotions. There are new perceptions. The writer
  begins to be able to enter into other lives. The process of
  standing apart and being involved has come.<br>
  <br>
  Unknowingly, I had been addressing myself on the subject of
  being, whether, as in my first stories, there was a child's
  contemplation of death and murder in the necessity to finish off,
  with a death blow, a dove mauled by a cat, or whether there was
  wondering dismay and early consciousness of racism that came of
  my walk to school, when on the way I passed storekeepers,
  themselves East European immigrants kept lowest in the ranks of
  the Anglo-Colonial social scale for whites in the mining town,
  roughly those whom colonial society ranked lowest of all,
  discounted as less than human - the black miners who were the
  stores' customers. Only many years later was I to realize that if
  I had been a child in that category - black - I might not have
  become a writer at all, since the library that made this possible
  for me was not open to any black child. For my formal schooling
  was sketchy, at best.<br>
  <br>
  To address oneself to others begins a writer's next stage of
  development. To publish to anyone who would read what I wrote.
  That was my natural, innocent assumption of what publication
  meant, and it has not changed , that is what it means to me
  today, in spite of my awareness that most people refuse to
  believe that a writer does not have a particular audience in
  mind; and my other awareness: of the temptations, conscious and
  unconscious, which lure the writer into keeping a corner of the
  eye on who will take offense, who will approve what is on the
  page - a temptation that, like Eurydice's straying glance, will
  lead the writer back into the Shades of a destroyed talent.<br>
  <br>
  The alternative is not the malediction of the ivory tower,
  another destroyer of creativity. Borges once said he wrote for
  his friends and to pass the time. I think this was an irritated
  flippant response to the crass question - often an accusation -
  'For whom do you write?', just as <a href=
  "../1964/index.html">Sartre's</a> admonition that there are times
  when a writer should cease to write, and act upon being only in
  another way, was given in the frustration of an unresolved
  conflict between distress at injustice in the world and the
  knowledge that what he knew how to do best was write. Both Borges
  and Sartre, from their totally different extremes of denying
  literature a social purpose, were certainly perfectly aware that
  it has its implicit and unalterable social role in exploring the
  state of being, from which all other roles, personal among
  friends, public at the protest demonstration, derive. Borges was
  not writing for his friends, for he published and we all have
  received the bounty of his work. Sartre did not stop writing,
  although he stood at the barricades in 1968.<br>
  <br>
  The question of for whom do we write nevertheless plagues the
  writer, a tin can attached to the tail of every work published.
  Principally it jangles the inference of tendentiousness as praise
  or denigration. In this context, <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Camus</a><a href="#not_8"><sup><font size=
  "1">8</font></sup></a> dealt with the question best. He said that
  he liked individuals who take sides more than literatures that
  do. 'One either serves the whole of man or does not serve him at
  all. And if man needs bread and justice, and if what has to be
  done must be done to serve this need, he also needs pure beauty
  which is the bread of his heart.' So Camus called for 'Courage in
  and talent in one's work.' And M&aacute;rquez<a href=
  "#not_9"><sup><font size="1">9</font></sup></a> redefined tender
  fiction thus: The best way a writer can serve a revolution is to
  write as well as he can.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that these two statements might be the credo for all of
  us who write. They do not resolve the conflicts that have come,
  and will continue to come, to contemporary writers. But they
  state plainly an honest possibility of doing so, they turn the
  face of the writer squarely to her and his existence, the reason
  to be, as a writer, and the reason to be, as a responsible human,
  acting, like any other, within a social context.<br>
  <br>
  Being here: in a particular time and place. That is the
  existential position with particular implications for literature.
  <a href="../1980/index.html">Czeslaw Milosz</a><a href=
  "#not_10"><sup><font size="1">10</font></sup></a> once wrote the
  cry: 'What is poetry which does not serve nations or people?' and
  Brecht <a href="#not_11"><sup><font size="1">11</font></sup></a>
  wrote of a time when 'to speak of trees is almost a crime'. Many
  of us have had such despairing thoughts while living and writing
  through such times, in such places, and Sartre's solution makes
  no sense in a world where writers were - and still are - censored
  and forbidden to write, where, far from abandoning the word,
  lives were and are at risk in smuggling it, on scraps of paper,
  out of prisons. The state of being whose ontogenesis we explore
  has overwhelmingly included such experiences. Our approaches, in
  Nikos Kazantzakis'<a href="#not_12"><sup><font size=
  "1">12</font></sup></a> words, have to 'make the decision which
  harmonizes with the fearsome rhythm of our time.'<br>
  <br>
  Some of us have seen our books lie for years unread in our own
  countries, banned, and we have gone on writing. Many writers have
  been imprisoned. Looking at Africa alone - <a href=
  "../1986/index.html">Soyinka</a>, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Jack
  Mapanje, in their countries, and in my own country, South Africa,
  Jeremy Cronin, Mongane Wally Serote, Breyten Breytenbach, Dennis
  Brutus, Jaki Seroke: all these went to prison for the courage
  shown in their lives, and have continued to take the right, as
  poets, to speak of trees. Many of the greats, from <a href=
  "../1929/index.html">Thomas Mann</a> to Chinua Achebe, cast out
  by political conflict and oppression in different countries, have
  endured the trauma of exile, from which some never recover as
  writers, and some do not survive at all. I think of the South
  Africans, Can Themba, Alex la Guma, Nat Nakasa, Todd Matshikiza.
  And some writers, over half a century from Joseph Roth to Milan
  Kundera, have had to publish new works first in the word that is
  not their own, a foreign language.<br>
  <br>
  Then in 1988 the fearsome rhythm of our time quickened in an
  unprecedented frenzy to which the writer was summoned to submit
  the word. In the broad span of modern times since the
  Enlightenment writers have suffered opprobrium, bannings and even
  exile for other than political reasons. Flaubert dragged into
  court for indecency, over <i>Madame Bovary,</i> Strindberg
  arraigned for blasphemy, over <i>Marrying,</i> Lawrence's <i>Lady
  Chatterley's Lover</i> banned - there have been many examples of
  so-called offense against hypocritical bourgeois mores, just as
  there have been of treason against political dictatorships. But
  in a period when it would be unheard of for countries such as
  France, Sweden and Britain to bring such charges against freedom
  of expression, there has risen a force that takes its appalling
  authority from something far more widespread than social mores,
  and far more powerful than the power of any single political
  regime. The edict of a world religion has sentenced a writer to
  death.<br>
  <br>
  For more than three years, now, wherever he is hidden, wherever
  he might go, Salman Rushdie has existed under the Muslim
  pronouncement upon him of the <b>fatwa</b>. There is no asylum
  for him anywhere. Every morning when this writer sits down to
  write, he does not know if he will live through the day; he does
  not know whether the page will ever be filled. Salman Rushdie
  happens to be a brilliant writer, and the novel for which he is
  being pilloried, <i>The Satanic Verses,</i> is an innovative
  exploration of one of the most intense experiences of being in
  our era, the individual personality in transition between two
  cultures brought together in a post-colonial world. All is
  re-examined through the refraction of the imagination; the
  meaning of sexual and filial love, the rituals of social
  acceptance, the meaning of a formative religious faith for
  individuals removed from its subjectivity by circumstance
  opposing different systems of belief, religious and secular, in a
  different context of living. His novel is a true mythology. But
  although he has done for the postcolonial consciousness in Europe
  what Gunter Grass did for the post-Nazi one with <i>The Tin
  Drum</i> and <i>Dog Years,</i> perhaps even has tried to approach
  what <a href="../1969/index.html">Beckett</a> did for our
  existential anguish in <i>Waiting For Godot,</i> the level of his
  achievement should not matter. Even if he were a mediocre writer,
  his situation is the terrible concern of every fellow writer for,
  apart from his personal plight, what implications, what new
  threat against the carrier of the word does it bring? It should
  be the concern of individuals and above all, of governments and
  human rights organizations all over the world. With dictatorships
  apparently vanquished, this murderous new dictate invoking the
  power of international terrorism in the name of a great and
  respected religion should and can be dealt with only by
  democratic governments and the United Nations as an offense against
  humanity.<br>
  <br>
  I return from the horrific singular threat to those that have
  been general for writers of this century now in its final,
  summing-up decade. In repressive regimes anywhere - whether in
  what was the Soviet bloc, Latin America, Africa, China - most
  imprisoned writers have been shut away for their activities as
  citizens striving for liberation against the oppression of the
  general society to which they belong. Others have been condemned
  by repressive regimes for serving society by writing as well as
  they can; for this aesthetic venture of ours becomes subversive
  when the shameful secrets of our times are explored deeply, with
  the artist's rebellious integrity to the state of being manifest
  in life around her or him; then the writer's themes and
  characters inevitably are formed by the pressures and distortions
  of that society as the life of the fisherman is determined by the
  power of the sea.<br>
  <br>
  There is a paradox. In retaining this integrity, the writer
  sometimes must risk both the state's indictment of treason, and
  the liberation forces' complaint of lack of blind commitment. As
  a human being, no writer can stoop to the lie of Manichean
  'balance'. The devil always has lead in his shoes, when placed on
  his side of the scale. Yet, to paraphrase coarsely M&aacute;rquez's
  dictum given by him both as a writer and a fighter for justice,
  the writer must take the right to explore, warts and all, both
  the enemy and the beloved comrade in arms, since only a try for
  the truth makes sense of being, only a try for the truth edges
  towards justice just ahead of Yeats's beast slouching to be born.
  In literature, from life,</p>

  <blockquote><p>
    we page through each other's faces<br>
    we read each looking eye<br>
    ... It has taken lives to be able to do so.
  </blockquote></p>

  <p>These are the words of the South African
  poet and fighter for justice and peace in our country, Mongane
  Serote.<a href="#not_13"><sup><font size=
  "1">13</font></sup></a><br>
  <br>
  The writer is of service to humankind only insofar as the writer
  uses the word even against his or her own loyalties, trusts the
  state of being, as it is revealed, to hold somewhere in its
  complexity filaments of the cord of truth, able to be bound
  together, here and there, in art: trusts the state of being to
  yield somewhere fragmentary phrases of truth, which is the final
  word of words, never changed by our stumbling efforts to spell it
  out and write it down, never changed by lies, by semantic
  sophistry, by the dirtying of the word for the purposes of
  racism, sexism, prejudice, domination, the glorification of
  destruction, the curses and the praise-songs.</p>
