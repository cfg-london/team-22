  <h1>Nikolaas Tinbergen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tinbergen.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in The Hague, Netherlands, on
  15th April 1907, the third of five children of Dirk C. Tinbergen
  and Jeannette van Eek. We were a happy and harmonious family. My
  mother was a warm, impulsive person; my father - a grammar school
  master in Dutch language and history - was devoted to his family,
  a very hard worker, and an intellectually stimulating man, full
  of fine, quiet humour and <i>joie de vivre.</i><br>
  <br>
  I was not much interested in school, and both at secondary school
  and at University, I only just scraped through, with as little
  effort as I judged possible without failing. Wise teachers,
  including my University Professors in Leiden, H. Boschma
  and the late C. J. van der Klaauw, allowed me plenty of freedom
  to engage in my hobbies of camping, bird watching, skating and
  games, of which playing left-wing in grass hockey teams gave me
  free rein for my almost boundless youthful energies.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout my life, Fortune has smiled on me. Holland's then
  unparalleled natural riches - its vast sandy shores, its
  magnificent coastal dunes, the abundant wildlife in its
  ubiquitous inland waters, all within an hour's walk of our urban
  home - delighted me, and I was greatly privileged in having
  access to the numerous stimulating writings of the two quite
  exceptional Dutch naturalists, E. Heimans and Jac P. Thijsse -
  still household names in the Netherlands.<br>
  <br>
  As a boy, I had two small aquaria in our backyard, in which I
  watched, each spring, the nest building and other fascinating
  behaviours of Sticklebacks. My natural history master at our High
  School, Dr. A. Schierbeek, put some of us in charge of the three
  seawater aquaria in the classroom, rightly arguing to the Head
  Master that I got plenty of fresh air, so that no one needed to
  worry about my spending the morning break indoors.<br>
  <br>
  Having been frightened off by what I had been told of academic
  Biology as it was then taught in Leiden, I was at first
  disinclined to go to University. But a friend of the family,
  Professor Paul Ehrenfest, and Dr. Schierbeek urged my father to
  send me, in 1925, to Professor J. Thienemann, the founder of the
  famous 'Vogelwarte Rossitten', and the initiator of bird ringing.
  While Thienemann did not quite know what to do with this awkward
  youth, the photographer Rudy Steinert and his wife Lucy took me
  along on their walks along the uniquely rich shores and dunes of
  the <i>Kurische Nehrung,</i> where I saw the massive autumn
  migration of birds, the wild Moose, and the famous
  <i>Wanderd&uuml;nen.</i> Upon my return to Holland, Christmas
  1925, I had decided to read Biology at Leiden University after
  all. Here I had the good fortune to be befriended by Holland's
  most gifted naturalist Dr. Jan Verwey, who instilled in me, by
  his example, a professional interest in animal behaviour (he also
  beat me, much to my humiliation, in an <i>impromptu</i> running
  match along the deserted <i>Noordwijk</i> seashore - two
  exuberant Naked Apes!). I owe my interest in seagulls to early
  imprinting on a small protected Herring Gull colony not far from
  the Hague, and to the example of two fatherly friends, the late
  G. J. Tijmstra and Dr. h. c. A. F. J. Portielje.<br>
  <br>
  Having scraped through my finals without much honour, I became
  engaged to Elisabeth Rutten, whose family I had often joined on
  skating trips on the Zuiderzee; this made me realise that some
  day I would have to earn a living. Influenced by the work of
  <a href="index.html">Karl von Frisch</a>, and by J.-H. Fabre's
  writings on insects, I decided to use the chance discovery of a
  colony of Beewolves (<i>Philanthus</i> - a digger wasp) for a
  study of their remarkable homing abilities. This led to an
  admittedly skimpy but still quite interesting little thesis,
  which (as I was told later) the Leiden Faculty passed only after
  grave doubts; 32 pages of print were not impressive enough. But I
  was itching to get this milestone behind me, for, through the
  generosity of Sidney Van den Bergh, I had been offered the
  opportunity of joining the Netherlands' small contingent for the
  International Polar Year 1932-33, which was to have its base in
  Angmagssalik, the homeland of a small, isolated Eskimo tribe. My
  wife and I lived with these fascinating people for two summers
  and a winter just before they were westernised. Our first-hand
  experience of life among this primitive community of
  hunter-gatherers stood us in good stead forty years laters when I
  tried to reconstruct the most likely way of life of ancestral
  Man.<br>
  <br>
  Upon our return to Holland, I was given a minor instructor's job
  at Leiden University, where in 1935 Professor C. J. van der
  Klaauw, who knew how to stretch his young staff members, told me
  to teach comparative anatomy and to organise a teaching course in
  animal behaviour for undergraduates. I was also allowed to take
  my first research graduates into the field and so could extend my
  official 12-day annual holiday to an annual two months' period of
  field work. This we used for further studies of the homing of
  Beewolves and behaviour studies of other insects and birds.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936 Van der Klaauw invited <a href="index.html">Konrad
  Lorenz</a> to Leiden for a small symposium on 'Instinct', and it
  was then that Konrad and I first met. We 'clicked' at once. The
  Lorenzes invited us, with our small son, for a fourmonths' stay
  in their parental home in Altenberg near Vienna, where I became
  Lorenz' second pupil (the first being Dr. Alfred Seitz, of the
  <i>Seitz's Reizsummenregel</i>). But from the start 'pupil' and
  'master' influenced each other. Konrad's extraordinary vision and
  enthusiasm were supplemented and fertilised by my critical sense,
  my inclination to think his ideas through, and my irrepressible
  urge to check our 'hunches' by experimentation - a gift for which
  he had an almost childish admiration. Throughout this we often
  burst into bouts of hilarious fun - in Konrad's words, in
  <i>Lausbuberei.</i><br>
  <br>
  These months were decisive for our future collaboration and our
  lifelong friendship. On the way back to Holland, I shyly wrote to
  the great Von Frisch asking whether I could call at his already
  famous Rockefeller-built laboratory in Munich. My recollection of
  that visit is a mixture of delight with the man Von Frisch, and
  an anxiety on his behalf when I saw that he refused to reply to a
  student's aggressive <i>Heil Hitler</i> by anything but a quiet
  <i>Gr&uuml;ss Gott.</i><br>
  <br>
  In 1938 the Netherlands-America Foundation gave me free passage
  to and from New York, which I used for a four months' stay, eked
  out by fees for lectures given in halting English, by living for
  one dollar a day in YMCAs (40 c for a room, 50 c for a day's
  food, and 2 nickels for the subway), and travelling by Greyhound.
  During that visit I met Ernst Mayr, Frank A. Beach, Ted
  Schneirla, Robert M. Yerkes (who offered me hospitality both in
  Yale and
  Orange Park, Florida) and many others. I was frankly bewildered
  by what I saw of American Psychology. I sailed for home shortly
  after the Munich crisis, bracing myself for the dark years that
  we knew were lying ahead.<br>
  <br>
  There followed a year of intense work, and of lively
  correspondence with Lorenz, which was broken off by the outbreak
  of war. Both of us saw this as a catastrophe. <i>Wir h&auml;tten
  soviel Gutes vor,</i> wrote Lorenz before the evil forces of
  nazism descended on Holland.<br>
  <br>
  In the war I spent two years in a German hostage camp while my
  wife saw our family through the difficult times; Lorenz was
  conscripted as an Army doctor and disappeared during the battle
  of Witebsk; he did not emerge from Russian prison camps until
  1947. Our reunion, in 1949, in the hospitable home of W. H.
  Thorpe in Cambridge, was to both of us a deeply moving
  occasion.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after the war I was once again invited to the United States,
  and to Britain, to lecture on our work on animal behaviour.
  Lasting friendships with Ernst Mayr and David Lack proved
  decisive for my later interest in evolution and ecology. The
  lectures in the U.S. were worked out to a book 'The Study of
  Instinct' (1951); and my visit to Oxford, where David Lack had
  just taken over the newly founded Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology,
  ultimately led to our accepting the invitation of Sir Alister
  Hardy to settle in Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from establishing, as Hardy had asked me, a centre of
  research and teaching in animal behaviour, I spent my Oxford
  years in seeing our newly founded journal Behaviour through its
  early years, in helping to develop contact with American
  psychology (of which we were perhaps excessively critical), and
  in fostering international cooperation. This work would not have
  been possible without the active help, behind the scenes, of
  <a href="../1960/index.html">Sir Peter Medawar</a> (who urged the
  Nuffield Foundation to finance our little research group through
  its first ten years) and of E. M. Nicholson, who allocated
  generous funds from the Nature Conservancy which, with hardly any
  strings, was to last until my retirement. When Professor J. W. S.
  Pringle succeeded Alister Hardy as Head of the Department of
  Zoology in Oxford, he not only supported and encouraged our
  group, but also interested us in bridging the gap (so much wider
  than we had realised) between ethology and neuro-physiology. By
  founding the new inter-disciplinary Oxford School of Human
  Sciences he stimulated my still dormant desire to make ethology
  apply its methods to human behaviour.<br>
  <br>
  Our research group was offered unique opportunities for
  ecologically oriented field work when Dr. h. c. J. S. Owen, the
  then Director of Tanzania's National Parks, asked me to help him
  in founding the Serengeti Research Institute. A number of my
  pupils have since helped to establish this Institute's world
  fame; and the scientific ties with it have remained strong ever
  since.<br>
  <br>
  Our work received recognition by various proofs of acceptance by
  the scientific community, among which I value most my election as
  a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1962; as a Foreign Member of the
  <i>Koninklijke
  Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen</i> in 1964; the
  conferment, in 1973, of the honorary degree of D. Sc. by Edinburgh University;
  and the awarding of the Jan Swammerdam medal of the
  <i>Genootschap voor Natuur-, Genees-, en Heelkunde</i> of
  Amsterdam in 1973.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years I have, with my wife, concentrated my own
  research on the socially important question of Early Childhood
  Autism. This and other work on the development of children has
  recently brought us in contact with Professor Jerome S. Bruner,
  whose invigorating influence is already being felt throughout
  Britain. My only regret is that I am not ten years younger, so
  that I could more actively join him in developing his centre of
  child ethology in Oxford.<br>
