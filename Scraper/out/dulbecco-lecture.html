  <h2>From the Molecular Biology of Oncogenic DNA Viruses to Cancer</h2>

  <p>Oncogenic viruses, able to elicit tumour
  formation in animals, have been on the scientific scene for many
  years. After the early discovery of Ellerman and Bang at the
  beginning of this century, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1966/index.html">Peyton Rous</a> opened up
  the field in its second decade and in prophetic words gave a good
  hint of things to come. However, these discoveries were soon
  forgotten and only after a long eclipse was interest in oncogenic
  viruses revived in the fifties. My involvement in this field
  began at that time when Rubin and Temin worked in my laboratory
  with the Rous Sarcoma Virus. When in 1958 polyoma virus, a new
  oncogenic virus with different properties, was isolated, I jumped
  at the new opportunity and started working with it. Within a
  short time polyoma virus became the main interest of my
  laboratory, to be joined, a few years later by SV<sub>40</sub>,
  another papovavirus. It became clear fairly soon that the
  molecular biology of these viruses could be worked out, and I set
  out to find the molecular basis of cancer induction. The results
  that I and a number of brilliant young collaborators have
  obtained during the following fifteen years have brought us close
  to that goal. I will review the most interesting steps of our
  work and will then ask some questions concerning the nature of
  cancer and about perspectives for prevention and treatment. I
  stress the relevance of my work for cancer research because I
  believe that science must be useful to man.</p>

  <p><b>Integration: The provirus</b><br>
  Let me start with a brief review of our work in the molecular
  events in transformation. The first results, crucial for future
  developments, showed that polyoma virus could be assayed in
  certain cell cultures (<a href="#footnote1">1</a>), which we call
  permissive, and could induce a cancer-like state in other
  cultures (<a href="#footnote2">2</a>, <a href="#footnote3">3</a>)
  in which the virus does not grow, which we call non-permissive.
  The induction of the cancer-like state in vitro was called
  transformation. We were able to show that the virus contains DNA
  (<a href="#footnote4">4</a>), and within a few years we gave the
  first evidence of its cyclic, or circular, shape (<a href=
  "#footnote5">5</a>), which is important for two critical
  biological events: DNA replication and integration. In
  integration, which we discovered a few years later with
  SV<sub>40</sub> (<a href="#footnote6">6</a>), the viral DNA
  becomes a provirus, i.e. it establishes permanent, covalent bonds
  with the cellular DNA. The cyclic configuration explains how a
  complete molecule of the SV<sub>40</sub> DNA can be integrated
  without losses.</p>

  <p>Integration is one of the key events in
  virus induced cell transformation. It explained the persistence
  of the transformed state in the cell clone deriving from a
  transformed cell, since the provirus replicates with the cellular
  DNA. It also permitted us to resolve one of the main questions
  about the role of viruses in transformation. It was known at the
  time that papova viruses leave their footprints in the cells of
  the cancers they induce and those they transform <i>in vitro</i>,
  in the form of characteristic antigens. However, it was not known
  whether the antigens were expressed by viral genes or by
  derepressed cellular genes. Hence, it was uncertain whether cells
  were transformed by the expression of viral genes persisting in
  the cells or alternatively if the virus altered the cells by a
  hit-and-run mechanism, changing the expression of cellular genes
  and then leaving. The demonstration that viral DNA is integrated
  in the cells in conjunction with the finding that the provirus is
  transcribed into messenger RNA (<a href="#footnote7">7</a>)
  hundreds of generations after the establishment of a transformed
  clone, made the hit-and-run hypothesis unlikely and supported a
  continuing role of viral gene functions in determining
  transformation. This possibility was later supported by
  observations with abortively transformed cells, which behave as
  transformed only for several generations after infection, but
  then return to normality (<a href="#footnote8">8</a>). When they
  are back to normal these cells no longer contain the viral DNA
  (<a href="#footnote9">9</a>).</p>

  <p>The viral genes that remain unexpressed in
  the transformed cells, such as those for capsid protein in
  SV<sub>40</sub>-transformed cells, were also interesting,
  although in a different way. In fact their expression could be
  renewed in hetero-karyons formed by fusing transformed cells with
  permissive cells (<a href="#footnote10">10</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote11">11</a>), a result that gave the first evidence that
  the viral functions are under the control of cellular functions.
  The provirus thus became a tool for studying regulation of DNA
  transcription in animal cells. Subsequently, the presence of
  giant RNAs containing viral sequences in the nucleus of
  transformed or lytically infected cells (<a href=
  "#footnote12">12</a>) raised the question of the initiation and
  termination signals for transcription in animal cells, as well as
  the question of processing of nuclear RNA precursors of messenger
  RNA, questions that are still largely unresolved.</p>

  <p><b>Viral functions in
  transformation</b><br>
  Efforts were in the meantime directed at identifying the viral
  genes transcribed in the transformed cells. It was established
  that in lytic infection with SV<sub>40</sub> the whole viral DNA
  is transcribed in two nearly equal parts, one early, before the
  inception of replication of the viral DNA, the other late after
  DNA replication has begun and that the early RNA is also present
  in transformed cells (<a href="#footnote7">7</a>). Subsequently,
  the early and the late messengers were found to be transcribed
  from different DNA strands (<a href="#footnote13">13</a>), an
  observation that facilitated the further characterization of the
  viral transcripts. Later work in other laboratories using
  specific fragments produced by restriction endonucleases
  confirmed and refined these findings; and the results were
  extended to adenoviruses by showing that a segment of the early
  part of that DNA is always present and transcribed in transformed
  cells (<a href="#footnote14">14</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote15">15</a>).</p>

  <p>These facts suggested that some early viral
  function is essential for maintaining the transformed state but
  they could also be interpreted differently: for instance,
  transformation might be caused by the mere presence of the viral
  DNA in the cellular DNA, the persistent viral functions being
  perhaps required for establishing and maintaining
  integration.</p>

  <p>Attempts were made to solve the dilemma by
  isolating temperature sensitive mutants affecting either
  initiation or maintenance of transformation. Many transformation
  mutants were found, all clustered in a segment of the early
  region of the viral DNA, designated as the A gene, but they were
  all initiation mutants (<a href="#footnote16">16</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote17">17</a>, <a href="#footnote18">18</a>). These
  mutations prevent the onset of transformation at high but not at
  low temperature, and cells transformed at low temperature remain
  transformed at high temperature. It was not possible to find
  clear cut maintenance mutants, i.e. mutations capable of causing
  a complete reversion of the phenotype when cells transformed at
  low temperature were shifted to high temperature: however,
  careful observation later showed that the initiation mutants are
  also partial maintenance mutants, since the cells they transform
  undergo a partial reversion of the phenotype at high temperature
  (<a href="#footnote19">19</a>, <a href="#footnote20">20</a>,
  <a href="#footnote21">21</a>). This result shows that the viral
  genes play a continuing role in transformation; however, the
  failure to obtain complete maintenance mutants suggests that the
  relation between viral gene expression and cell phenotype is
  complex.</p>

  <p><b>Search for the viral transforming
  protein</b><br>
  Further progress in this subject has been achieved by studying
  the proteins specified by the early region of the viral DNA. This
  work has centred around the so-called T antigen (<a href=
  "#footnote22">22</a>) present in the nucleus of cells infected or
  transformed by SV<sub>40</sub> and whose synthesis and properties
  are affected by mutations of the A gene (<a href=
  "#footnote23">23</a>, <a href="#footnote24">24</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote25">25</a>). In non-permissive transformed cells the
  antigen is a protein of molecular weight of about 94,000 daltons
  (<a href="#footnote26">26</a>), which binds firmly to
  double-stranded DNA, but without much specificity (<a href=
  "#footnote27">27</a>, <a href="#footnote28">28</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote29">29</a>). That the T antigen is specified by the
  viral DNA is strongly suggested by its in vitro synthesis using a
  wheat germ extract primed with various messengers (<a href=
  "#footnote30">30</a>), especially since the size of the product
  depends on the nature of the messenger. Thus, when the messenger
  was viral RNA made in vitro by transcribing SV<sub>40</sub> DNA
  with <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase, an antigenic protein of about
  62,000 daltons was synthesized; but when mRNA extracted from
  infected cells was used the protein synthesized was, like the T
  antigen of transformed cells, of about 94,000 daltons. The
  discrepancy of the two molecular weights makes it very unlikely
  that the T antigen is a cellular protein modified by a viral
  function, because two different proteins would have to be
  modified in the same extract depending on the messenger used. In
  contrast, the synthesis of a shorter polypeptide chain with the
  artificial messenger may be justified by the absence of accessory
  signals, such as cap, poly A, and possibly other modifications.
  Further definition of these findings awaits peptide maps of the
  various products.</p>

  <p>Since the early, transforming part of the
  SV<sub>40</sub> genome can specify proteins of a molecular weight
  of about 100,000 daltons altogether, the T antigen is likely to
  be its sole product and, therefore, to be the transforming
  protein. However, the same protein must also initiate viral DNA
  replication, which cannot initiate at high temperature in cells
  infected by mutants of the A gene. The different functions in
  transformation and lytic infections could be performed by
  different domains of the same protein, or could result from
  modifications (such as phosphorylation and glycosylation) or from
  processing. Processing of SV<sub>40</sub> T antigen seems to
  occur in lytically infected cells which contain a smaller T
  antigen of about 84,000 daltons; this smaller size contrasts with
  the regular size (94,000 daltons) of the antigen specified <i>in
  vitro</i> by mRNA extracted from the same cells (<a href=
  "#footnote26">26</a>). Whether the two forms of the antigen have
  different roles in transformation and DNA replication still
  remains to be established.</p>

  <p>Since the transforming protein should
  control both initiation and maintenance of transformation the
  partial reversion of the phenotype of cells transformed by A
  mutants when shifted to high temperature may be explained by a
  decreased requirement for the transforming protein once
  transformation has taken place, which in turn could result from a
  positive feedback stabilizing the transformed state. For
  instance, unstable protein monomers specified by the mutated gene
  might form self-stabilizing oligomers (<a href=
  "#footnote31">31</a>), or the transforming protein might generate
  changes that tend to favour the transformed state. An example of
  the latter model is the beta galactosidase induction in <i>E.
  coli</i> which is maintained by inducer concentrations much
  smaller than that required for initiating induction, because
  inducer is pumped into the cells by the induced permease
  (<a href="#footnote32">32</a>). I wonder whether a certain degree
  of self-stabilization of the state of gene expression is a
  general property of animal cells, which has developed for
  maintaining differentiation.</p>

  <p><b>Cellular events in
  transformation</b><br>
  I now wish to turn to cellular events participating in
  transformation, which will be the main problem after the
  remaining questions on the role of the virus have been answered.
  Among the cellular events are functional changes and mutations.
  Some functional changes, which affect many cellular properties,
  are associated with the shift of resting cells to growing state
  after infection with polyoma virus or SV<sub>40</sub> (<a href=
  "#footnote33">33</a>, <a href="#footnote34">34</a>); other
  changes observed in transformed and in cancer cells in general
  consist of the re-expression of cellular genes normally expressed
  in a preceding state of differentiation, in foetal life (<a href=
  "#footnote35">35</a>). These functional changes might be caused
  by the binding of transforming proteins to DNA; if so they may be
  mediated by an alteration of transcription of the cellular DNA.
  However, we do not know whether the transcription pattern changes
  because experiments based on competition hybridization have given
  ambiguous results. Perhaps the methodology is not good enough.
  Cloning of cellular DNA fragments in phages or plasmids may
  afford the necessary probes for carrying out significant
  experiments.</p>

  <p>In order to understand further how the
  virus deregulates cellular growth we would need a detailed
  knowledge of the mechanisms of growth regulation in animal cells,
  which is now lacking. However, certain useful ideas about growth
  regulation are now available and can be used to draw inferences
  on the action of the virus. Thus, it seems clear that with a
  given cell type growth regulation involves a complex chain of
  events, beginning with extracellular regulators of many kinds,
  probably interacting with the cell plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic
  mediators then appear to transmit regulatory signals from the
  plasma membrane to the nucleus, where they perhaps control
  DNA-binding proteins similar to the transforming protein of
  papova viruses. The complexity of growth regulation increases
  markedly when different cell types are considered, since they
  seem to recognize different sets of extracellular regulators and
  may have different mediators and DNA binding proteins.</p>

  <p>Proceeding from this general picture it
  would be tempting to propose that the viral transforming protein
  replaces one of the normal nuclear regulatory proteins of the
  cell, and being unaffected by the mediators that control the
  normal protein, keeps growth related transcription going,
  bypassing the signals of the plasma membrane. If so, however, the
  transformed state should be dominant over the normal state in
  cell hybrids, whereas the contrary is usually true (<a href=
  "#footnote36">36</a>). On the other hand, the dominance of the
  normal state could be explained if the transformed cells had a
  changed surface, unable to respond to regulatory signals. Such a
  change could result from the re-expression of foetal functions to
  make the transformed cells anachronistic, i. e. belonging to a
  stage of differentiation inappropriate to that of the organism
  which contains them. The cells with an anachronistic surface
  being insensitive to the growth regulators present in the adult
  organisms, which operate on adult cells, would grow without
  control. A striking support of the role of cell anachronism in
  cancer has been obtained with teratoma, a tumour originating when
  cells from an early embryo are transplanted to an adult
  environment. When, after many transplants cells of this tumour
  are introduced back into a blastocyst, i.e. an early embryo, they
  return to normality (<a href="#footnote37">37</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote38">38</a>), presumably because the internal growth
  control of the cells becomes again matched by the environmental
  regulators of the recipient embryo. In this model a hybrid cell
  formed by fusing a transformed and a normal cell may be
  untransformed, if the normal partner contributes normal surface
  components which respond to the normal extracellular regulators.
  For this result to be possible, anachronistic transcription
  should not be initiated after cell fusion on the DNA deriving
  from the normal parent. The virological studies suggest that this
  may well be the case, since the initiation of transformation
  seems to require much more transforming protein than its
  maintenance.</p>

  <p>It would be important to recognize the
  developmental period during which the anachronistic genes of
  transformed or cancer cells are normally expressed, not only for
  understanding but possibly also for controlling cancer. In fact,
  if the growth regulators specific for the periods expressed in
  cancer cells could be identified they could be used for halting
  the growth of the cancer cells.</p>

  <p><b>Role of cellular mutations</b><br>
  I will now consider the other cellular events important in viral
  transformation, i. e. cellular mutations. Several results suggest
  that cellular mutations may be needed for obtaining the full
  state of transformation with papova viruses. Thus, after
  infection primary cultures generate clones with various degree of
  transformation, some of which appear to undergo full
  transformation in steps (<a href="#footnote39">39</a>) which may
  correspond to the occurrence of cellular mutations. Cells that
  achieve full transformation immediately, as are common with
  permanent lines, may have already undergone similar mutations
  before infection. Some cellular mutations occurring in transformed
  cells may even be virus-induced, because in the early stages of
  transformation by papova viruses cells of primary cultures have
  frequent chromatid breaks (<a href="#footnote39">39</a>).
  Conversely, cells fully transformed by SV<sub>40</sub> can revert
  to a relatively normal phenotype although they still contain
  normal viral DNA and T antigen (<a href="#footnote40">40</a>,
  <a href="#footnote41">41</a>). It is conceivable that these
  mutations are reversions of mutations of the former kind, which
  enhance the transformed state of the cells. Stepwise
  transformation may not only occur with viruses. Thus, I have
  observed it in primary cultures exposed to a chemical carcinogen.
  In this experiment fully transformed cells evolved from the
  normal cells, which have limited life, generating first cells
  with unlimited life but unable to form colonies in agar, then
  cells with progressively increasing colony forming efficiency in
  agar, to finally reach 100% efficiency.</p>

  <p>All these observations show the important
  role of cellular mutations in cell transformation induced by
  different agents. This conclusion is reinforced and generalised
  by additional findings, such as 1) the experimental enhancement
  of the transforming activity of viruses by mutagenic agents
  (<a href="#footnote42">42</a>), (<a href="#footnote2">2</a> by
  the elevated cancer frequency in some genetic diseases, and
  <a href="#footnote3">3</a>) by the evidence that most carcinogens
  are promutagens, i.e. generate mutagenic substances when acted
  upon by normal metabolism (<a href="#footnote43">43</a>). Most of
  the carcinogens themselves must be activated by metabolism in a
  similar way in order to induce cancer.</p>

  <p><b>Prospects for cancer
  prevention</b><br>
  I will now turn to some general deductions concerning the
  etiology and possible prevention of human cancer, which derive
  from the various points I have discussed so far. One deduction,
  deriving from the persistence of the viral DNA in the cells is
  that we can test whether a given DNA virus is a possible agent of
  human cancer by looking for its DNA in the cancer cells. I think
  that much more extensive surveys than those carried out so far
  are warranted, but they should have a sensitivity sufficient to
  detect fragments of viral DNA of about one million daltons, which
  is within the reach of modern technology, even with the most
  difficult viruses. A positive finding would be significant
  because DNA viruses do not appear to exist in widespread
  endogenous forms.</p>

  <p>Another deduction is that somatic mutations
  are one of the fundamental ingredients of cancer although they
  appear to require the occurrence of several other events not yet
  understood. The role of mutations in turn suggest that the
  incidence of cancer in man could be reduced by identifying as
  many promutagens as possible, and by eliminating them from the
  environment. One important feature of this approach to cancer
  prevention is that it can be started now, since these substances
  can be identified with simple bacterial tests suitable for mass
  screening (<a href="#footnote44">44</a>). The feasibility of
  prevention is shown by the fact that the promutagens already
  identified in a preliminary screening, such as tobacco or some
  hair dyes, are inessential for human life (<a href=
  "#footnote45">45</a>, <a href="#footnote46">46</a>).</p>

  <p>However, it is practically difficult to
  achieve a substantial reduction of the use of these substances,
  as shown by the example of tobacco. According to epidemiological
  evidence tobacco smoke is the agent of lung cancer in man, which
  in Britain is responsible for one in eight of all male deaths
  (<a href="#footnote47">47</a>). Yet only mild sanctions have been
  imposed on tobacco products, such as a vague health warning on
  cigarette packets, which sounds rather like an official
  endorsement. Any limitation on the use of tobacco is left to the
  individual, although it is clear that the individual cannot
  easily exercise voluntary restraint in the face of very effective
  advertisements, especially as he does not usually appreciate the
  danger of a cumulative action over a long period of time.</p>

  <p>The lax attitude of governments towards
  tobacco probably also derives from the difficulty of appreciating
  epidemiological evidence, especially since this evidence is
  contradicted from time to time by single-minded individuals who
  use incomplete or even erroneous analyses of the data, and whose
  views are magnified out of all proportion by the media. However,
  the recent recognition that tobacco smoke contains promutagens
  contributes direct experimental evidence on the dangers of
  tobacco smoke, on which there cannot be any equivocation. I,
  therefore, call on governments to act towards severely
  discouraging tobacco consumption; and to act now because it will
  be at least thirty years before their action has its full
  effect.</p>

  <p>Although tobacco smoke is a striking
  example of an environmental carcinogen, many others are known and
  probably many more remain to be identified. Identification by
  conventional tests is difficult because they are costly and
  laborious; but they can now be replaced by the bacterial tests
  for promutagens. Since the tests are easy and inexpensive it
  should be possible to investigate many normal constituents of the
  environment, and every new compound before it is offered to the
  public. The feasibility of such a programme is borne out by the
  finding that most of the commonly available substances are not
  promutagens (<a href="#footnote45">45</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote46">46</a>). Given the strong correlation between
  mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (<a href="#footnote43">43</a>),
  any promutagen is suspect and, if all possible, should be
  withdrawn.</p>

  <p>In fact, this is precisely the attitude
  that scientists have taken for them-selves concerning the
  experiments in genetic engineering, which carry the theoretical
  possibility of creating new virus-like molecules, endowed with
  carcinogenic activity. Although the danger is only hypothetical,
  experiments which might be very useful for science and society
  have been postponed until they can be carried out under the
  strictest safeguards (<a href="#footnote48">48</a>). Governments
  have accepted this position and are eager to impose severe
  restrictions on the performance of these experiments. While I
  fully approve of their concern, I cannot help noticing that they
  follow a double standard; if there is any doubt - you must
  discourage experiments, but if there is any doubt - you cannot
  discourage cigarettes.</p>

  <p><b>Biologists and society</b><br>
  This discussion about cancer prevention is a development of the
  experimental results obtained in the field of oncogenic viruses,
  but it is also strongly influenced by the new social conscience
  of many scientists. Historically, science and society have gone
  separate ways, although society has provided the funds for
  science to grow and in return science has given society all the
  material things it enjoys. In recent years, however, the
  separation between science and society has become excessive, and
  the consequences are felt especially by biologists. Thus, while
  we spend our life asking questions about the nature of cancer and
  ways to prevent or cure it, society merrily produces oncogenic
  substances and permeates the environment with them. Society does
  not seem prepared to accept the sacrifices required for an
  effective prevention of cancer. The situation is clearly
  unacceptable, and we biologists would like to see it corrected.
  We have ourselves begun to put our house in order, by banning
  some experiments that may contain a risk for mankind. We would
  like to see society take a similar attitude, abandoning selfish
  practices that are dangerous for society itself. We would also
  like to see a new co-operation of science and society for the
  benefit of all mankind and hope that the dominant forces in
  society will recognize that this is a necessity.</p>
