  <h1>Vitaly L. Ginzburg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ginzburg.jpg" class="bio-img">Apart 
                from several monographs on physics and astrophysics, I have published 
                two books which are collections of various articles of scientific, 
                semi-scientific and general, social and political character<sup><a href="#not1">1</a></sup>. 
                Some of these articles contain rather much biographical material. 
                So I do not have any wish to come back to my autobiography. However, 
                it is the wish of the Nobel Foundation that the Nobel Prize winners, 
                together with the lecture, wrote their autobiography. I respect 
                the wishes of the Foundation, so I am writing. Of course, I could 
                confine myself to brief biographical information, while writing 
                a detailed autobiography is rather dangerous - it can bring reproach 
                for "exhibitionism" and immodesty. Nevertheless, I have decided 
                to write in a rather detailed and frank way, as it corresponds 
                to my habits and tastes. One more reason to justify this decision 
                is that I am already 87 and will hardly ever have another occasion 
                to write about myself and my views.</p>
              <p>1. I was born in Moscow, on 4th October,
                1916,  that is, as far back as in the tsarist Russia (at that
                time even  the calendar was different, so the date of my birth
                was 21st September).  My father, Lazar' Efimovich Ginzburg, almost
                half of his life  lived in the 19th century, he was born in 1863,
                that is only two  years after the abolition of serfdom in Russia.
                Having graduated  from Riga Polytechnic, he was an engineer engaged
                in purification  of water and had a number of patents. My mother,
                Avgusta Veniaminovna  Vil'dauer-Ginzburg, was a doctor, she was
                born, in 1886, in Mitava  (Latvia). I was the only child in the
                family. Mother died of typhoid  in 1920, I only remember one
                episode at her bedside and her funeral.  Mother's younger sister,
                Rosa, who started to live with us, did  everything she could
                for me. She died in 1948. Father had died  still earlier (in
                1942), when we were living in Kazan', where  we had been evacuated.
                Below I will tell about this period in  a more detailed way.
                And here I will only note that, as is well  known, life in Russia
                during World War I, and especially during  the period of military
                communism, and later in the Soviet Union  was hard, in many cases
                even very hard. But in Moscow, where we  lived all the time,
                with the exception of about two years (1941-1943)  spent in Kazan',
                material conditions were better than in the majority  of other
                regions of the country. However, one of my childhood  memories
                is a wagon loaded with half-covered coffins with dead  bodies
                and pulled by a horse past our house in the center of Moscow.
                 Another memory is of buying fresh meat "for the kid", which
                 turned  out to be the meat of a dog. Normally dogs had never
                 been eaten  in Central Russia. However, in general we did not
                 starve, but  we lived in a so-called communal apartment - into
                 my father's  four-room apartment two more families had been
                 placed after the  revolution. Still, it is not these hardships,
                 more or less general,  but my loneliness that really sticks
                 in my mind. It was exacerbated  by my being sent to school only
                 at the age of 11 (in 1927 I entered  the 4th form). My parents
                 (or, to be more exact, father and aunt)  must have been afraid
                 that school at the Soviet times had become  quite bad, and sending
                 children to school was not obligatory.  I am not acquainted
                 with the general state of education in the  USSR in the twenties.
                 But school No. 57 belonging to the Sokol'niki  district department
                 of education, which I entered, does not seem  bad to me. It
                 was a former French grammar school, with many good  old teachers
                 still working there. True, as far as I remember,  history was
                 practically not taught, being substituted with rendering  the
                 contents of some reports of comrade Stalin and, it seems,  some
                 other material like that. What was really bad came later.  In
                 1931, just at the time when I finished the 7th form, yet another
                  school reform happened, and the full high school (I do not
                 remember  whether it had 9 or 10 forms) was abolished. After
                 the 7th form  pupils were to enter vocational schools (FZU),
                 which were supposed  to train skilled factory workers. After
                 a FZU one could, in principle,  enter directly higher educational
                 establishments (VUZes), including  universities - through "rabfaks",
                 that is worker preparatory departments.  I am putting it somewhat
                 vaguely, because, not at all willing  to enter a FZU, I did
                 not follow this way. So for a while I, then  a boy of 15, remained
                 rather lost and unhappy. My aunt, already  mentioned, was working
                 in an organization dealing with purchases  of foreign scientific
                 literature. One of their customers was Evgeni  Bakhmet'ev, a
                 professor of a technical VUZ. He was a very picturesque  figure
                 - a former submarine sailor, a Bolshevik, who became a  specialist
                 in the field of X-ray structure analysis. His fate,  like the
                 fates of many other people of such kind, was tragic -  later
                 he died, crushed by the millstones of Stalin's terror.  But
                 in 1931 he helped me to get a job of a laboratory assistant
                  in the X-ray laboratory of the technical VUZ where he was teaching.
                  I will not go into details. I will confine myself to saying
                 that  the key figure in the laboratory was Veniamin (Venya)
                 Tsukerman,  quite a young man (only three years older than me)
                 with truly  uncommon inventiveness and initiative. With him
                 and his school  friend and peer, Lev Al'tshuler, we communicated
                 and worked together  for about two years. Both Tsukerman and
                 Al'tshuler became physicists,  from 1946 they were very close
                 to their superior, Y.B. Khariton,  who headed the main center
                 where the atomic and hydrogen bombs  were created (now it is
                 the town of Sarov, as this place was called  as far back as
                 in the tsarist time; after a nuclear center was  created there
                 it was called by some code name, which I have already  forgotten,
                 and later its name was Arzamas-16). Tsukerman and Al'tshuler
                  have a lot of awards, and, the main thing, many works of theirs
                   are already declassified and well-known. Both of them are
                  people  with interesting fates, in part already described in
                  literature.  Giving a more detailed description here is evidently
                  impossible  (I will only say that Tsukerman died in 1993, and
                  on 9th November,  2003 we celebrated Al'tshuler's 90th birth
                  anniversary).</p>

                    Efimovich Ginzburg and Avgusta Veniaminovna Vil&#8217;dauer-Ginzburg. 
                  
                
      </p>
              <p>What I acquired at the laboratory is not so 
                much some concrete knowledge as the taste for work, for physics, 
                for inventiveness. I also remember reading, with interest, the 
                book by O.D. Khvol'son "Fizika Nashikh Dnei" (The Physics of Our 
                Days) - a popular writing about the achievements of physics, a 
                rare book for that time. Anyway, I decided to become a physicist, 
                especially as I did not have any talents, but in physics I was 
                at least interested. So I decided to enter the physical department 
                of the Moscow State University (MGU). Just at that time, from 
                1933, it became possible to enter the MGU by open competition 
                (previously for several years the entrance procedure was somehow 
                different - for instance, through rabfaks or in some other way, 
                but certainly not by competition). But for entering the University 
                it was necessary to have finished the complete high school course, 
                while I had finished only 7 forms. So I had to learn in three 
                months (partly with a tutor) what had to be learned in the senior 
                forms. I am going into these details because all my life I have 
                wished I had got a normal school education. And I want to warn 
                those who think that school wisdom is not worth spending many 
                years on it. Indeed, though having, as I am convinced, merely 
                average abilities, I managed to do in three months the program 
                of three school years. But at what cost? The cost is, first of 
                all, a total lack of automatism in elementary mathematics and 
                in the orthography even of the Russian language. Specifically, 
                at school I would have solved, for instance, 100 problems in algebra, 
                trigonometry, etc., while on my own I solved only about 10. Why 
                solve more if it is not demanded? Such things lead to lack of 
                skills in the further learning of mathematics. The same with orthography. 
                Illiteracy "in the people" was at that time being combated, though, 
                and, as far as I know, there were some good results in this field. 
                But at the higher level things were much worse. Suffice to say 
                that already at the second year at the university we had a check 
                (a dictation) in Russian, and half of the students of the year 
                (!), me including, got unsatisfactory marks. After that an obligatory 
                course of Russian was introduced for those who had failed this 
                exam. I doubt that it gave any noticeable benefit - making up 
                for what has been missed in childhood is very difficult. Neither 
                do I know foreign languages, although later I had to master English, 
                but only in the limits necessary for my doing physics. I hope 
                that the given information is not superfluous, both in terms of 
                understanding the life in the USSR in the years described and 
                in terms of my biography.</p>
              <p>I did not fail any of the entrance exams at 
                the MGU, in 1933, but on the whole I did not make out brilliantly. 
                As a result, I was not admitted, although admitted were some people 
                with slightly lower marks but more advantageous personal particulars 
                (I was neither a member of the Young Communist League nor a worker, 
                and my parents also were not proletarians, and so on). But still 
                this result was not discrimination or a sign of anti-Semitism, 
                which flourished after the war. Some of my comrades who were not 
                admitted either decided to wait for a year, but I had already 
                left work and had somehow become keen on studying. That is why 
                I entered the external department, which proved possible. And 
                here again I painfully felt my sore spot. In 1934 I managed to 
                get transferred to the internal department, to the second year, 
                that is, I caught up with my fellow students and started to study 
                like everybody. But I learned how much richer and brighter their 
                life was, with all sorts of optional courses and so on. Not to 
                mention that, strangely, I never got acquainted with the courses 
                of astronomy and chemistry, which I did not have to do at the 
                external department and somehow was not obliged to sit when being 
                transferred to the internal department.</p>
              <p>I want to finish the story of the first stage 
                of my life by mentioning just one of many episodes which show 
                that man's fate is merely a chain of chances and it is like a 
                pathetic little boat in the sea waves, which may capsize at any 
                moment. What I mean here is the following. At the second year 
                at the MGU all students were enrolled in groups of two types, 
                military and civil. Only men were placed in military groups, where 
                they were trained and qualified as military officers. So, when 
                being transferred to the internal department I was sent to a military 
                hospital in order to decide where I should be placed. I was rather 
                not athletic (height 180 cm, weight about 60 kilograms). A military 
                doctor, who seemed an elderly man to me, poked his finger at my 
                neck, uttered the diagnosis "struma" and sent me to a civil group. 
                Struma is some swelling of the thyroid gland, which I have not 
                noticed up to now. I am telling about that because practically 
                all my fellow students who got into military groups were killed 
                at the war. To finish with this unpleasant topic, I shall note 
                that there were three more similar episodes. I cannot say that 
                I was bursting to go to the front but I was not in the least trying 
                to avoid it. Telling about all incidents would be too long, so 
                I shall limit myself to only one. In 1941, after the beginning 
                of the war (for the USSR it began on 22nd June, 1941) the Lebedev 
                Physical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences (FIAN), where 
                I was working at the time (and were I have been working up till 
                now), was evacuated to Kazan' together with the greater part of 
                the Academy of Sciences. And, what was quite natural for the war 
                time, at least in our country, the workers of the Institute were 
                used for different works. So once we were sent to unload barges 
                with logs or firewood on the Volga. By the way, everybody took 
                part in that, for instance, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1958/index.html">I.E. 
                Tamm</a>, also mentioned in my Nobel Lecture. My task was bringing 
                logs from the barge to the bank. I was wearing the so-called "koza" 
                (which means "a goat") - something like a rucksack with a step 
                at the rear. Such "kozas" were widely used in Russia at one time 
                for carrying heavy weights, and they are effective indeed. Two 
                men put a log on a "koza" and the one who was wearing it carried 
                the log to the bank. I am still surprised what heavy logs can 
                be carried in such a way. But still I must have overstrained myself 
                and on the next day I had bleeding at the throat, though not profuse. 
                Some small blood vessel must have burst. I was sent to hospital, 
                where some petrified spots were found in my lungs. The bleeding 
                stopped, and, like the struma, it did not show itself anymore. 
                At the same time voluntary enlistment into some airborne landing 
                forces was announced and I, then a YCL member, enlisted. But I 
                was not admitted, although I had not mentioned any illnesses and, 
                if I remember correctly, even did not know that I was on the medical 
                books. By the way, I can say that I was not officially exempted 
                from military service - at least, in the first years of the war. 
                But there was some order not to mobilize untrained graduates of 
                some professions or some specialists in general. I was never conscripted, 
                but, expecting to be conscripted all the time, I was trying to 
                write my thesis as soon as possible. In peace time I would not 
                have hurried to do it, but then I wanted, though it looks a bit 
                silly, to be able to finish before the draft what had been started. 
                So I defended this thesis in the spring of 1942 (it was the D.Sc. 
                thesis, as the Ph.D. one I had defended in 1940).</p>
              <p>The life in Kazan' was hard, the four of us 
                (my father, my aunt, my wife and I, as my daughter with her grandmother 
                had been evacuated to another place) lived in one room. We felt 
                rather cold and rather hungry. But I worked a lot, as did all 
                my fellow workers. I was exploring the propagation of radio waves 
                in the atmosphere and something else which seemed useful for the 
                defense. I also tackled some other problems, as the scientific 
                life was going on.</p>
              <p>2. However, let me come back to the student 
                days. Starting from the second year, I did well in my study and, 
                so to say, enjoyed studying. I liked theoretical physics, but 
                I thought, and still think, that my ability for mathematics is 
                average, at most; besides, I had difficulties solving problems 
                and making calculations (see above) - while it was considered, 
                and rather justly, that a theoretical physicist should be good 
                at mathematics. In short, because of all that, when at the end 
                of the third year or at the beginning of the fourth year (now 
                I do not remember when it was) I had to choose my specialization, 
                I did not dare to take up theoretical physics and chose optics. 
                The choice was not accidental. At the MGU physical department 
                at that time there were rather many really good specialists, but 
                there were some retrogrades as well. They were struggling with 
                each other, and this struggle had a political coloring. Just a 
                beginner at that time, I was far from their controversy. I remember 
                only one public debate between the partisans of the contemporary 
                physics and the so-called "mechanicists", who criticized the theory 
                of relativity and so on. It took place in 1935 or maybe the first 
                half of 1936. I do not remember the date and I did not try to 
                find it out, having a sad possibility to say something in this 
                respect, as I know the fate of B. Gessen - a participant of this 
                dispute, a physicist and a philosopher, who was the dean of the 
                physical department at one time. He was also an old Bolshevik 
                (so they called those who joined the party whether before October 
                1917 or shortly after) and shared the lot of the majority of his 
                comrades - arrested on 21st August, 1936 and sentenced to be shot 
                on 20th December, 1936, at the private meeting of the Military 
                Board of the Supreme Court. The sentence was carried out on the 
                same day. Of course, he was posthumously rehabilitated in view 
                of a complete "absence of <i>corpus delicti</i>" - let it be a 
                consolation for the representatives of "progressive, leftist intelligentsia" 
                defending today, because of their much talked about "political 
                correctness", dictators, terrorists and hooligans.</p>
              <p>Returning to the subject, I can say that, 
                despite a complete absence of any personal connections or acquaintances, 
                I understood from the very beginning, putting it in the words 
                from a popular Russian children's poem, "what is good and what 
                is bad". In short, I decided to specialize in optics because the 
                chair of optics was headed by G.S. Landsberg, one of the people 
                grouping around the remarkable person and physicist, Leonid Mandel'shtam. 
                The associate professor of this chair, Saul Levi, was, luckily, 
                appointed my tutor. I remember him with a warm feeling. I write 
                about him and my relationship with him in the article "Notes of 
                an Amateur Astrophysicist"<sup><a href="#not2">2</a></sup>. There 
                is also some material repeated above and further on. Maybe it 
                would be more convenient for the readers if everything was repeated 
                here, but I have decided not to do it, for this autobiography 
                is becoming very long as it is. But still I shall tell how I left 
                optics and experiment in general and became a theoretical physicist. 
                When I was waiting, in September 1938, to be conscripted (as a 
                matter of fact, I had already been conscripted and was waiting 
                to be summoned to come with my things to the district military 
                committee), which I again avoided, one can say, as luck would 
                have it (it was the last time when the MGU post-graduates were 
                granted a conscription deferment), I did not want to sit in the 
                room without windows and with the walls painted black, where I 
                was trying to measure the spectrum of radiation of canal rays. 
                So I made an attempt to explain the effect we were looking for, 
                notably some asymmetry in the radiation of the mentioned canal 
                rays. Notably, I thought that the electro-magnetic field of moving 
                charges could cause induced radiation. Such an assumption was 
                erroneous, as the field of a charge is not equivalent to free 
                (light) field. But I did not understand it at once and turned 
                with the corresponding question to I. Tamm, who at that time was 
                heading the chair of theoretical physics at the MGU and reading 
                lectures to us. Fortunately, I. Tamm also did not notice at once 
                that my idea was erroneous, he listened to me in a very friendly 
                manner, advised to look something up and in general supported 
                me. The latter was so important for me, suffering from the inferiority 
                complex and not at all sure of my ability to obtain any theoretical 
                results. I write about it in more detail in the article "A Scientific 
                Autobiography - an Attempt" published in book I. In short, it 
                turned out that I managed, without any complicated mathematics, 
                to sort out some problems of quantum electrodynamics. Specifically, 
                such an undoubtedly highly knowledgeable theoretical physicist, 
                and mathematically minded at that, as V. Fock, when doing quantum 
                calculations had come to the conclusion that an electron uniformly 
                moving radiates electromagnetic waves. This conclusion surprises, 
                as we in the classical theory are used to thinking that a uniformly 
                moving charge (electron) does not radiate. But the thing was merely 
                in formulating the problem in a different way: in the classical 
                case it is usually a stationary problem, while the quantum calculation 
                had been done with the inclusion of quantum interaction at a certain 
                instant of time <i>t</i> = 0. But the latter is equivalent to 
                the fact that when <i>t</i> < 0 there is an electron without the 
                field it entrains, while at <i>t</i> = 0 it acquires a velocity 
                <i>v</i> and starts to interact with the field. Physically this 
                is equivalent to the assumption that the electron at the moment 
                <i>t</i> = 0 is instantly accelerated to a velocity <i>v</i>. 
                It is clear that this process is accompanied by radiation. In 
                general, using the so-called Hamiltonian method I managed to elucidate 
                some questions and solve a number of electrodynamic problems both 
                in vacuum and in the movement of charges in a medium, for example, 
                the problem of the Vavilov-<a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1958/index.html">Cherenkov</a> 
                radiation in the passage of charges through crystals. Here I did 
                not have to use any complicated mathematics. Of course, I found 
                what had long been known - however close are physics and mathematics 
                their connection can be most different, in particular, it is possible 
                to make progress in theoretical physics using but a very modest 
                mathematical apparatus, for instance, not exceeding the limits 
                of what is taught at physical departments of universities. By 
                contrast, in some cases theoretical physicists both use most complicated 
                modern mathematics and develop it.</p>

      </p>
              <p>So I realized that I could work, achieve results, 
                think up new possibilities. Such awareness brings a great joy, 
                it is happiness. And I worked a great deal, I wrote a thesis (which 
                is a candidate thesis with us and a Ph.D. according to the western 
                standards) practically in a year and defended it in 1940. Thus 
                I finished the post-graduate course at the MGU physical department 
                in two such kind. After that they wanted to leave me, in some 
                capacity, at the MGU Institute of Physics, but the atmosphere 
                there was bad and, most fortunately, on 1st September, 1940 I 
                was taken to the FIAN as a person working for the degree of doctor 
                (such a person has to already have the first scientific degree, 
                Ph.D., and is to prepare, officially in three years, the second 
                thesis for which the D.Sc. is given). I had been doing my postgraduate 
                studies under the guidance of G. Landsberg, as I had been supposed 
                to take up optics. But he quite nobly had not hindered me from 
                doing something quite different. And I. Tamm, who was considered 
                to be my tutor in my doctor work, also did not hamper my doing 
                what I wanted. In general such is the style characteristic of 
                theoretical physicists of the USSR and Russia, at any rate, in 
                many places and undoubtedly at the FIAN.</p>

      </p>
              <p>Thus I have been doing theoretical physics
                 since 1938, and I have done many dozens of research works on
                different  physical and astrophysical subjects. As for articles,
                I have already  written hundreds of them, because for me writing
                is fairly easy  and writing articles is an integral part of my
                work. Some colleagues  condemned and may still be condemning
                me for writing such a great  number of articles. And indeed,
                there are people who write articles  in order to increase the
                number of references to their works.  But I, believe me, have
                never been guided by such considerations,  besides, I have got
                very many references as it is. For instance, I have recently
                seen in a certain reference book that after 1985  there have
                been 8,962 references to my articles, in spite of the  fact that
                the article which we wrote together with <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1962/index.html">Landau</a> 
                and which was published, in 1950, only in Russian, is almost
                always  mentioned without placing the reference in the list of
                literature;  the same source informs that after 1945 there have
                been 19,519  references to my articles. I began to publish them
                in 1939. By  the way, Landau judged, though not very seriously,
                the age of  physicists by the time when their first publication
                appeared.  For instance, he said that I was 13 years younger
                than him, because  his first article appeared in 1926; whereas
                he was born in 1908,  therefore by calendar years I am only 8
                years younger. I think  that it is not worth attaching too much
                importance to the number  of references, sometimes it is quite
                deceptive, especially if  people refer to some sensational assertion
                which may prove to  be wrong. The number of publications may
                be slightly more reliable  in this respect, but it characterizes
                the style of working rather  than its quality - because it is
                clear that one publication containing  an important result is
                more substantial than a great number of  articles with less important
                results. Here I will not write about  the content of my works,
                as I can refer the readers to the article 
                "A Scientific Autobiography - an Attempt" published in book I.
                 Let others judge the quality of these works, although below
                I  shall make one remark in this respect.</p>

				  great-grand-children (twins) Grigori and Elizaveta.
                
      </p>
              <p>3. Now I must come back to my biography. In 
                1937 I married my fellow student, Olga Zamsha. In 1946 we divorced. 
                We have one daughter, Irina Dorman, born in 1939; she graduated 
                from the Physics Department of the Moscow State University, defended 
                her Ph.D. thesis, and was occupied with the history of physics. 
                Her husband Lev Dorman is a D.Sc., a specialist in the area of 
                cosmic rays. They have two daughters, Maria Dorman and Viktoria 
                Dorman. The former is not married and lives in Israel. Viktoria 
                has got a Ph.D. in physics in Princeton, she is married to M. 
                Petrov, also a physicist, they have twins, Grigory and Elizaveta, 
                who are now already three years old. So they are my great-grand-son 
                and great-grand-daughter. They live in Princeton, USA. In 1946 
                I married the second time, to Nina Ermakova, who became Nina Ginzburg. 
                Thus we have been together already for 57 years. Unfortunately, 
                we have no children. As this is not quite an ordinary marriage, 
                at least for the Soviet Union, I have written rather much about 
                it in a number of articles published in book II. The thing is 
                that Nina's father, a prominent engineer, was arrested as far 
                back as before the war and died of starvation, in 1942, in a prison 
                of the city of Saratov. It seems that he died in the same cell 
                and almost at the same time as the renowned biologist N.I. Vavilov. 
                And Nina was arrested in 1944 as a member of a group of young 
                people allegedly going to kill comrade Stalin himself. Of course, 
                it was merely an invention of the KGB, but I am writing about 
                it here, especially as a warning to contemporary "revolutionaries" 
                and terrorists, so they could foresee their fate in case of their 
                victory. Under a totalitarian regime the punitive organs deal 
                out justice arbitrarily, and innocent people suffer. Quite often 
                a regular theatre of the absurd adds to that. In Nina's case, 
                she suffered, according to the KGB's scenario, mainly because 
                she lived on Arbat, the street where the great leader sometimes 
                drove by. It was from the window of her flat that he was to be 
                shot at. But the valorous fighters against counter-revolutionaries 
                had not taken the trouble to learn that after the head of the 
                family had been arrested only one room in their apartment had 
                been left to Nina and her mother, with the windows overlooking 
                the yard. The clearing up of this circumstance, which happened 
                already after the arrest and ruled out the charge with terrorism, 
                and also some other circumstances resulted in the sentence surprisingly 
                lenient for that time - "only" three years in camps. And if her 
                room had overlooked Arbat, we would probably have never met. In 
                1945, Nina was released by an amnesty, but without the right to 
                live in Moscow and in a number of other cities. Her aunt lived 
                in the city of Nizhni Novgorod (then Gorki), so she went there, 
                in fact, into exile, especially as in Gorki itself she had no 
                right to live as well and was officially registered in the village 
                of Bor, on the opposite bank of the Volga<sup><a href="#not3">3</a></sup>.</p>

      </p>
              <p>In 1945 I was invited by a group of physicists 
                headed by Alexander Andronov and working at Gorki University to 
                become a visiting professor at the newly organized radiophysical 
                department of this university. I was 29 and full of energy, but 
                in Moscow I did not have any place to teach (I. Tamm and many 
                others had been actually banished from the MGU by that time). 
                During the war I had worked, among other things, on the propagation 
                of radio waves in the ionosphere. So the invitation to head the 
                chair of propagation and radiation of radio waves was quite natural, 
                and I accepted it. I first came to Gorki at the end of 1945, it 
                was then that I met Nina, and in the summer of 1946 we got married. 
                Of course, I was permanently putting in applications to the KGB 
                (to be more exact, it could be done once a year) with the request 
                to permit my wife to return to Moscow and live where she was born 
                and where her mother lived. But all the time I was refused, despite 
                the fact that my applications were also signed by the directors 
                of our institute, at first by S.I. Vavilov and then by D.V. Skobel'tsyn. 
                I have written about it in a rather detailed way in "A Story of 
                Two Directors" published in book I. My wife managed to move to 
                Moscow only in1953, after Stalin's death and the amnesty that 
                followed. It goes without saying that later (in 1956) she was 
                rehabilitated, like all the members of the imaginary counter-revolutionary 
                group - "owing to the absence of <i>corpus delicti</i>". Unfortunately, 
                not all of them lived to see this moment, not to mention the long 
                years of imprisonment for some of those who did.</p>
              <p>In 1942 I joined the communist party (CPSU). 
                It was just when the Germans reached the Volga, and our view of 
                the future was far from optimistic. Thus I can hardly be suspected 
                of any careerist considerations, not to mention the fact that 
                I certainly hated the Nazis and all the faults of the communist 
                rule were then receding. At the same time, I cannot help saying, 
                with great regret and bitterness, that for many years I was virtually 
                blind in my estimation of communism and Bolshevism. In general, 
                I believed in "a radiant communist future", not understanding 
                that here we had, in fact, a regime of a Nazi type, headed by 
                a criminal no less mean and bloodthirsty than Hitler. Having written 
                the previous phrase I remembered the observation of <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/index.html">Churchill</a> 
                that Stalin and Hitler differed only in the shape of their mustache. 
                Anyway, I was sharing the lot of millions of people who did not 
                understand the inevitable fate of the totalitarian regime sliding 
                to lawlessness and terror. I have written a lot on this subject 
                (see a number of articles in book II), and it is not possible 
                for me to dwell on it here. I will come back to my own fate.</p>
              <p>The years from 1946 to 1953 were far from 
                easy for me. Living mainly in Moscow I went to Gorky when I could, 
                to read lectures and train a number of postgraduates and workers 
                in physics with an astrophysical and astronomical bias. All that 
                would not have been too bad, but the clouds began to gather over 
                my head. State anti-Semitism and different kinds of persecution 
                of the so-called cosmopolitans, who supposedly worshipped the 
                West, were blossoming out in the country. An offensive against 
                modern science was in progress - first of all, in biology, but 
                accusations of idealism and of other sins were raining down on 
                us in physics as well. I proved to be a good target for all sorts 
                of attacks. Indeed: a member of the party, married to a former 
                prisoner, who had been accused of counter-revolutionary activities 
                and therefore deprived of many rights. And a Jew at that. So finally 
                they started to accuse me of idealism, cosmopolitism and so on, 
                and so forth. Appearing as some culmination of all that was an 
                article published in a newspaper widely distributed at that time, 
                the <i>Literaturnaya Gazeta</i> (Literary Newspaper), on 4th October 
                1947, that is, on my birthday, under the heading "Against Servility". 
                In the article inspired by the rather well-known physicist D.D. 
                Ivanenko<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>, I was accused of all 
                sins together with the biologist A.R. Zhebrak, an opponent of 
                academician Lysenko. On the same day (what a coincidence!), on 
                the initiative of the same Ivanenko, the High Assessment Commission 
                of the ministry of higher education did not confirm promoting 
                me to the rank of professor, for which I had been nominated by 
                Gorki University. After that my name began to be mentioned wherever 
                possible as a negative example. Even our institute evidently had 
                to remove me from its academic council for "strengthening" it. 
                I can only guess what fate awaited me in this situation at that 
                time. I think that it would have cost me dear, but I was saved 
                by the hydrogen bomb.</p>
              <p>4. The history of creating atomic and hydrogen 
                bombs and my role in it have been extensively described. So I 
                have the more reasons to be brief. The Soviet atomic bomb was 
                first blown up on 29th August, 1949, and the hydrogen bomb, on 
                12th August, 1953. The hydrogen bomb had been arousing interest 
                even before the tests of the atomic bomb, but then it was completely 
                unclear how to make it, nor was it topical, as far as I understand. 
                It was merely something not to be missed. So in 1948 I. Tamm was 
                attached to this work, though the authorities did not have any 
                special trust in him (once he belonged to the Men'sheviks, who 
                were opponents of the Bolsheviks, and his only brother had been 
                arrested and shot). Only recently have I learned from some jubilee 
                article (the jubilee took place on 12th August, 2003) that at 
                first I had evidently not been admitted to the work in Tamm's 
                group, it only happened some time later. It is a miracle that 
                it happened at all - that someone having the wife in exile was 
                recruited for a top secret job ("top secret, special file"). Of 
                course, I do not know the reasons. I think that both the task 
                was not considered very important (see above) and I had a high 
                "rating". But recruiting my closest friend and a superb physicist, 
                E.L. Feinberg, turned out to be impossible for Tamm, as Feinberg's 
                wife had once lived in the USA. By the way, I cannot help telling 
                why the services of <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/index.html">A. 
                Sakharov</a> were enlisted, though earlier I already wrote about 
                it somewhere, and Sakhrov himself mentions it in his "Memories"<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>. 
                From 1945 Sakharov was a postgraduate in the FIAN theoretical 
                department headed by I. Tamm, in 1947 or 1948 he defended his 
                Ph.D. thesis and was going to carry on with peaceful science at 
                the FIAN. He had a small daughter and did not have an apartment 
                of his own, renting a room somewhere, and in general his life 
                was rather hard. So the director of our institute, S.I. Vavilov, 
                asked Tamm to include Sakharov in his special group in order to 
                get a room for him, which they managed to do (Sakharov got a small 
                room with the area of 14 square meters in a communal apartment). 
                If he had had a room of his own before that, many fates, including 
                both his fate and mine, would have probably turned out quite differently. 
                But it happened as it happened. From the middle of 1948 we started 
                working, at first reading the materials which we had and which, 
                as far as I remember, did not raise any hopes that this problem 
                would be solved. Then Sakharov put forward "the first idea" and 
                I, "the second idea", which together made it possible to build 
                the first Soviet hydrogen bomb. It is ridiculous, but until the 
                very death of Sakharov in 1989, that is 40 years later, all this 
                material had been classified. That is why Sakharov in his memories 
                writes about the 1st and the 2nd ideas without revealing their 
                content. Now it has long been known that the 1st idea is "the 
                layer structure" (I will not explain it here), and my 2nd idea 
                is using as fuel <sup>6</sup>Li (or, if you wish, <sup>6</sup>LiD) 
                for obtaining tritium <sup>3</sup>H = t as a result of the reaction 
                <sup>6</sup>Li + n &#8211;> t + <sup>4</sup>He + 4.6 MeV. These 
                two "ideas" were recognized as opening the possibility of creating 
                the hydrogen bomb. With the aim of carrying out this task Tamm 
                and Sakharov were sent, in 1950, to "the site" (Arzamas-16), and 
                I was not admitted there, obviously for the reasons mentioned 
                above (it was a higher level of secrecy), and I remained in Moscow 
                as the head of a small "group of support", but with a sentinel 
                sitting at out door. It goes without saying that I regard this 
                turn of the fate as a greatest luck. I was sure of my safety, 
                so I could visit my wife in Gorki, and could do science. It was 
                not that I was neglecting my work, but our task was mainly performing 
                different calculations, which is not my strong suit. Taking an 
                interest in other people's secrets was not customary with us in 
                general, and I was especially indifferent to them. So I remember 
                my surprise, probably, already in the seventies or the eighties, 
                when by chance I asked Sakharov how "the layer structure" had 
                "worked" or developed. He said that it had "not worked", which 
                I did not understand. Now it is known that the first two Soviet 
                hydrogen bombs were made as "layer structures." But such a construction 
                proved to be able to increase the power of the bombs, I do not 
                remember exactly, whether 20 or some other, comparatively small 
                number of times more than that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
                Somebody thought for some reason that it was not enough, and the 
                3rd idea (by Sakharov's terminology) consisting in radiative compression 
                was used. While "my" 2nd idea is probably still working. Or rather, 
                not working, to our great luck, but merely figuring.</p>
              <p>Trying to be worth my classified salt, as 
                it has already been said, I was glad when Tamm or Sakharov (I 
                do not remember exactly who of them), having once come to Moscow 
                in 1950, told me of the problem of controlled thermonuclear synthesis 
                and the "Tokamak" system offered by them. I took up this problem, 
                managed to write several reports and, by the way, in 1962, when 
                all that was declassified, even published some material from these 
                reports. But I did it as a sort of some rather silly "revenge" 
                for having been dismissed from this work in 1951, which must have 
                been considered too secret for me (for more detail see book II, 
                article 18).</p>
              <p>Then especially terrible time came. Stalin 
                went totally insane, repressions were going on, culminating in 
                "the case of doctors" and a bestial anti-Semitism related to 
                it. It seems that the corresponding documents have not been found 
                yet. They may not have existed, as it was clear even to bandits 
                that it was better not to leave trace. According to the rumors, 
                "the doctor killers" were whether to be hanged on the Red Square 
                or exterminated in some other way, and all Jews were to be exiled 
                into some camps already built. Some "necessary" people, possibly 
                I among them, would have been left in "sharashkas" later described 
                by Solzhenitsyn and others (a "sharashka" is in fact a prison 
                were scientific and technical research was conducted). It was 
                a tremendous luck that the Great Leader did not have enough time 
                to carry out what he had planned to do and died, or was killed, 
                on 5th March, 1953. In the former USSR many people (at any rate, 
                my wife and I) have up till now been celebrating this day as a 
                great festival.</p>
              <p>Everything in the country started to change 
                very quickly, suffice to mention the rehabilitation of "the doctor 
                killers" and the shooting up of Beriya, who was the head of the 
                Soviet "atomic project" (by the way, he was a good organizer and 
                probably not more of a bandit than all the rest). At the USSR 
                Academy of Sciences, contrary to its Charter, there had been no 
                election since 1946, evidently, because it had not been allowed 
                by Stalin. Already in 1953 such an election took place, and I 
                was elected corresponding member of the Academy. As they say, 
                "from rags to riches" - although, in my case this saying looks 
                somewhat exaggerated. But still, both in the USSR and now in Russia 
                being a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences means a rather 
                privileged position. In addition, I got some rather high governmental 
                awards<sup><a href="#not6">6</a></sup> and in general turned into 
                a VIP, although second rate. No less important was that my wife 
                managed to return to Moscow, after 8 years of half-exile, not 
                to mention approximately a year and a half of prison and camp.</p>
              <p>Since that time life has been going on more 
                or less normally, but still it made you think of a popular joke: 
                "Question: What is permanent under the Soviet power? Answer: temporary 
                difficulties are." The Sakharov story became a temporary difficulty 
                for me. In 1969, dismissed from classified work, he returned to 
                our theoretical department of the FIAN. As for me, in 1971, after 
                Tamm's death, I had to become head of this department. "Had to 
                become" indeed, because I did not want it and in general I do 
                not at all like work like that. But the workers of the department 
                had asked me, and it was really necessary, because due to numerous 
                "temporary difficulties" it was important that the department 
                should be headed by a person of some rank. And in our department 
                only Sakharov and I were academicians (I had been elected full 
                member of the Academy in 1966). But Sakharov had already become 
                a dissident, had taken up politics, and was totally unsuitable 
                for the post. So I had to take over. And it was the same Sakharov 
                who first of all became a problem, one can say, especially after 
                his being exiled to Gorki in 1980. I have written about it in 
                the article "The Sakharov Phenomenon", which can be found both 
                in book I and in the book of memories about Sakharov. I will not 
                repeat myself. I will only say that I do not see anything for 
                which I could reproach myself in this matter.</p>
              <p>However, I must note that "the case" of Sakharov 
                aggravated my already not temporary but permanent problem which 
                I faced when under the Soviet regime I either would not be allowed 
                to go abroad at all or would be allowed with great difficulty. 
                The explanations always referred to the reasons of our famous 
                "secrecy", but it was an obvious pretext. For instance, Tamm, 
                who really did know some secrets (while I actually knew none), 
                went abroad many times after 1953. Of course, I was very glad 
                for him. But I was refused permission to go because of the "sins" 
                of my wife and my own sins. My greatest "achievement" in this 
                area was made in 1959. That year a big international physical 
                conference took place in the USSR, in Kiev, it seems that it was 
                called the Rochester conference. So, some people, me including, 
                were not allowed to go to this conference (!) under the pretext 
                of secrecy. Landau was also not allowed at first, but he announced 
                that he would go all the same and would make a scandal. Well done! 
                They retreated and he went there. And I cannot make scandals and, 
                even if I could, I would perhaps not have obtained anything by 
                it. So I did not go to this conference, did not see many good 
                physicists, did not learn many interesting things. I was very 
                bitter about it at that time, and I am bitter now when I remember 
                this insult. And the greatest pity for me is that I could not 
                meet <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> 
                and speak with him - for he died in 1955 when I was already 39, 
                understood something in physics and astronomy already and could 
                well have had a professional talk with him if I had lived in a 
                free world. But I was not fated to. I only remember asking L. 
                Infeld, who came to the USSR, to give my regards to Einstein. 
                I do not know if Infeld had an opportunity to do it.</p>
              <p>Going on with the subject, I shall describe 
                two latest experiences characterizing the conditions in which 
                we lived before the collapse of the USSR. In 1984 the Danish Academy 
                of Sciences, whose foreign member I have been since 1977, invited 
                me to come to Copenhagen for a week, I do not remember on what 
                occasion. I started the painful procedure of "registration": for 
                going abroad one had to fill out many papers and pass some commissions. 
                Then all the documents went to the "instance", and sometimes you 
                were not informed until the very last moment whether or not your 
                trip had been permitted. This time I was also told shortly before 
                the departure that I could go but without my wife (!). I refused 
                to go. Such a natural reaction was a rare thing at that time, 
                so I even had a telephone call from the president of the USSR 
                Academy of Sciences, who expressed his disapproval by saying that 
                he, for example, did go without his wife - so how can I be so 
                shrewish instead of being grateful for the great honor done to 
                me and the trust given (to be honest, all the last words were 
                not said but, in my opinion, this call could be interpreted only 
                in such a way). A year later, in 1985, again in Copenhagen, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels 
                Bohr</a>'s birth centenary was to be celebrated. And again I was 
                invited, this time, if my memory does not fail me, being the only 
                person from the USSR who was to make a report at a plenary meeting 
                of the corresponding conference. And again I started to go through 
                the "registration" with my wife. And again at the last moment 
                I was told that I was allowed to go but without my wife. Probably, 
                someone was afraid that if we went together, we might not return. 
                By the way, we had never thought of anything of the kind. However, 
                this time I went, though I was indignant. The thing was that I 
                had already prepared my report, which meant quite a lot of work 
                done, taking into account that I had to prepare it both in Russian 
                and in English and then to pass it through censorship<a href="#not7">.<sup>7</sup></a> 
                And, what was even more important, I certainly had a great respect 
                for Bohr (I had heard his reports and was acquainted with him, 
                because he had been to the USSR) and I wanted to take part in 
                the jubilee conference. In my report at the conference and especially 
                in private talks, I somehow expressed my indignation at our lack 
                of freedom. I do not remember the details, but I do remember the 
                bitter after-taste left by the indifference of western colleagues. 
                But I was probably wrong. In the West they knew about the Soviet 
                arbitrariness and were used to it, they protested and defended 
                some people. And in general, why should they have taken my case 
                to heart. Besides, I spoke in a reserved manner, without any attempts 
                to arrange a rally, so it was easier to turn a deaf ear.</p>
              <p>By a chance coincidence, this year, 1985, 
                was a turning point, as M.S. Gorbachev came to power, and soon 
                the "perestroika" began. I took part in it - although not very 
                active, but I did. I was a deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet (from 
                1989 to 1991, the year when it was dissolved), elected from the 
                Academy of Sciences. I resigned from the party in 1991, since 
                then I have never again been a member of any party and am not 
                going to be one. Of course, I have always been a partisan of the 
                democratic forces but I have not always identified myself with 
                concrete actions of some of their representatives, Sakharov in 
                particular. However, I do not remember anything important and 
                interesting from my "political" activities, which would be worth 
                describing here.</p>
              <p>In 1988 I finally managed to free myself from 
                heading the I.E. Tamm Department of Theoretical Physics, as it 
                began to be called. The thing is that according to the rule which 
                had just been introduced and which had long been necessary, people 
                over 70 were not allowed to hold some positions. Having remained 
                at the FIAN in the position of advisor of the Academy of Sciences, 
                I have a small group of subordinates. Besides, I have been heading, 
                since 1968, the chair of problems of physics and astrophysics, 
                created that year at the Moscow Physical and Technical Institute 
                (rather well-known as Phystech), but now I already do not read 
                lectures and remain in this position without being payed (according 
                to my own wish), at the request of the staff in order to be able 
                to help the chair in solving some problems.</p>
              <p>Since 1998 I have been chief editor of the 
                Usp. Fiz. Nauk (Physics - Uspekhi) journal, and I actually carry 
                out my responsibility in the journal as far as I can. From the 
                middle of the fifties I was in charge of a physical seminar at 
                the FIAN, on Wednesdays, and this seminar was rather popular. 
                Running for two hours, it was attended by many people from Moscow 
                and from other places as well. At the time of Khrushchev we had 
                a popular saying: one should know the measure, be it maize or 
                seeing Nehru with pleasure. The saying came into being in connection 
                with Khrushchev's keenness on cultivating maize even in the areas 
                totally unsuitable for this purpose, as well as with his love 
                for Javaharlal Nehru, which the latter may have deserved, though. 
                I am writing about that by association. In 2001 I started to feel 
                worse and decided that I "should know the measure". So on 21st 
                November 2001 the 1700th seminar was arranged in the form of an 
                amusing party, like some other "jubilee" seminars (for instance, 
                the 1500th and 1600th), and there, quite unexpectedly for everybody, 
                I announced that the seminar was closing down. I did it after 
                telling a story about an actress who had been "playing" until 
                she could no longer walk. I still could walk, but the seminar 
                had to be closed some day and I wanted to do it in time.</p>
              <p>In the post-Soviet Russia and even a bit earlier 
                (after 1986 or 1987) going abroad was no longer a problem, or 
                at least no longer a problem of the Soviet type, that is with 
                a lot of obstacles. I took advantage of the corresponding opportunities, 
                but due to "the law of conservation" going abroad has become difficult 
                for other reasons - because of the age. In 2001 I was unexpectedly 
                given the Humboldt Prize (or grant) for going to Germany for half 
                a year. I was already going to accept this invitation but at the 
                last moment refused it because of the state of my health. But 
                I used the visa already received for going to Spain to the 10th 
                International conference on ferroelectricity, the first conference 
                of such kind which I managed to attend (about it see above and 
                book II, article 5). I thought that I would not go abroad any 
                more, but here I am going to Stockholm to the Nobel award ceremony.</p>
              <p>6. A great deal has already been written above, 
                but nevertheless, I do not think that some more questions could 
                be left without answers. Indeed, if we want our notion of a person 
                to be full enough, we should learn many things about him. Specifically, 
                we would like to know, first, what his outlook is, including his 
                attitude towards religion. Secondly, we would be interested in 
                his political views. What follows, thirdly, is the description 
                of his professional activities. And finally, fourthly, very important 
                are his personal qualities and tastes. All that should be described. 
                But of course, it is easier wished than done. Besides, I think 
                that there are many personal things about which a man sometimes 
                cannot and should not write. Indeed, in newspapers and magazines 
                we can often see the answers to such questions asked by correspondents: 
                what qualities in people do you value above all else, what are 
                your ideals, do you want to earn more money and for what purposes, 
                and so forth. The answers, as far as I could notice, are rather 
                monotonous: everybody values faithfulness, nobleness and decency; 
                everybody has radiant ideals of fairness, and money is needed 
                mainly for good deeds and not for buying mansions. It is quite 
                understandable, as everybody knows what qualities and likings 
                are considered positive and what tastes one should and can be 
                ashamed of. So I will not go into details of my personal matters. 
                I will only say a few words on the theme related to them. In my 
                life, like in the lives of many other people, friends have played 
                an important role. Now some of them are already no more, to my 
                greatest regret. Two closest friends of mine are now having hardships 
                connected with old age I would like at least to mention all my 
                friends and to express my warm feelings to them. But after some 
                attempts I have made sure that I am not able to do it in a satisfactory 
                way. The same concerns my wife and relatives. Probably only a 
                few people will be able to write about their feelings quite sincerely 
                and without hitting any wrong notes.</p>
              <p>One more category of people to be described 
                in a complete enough autobiography are teachers and pupils. Treating 
                the matter seriously, it is not at all simple to decide who you 
                should regard as your teachers and pupils. Evidently each of us 
                learned a lot from many people, in person or externally. Where 
                I am concerned I want to solve this problem as I.E. Tamm and L.D. 
                Landau solved it. The latter said, quite definitely and repeatedly, 
                that it was only Niels Bohr whom he considered his teacher. As 
                for I.E. Tamm, as far as I know, he regarded only L.I. Mandel'shtam 
                as his teacher. For my part, acting in the same way, I believe 
                that my teachers are I.E. Tamm and L.D. Landau. By the way, with 
                the latter I did not have any official links - I did not take 
                an exam in his "theoretical minimum", he was not my tutor or superior, 
                nor did his name appear as that. About Tamm and Landau I have 
                written in a rather detailed way (see books I and II). As for 
                the pupils, many people (especially mathematicians) call their 
                pupils those who they supervised, for instance, in their postgraduate 
                studies or for whom they were considered tutors helping to prepare 
                a thesis. I cannot be satisfied with such an approach. I want 
                to call my pupils, although maybe not always, those who consider 
                me their teacher. Naturally, with such an approach I cannot present 
                a list of my pupils. I will only say that I have never forgotten 
                the role played for me by the support and benevolent attitude 
                of I.E. Tamm. I tried to follow his example. Let other people 
                judge to what extent I have succeeded in it. I will confine myself 
                to the remark that, with only very few exceptions, I have good 
                feelings about those with whom I happened to work together or 
                whose tutor I used to be. Thanking them for cooperation I hope 
                that they returned and return my feelings.</p>
              <p>Where my professional activities are concerned, 
                they are described in the Nobel lecture, in this autobiography 
                and, the main thing, in a number of articles in books I and II; 
                I would especially like to note the article "A Scientific Autobiography 
                - an Attempt" in book I. It is interesting to consider the question 
                of estimation of people's scientific level and activities. It 
                is a big theme and here I only want to take an opportunity and 
                to tell about Landau's opinion in this respect. Landau in general 
                , especially in his youth, liked to classify everything. Later, 
                when I got to know him, he himself looked at these classifications, 
                for instance, of women, with irony. I shall only dwell on his 
                classification of theoretical physicists who worked in the 20th 
                century. It was done according to a logarithmic scale, with the 
                base 10, so a 2nd class physicist was 10 times inferior to a 1st 
                class physicist. It was a question of accomplishments, and not 
                of the level of knowledge, of pedagogical ability or oratorical 
                talent. Class 0.5 was given only to Einstein. Put into class 1 
                were Bohr, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a>, 
                <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schrödinger</a>, 
                <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/index.html">de Broglie</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a>. 
                I have undoubtedly forgotten several names, but, of course, I 
                will not supplement this list in the way I see it. I remember 
                <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Pauli</a> being
                put to class 1.5. Landau himself was placed in his own classification,
                as far as I remember, at first to class 2.5 and then to class
                2. Once E. Lifshits told me that Landau had upgraded himself
                to class 1.5. Why does this classification seem interesting to
                me? First, it refutes the legends about Landau's immodesty and
                conceit. Secondly, it is important that he put an emphasis on
                the record of accomplishments, achievements. For instance, I remember arguing 
                with Landau about de Broglie, who did not seem to me a particularly
                powerful figure. But Landau stood firm, and I think he was right.
                The wave proprieties of the electron and other particles is a
                guess of genius, although this idea occurred to de Broglie under
                the influence of Einstein's notion of photons and the equations 
                <b>p</b> = -h<b>k</b> and <i>k</i> = <font face="Symbol">w</font>/<i>c</i>. 
                By the way, I am surprised that Landau put Feynman higher than 
                himself and in general put him into the 1st class. There is no 
                doubt that Feynman was a brilliant physicist and lecturer but 
                it seems to me that his accomplishments cannot be compared with 
                those of other "first-class" physicists. Probably, Landau especially 
                valued the diagrammatic technique, thinking that he himself would 
                not have been able to hit upon it. What looks interesting and 
                important, from my point of view, is an enormous gap which may 
                exist and often exists between accomplishments and knowledge, 
                command of the apparatus and so on. I think, though I cannot assert 
                it, of course, that "by knowledge and command of the apparatus" 
                Landau stood even higher than Einstein, but "by accomplishments" 
                he sober-mindedly estimated himself as much inferior to him. I 
                am certainly not going to give my estimation of myself here, but 
                it is undoubtedly much lower "by command of the apparatus" than 
                "by accomplishments".</p>
              <p>It seems to me that working in science, in 
                physics - at any rate, in a position of at least some authority 
                - is absolutely impossible without having a stand on important 
                issues of our existence and thinking about philosophical questions. 
                Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to really acquaint myself 
                with the philosophy and methodology of science. To a certain extent 
                it can be explained by the fact that I have always worked at concrete 
                tasks and not at, for instance, problems of interpretation of 
                quantum mechanics and so on. That is why the atmosphere of dogmatism 
                and censorship in philosophical issues, which prevailed in our 
                country, has not had an especially pernicious effect on me, as 
                well as on the majority of my colleagues in the USSR. I do not 
                even want to name illiterate rogues who dictated to us under the 
                sign of dialectical materialism how the laws of physics or, for 
                instance, of genetics should be understood. But it does not in 
                the least prove that dialectical materialism in itself is unacceptable 
                (among its advocates there were quite decent and reasonable people, 
                as for instance, the already mentioned B. Gessen). I have always 
                understood the core of this philosophical trend as, first of all, 
                materialism, that is the conviction that nature and matter exist 
                beyond our consciousness and independently of it. Secondly, studying 
                nature, which is what natural sciences do, requires a flexible 
                approach based on facts and not on dogmas. It is such an approach 
                which is dialectical. I do not mean anything else, although philosophers 
                may consider my words naive, insufficient or maybe even worse.<sup><a href="#not8">8</a></sup> 
                A really important point is understanding that materialism is 
                "an intuitive judgment" (using the term especially widely used 
                by E.L. Feinberg) which can be neither proved nor disproved. Atheism 
                and belief in the existence of God are also intuitive judgments. 
                I am an atheist, that is, I think nothing exists except and beyond 
                nature. Within the limits of my, undoubtedly insufficient knowledge 
                of the history of philosophy, I do not see in fact any difference 
                between atheism and the pantheism of Spinoza. That is why I think 
                that Einstein was also an atheist, because in 1929, when asked 
                what he believed in, he answered: "I believe in Spinoza's God, 
                who shows himself in the harmony of all that exists, but not in 
                a God who takes care of the fate and actions of people." Einstein, 
                however, used the term "cosmic religion" and reckoning him among 
                atheists may be not quite right. At any rate, I, like many others, 
                do not have any "cosmic feeling", and I do not see any place for 
                God, that is, for something which is beyond nature and has created 
                this nature (such is the opinion of deists). But evidently it 
                is impossible to prove that God does not exist. This itself leads 
                to the conclusion that the principle of the freedom of conscience 
                is fair, that is, people should have the unimpeded right to believe 
                in God and, if they so desire, to practice some religion (of course, 
                I am not speaking about wildly fanatical sects and the beliefs 
                justifying banditry and terrorism). The Bolshevik-communists 
                were not merely atheists but, according to Lenin's terminology, 
                militant atheists. This term, being not quite clear for broad 
                masses, was changed to the name "the militant godless". These 
                pursued believers, especially priests, destroyed temples (churches, 
                mosques, synagogues) turning some of them into warehouses, stables 
                and so on. Identifying atheists with "the militant godless", which 
                is done in Russia by unscrupulous people or simply by illiterate 
                demagogues, is absolutely groundless. It is the same as identifying 
                a respectable catholic with a partisan of the inquisition or considering 
                all members of the Orthodox Church to be partisans of the brutal 
                persecution of Old Believers or other "heretics". Unfortunately, 
                in the post-Soviet time in Russia a clerical offensive has been 
                going on, while the voice of atheists is completely stifled. That 
                is why since 1998 I have been defending atheism in the press, 
                and after being awarded the Nobel Prize I managed to say about 
                that on television as well. Here it is not a question of combating 
                religion, as this would be at variance with the principle of the 
                freedom of conscience, and, besides, religion sometimes does good, 
                calling for good and for worthy behaviour. It is merely a question 
                of atheistic enlightenment, for instance, of scientific elucidation 
                of a complete falsehood of creationism. In general, an abstract 
                belief in the existence of God (concretely, deism) should not 
                be confused with theism (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) involving 
                belief in miracles and the sanctity of the Bible, Koran and so 
                on. By the way, no cultured person will deny the great artistic 
                and historical value of the Bible. But a belief in Biblical miracles 
                is another thing altogether, being incompatible with a scientific 
                outlook, because a miracle, by definition, is something at variance 
                with scientific data and results of scientific research (for some 
                more details see a number of articles in book II).</p>
              <p>7. It remains for me to write about politics, 
                or rather about my opinion on certain questions in this respect. 
                I have always remembered the line from a song by the popular poet 
                and singer Alexander Galich (by the way, his real surname was 
                Ginzburg but we are not relatives): "Be only afraid of the one 
                who will say: I know what should be done". Lenin, Hitler and Stalin 
                knew "what should be done" and this knowledge cost the lives of 
                millions of people. Even if I knew "what should be done", I would 
                not be able to influence the course of history. But the main thing 
                is that I do not know this. I have some opinions, but there is 
                a world of difference between being sure that you are right and 
                acting correspondingly, in spite of everything - and having an 
                opinion and understanding that it may prove to be wrong. So, my 
                opinion is well-known enough: I am convinced that only a democratic 
                form of rule is acceptable. Churchill was certainly right when 
                he said, with the clarity of thought inherent in him, that (unfortunately, 
                I do not remember his exact words) democracy is a very bad form 
                of rule but we do not know any better. Indeed, the hereditary 
                monarchy is presently something which remains merely by tradition. 
                Even so, the monarchic regimes remaining in some countries of 
                Europe do not hamper the democratic order, as far as I know. Where 
                the totalitarian regime is concerned, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao 
                Tse-tung and many leaders of a lower rank proved convincingly 
                enough that this form of rule is inhuman and is inevitably leading 
                to tragic circumstances. Millions of people, and I am not an exception, 
                believed, putting it in a more or less modern language, in the 
                possibility of "a communism with a human face". To tell the truth, 
                I still do not understand why it is impossible. But there is "a 
                criterion of practice", in exact sciences absolutely unshakeable 
                and enabling us to have indisputable knowledge, for instance, 
                that astrological forecasts are false and the law of conservation 
                of energy is correct (though for the latter this is with a reservation 
                about the whole known range of phenomena). In social life there 
                is certainly no similar indisputability, but the whole experience 
                of mankind shows that totalitarianism and dictatorship inevitably 
                slide to the rails of arbitrary rule, crimes and atrocities. However, 
                for democracy a high price is to be payed too, and arguments emerge 
                about this price - how far can we go, where is the border? The 
                whole history of the rule of the Bolsheviks and the Nazis is full 
                of examples how democrats, progressive intellectuals, liberals, 
                pacifists and all public like that often did not understand elementary 
                things, and step by step they in actual fact encouraged bandits 
                and consolidated their power. Much has been written on this theme, 
                and I also could write a whole book. I will confine myself to 
                just one example of "deep understanding" of Stalinism, which I 
                have recently come across. Herbert Wells wrote, characterizing 
                Stalin, that he had never met a person more sincere, decent and 
                honest; that in Stalin there was nothing dark and sinister, and 
                it was these qualities that should account for his tremendous 
                power in Russia (!) According to Wells, Stalin was a Georgian totally 
                devoid of cunning and insidiousness, and his sincere orthodoxy 
                guaranteed the safety of his comrades-in-arms. And this was written 
                in the thirties, already after the horrors of Stalin's collectivization, 
                known all over the world. Several years later Stalin's comrades-in-arms 
                who Wells had probably met were also shot. In all, the "Georgian 
                devoid of cunning and insidiousness" signed by his own hand death 
                sentences (shooting lists) for 44000 people!<sup><a href="#not9">9</a></sup></p>
              <p>There are really lots of examples of "understanding" 
                reality in the way demonstrated above. But I have an impression 
                that the "leftist progressive" public "has forgotten nothing and 
                has learned nothing". Under the slogans of "political correctness", 
                following democratic principles and so on, they follow the same 
                road of protection and justification of hooliganism, banditry 
                and terror. Even the tragic events of 11th September, 2001 were 
                far from having a sobering effect on each and everyone. A spectacular 
                example is the attitude to the events in Iraq. The Iraqi regime 
                of Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons in the war with Iran, 
                it occupied and plundered Kuwait, it committed innumerable atrocities 
                inside the country. But they say that it has not been proved whether 
                Saddam did or did not manage to build up a stock of chemical, 
                bacteriological and maybe also of nuclear weapons. It has been 
                proved, however, that he aspired for that. All vileness of this 
                regime and its crimes have also been proved. However, the action 
                of the USA and Britain taken in order to overthrow this regime 
                is condemned by many people. In their opinion, they should have 
                waited until Saddam became stronger and was able to drop something 
                on their heads. I understand that the Anglo-American action was 
                clumsy and this issue is complicated. But, by the way, I do not 
                understand why the elimination of the regime of Talibs in Afghanistan 
                had been considered more legitimate from formal point of view. 
                It is just that 11th September was closer, and bin Laden and Afghanistan, 
                farther. I have already said that I do not know "what should be 
                done". But I know, as it seems to me, that if civilized countries 
                follow the principles of "political correctness" and observing 
                laws literally, they will again incur innumerable calamities, 
                like those from Hitler and Stalin. The wild fanatics killing absolutely 
                innocent people, women and children, cannot be stopped and rendered 
                harmless without soiling one's hands.</p>
              <p>As a Jew I cannot go without dwelling on the 
                "Jewish question" here, although it is still not entirely clear 
                to me why this quite small, suffering people turned out to be 
                in the focus of the world politics. For understanding of what 
                follows I must make several observations. The Jews have remained 
                as a nation, they have not assimilated, as it is customary to 
                think, due to their attachment to Judaism and to considering themselves 
                a chosen nation. I am an atheist and internationalist, that is, 
                I do not regard any people as "chosen", in particular, I do not 
                think that Jews are better than Arabs. I do not know any Jewish 
                language (Hebrew or Yiddish); by the way, I wish I knew, but I 
                do not have ability for languages and my native tongue is Russian. 
                One would think that I must have assimilated. But it is absolutely 
                wrong, I have never been able to even think of giving up my native 
                people. What are the reasons? I do not know and understand them 
                quite well myself. Of course, family roots are essential, there 
                were some Jewish traditions in my family. No less essential is 
                anti-Semitism. Although I have not suffered from it directly, 
                I also used to be called "a Yid". Not to mention the time when 
                after the war anti-Semitism flourished with us. Anyway, because 
                of all these and maybe some other reasons which I do not understand 
                (what if it is merely a question of genes, their role is not quite 
                clear yet), I am a bearer, so to say, of the Jewish national feeling. 
                This is by no means nationalism, for I see nationalism as the 
                opinion of the superiority of "one's own" nation or, at least, 
                striving to justify and defend "one's own" people. I categorically 
                deny having such feelings. On the contrary, with me the most spectacular 
                display of the Jewish national feeling are shame and indignation 
                when I face a Jew who is a scoundrel and on the whole a bad person. 
                At the same time I am glad if a worthy person turns out to be 
                a Jew. For instance, I am happy that Einstein was a Jew, as well 
                as many other outstanding people. In these feelings I see nothing 
                to be ashamed of. It is shameful to promote somebody "one's own" 
                at someone else's expense, it is shameful to pardon "one's own" 
                scoundrel. But taking pride in "one's own" good person is not 
                shameful to me. However, I cannot clearly explain and understand 
                these feelings of mine. But this is another question. By the way, 
                to avoid suspicion of being insincere, let me say that my first 
                and my second wives are Russian. The daughter's husband is a Jew. 
                The granddaughter's husband is Russian. I do not see any problem 
                here, life is like that.</p>
              <p>I have burst out telling the above partly 
                in order to explain why I was interested in Israel and its fate. 
                I am very glad that there is such a state where at last the Jews 
                are not a minority, often persecuted and humiliated. At the same 
                time, many things there I do not like. Not in the order of importance, 
                but I cannot help noting clericalism. In the history of the Jews 
                synagogues played not only the role of prayer houses but also 
                of the centers of a community. So some state support of religion 
                in Israel can be understood. But it is important to know the measure. 
                I cannot see any reasons justifying the absence (at least, in 
                a number of places) of public transport on Saturdays and a number 
                of other, sometimes more important, restrictions or consequences 
                of religious character. In such a way atheists are discriminated. 
                Still more important are a complete absence of unity in the country 
                and the presence of a great number of cases of abusing the advantages 
                of democracy which I mentioned above. That is why, I think, the 
                very existence of the state of Israel is under threat, while the 
                elimination of this state would be a new catastrophe of the Holocaust 
                sort. I am writing about it, although I am aware that it might 
                be irrelevant here, as I am indignant at the support of Arafat 
                and his gangs by anti-Semitic and at the same-time progressive 
                "left" forces of the West. And it is not because of my supposedly 
                anti-Arab stand. Stalin and Hitler would have solved the Palestinian 
                problem in 48 hours. They would eliminate either Israel or, which 
                is much less likely, the Palestinian autonomy, deporting the disagreeable 
                population to some distant place. Of course, in the civilized 
                world such a decision is inadmissible. I am of the opinion that 
                it is necessary and possible to have two completely isolated states. 
                All those who know the lessons of history (for instance, the history 
                of "friendship" of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland) 
                or who have seen on television dancing crowds of Palestinians 
                of all ages while the television was showing the terrorist acts 
                of 11th September, which took away the lives of thousands of innocent 
                people, cannot have any illusions about the friendship and love 
                between Palestinians and Israelis. To be more exact, only absolutely 
                brainless bankrupts who had once obtained the celebrated agreements 
                in Oslo can assume (or pretend to assume) that this might be possible 
                in the foreseeable future. That is why I am convinced that a friendly 
                coexistence of Israel and the state of Palestine is nowadays impossible. 
                The only way out, in my view, is a complete isolation of these 
                states from each other. It cannot be done with the majority of 
                Israeli "settlements" remaining on the Palestinian territory. 
                They should be removed, and it is not a question of law. One Israeli 
                man told me that the land for these "settlements" had been bought 
                and not annexed. So much the better, but it merely means that 
                they can try to "exchange" these settlements for the land of the 
                Arabs living in Israel. These Israeli Arabs are the only true 
                obstacle to a complete division of the two states<sup><a href="#not10">10</a></sup>. 
                But this obstacle is not decisive either. Of course, an impenetrable 
                "wall" dividing the two states is also necessary. Using Palestinian 
                workers on the territory of Israel is absolutely inadmissible. 
                This is motivated, as I heard, by humanist considerations, allegedly 
                by the care about poor Arabs. While in actual fact, I think, many 
                Israelis do not want to do manual or menial dirty work, and their 
                own workers are, in spite of the unemployment, either more expensive 
                or unavailable. But the Palestinians working in Israel can't help 
                hating their rich masters, which is a source of additional antagonism. 
                The history of importation of black slaves to America could be 
                a good lesson. And taking care of Palestinians should be carried 
                out by their brothers in rich Arab countries.</p>
              <p>As for the question of the Golan Heights, 
                it seems to me completely made up. I have been there myself and 
                seen the ruins of a big ancient synagogue. So why is it Syrian 
                land "from time immemorial"? Syria attacked Israel, suffered a 
                crushing defeat and lost the Golan Heights. Now there is no Syrian 
                population on this territory, its loss is Syria's pay for aggression. 
                Why those who are indignant at this situation do not demand that 
                Konigsberg and its environs, renamed into Kaliningrad and the 
                Kaliningrad region, should be returned to Germany? Such is a result 
                of Germany's attack on the USSR, and nobody, including the Germans, 
                is not going to revise it. By the way, I am indignant that a part 
                of Eastern Prussia and Konigsberg were named after Kalinin, this 
                nonentity, who licked Stalin's boots, while Stalin sent his completely 
                innocent wife to a concentration camp.</p>
              <p>Being a realist, I am sure that such "Ginzburg 
                plan" will not be realized and will only arouse spite and mockery 
                of pseudo-democrats and "peace-makers". Why, that is their business, 
                while I wanted to express my opinion, taking advantage of the 
                freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, one observation of general 
                character. A tremendous progress of science has led to its deep 
                internationalization. There is no such thing as American, Russian, 
                Jewish or whatever else national physics. There is only one physics 
                in the world, and when we are speaking, for instance, about British 
                or Russian physics, we only mean the organization or the state 
                of physics in Britain or in Russia. The Aryan science of the Nazis 
                and the Marxist and Leninist science of the communists have long 
                been forgotten. Whereas in the field of the social sciences and 
                the sciences related to them, like sociology, psychology, economics 
                and so on, the true depth and internationalization are still far 
                from being achieved. But, I hope, here also the time of great 
                success is near. Such is one of the factors which enable us, as 
                it seems to me, to look into the future with hope. Another factor 
                is the slowdown of the growth of the population of the Earth. 
                Also positive, though this assertion is disputable, is the increase 
                of the average life expectancy and thus the increase of the average 
                age of the population. I remember the saying: if a man is not 
                a communist at the age of 20, it means that he has no heart, but 
                if he is a communist at 50, it means that he has no head. The 
                bitter statement "what history teaches is merely that it does 
                not teach anything" is not without reason. But still to completely 
                agree with this statement would mean to totally lose the faith 
                in mankind.</p>
              <p>What has been said explains why I am still 
                inclined to believe in the radiant future of mankind. Today on 
                the road to it there are many obstacles, first of all, the Islamic 
                (terrorist) threat, poverty and the lack of education of great 
                masses of population, AIDS and other diseases. But let us remember 
                the situation, for example, in 1943, sixty years ago. Europe was 
                under Hitler's heel, the USSR, though heroically resisting, was 
                living under the Stalinist yoke. America was not so strong, and 
                the world war was raging. Was it easier and better than now? The 
                forces of democracy have coped with it, saved the civilized society 
                and nowadays both the Nazism and the communism have almost sunk 
                into oblivion. That is why we can hope for the ultimate triumph 
                of the democratic system and the secular humanism all over the 
                world. The necessary conditions for that are the presence of historical 
                memory and the development of science. </p>

                Others) (Moscow: Fizmatlit, 2003): it is the third edition. The 
                English translation "About Science, Myself and Others" will, I 
                hope, be published at the publishing house Bristol: IOP Publ.

                it should be explained that in the USSR a person could live somewhere 
                only with the permission of the militia and had to be registered 
                there.</p>

                his name I must say that I am writing about the fact established 
                beyond all doubt (see book II, article 18, commentary 10 at the 
                end of the article).</p>

                I do not feel like enumerating all these awards, including prizes 
                and being elected members of some academies. Enumerating all of 
                them would be too long, and mentioning only the main ones would 
                mean lack of respect for others. The corresponding information, 
                although incomplete, can be found in books I and II. Let me note 
                that I have never strived for awards, never aspired for them, 
                though I was glad to get them. Besides, the Nobel Prize has exceeded 
                everything. I know that they had started to nominate me for this 
                prize as far back as about thirty years ago. However, I had long 
                ago come to the conclusion that it had been decided not to give 
                it to me. By the way, I was able to understand it - both because 
                of the certain circumstances of my life and because I knew that 
                the work of the Nobel committee is extremely difficult. That is 
                why the news of the prize having been awarded to me, in 2003, 
                was quite unexpected.</p>

                to me, a more exact interpretation of dialectical materialism 
                is seeing it as a combination of materialism with the recognition 
                of the laws of dialectics formulated by Hegel. Whereas I regard 
                these laws as scholastic to a considerable degree. Perhaps the 
                most correct name for the views that I hold would be scientific 
                materialism.</p>

                is a certain problem because Jerusalem is a very important center 
                from the religious point of view not only for the Jews but also 
                for the Christians and the Moslems. However, I do not see why 
                a free religious life cannot be provided under a correspondent 
                agreement (and, perhaps, also under international control) and 
                in the conditions when Jerusalem is the capital of only Israel.</p>
