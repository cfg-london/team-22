  <h1>Paul Berg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="berg.jpg" class="bio-img">I 
              was born in New York on June 30, 1926 and my formative years were 
              spent in a small, gated community named Sea Gate, at the southernmost 
              tip of Brooklyn. By the time I reached Jr. high school I had already 
              formed a strong ambition to be a scientist, in part stimulated by 
              my readings about medical scientists: &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; by 
              <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/index.html">Sinclair Lewis</a> 
              and &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; by Paul DeKruif. An inspiring high 
              school &quot;teacher&quot;, Sophie Wolfe, whose job was to supervise 
              the stockroom that supplied the classes in chemistry, physics and 
              biology, nurtured that ambition. Her love of young people and interest 
              in science led her to start an after school program of science clubs. 
              Rather than answering questions we asked, she encouraged us to seek 
              solutions for ourselves, which most often turned into mini research 
              projects. Sometimes that involved experiments in the small lab she 
              kept but sometimes it meant going to the library to find the answers. 
              The satisfaction derived from solving a problem with an experiment 
              was a very heady experience, almost addicting. Looking back, I realize 
              that nurturing curiosity and the instinct to seek solutions are 
              perhaps the most important contributions education can make. With 
              time, many of the facts I learned were forgotten but I never lost 
              the excitement of discovery.</p>
            <p>I graduated from high school (1943) just a year 
              after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and enrolled at New 
              York&#8217;s City College to study chemical engineering. But 
              the prospects of designing chemical plants for industrial scale 
              chemical processes seemed far less interesting than the chemical 
              events that occur in biological systems. But I felt it necessary 
              to be part of the war effort and I enlisted in the Navy to be a 
              flyer. While waiting to be called to pre-flight training, I enrolled 
              at the Pennsylvania 
              State University to study biochemistry. After a few months I 
              was called to active duty but allowed to remain at Penn State for 
              pre-flight training. After a year at Penn State and six months training 
              at sea I served on a submarine chaser through the end of the war. 
              I returned to the university in the fall of 1946 and completed my 
              undergraduate degree in biochemistry two years later.</p>
            <p>As a project during the senior year, I studied 
              a group of papers that dealt with the application of newly available 
              radioisotopes as tracers for the study of intermediary metabolism. 
              Particularly fascinating were a succession of papers from Western 
              Reserve University that showed how compounds labeled with isotopic 
              carbon and/or heavy nitrogen atoms could be tracked during their 
              conversion from foodstuffs to cellular materials. That seemed exciting 
              and although I had never heard of Western Reserve University it 
              was my next destination.</p>
            <p>That was a fortunate choice; in fact, it changed 
              the course of my career. Because of its pioneering work in this 
              new field, the department had by the late 1940&#8217;s become one 
              of the important biochemistry centers in the country. Harland Wood, 
              the department head, was an inspiring scientist and teacher but 
              he was also devoted to his students and colleagues. My doctoral 
              thesis concerned what is today referred to as C1 metabolism, more 
              specifically the conversion of formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol 
              to the fully reduced state of methyl groups in methionine. I was 
              among the first to demonstrate, in vitro, that folic acid and vitamin 
              B12 cofactors participated in these processes. (1952). By that time 
              I was hooked on a career in academic research instead of one in 
              the pharmaceutical industry that I had originally considered in 
              deciding to get a PhD.</p>
            <p>Seeking more experience with enzymes, I studied 
              for a year in Copenhagen 
              with Herman Kalckar at the Institute of Cytophysiology and for a 
              second year with <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/index.html">Arthur 
              Kornberg</a> at Washington 
              University in St. Louis. Both were very productive and enjoyable 
              experiences. In Copenhagen, Wolfgang Joklik and I discovered a new 
              enzyme that created the nucleoside triphospates for nucleic acid 
              assembly and the next year in Kornberg&#8217;s lab, I discovered 
              a previously unknown class of biological compounds - acyl adenylates 
              - intermediates in the formation of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acids, 
              ATP and CoA. This type of reaction, I discovered, was also central 
              to the way amino acids are activated as amino-acyl adenylates prior 
              to being linked to tRNAs. By then, I was making the slow transition 
              from classical biochemistry to molecular biology and becoming increasingly 
              preoccupied with how genes act and how proteins are made.</p>
            <p>After 6 years in St. Louis, I moved to Stanford 
              University&#8217;s Medical Center (1959) to help Kornberg set 
              up the new department of biochemistry. In time, my interests shifted 
              from studies with microorganisms to mammalian cells and I spent 
              a year experimenting with Polyoma and SV40 tumor viruses in mammalian 
              cell culture with Renato Dulbecco at the Salk 
              Institute. Soon after I returned to Stanford, I conceived of 
              using SV40 as a means for introducing new genes into mammalian cells 
              much in the way that bacteriophage transduce cellular DNA among infected 
              cells. My colleagues and I succeeded in developing a general way 
              to join two DNAs together in vitro; in this case, a set of three 
              genes responsible for metabolizing galactose in the bacterium <i>E. 
              coli</i> was inserted into the SV40 DNA genome. That work led to 
              the emergence of the recombinant DNA technology thereby providing 
              a major tool for analyzing mammalian gene structure and function 
              and formed the basis for me receiving the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
