  <h1>Shirin Ebadi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ebadi.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in the city of Hamadan [northwestern Iran] in 1947. My 
                family were academics and practising Muslims. At the time of my 
                birth my father was the head of Hamedan's Registry Office. My 
                father, Mohammad Ali Ebadi, one of the first lecturers in commercial 
                law, had written several books. He passed away in 1993.</p>
              <p>I spent my childhood in a family filled with 
                kindness and affection. I have two sisters and a brother all of 
                whom are highly educated. My mother dedicated all her time and 
                devotion to our upbringing.</p>
              <p>I came to Tehran with my family when I was 
                a one year old and have since been a resident in the capital. 
                I began my education at Firuzkuhi primary school and went on to 
                Anoshiravn Dadgar and Reza Shah Kabir secondary schools for my 
                higher education. I sat the Tehran University entrance exams and 
                gained a place at the Faculty of Law in 1965. I received my law 
                degree in three-and-a-half years, and immediately sat the entrance 
                exams for the Department of Justice. After a six-month apprenticeship 
                in adjudication, I began to serve officially as a judge in March 
                1969. While serving as a judge, I continued my education and obtained 
                a doctorate with honours in private law from Tehran University 
                in 1971.</p>
              <p>I held a variety of positions in the Justice 
                Department. In 1975, I became the President of Bench 24 of the 
                [Tehran] City Court. I am the first woman in the history of Iranian 
                justice to have served as a judge. Following the victory of the 
                Islamic Revolution in February 1979, since the belief was that 
                Islam forbids women to serve as judges, I and other female judges 
                were dismissed from our posts and given clerical duties. They 
                made me a clerk in the very court I once presided over. We all 
                protested. As a result, they promoted all former female judges, 
                including myself, to the position of "experts" in the Justice 
                Department. I could not tolerate the situation any longer, and 
                so put in a request for early retirement. My request was accepted. 
                Since the Bar Association had remained closed for some time since 
                the revolution and was being managed by the Judiciary, my application 
                for practising law was turned down. I was, in effect, housebound 
                for many years. Finally, in 1992 I succeeded in obtaining a lawyer's 
                licence and set up my own practice.</p>
              <p>I used my time of unemployment to write several 
                books and had many articles published in Iranian journals. After 
                receiving my lawyer's licence I accepted to defend many cases. 
                Some were national cases. Among them, I represented the families 
                of the serial murders victims (the family of Dariush and Parvaneh 
                Foruhar) and Ezzat Ebrahiminejad, who were killed during the attack 
                on the university dormitory. I also participated in some press-related 
                cases. I took on a large number of social cases, too, including 
                child abuse. Recently I agreed to represent the mother of Mrs 
                Zahra Kazemi, a photojournalist killed in Iran.</p>
              <p>I also teach at university. Each year, a number 
                of students from outside Iran join my human rights training courses.</p>
              <p>I am married. My husband is an electrical 
                engineer. We have two daughters. One is 23 years old. She is studying 
                for a doctorate in telecommunications at McGill University in 
                Canada. The other is 20 years old and is in her third year at 
                Tehran University where she reads law.</p>
