  <h1>William H. Stein - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stein.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born
  June 25, 1911 in New York City, the second of three children, to
  Freed M. and Beatrice Borg Stein. My father was a business man
  who was greatly interested in communal affairs, particularly
  those dealing with health, and he retired quite early in life in
  order to devote his full time to such matters as the New York
  Tuberculosis and Health Association, Montefiore Hospital and
  others. My mother, too, was greatly interested in communal
  affairs and devoted most of her life to bettering the lot of the
  children of New York City. During my childhood, I received much
  encouragement from both of my parents to enter into medicine or a
  fundamental science.<br>
  <br>
  My early education was at the Lincoln School of Teachers College
  of Columbia
  University in New York City, a school which was considered
  progressive for that time and which fostered in me an active
  interest in creative arts, music, and writing. There I had my
  first course in chemistry which proved to be an extremely
  valuable and interesting one. I left this school when I was about
  sixteen and went to an excellent preparatory school in New
  England, namely Phillips Exeter Academy, which was at the time,
  although it has changed since, a much more rigid and much more
  demanding educational experience than I had had at Lincoln. It
  was at Exeter that I was introduced to standards of precision of
  writing, and of work generally which I think has stood me in very
  good stead, and I believe that the combination of a progressive
  school and a more demanding school such as I enjoyed was an ideal
  preparation. From Exeter I went to Harvard where I had a very
  enjoyable, although not a very academically distinguished career,
  and graduated from the college in 1933 at the depths of the
  economic depression. I had majored in chemistry at college and
  decided to continue on at Harvard as a graduate student in
  that subject. This proved to be a rather unfortunate experience
  because my first graduate year was undistinguished, to say the
  very least. I was almost ready to abandon a career in science
  when it was suggested to me that I might enjoy biochemistry much
  more than straight organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  The next year, I transferred to the Department of Biochemistry,
  then headed by the late Hans Clarke at the College of Physicians
  and Surgeons, Columbia University in New York. The department at
  Columbia was an eye-opener for me. Professor Clarke had succeeded
  in surrounding himself with a fascinating and active faculty and
  an almost equally stimulating group of graduate students. From
  both of these I learned a tremendous amount in a short time. My
  thesis involved the amino acid analysis of the protein elastin,
  which was then thought to play a role in coronary artery disease
  and I completed the requirements for my degree at Columbia late
  in 1937 and went directly to the laboratory of Max Bergmann at
  the Rockefeller Institute.<br>
  <br>
  While still a graduate student, I had the extreme good fortune to
  marry, in 1936, Phoebe Hockstader who has been of enormous
  support to me ever since. We have three sons, William H. Jr., 35;
  David F., 33; Robert J., 28.<br>
  <br>
  Bergmann was, I still feel, one of the very great protein
  chemists of this century and he, too, had the ability to surround
  himself with a most talented group of postdoctoral colleagues. In
  the laboratory at the time that I was there were, of course, Dr.
  Moore, and, in addition, Dr Joseph S. Fruton, Dr Emil L. Smith,
  Dr. Klaus Hofmann, Dr. Paul Zamecnik, and many others. It was
  impossible not to learn a great deal about the business of
  research in protein chemistry from Bergmann, himself, and from
  the outstanding group he had around him.<br>
  <br>
  The task of Moore and myself was to devise accurate analytical
  methods for the determination of the amino acid composition of
  proteins, because Bergmann firmly believed, as did we, that the
  amino acid analysis of proteins bore the same relationship to
  these macromolecules that elementary analysis bore to the
  chemistry of simpler organic substances. It was during this
  period in the mid-thirties that Bergmann and Fruton and their
  colleagues were working out the specificity of proteolytic
  enzymes, work which has had a profound effect upon our knowledge
  of how enzymes function and has made it possible to use these
  proteolytic enzymes as tools for the degradation and subsequent
  derivation of structure of protein molecules ever since.<br>
  <br>
  Work on proteins was suspended during the war for other more
  pressing matters and Dr. Moore left the laboratory in order to be
  of assistance in Washington and elsewhere. Our entire group was
  engaged in working for the Office of Scientific Research and
  Development. Bergmann's death in 1944 robbed the world of a
  distinguished chemist and, of course, left the laboratory without
  a chief. The group continued to function until the end of the war
  at which time Moore and I had the very great good fortune to be
  asked by <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1944/index.html">Dr.
  Herbert Gasser</a>, Director of the Institute, to stay on at
  Rockefeller with the freedom to do anything we pleased in the
  biochemical field.<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, had come the remarkable developments in England
  on the separation of amino acids by paper chromatography by
  <a href="../1952/index.html">Martin and Synge</a> and <a href=
  "../1958/index.html">Sanger</a> had started his classical work on
  the derivation of the structure of insulin. It was then, perhaps,
  not surprising that Moore and I resumed our collaboration, and
  following a suggestion of Synge began to try to separate amino
  acids on columns of potato starch. We were very fortunate in
  hitting upon a type of potato starch which was well-suited to our
  needs almost immediately, and from that day on began to work
  first on the amino acid analysis, and then on the structural
  analysis of proteins. From columns of potato starch, we
  progressed to columns of ion exchange resins, developed the
  automatic amino acid analyzer, and together with a group of very
  devoted and extremely skillful collaborators, began work on the
  structure of ribonuclease. These columns were also used for other
  purposes. In the course of the early work, we developed a
  drop-counting automatic fraction collector which is now a common
  instrument in most biochemical laboratories throughout the
  world.<br>
  <br>
  I should like to emphasize that the development of methods grew
  out of a need rather than a particular desire to develop methods
  as ends in themselves. We needed to know the amino acid
  composition of proteins, we needed to be able to separate and
  analyze peptides in good yield, and we needed to be able to
  purify proteins chromatographically. Since there were no methods
  for doing any of these things at the time that we started, we had
  to devise them ourselves. We not only wanted to know what the
  amino acid sequence of an enzyme such as ribonuclease was, but we
  tried to find out as much as we could about what made it an
  enzyme and after we had taken that particular enzyme about as far
  as we thought we could profitably go, we turned to a number of
  others which have been listed in the Nobel Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  During all of this time, we had the undeviating support of an
  enlightened administration at Rockefeller who believed in
  allowing us to do those things which we thought to be important,
  and, during the last years of this work, we also have had great
  financial assistance from the NIH. For this and particularly for
  the very large number of devoted and talented colleagues which we
  have had in the laboratory we shall be forever grateful.<br>
  <br>
  During all of this time, each of us, naturally, developed
  interests outside of the laboratory. I, for example, became
  greatly concerned about the promulgation of scientific
  information and have been attached, in one way or another, to the
  Journal of Biological Chemistry for a matter of over fifteen
  years. During this time it has been my privilege to work with a
  knowledgeable and dedicated group of biochemists who have devoted
  themselves unselfishly to serving the interests of their fellow
  biochemists throughout the world.<br>
