  <h1>Edmond H. Fischer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fischer.jpg" class="bio-img">Memories of my early childhood are clouded
  with uncertainties because I was essentially separated from my
  parents since the early age of seven. I was born in Shanghai,
  China on April 6, 1920. My father had come there from Vienna,
  Austria after earning doctorates in law and business. My mother,
  born Ren&eacute;e Tapernoux, had arrived from France with her
  parents via Hanoi. Her father had left Switzerland as a young man
  to become a journalist for L'Aurore. This journal published the
  letter by Emile Zola entitled "J'accuse" in which he denounced
  the government cover-up during the Affaire Dreyfus which tore
  France apart at the turn of the century. When the case against
  Dreyfus collapsed in the early 1900s my grandfather left for
  French Indochina, then called le Tonkin. He later went to
  Shanghai where he founded the "Courrier de Chine", the first
  French newspaper published in China. He also helped to establish
  "l'Ecole Municipale Fran&ccedil;aise" where I first went to
  school.<br>
  <br>
  At age 7, my parents sent my two older brothers and me to La
  Ch&acirc;taigneraie, a large Swiss boarding school overlooking
  Lake Geneva. My oldest brother, Raoul, was the first to leave to
  attend the ETH, the Swiss Federal Polytechnical Institute in
  Z&uuml;rich where he was awarded a degree in engineering. My
  brother Georges went to Oxford and read law.<br>
  <br>
  In 1935, I entered Geneva's all boys Coll&egrave;ge de Calvin from
  which I obtained my Maturit&eacute; F&eacute;d&eacute;rale four years
  later, even as the specter of World War II loomed evermore
  menacing. While in school, I formed a lifelong friendship with my
  classmate Wilfried Haudenschild who dazzled me with his tinkering
  abilities, off-the-wall ideas and mechanical inventiveness.
  Together we decided that one of us should go into the Sciences
  and the other into Medicine so that we could cure all the ills of
  the world.<br>
  <br>
  Another important event marked my High School days: I was
  admitted to the Geneva Conservatory of Music. I had heard Johnny
  Aubert give an unforgettable rendition of Beethoven's 5th Piano
  Concerto. I decided on the spot that I wanted to study with him.
  After an audition in which I nervously presented Mendelssohn's
  Rondo Capriccioso and Chopin's A-maj. Polonaise, he took me on,
  and that spelled the beginning of many enthralling years. Music
  had always played an important part in my life, to such an extent
  that I even wondered whether I should not make a career of it.
  But finally I thought it better to keep music purely for
  pleasure.<br>
  <br>
  It was my goal to become a microbiologist but Fernand Chodat, the
  Professeur of Bacteriology, argued that there was little future
  in that field, which was probably the case in Switzerland at that
  time. He advised me to get a diploma in Chemistry saying that, in
  any case, test tubes were of more use than a microscope to modern
  microbiologists.<br>
  <br>
  I therefore entered the School of Chemistry just at the start of
  World War II. Two years of quantitative inorganic analyses seemed
  endless. Organic chemistry finally arrived like a breath of fresh
  air, if not a reprieve on life. I earned two Licences &egrave;s
  Sciences, one in Biology, the other in Chemistry and, two years
  later, the Diploma of "Ing&eacute;nieur Chimiste". For my thesis, I
  elected to work with Prof. Kurt H. Meyer, Head of the Department
  of Organic Chemistry. "Le Patron" as we affectionately called
  him, was a most impressive person. At the time when most
  scientists showed little understanding of natural high polymers,
  Kurt Meyer had already authored several books on the subject,
  starting with the epochal "Meyer-Mark: Der Aufbau der
  hochpolymeren organischen Naturstoffe" and "Makromolekulare
  Chemie". His main interest lay in the structure of
  polysaccharides, particularly starch and glycogen. To unravel the
  structure of these molecules, enzymes were needed: alpha- and
  beta-amylases, phosphorylase, etc. Therefore, the lab was divided
  into two groups: the enzymologists under the guidance of Peter
  Bernfeld and carbohydrate chemists under Roger Jeanloz. I decided
  to work on the purification of hog pancreas amylase. Within a
  couple of years, we succeeded in crystallizing alpha-amylase from
  pork pancreas and soon after that, from a variety of other
  sources including human pancreas and saliva, two strains of <i>A.
  oryzae</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>P. saccharophila</i>. It is
  at that time that Eric A. Stein joined the laboratory, beginning
  a marvelous 15-year collaboration and a lifelong
  friendship.<br>
  <br>
  It had always been my intention to go to the United States to
  pursue my studies in Biochemistry. In those days, that field was
  in its infancy in most European universities to such an extent
  that I was asked to present the very first course in Enzymology
  as a Privat Docent at the University of Geneva in 1950. Two events
  hastened my departure for the USA: the untimely death of Kurt
  Meyer following an asthma attack and my being abruptly issued a
  US immigration visa. Apparently, the US consulates abroad were
  clearing their files before the complicated McCarran Act would
  come into effect. I had decided to go to CalTech on a Swiss
  Post-doctoral Fellowship that Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/index.html">Paul Karrer</a> succeeded
  in securing for me on a moment's notice. Some friends who knew of
  my arrival in New York had arranged for me to give some seminars
  on my way to Pasadena: Maria Fuld at Pittsburgh and Henry Lardy
  at Madison. To my utter surprise, I was offered a job in both
  places. Then, upon my arrival at CalTech I found a letter from
  Hans Neurath, Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the
  University of
  Washington, inviting me to come to Seattle, apparently for
  the same purpose. I thought that the Americans had to be crazy
  since at that time, academic positions in Europe were
  one-in-a-million. I visited Seattle with my wife and thought that
  the surrounding mountains, forests and lakes were beautiful,
  reminiscent of Switzerland. The Medical School was brand-new and
  when I was offered an Assistant Professorship, I accepted and
  have never regretted that decision.<br>
  <br>
  There were only seven of us on the faculty and we quickly became
  close friends. I remember the amused expressions of my colleagues
  seated in the back row of the class listening to my fractured
  English when lecturing the medical students. I also remember
  <a href="index.html">Ed Krebs</a>' broad smile whenever I lapsed
  into French. What Ed didn't realize, though, is that within two
  years, while my English didn't improve very much, his
  deteriorated completely!<br>
  <br>
  Within six months of my arrival, Ed Krebs and I started to work
  together on glycogen phosphorylase. He had been a student of the
  <a href="../1947/index.html">Cori's</a> in St. Louis. They
  believed that AMP had to serve some kind of co-factor function
  for that enzyme. In Geneva, on the other hand, we had purified
  potato phosphorylase for which there was no AMP requirement. Even
  though essentially no information existed at that time on the
  evolutionary relationship of proteins, we knew that enzymes,
  whatever their origin, used the same co-enzymes to catalyze
  identical reactions. It seemed unlikely, therefore, that muscle
  phosphorylase would require AMP as a co-factor but not potato
  phosphorylase. We decided to try to elucidate the role of this
  nucleotide in the phosphorylase reaction. Of course, we never
  found out what AMP was doing: that problem was solved 6-7 years
  later when <a href="../1965/index.html">Jacques Monod</a>
  proposed his allosteric model for the regulation of enzymes. But
  what we stumbled on was another quite unexpected reaction: i.e.
  that muscle phosphorylase was regulated by
  phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. This is yet another example of
  what makes fundamental research so attractive: one knows where
  one takes off but one never knows where one will end up.<br>
  <br>
  These were very exciting years when just about every experiment
  revealed something new and unexpected. At first we worked alone
  in a small, single laboratory with stone sinks. Experiments were
  planned the night before and carried out the next day. We worked
  so closely together that whenever one of us had to leave the
  laboratory in the middle of an experiment, the other would carry
  on without a word of explanation. Ed Krebs had a small group that
  continued his original work, determining the structure and
  function of DPNH-X, a derivative of NADH. I was still studying
  the alpha-amylases with Eric Stein. In collaboration with Bert
  Vallee, we were able to demonstrate that these enzymes were in
  reality calcium-containing metalloproteins.<br>
  <br>
  In those days, we waited all year for the next Federation Meeting
  or Gordon Conference. It was an occasion for me to get together
  with my friends on the East Coast: Herb and Eva Sober and Chris
  and Flossie <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/index.html">Anfinsen</a> from NIH, Bill and Inge
  Harrington from Johns Hopkins, Bert and Kuggie Vallee from the
  Brigham and Al and Lee Meister, then at Tufts and later at
  Cornell, and many others. I have forgotten much about the
  meetings themselves. There was the excitement of hearing about
  the latest breakthroughs, the frantic preparations for talks that
  had to be given, and the numerous notebooks filled with
  information, questions and problems that had to be solved. I will
  never forget, though, the marvelous time we had together speaking
  far into the night about anything and everything. Some of these
  friends are gone today but their memory is still vivid.<br>
  <br>
  I have two sons, Fran&ccedil;ois and Henri, from my first wife
  Nelly Gagnaux, a Swiss National who died in 1961. I married my
  present wife Beverley n&eacute;e Bullock from Eureka, California,
  in 1963. She has a daughter Paula from a first marriage. All
  three of our children are now married and my two sons each has a
  son.<br>
  <br>
  I received the Werner Medal from the Swiss Chemical Society, the
  Lederle Medical Faculty Award; the Prix Jaubert from the
  University of Geneva and, jointly with Ed Krebs, the Senior
  Passano Award and the Steven C. Beering Award from Indiana
  University. I received Doctorates Honoris Causa from the
  University of Montpellier, France and the University of Basel,
  Switzerland and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and
  Sciences in 1972 and to the National Academy of Sciences in
  1973.</p>
