  <h1>Norman F. Ramsey - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ramsey.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born August 27, 1915 in
  Washington, D.C. My mother, daughter of German immigrants, had
  been a mathematics instructor at the University of Kansas. My
  father, descended from Scottish refugees and a West Point
  graduate, was an officer in the Army Ordnance Corps. His
  frequently changing assignments took us from Washington, DC to
  Topeka, Kansas, to Paris, France, to Picatinny Arsenal near
  Dover, New Jersey, and to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. With two of
  the moves I skipped a grade and, encouraged by my supportive
  parents and teachers, I graduated from high school with a high
  academic record at the age of 15.<br>
  <br>
  My early interest in science was stimulated by reading an article
  on the quantum theory of the atom. But at that time I did not
  realize that physics could be a profession. My parents presumed
  that I would try to follow my father's footsteps to West Point,
  but I was too young to be admitted there. I was offered a
  scholarship to Kansas University but my parents again moved -
  this time to New York City. Thus I entered Columbia College in
  1931, during the great depression. Though I started in
  engineering, I soon learned that I wanted a deeper understanding
  of nature than was then expected of engineers so I shifted to
  mathematics. By winning yearly competitive mathematics contests,
  I was honored in my senior year by being given the mathematics
  teaching assistantship normally reserved for graduate students.
  At the time I graduated from Columbia in 1935, I discovered that
  physics was a possible profession and was the field that most
  excited my curiosity and interest.<br>
  <br>
  Columbia gave me a Kellett Fellowship to Cambridge University,
  England, where I enrolled as a physics undergraduate. The
  Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge was then an exciting world
  center for physics with a stellar array of physicists: J.J.
  Thomson, Rutherford, Chadwick, Cockcroft, Eddington, Appleton,
  Born, Fowler, Bullard, Goldhaber and Dirac. An essay I wrote at
  Cambridge for my tutor, Maurice Goldhaber, first stimulated my
  interest in molecular beams and in the possibility of later doing
  my Ph. D. research with I.I. Rabi at Columbia.<br>
  <br>
  After receiving from Cambridge my second bachelors degree, I
  therefore returned to Columbia to do research with Rabi. At the
  time I arrived Rabi was rather discouraged about the future of
  molecular beam research, but this discouragement soon vanished
  when he invented the molecular beam magnetic resonance method
  which became a potent source for new fundamental discoveries in
  physics. This invention gave me the unique opportunity to be the
  first graduate student to work with Rabi and his associates,
  Zacharias, Kellogg, Millman and Kusch, in the new field of
  magnetic resonance and to share in the discovery of the deuteron
  quadrupole moment.<br>
  <br>
  Following the completion of my Columbia thesis, I went to
  Washington, D.C. as a Carnegie Institution Fellow, where I
  studied neutron-proton and proton-helium scattering.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1940 I married Elinor Jameson of Brooklyn, New
  York, and we went to the University of Illinois with the
  expectation of spending the rest of our lives there, but our stay
  was short lived. World War II was rampant in Europe and within a
  few weeks we left for the MIT Radiation Laboratory. During the
  next two years I headed the group developing radar at 3 cm
  wavelength and then went to Washington as a radar consultant to
  the Secretary of War. In 1943 we went to Los Alamos, New Mexico,
  to work on the Manhattan Project.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as the war ended I eagerly returned to Columbia
  University as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and I
  immediately set out to revive the molecular beam laboratory which
  had been abandoned during the war. My first graduate student,
  William Nierenberg, and I measured a number of nuclear magnetic
  dipole and electric quadrupole moments and Rabi and I started two
  other students, Nafe and Nelson, on a fundamental experiment to
  measure accurately the atomic hydrogen hyperfine separation.
  During this period Rabi and I also initiated the actions that led
  to the establishment of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on
  Long Island, New York, where in 1946 I became the first head of
  the Physics Department.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 I moved to Harvard University where I taught for 40 years
  except for visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford
  University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia.
  At Harvard I established a molecular beam laboratory with the
  intent of doing accurate molecular beam magnetic resonance
  experiments, but I had difficulty in obtaining magnetic fields of
  the required uniformity. Inspired by this failure, I invented the
  separated oscillatory field method which permitted us to achieve
  the desired accuracy with the available magnets. My graduate
  students and I then used this method to measure in many different
  molecules a number of molecular and nuclear properties including
  nuclear spins, nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole
  moments, rotational magnetic moments of molecules,
  spin-rotational interactions, spin-spin interactions, electron
  distributions in molecules, etc. Although we studied a wide
  variety of molecules we concentrated on the diatomic molecules of
  the hydrogen isotopes since these molecules were most suitable
  for comparing theory and experiment. During this period I also
  consulted with various groups that were applying the separated
  oscillatory field method to atomic clocks and I analyzed the
  precautions which must be taken to avoid errors. Although our
  original molecular beam research was only with the magnetic
  resonance method, we later built a separated oscillatory fields
  electric resonance apparatus and used it to study polar
  molecules.<br>
  <br>
  In an effort to attain even greater accuracy and to do so with
  atomic hydrogen, the simplest fundamental atom, Daniel Kleppner,
  a former student, and I invented the atomic hydrogen maser. We
  then used it for accurate measurements of the hyperfine
  separations of atomic hydrogen, deuterium and tritium and for
  determining the extent to which the hyperfine structure was
  modified by the application of external electric and magnetic
  fields. We also participated with Robert Vessot and others in
  converting a hydrogen maser to a clock of unprecedented
  stability.<br>
  <br>
  While these experiments were being carried out with some of my
  graduate students, I worked with other students and associates to
  apply similar precision methods to beams of polarized neutrons.
  At the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, we measured
  accurately the magnetic moment of the neutron, set a low limit to
  the electric dipole moment of the neutron as a test of time
  reversal symmetry and discovered and measured the parity
  non-conserving rotations of the spins of neutrons passing through
  various materials.<br>
  <br>
  Concurrently with my molecular and neutron beam research, I was
  also teaching and involved with other scientific activities. I
  was director of the Harvard Cyclotron during its construction and
  early operation and participated in proton-proton scattering
  experiments with that cyclotron. I was later chairman of the
  joint Harvard-MIT committee managing the construction of the 6
  GeV Cambridge Electron Accelerator and used that device for
  various particle physics experiments including electron-proton
  scattering. For a year and a half I was on leave from Harvard as
  the first Assistant Secretary General for Science (Science
  Advisor) in NATO where I initiated the NATO programs for Advanced
  Study Institutes, Fellowships and Research Grants. For sixteen
  exciting years I was on leave half time from Harvard as President
  of Universities Research Association which exercised its
  management responsibilities for the construction and operation of
  the Fermilab accelerator through two outstanding laboratory
  directors, Robert R. Wilson and Leon Lederman.<br>
  <br>
  Although I am primarily an experimental physicist, theoretical
  physics is my hobby and I have published several theoretical
  papers including early discussions of parity and time reversal
  symmetry, the first successful theory of the NMR chemical shifts,
  theories of nuclear interactions in molecules and the theory of
  thermodynamics and statistical mechanics at negative absolute
  temperatures.<br>
  <br>
  I officially retired from Harvard in 1986, but I have remained
  active in physics. For one year I was a research fellow at the
  Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics at the University of
  Colorado and I now periodically revisit JILA as an Adjunct
  Research Fellow. Subsequent to our year in Colorado, I have been
  visiting professors at The University of Chicago, Williams
  College and the University of Michigan. I continue writing and
  theoretical calculations in my Harvard office and with my
  collaborators we are continuing our neutron experiments at
  Grenoble.<br>
  <br>
  After Elinor died in 1983, I married Ellie Welch of Brookline,
  Massachusetts and we now have a combined family of seven children
  and six grandchildren. We enjoy downhill and cross country
  skiing, hiking, bicycling and trekking as well as musical and
  cultural events.<br>
  <br>
  I have greatly enjoyed my years as a teacher and research
  physicist and continue to do so. The research collaborations and
  close friendships with my eighty-four graduate students have
  given me especially great pleasure. I hope they have learned as
  much from me as I have from them.</p>
