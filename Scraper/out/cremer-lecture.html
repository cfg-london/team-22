  <h2>The Progress and Advantages of International Arbitration</h2>

  <p>For many reasons I regret the delay which
  has taken place in my appearance here. Ever since the Nobel
  Committee awarded me the prize, I have been anxious to fulfill
  the condition which they impose upon the recipient, that he
  should visit Christiania [Oslo] and deliver an address upon the
  subject of arbitration and peace.</p>

  <p>Several circumstances entirely beyond my
  control have led to the delay, a delay which I deeply regret and
  for which I ask you to excuse me.</p>

  <p>Travelers anxious to reach their journey's
  end, occasionally ask themselves how far they have got and how
  much farther they have to go before they reach the goal of their
  hopes. The progress they have made can be easily ascertained, but
  the remaining distance and possible accidents on the way are more
  difficult to calculate.<br>
  <br>
  In the time at our disposal this evening, we pilgrims of peace
  might imitate the traveler and note how many milestones we have
  passed: whether we have made any real progress, whether we have
  any cause for rejoicing, whether any - and if so, what - real
  obstacles are still to be overcome.</p>

  <p>For a long time the friends of peace were
  preaching and saying what <i>ought</i> to be done. I propose to
  tell you something about what <i>has</i> been done.</p>

  <p>First - and I hope that you will agree with
  me - we have been fortunate in enlisting the sympathies and
  securing the support of the monarch<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> who sits on the British throne and
  to whom the world owes a debt of gratitude for using his best
  influence on behalf of the cause of peace. In the past, monarchs
  have so rarely used their influence in the cause of amity, that
  the example set by King Edward is the more notable, and one of
  the most hopeful signs of the times.</p>

  <p>Thirty-four years ago, when the organization of which I am
  secretary<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> formulated a plan
  for the establishment of a "High Court of Nations", we were
  laughed to scorn as mere theorists and utopians, the scoffers
  emphatically declaring that no two countries in the world would
  ever agree to take part in the establishment of such a court.</p>

  <p>Today we proudly point to the fact that the Hague Tribunal
  <i>has</i> been established<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>;
  and notwithstanding the unfortunate blow it received in the early
  stages of its existence by the Boer War<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and the attempt on the part of
  some nations to boycott it, there is now a general consensus of
  opinion that it has come to stay - and thanks to the munificence
  of Mr. Carnegie, this high court of nations will be provided with
  a permanent home in a Palace of Peace<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>If evidence had been wanting as to the desirability and
  usefulness of such a tribunal, the recent "Dogger Bank" incident
  <a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> supplied it. Had there been
  no tribunal in existence, Russia and Great Britain would probably
  have taken months to consider whether the so-called outrage was a
  fit subject to be referred to arbitration, and that delay would
  have been used by the crimson press to lash the public mind into
  a state of frenzy and to render a pacific solution impossible.
  But the very fact that the peaceful machinery was at hand, ready
  to be set in motion, suggested its employment, and
  notwithstanding the frantic efforts of some British journals to
  provoke a conflict, the two governments in a few days agreed to
  resort to the friendly offices of the Hague Tribunal.</p>

  <p>During the last century the number of disputes settled by
  arbitration or friendly mediation amounted to nearly 200. Many of
  the disputes were of a trifling character. Some, however, were
  very serious, the most important of all being the great dispute
  between the United States and Great Britain with regard to the
  pirate ship <i>Alabama</i><a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, until the year 1887 that the question
  entered upon what I regard as its practical stage. Up till that
  time meetings had been held, conferences arranged, and petitions
  presented to governments; but the difficulty with which the
  friends of peace were confronted was, who should begin? What
  nation would take the lead and make a practical proposal? To meet
  this difficulty and overcome these objections, memorials<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> from members of the British House
  of Commons were presented to the President and Congress of the
  United States of America, urging that the governments of the
  United States and of Great Britain should inaugurate a new era
  and conclude between them a treaty binding themselves to settle
  their differences by arbitration.</p>

  <p>Of course the scoffers again pooh-poohed the idea that any
  nations could be found willing to conclude such treaties; but
  those who ridiculed have been again put to shame, for within the
  last twelve months, thirteen treaties have been concluded between
  various nations. The countries that have bound themselves by
  these obligations are: Great Britain and France; France and
  Italy; Great Britain and Italy; Denmark and Holland; Great
  Britain and Spain; France and Spain; France and Holland; Spain
  and Portugal; Germany and Great Britain; Great Britain, Norway
  and Sweden; Great Britain and Portugal; Switzerland and Great
  Britain; Sweden, Norway and Belgium. Seven other treaties have
  also been drafted, and signed by the government of the United
  States of America, and the governments of Great Britain, France,
  Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland. With the
  exception of the treaties with the United States, which yet await
  the decision of the Senate, all the others are operative, so that
  today thirteen treaties have the force of international law.</p>

  <p>But, say the skeptics, what use are the treaties now that you
  have got them? To this I make answer that the treaty between
  France and Great Britain<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>,
  although only twelve months old, has been followed by a
  convention between the two governments in which all the
  differences between the two countries, some of which had lasted
  for centuries, have been equitably adjusted and the decisions of
  the convention endorsed by both parliaments. So today France and
  Great Britain, whose sons had frequently slaughtered each other
  and wasted the resources of both nations, are now living on terms
  of the most cordial friendship without a cloud on the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>Another notable instance is afforded of the advantages of
  treaties of arbitration. The two South American republics, Chile
  and Argentina, which had been frequently in conflict, having
  solemnly bound themselves by treaty to settle their disputes by
  arbitration, finding that they had no use for their ironclads and
  vessels of war, have been disposing of them to Russia, Great
  Britain, and any other power that chooses to purchase them.</p>

  <p>The latter affords an excellent illustration of the wisdom of
  our policy in advocating arbitration first, with the conviction
  on our part that disarmament would be sure to follow. The one we
  have always regarded as the <i>means</i>; the other as the
  <i>end</i> to be attained.</p>

  <p>Amongst the advantages which we have contended that nations
  would reap from entering into treaties of arbitration are, that
  when differences arose, the disputants would have time for
  reflection, because, while the arbitrators were deliberating, the
  passions of the contending parties would cool, and the chances of
  war be greatly diminished.</p>

  <p>Again, at the first rumors of war, the market price of many
  necessary commodities is affected, especially articles which are
  crossing the seas and upon which the premium for insurance is
  increased, all such increases having ultimately to be paid for by
  the consumer.</p>

  <p>Such treaties would also weaken the baneful influence of panic
  mongers and serve to protect honest investors from being
  defrauded by stock exchange gamblers. At the first rumors of war,
  timid investors in various government stock, being
  panic-stricken, sell out, to their loss and the gamblers' gain.
  This evil would be lessened, if not obviated, as investors would
  not rush to sell out, knowing as they would, that war could not
  take place until after the dispute had been referred to
  arbitration.</p>

  <p>A notable illustration of the advantages of arbitration is
  afforded by the late Boer War. If the points in dispute between
  the two governments had been referred to arbitration, as the
  Boers desired, the thousands of lives of heroic men and women
  which were sacrificed, the untimely deaths of 15,378 children in
  the concentration camps, the devastation wrought, the misery
  endured, and the 250 millions of money expended, would all have
  been saved.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So far, I have been referring to some of the good work which
  has been done, and now I propose to say something about
  <i>how</i> it has been done.</p>

  <p>Thirty-four years ago, the British and French workmen
  inaugurated a series of conferences and meetings and the
  circulation of mutual addresses to their countrymen in favor of a
  better understanding between the peoples<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>These efforts have been continued during the whole of that
  time and at last have culminated in the Treaty of Arbitration
  between France and England - the first treaty of that nature
  concluded between any of the nations of Europe. The example thus
  set has already led to the series of treaties I have previously
  referred to.</p>

  <p>The victory which has been achieved is therefore a people's
  victory, and this is the opinion emphatically expressed by the
  great French orator and popular leader, Mr. Jaur&egrave;s<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I have previously referred to the efforts which were made in
  1887 and the following years in favor of an Anglo-American Treaty
  of Arbitration when two memorials in favor of such a treaty were
  signed, the first by 234 and the second by 364 members of the
  British Parliament. These memorials were unique. It was the first
  instance on record of the members of one parliament addressing
  the members of another. These influentially signed memorials were
  supplemented by a unanimous vote of the British House of
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Ultimately a treaty was drafted<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, signed by both governments,
  endorsed by a large majority of the Senate, but failed, for want
  of three votes, to secure the requisite two-thirds majority. At
  the present moment, however, another treaty has been signed by
  the two governments and is now being considered by the
  Senate.</p>

  <p>But out of that failure a new force sprang into existence.
  That force is now known as the Interparliamentary Union.</p>

  <p>The Interparliamentary Conferences, which have led to the
  formation of that Union, began in 1888 with the meeting of
  thirty-eight British and French parliamentary representatives at
  Paris. Since then conferences have been held in London, Rome,
  Bern, The Hague, Brussels, Budapest, Christiania, Paris, Vienna,
  and last year at St. Louis. From that small meeting in Paris
  groups have been formed in every parliament of Europe except
  Spain.</p>

  <p>The Union has now nearly 2,000 adherents, and the latest
  addition is the formation of a group in the Congress of the
  United States of America.</p>

  <p>The influence and power of the Union is now recognized. The
  conferences are held in senate chambers, and governments make
  grants toward the expenses.</p>

  <p>When the history of the Union comes to be written, it will be
  found that during the time when there was considerable friction
  and danger of war between Italy and France, the appeals made by
  the Union to the members of the Italian Parliament produced an
  excellent effect and were largely instrumental in preventing
  strife between those two nations.</p>

  <p>It is also a matter of history that the Czar was induced to
  issue his Rescript, which led to the Hague Convention, by the
  proceedings of the conference at Budapest<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It has also brought into contact with each other and paved the
  way for a good understanding between the members of the
  parliaments of Europe and the United States. Its latest
  achievement was to induce the President of that great country to
  undertake the task of convening another conference of the nations
  to complete the work which the Hague Convention left unfinished.
  To the Union, therefore, is due the credit of having brought
  about the convention at the Hague which systematized arbitration
  and provided nations with an alternative method of settling their
  disputes.</p>

  <p>To the Union is also due the credit of influencing President
  Roosevelt<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> to summon
  another convention, and although the invitations to that
  convention do not specify that disarmament will be considered,
  the strong and constantly increasing desire which exists upon the
  subject - especially in France - will force the convention
  seriously to consider the cost and danger of armaments and
  whether they are really peace-preserving, or war-provoking
  institutions.</p>

  <p>The object lesson of the war between Japan and Russia<a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>, with its unparalleled holocaust,
  will make it practically impossible for the convention to
  disregard the question of disarmament.</p>

  <p>To the industrial classes, the subject is of supreme
  importance. The workers have to pay, and the workers have to
  fight.</p>

  <p>The task before us is a mighty one. All the vested interests
  and people who profit by war will - with the journals they
  control - resolutely oppose any reduction of armaments.</p>

  <p>But science is rapidly becoming a powerful auxiliary of peace;
  the restiveness of the burden bearers and the growing political
  power of the people are also factors which will have to be
  reckoned with in the great struggle between the supporters of
  barbarism, and the higher civilization.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In this brief summary of efforts made and victories won, I
  have abstained from any reference to the part which I have been
  privileged to take in promoting the Anglo-American Treaty of
  Arbitration, which was the first organized effort ever made for
  such a purpose and which lifted the question on to a higher plane
  and brought it within the domain of practical politics.
  Incidentally I may state that every senator of the United States
  has just received a memorial urging that body to ratify the
  Anglo-American Treaty of Arbitration which is now before it. The
  memorial is signed by 7,452 officers of industrial organizations
  in Great Britain, and these organizations have a membership
  exceeding two and three-quarter millions.</p>

  <p>Concerning the long-continued efforts which were necessary to
  bring the French and British people into line, the initiation and
  organization of the first Interparliamentary Conferences, the
  multifarious labors in the cause of peace in which I have been
  engaged during the past thirty-four years, I express no opinion,
  leaving my actions and doings to the judgment of my
  fellowmen.</p>

  <p>Some people, however, appear to have lost heart because Japan
  and Russia are engaged in a sanguinary conflict. But the most
  ardent advocates of peace never expected that treaties of
  arbitration would at once put an end to all wars, any more than
  those who, when mankind was emerging from barbarism, first framed
  crude laws and set up rude courts of justice, expected that by so
  doing all men would immediately cease to fight out their personal
  differences.</p>

  <p>Our forefathers, however, were not disheartened. The courts
  were continued for those who preferred to use them, and now we
  seldom hear of individual disputes being settled by brute force.
  What was formerly the universal practice is now regarded as
  degrading and brutalizing.</p>

  <p>That is what we believe will be the ultimate effect upon
  nations of concluding treaties and setting up tribunals.</p>

  <p>It may be that for a long time some nations will continue to
  fight each other, but the example of those nations who prefer
  arbitration to war, law courts to the battlefield, must sooner or
  later influence the belligerent powers and make war as unpopular
  as pugilism is now.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, if I have not exhausted my subject, I fear that I
  must have exhausted my audience.</p>

  <p>I cannot, however, conclude without heartily thanking the
  Nobel Committee for having honored me with their suffrages,
  awarded me the magnificent prize, and afforded me the opportunity
  of enabling the International Arbitration League to continue its
  useful work when I am gone.</p>

  <p>It has been the great object of my life to build up and endow
  a great peace organization which should be powerful enough to
  combat the forces which make for war, and thanks to the Nobel
  Committee, I have been able to do a great deal in that direction.
  Nearly the whole of the fund placed at my disposal has been given
  to and profitably invested for the use of the League.</p>

  <p>My only regret is that I am unable to wholly, instead of
  partially, complete the endowment. I hope, however, that others
  may be induced to follow my example, and that before I die I may
  see the dream of my life realized.</p>

  <p>There is still a great work before us. The advocates of peace
  are, however, no longer regarded as idle dreamers, and I trust
  that I have convinced you that our cause has, especially of late,
  made wonderful progress and that we are nearing the goal of our
  hopes.</p>

  <p>The world has passed through a long night of tribulation and
  suffering, millions of our fellow creatures have been sacrificed
  to the demon of war; their blood has saturated every plain and
  dyed every ocean.</p>

  <p>But courage, friends, courage ! The darkness is ending, a new
  day is dawning, and the future is ours.</p>

  <p>Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>

  of the Palace of Peace at The Hague as a home for the Permanent

  The Dogger Bank, or Hull, incident occurred on October 21, 1904,
  when a Russian fleet on its way through the North Sea fired on
  English fishing trawlers at Dogger Bank. One vessel was sunk. The
  remaining trawlers, five of them seriously damaged, put into
  Hull, England, on October 23, with two killed and six wounded.
  The Russians claimed to have been attacked by Japanese torpedo
  boats mingling with the Hull trawlers. Although British public
  opinion was outraged, Britain referred the matter to an
  International Commission of Inquiry which, on February 26, 1905,
  reported its opinion that since "there was no torpedo boat either
  among the trawlers nor on the spot, the fire opened by Admiral
  Rozhdestvensky was not justifiable." On March 9, the Russian
  ambassador handed to the secretary of state for Foreign Affairs
  an indemnity of &pound;65,000.</p>

  During the American Civil War, a British shipyard constructed the
  <i>Alabama</i> for the Confederacy. Armed with British weapons
  received at sea and manned by a Southern captain, with a
  partially British crew, the <i>Alabama</i> destroyed Northern
  shipping in 1863. In 1871 the United States' claims arising from
  this destruction were submitted to arbitration at Geneva, and in
  1872 a decision in favor of the United States was accepted.</p>

  The Anglo-French Treaty of Arbitration, first of its kind in
  history, was signed on October 14, 1903, going into effect before
  general agreement on pending difficulties was concluded. These
  difficulties, which included problems in Egypt, Morocco,
  New-foundland, New Hebrides, and Siam, were adjusted by April,
  1904, and the arguments published.</p>

  In 1871, Cremer formed the Workmen's Peace Association. A similar
  organization was founded at about the same time in Paris. At a
  conference in Paris in 1875 fifty British delegates led by Cremer
  joined with 100 French delegates led by Auguste Desmoulins in
  establishing the Workmen's Peace Committee to advance the
  international aspects of the peace crusade.</p>

  There was no official Russian delegate to the seventh
  Interparliamentary Union Conference in Budapest (September 23-25,
  1896), but a Russian consul in Budapest, acting as an observer,
  sent to the Russian government a copy of the resolutions passed
  and later, as a member of the Foreign Office, to the Czar when
  concern about international armaments arose.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote14" id="footnote14"></a>14.
  Czar Nicholas II is generally given credit for the actual
  convening of the second Hague Peace Conference in 1907. Cremer is
  referring to President Theodore Roosevelt's remarks of September
  24, 1904, to delegates from the recently adjourned
  Interparliamentary Union meetings in St. Louis when he said, "In
  response to your resolutions, I shall at an early date ask the
  other nations to join in a second congress at The Hague", and to
  his fulfillment of this promise in the following month by the
  issuance of a circular note through Secretary of State Hay to his
  counterparts in other nations urging the calling of such a
  conference.</p>
