  <h1>C&eacute;sar Milstein - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="milstein.jpg" class="bio-img">My father was a Jewish immigrant who
  settled in Argentina, and was left to his own devices at the age
  of 15. My mother was a teacher, herself the daughter of a poor
  immigrant family. For both my mother and my father, no sacrifice
  was too hard to make sure that their three sons (I was the middle
  one) would go to university. I wasn't a particularly brilliant
  student, but on the other hand I was very active in Student Union
  affairs and in student politics. It was in this way that I met my
  wife, Celia. After graduation, we married, and took a full year
  off in a most unusual and romantic honeymoon, hitch-hiking our
  way through most countries in Europe, including a couple of
  months working in Israel kibbutzim. As we returned to Argentina,
  I started seriously to work towards a doctoral degree under the
  direction of Professor Stoppani, the Professor of Biochemistry at
  the Medical
  School. My PhD thesis work was done with no economic support.
  Both Celia and I worked part-time doing clinical biochemistry,
  between us earning just enough to keep us going. My thesis was on
  kinetics studies with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. When
  that was finished, I was granted a British Council Fellowship to
  work under the supervision of Malcolm Dixon. There, in the
  Department of Biochemistry at the University of
  Cambridge, I started a project on the mechanism of metal
  activation of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. It was through that
  enzyme that I started to collaborate with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1958/index.html">Fred Sanger</a>. I have
  described this collaboration in some detail previously (Lynen
  Lecture; Miami Winter Symp. Proc., In: "From gene to protein:
  translation into biotechnology"; Ed. W. Whelan, Academic Press,
  1982). It was after completing my PhD thesis that I took a
  short-term appointment with the Medical Research Council in Sanger's group,
  and then returned to Argentina for a period of two years. During
  that period I extended my studies of mechanisms of enzyme action
  to the enzymes phosphoglyceromutase and alkaline phosphatase. It
  was then that I had my first experience at directing other
  people's work, including my first research student. The political
  persecution of liberal intellectuals and scientists manifested
  itself as a vendetta against the director of the institute where
  I was working. This forced my resignation and return to Cambridge
  to rejoin Fred Sanger, who by then had been appointed Head of the
  Division of Protein Chemistry in the newly-formed Laboratory of
  Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council. Following
  his suggestion, I shifted my interests from enzymology to
  immunology. The evolution of my research in this area is
  described in the Lynen Lecture as mentioned above and in the
  Nobel Lecture.<br>

  Born 8 October 1927, in Bah&iacute;a Blanca, Argentina. Married in
  1953, to Celia (n&eacute;e Prilleltensky). No children.</p>
