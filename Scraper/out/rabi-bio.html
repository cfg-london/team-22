  <h1>Isidor Isaac Rabi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rabi.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Isidor Isaac Rabi</b> was born in
  Raymanov, Austria, on July 29, 1898, the son of David Rabi and
  Janet Teig. He was brought to the United States by his family, in
  1899, and his early education was in New York City (Manhattan and
  Brooklyn). In 1919 he graduated Bachelor of Chemistry at Cornell University
  (New York). After three years in non-scientific occupation, he
  started postgraduate studies in physics at Cornell in 1921, which
  he later continued at Columbia University. In 1927 he received his Ph.D.
  degree for work on the magnetic properties of crystals. Aided by
  fellowships, he spent two years in Europe, working at different
  times with Sommerfeld, <a href="../1922/index.html">Bohr</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Pauli</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1943/index.html">Stern</a>, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a>. On his
  return in 1929 he was appointed lecturer in Theoretical Physics
  at Columbia University, and after promotion through the various
  grades became professor in 1937.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 he was granted leave from Columbia to work as Associate
  Director of the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology on the development of radar and the atomic bomb.
  In 1945 he returned to Columbia as executive officer of the
  Physics Department. In this capacity he is also concerned with
  the Brookhaven
  National Laboratory for Atomic Research, Long Island, an
  organization devoted to research into the peaceful uses of atomic
  energy.<br>
  <br>
  His early work was concerned with the magnetic properties of
  crystals. In 1930 he began studying the magnetic properties of
  atomic nuclei, developing Stern's molecular beam method to great
  precision, as a tool for measuring these properties. His
  apparatus was based on the production of ordinary electromagnetic
  oscillations of the same frequency as that of the Larmor
  precession of atomic systems in a magnetic field. By an ingenious
  application of the resonance principle he succeeded in detecting
  and measuring single states of rotation of atoms and molecules,
  and in determining the mechanical and magnetic moments of the
  nuclei.<br>
  <br>
  Prof. Rabi has published his most important papers in <i>The
  Physical Review</i>, of which he was an Associate Editor for two
  periods. In 1939 he received the Prize of the American
  Association for the Advancement of Science and, in 1942, the
  Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute. He was awarded the Medal for
  Merit, the highest civilian award in World War II, in 1948, the
  King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom the same year,
  and is an Officer of the Legion of Honour.<br>
  <br>
  He is an honorary D. Sc. of Princeton, Harvard, and Birmingham
  Universities. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (was its President
  in 1950) and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American
  Philosophical Society, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959 he was appointed a member of the Board of Governors of
  the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovoth, Israel. He holds
  foreign memberships of the Japanese and Brazilian Academies, and
  is a member of the General Advisory Committee to the Arms Control
  and Disarmament Agency, and of the United States National
  Commission for UNESCO. At the International Conference on Peaceful
  Uses of Atomic Energy (Geneva, 1955) he was the United States
  delegate and Vice-President. He is also a member of the Science
  Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy
  Agency.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Rabi married Helen Newmark in 1926. They have two daughters.
  His recreations are travel, walking, and the theatre.</p>
