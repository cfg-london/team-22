  <h1>Jos&eacute; Saramago - Biographical</h1>

  <p class="smalltext"><i>Written over the author's signature and
  translated into English by Fernando Rodrigues and Tim
  Crosfield</i></p>

<p><img src="saramago.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in a family of landless
  peasants, in Azinhaga, a small village in the province of
  Ribatejo, on the right bank of the Almonda River, around a
  hundred kilometres north-east of Lisbon. My parents were
  Jos&eacute; de Sousa and Maria da Piedade. Jos&eacute; de Sousa would
  have been my own name had not the Registrar, on his own
  inititiave added the nickname by which my father's family was
  known in the village: Saramago. I should add that <i>saramago</i>
  is a wild herbaceous plant, whose leaves in those times served at
  need as nourishment for the poor. Not until the age of seven,
  when I had to present an identification document at primary
  school, was it realised that my full name was Jos&eacute; de Sousa
  Saramago...<br>
  <br>
  This was not, however, the only identity problem to which I was
  fated at birth. Though I had come into the world on 16 November
  1922, my official documents show that I was born two days later,
  on the 18th. It was thanks to this petty fraud that my family
  escaped from paying the fine for not having registered my birth
  at the proper legal time.<br>
  <br>
  Maybe because he had served in World War I, in France as an
  artillery soldier, and had known other surroundings from those of
  the village, my father decided in 1924 to leave farm work and
  move with his family to Lisbon, where he started as a policeman,
  for which job were required no more "literary qualifications" (a
  common expression then...) than reading, writing and
  arithmetic.<br>
  <br>
  A few months after settling in the capital my brother Francisco
  two years older, died. Though our living conditions had improved
  a little after moving, we were never going to be well off.<br>
  <br>
  I was already 13 or 14 when we moved, at last, to our own - but
  very tiny - house: till then we had lived in parts of houses,
  with other families. During all this time, and until I came of
  age I spent many, and very often quite long, periods in the
  village with my mother's parents Jer&oacute;nimo Meirinho and
  Josefa Caixinha.<br>
  <br>
  I was a good pupil at primary school: in the second class I was
  writing with no spelling mistakes and the third and fourth
  classes were done in a single year. Then I was moved up to the
  grammar school where I stayed two years, with excellent marks in
  the first year, not so good in the second, but was well liked by
  classmates and teachers, even being elected (I was then 12...)
  treasurer of the Students' Union... Meanwhile my parents reached
  the conclusion that, in the absence of resources, they could not
  go on keeping me in the grammar school. The only alternative was
  to go to a technical school. And so it was: for five years I
  learned to be a mechanic. But surprisingly the syllabus at that
  time, though obviously technically oriented, included, besides
  French, a literature subject. As I had no books at home (my own
  books, bought by myself, however with money borrowed from a
  friend, I would only have when I was 19) the Portuguese language
  textbooks, with their "anthological" character, were what opened
  to me the doors of literary fruition: even today I can recite
  poetry learnt in that distant era. After finishing the course, I
  worked for two years as a mechanic at a car repair shop. By that
  time I had already started to frequent, in its evening opening
  hours, a public library in Lisbon. And it was there, with no help
  or guidance except curiosity and the will to learn, that my taste
  for reading developed and was refined.<br>
  <br>
  When I got married in 1944, I had already changed jobs. I was now
  working in the Social Welfare Service as an administrative civil
  servant. My wife, Ilda Reis, then a typist with the Railway
  Company, was to become, many years later, one of the most
  important Portuguese engravers. She died in 1998. In 1947, the
  year of the birth of my only child, Violante, I published my
  first book, a novel I myself entitled <i>The Widow,</i> but which
  for editorial reasons appeared as <i>The Land of Sin.</i> I wrote
  another novel, <i>The Skylight,</i> still unpublished, and
  started another one, but did not get past the first few pages:
  its title was to be <i>Honey and Gall,</i> or maybe <i>Louis, son
  of Tadeus...</i> The matter was settled when I abandoned the
  project: it was becoming quite clear to me that I had nothing
  worthwhile to say. For 19 years, till 1966, when I got to publish
  <i>Possible Poems,</i> I was absent from the Portuguese literary
  scene, where few people can have noticed my absence.<br>
  <br>
  For political reasons I became unemployed in 1949, but thanks to
  the goodwill of a former teacher at the technical school, I
  managed to find work at the metal company where he was a
  manager.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 1950s I started working at a publishing
  company, Est&uacute;dios Cor, as production manager, so returning,
  but not as an author, to the world of letters I had left some
  years before. This new activity allowed me acquaintance and
  friendship with some of the most important Portuguese writers of
  the time. In 1955, to improve the family budget, but also because
  I enjoyed it, I started to spend part of my free time in
  translation, an activity that would continue till 1981: Colette,
  <a href="../1951/index.html">P&auml;r Lagerkvist</a>, Jean
  Cassou, Maupassant, Andr&eacute; Bonnard, Tolstoi, Baudelaire,
  &Eacute;tienne Balibar, Nikos Poulantzas, Henri Focillon, Jacques
  Roumain, Hegel, Raymond Bayer were some of the authors I
  translated. Between May 1967 and November 1968, I had another
  parallel occupation as a literary critic. Meanwhile, in 1966, I
  had published <i>Possible Poems,</i> a poetry book that marked my
  return to literature. After that, in 1970, another book of poems,
  <i>Probably Joy</i> and shortly after, in 1971 and 1973
  respectively, under the titles <i>From this World and the
  Other</i> and <i>The Traveller's Baggage,</i> two collections of
  newspaper articles which the critics consider essential to the
  full understanding of my later work. After my divorce in 1970, I
  initiated a relationship, which would last till 1986, with the
  Portuguese writer Isabel da N&oacute;brega.<br>
  <br>
  After leaving the publisher at the end of 1971, I worked for the
  following two years at the evening newspaper Di&aacute;rio de
  Lisboa, as manager of a cultural supplement and as an
  editor.<br>
  <br>
  Published in 1974 with the title <i>The Opinions the DL Had,</i>
  those texts represent a very precise "reading" of the last time
  of the dictatorship, which was to be toppled that April. In April
  1975, I became deputy director of the morning paper Di&aacute;rio
  de N&oacute;ticias, a post I filled till that November and from
  which I was sacked in the aftermath of the changes provoked by
  the politico-military coup of the 25th November which blocked the
  revolutionary process. Two books mark this era: <i>The Year of
  1993,</i> a long poem published in 1975, which some critics
  consider a herald of the works that two years later would start
  to appear with <i>Manual of Painting and Calligraphy,</i> a
  novel, and, under the title of <i>Notes,</i> the political
  articles I had published in the newspaper of which I had been a
  director.<br>
  <br>
  Unemployed again and bearing in mind the political situation we
  were undergoing, without the faintest possibility of finding a
  job, I decided to devote myself to literature: it was about time
  to find out what I was worth as a writer. At the beginning of
  1976, I settled for some weeks in Lavre, a country village in
  Alentejo Province. It was that period of study, observation and
  note-taking that led, in 1980, to the novel <i>Risen from the
  Ground,</i> where the way of narrating which characterises my
  novels was born. Meanwhile, in 1978 I had published a collection
  of short stories, <i>Quasi Object;</i> in 1979 the play <i>The
  Night,</i> and after that, a few months before <i>Risen from the
  Ground,</i> a new play, <i>What shall I do with this Book?</i>
  With the exception of another play, entitled <i>The Second Life
  of Francis of Assisi,</i> published in 1987, the 1980s were
  entirely dedicated to the Novel: <i>Baltazar and Blimunda,</i>
  1982, <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,</i> 1984, <i>The
  Stone Raft,</i> 1986, <i>The History of the Siege of Lisbon,</i>
  1989. In 1986, I met the Spanish journalist Pilar del R&iacute;o.
  We got married in 1988.<br>
  <br>
  In consequence of the Portuguese government censorship of <i>The
  Gospel According to Jesus Christ</i> (1991), vetoing its
  presentation for the European Literary Prize under the pretext
  that the book was offensive to Catholics, my wife and I
  transferred our residence to the island of Lanzarote in the
  Canaries. At the beginning of that year I published the play
  <i>In Nomine Dei,</i> which had been written in Lisbon, from
  which the libretto for the opera <i>Divara</i> would be taken,
  with music by the Italian composer Azio Corghi and staged for the
  first time in M&uuml;nster, Germany in 1993. This was not the
  first cooperation with Corghi: his also is the music to the opera
  <i>Blimunda,</i> from my novel <i>Baltazar and Blimunda,</i>
  staged in Milan, Italy in 1990. In 1993, I started writing a
  diary, <i>Cadernos de Lanzarote</i> (Lanzarote Diaries), with
  five volumes so far. In 1995, I published the novel
  <i>Blindness</i> and in 1997 <i>All the Names.</i> In 1995, I was
  awarded the Cam&otilde;es Prize and in 1998 the Nobel Prize for
  Literature.</p>
