  <h1>Sir Henry Dale - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dale.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Henry
  Hallett Dale</b> was born in London on June 9, 1875. He attended
  Leys School, Cambridge, and in 1894 he entered Trinity College
  with a scholarship. He graduated through the Natural Sciences
  Tripos, specializing in physiology and zoology. From 1898 to 1900
  he was a Coutts-Trotter Student in Physiology at Trinity College,
  working then under J. N. Langley. In 1900 he gained a scholarship
  and entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, for the clinical
  part of the medical course. He qualified as B.Ch., Cambridge in 1903 and
  became M.D. in 1909. Meanwhile, he had been awarded the George
  Henry Lewes Studentship in Physiology and he used it to carry out
  research under Professor Starling at University College
  London. It was here that he met his lifelong friend, <a href=
  "index.html">Otto Loewi</a>. During 1903, he spent four months
  with <a href="../1908/index.html">Paul Ehrlich</a> in Frankfurt
  before returning to University College as Sharpey Scholar. He
  held this post for only six months before he took an appointment
  as pharmacologist at the Wellcome Physiological Research
  Laboratories in 1904. He became Director of these laboratories in
  1906, working for some six years with the chemical cooperation of
  George Barger.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914, Dale was appointed Director of the Department of
  Biochemistry and Pharmacology at the National Institute
  for Medical Research in London, becoming in 1928 Director of
  this Institute; and he served in this capacity until his
  retirement in 1942 when he became Professor of Chemistry and a
  Director of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory at the Royal Institution,
  London. Since 1946, he has devoted his knowledge and energies to
  the administration of the Wellcome Trust for the support of medical
  research and medical scholarships. He has been a Trustee since
  1936 and served as Chairman of the Board from 1938 until 1960. He
  was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1914 and served as Secretary
  from 1925 to 1935. During World War II, Sir Henry served on
  several Advisory Committees to His Majesty's Government. He was
  knighted in 1932 and appointed to the Order of Merit in
  1944.<br>
  <br>
  Sir Henry's researches have involved a painstaking investigation
  of the pharmacology of ergot alkaloids and a study of the effects
  of incidental bases of a simpler nature, such as tyramine and
  histamine. He discovered the oxytocic action of pituitary
  extracts, and his continued work on the action of histamine led
  to studies on anaphylaxis and on conditions of shock. He
  identified acetylcholine as a constituent of certain ergot
  extracts, and an analysis of its action served as a basis for
  later researches, extending the application of Loewi's
  discoveries, which have been recognized in the joint award of the
  Nobel Prize for 1936, given on account of the discoveries
  relating to chemical transmission of nerve impulses. In addition
  to numerous articles in medical and scientific journals which
  record his work, Sir Henry is the author of <i>Adventures in
  Physiology</i> (1953), and <i>An Autumn Gleaning</i>
  (1954).<br>
  <br>
  Sir Henry was President of the Royal Society (1940-1945),
  President of the British Association (1947), and President of
  the Royal
  Society of Medicine (1948-1950). He has received many public
  honours including the G.B.E. (Knight Grand Cross, Order of the
  British Empire) in 1948, Medal of Freedom (Silver Palm), U.S.A.,
  in 1947, the Grand-Croix de l'Ordre de la Couronne (Belgium) in
  1950, and l'Ordre pour le M&eacute;rite (Western Germany) in 1955.
  The Royal and Copley Medals of the Royal Society, the Gold Albert
  Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, the Baly Medal of the
  Royal
  College of Physicians (London), the Cameron Prize (Edinburgh)
  and the Schmiedeberg plaquette from the German Pharmacological
  Society are among the many awards he has gained, and, in
  addition, he has been awarded fellowships of numerous learned
  societies and institutions throughout the world, including the
  Royal
  Society of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge. He is
  also a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (Washington),
  Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine (Paris) and l'Acad&eacute;mie Royale
  de Belgique, as well as Academies in Denmark, Germany, Italy,
  Rumania, Spain, Sweden, U.S.A. (New York). He is the recipient of
  over twenty honorary degrees, and amongst the many lectures he
  has given are the Nothnagel Lecture (Vienna) and the Pilgrim
  Trust Lecture to the National Academy of Sciences,
  Philadelphia.<br>

  Sir Henry married Ellen Harriet Hallett, his first cousin, in
  1904. Their eldest daughter, Alison Sarah, is married to <a href=
