  <h1>Otto Wallach - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wallach.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Otto Wallach</b> was born on March 27, 1847, in
  K&ouml;nigsberg, Germany, the son of Gerhard Wallach and his
  wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Otillie Thoma. His father was a
  high-ranking civil servant, who later became Auditor General at
  Potsdam.<br>
  <br>
  During his early school years at the humanistic "Gymnasium" at
  Potsdam, Wallach had a profound liking for history and art - in
  those days subjects like chemistry were hardly taught at
  secondary-school level.<br>
  <br>
  In 1867 he went to G&ouml;ttingen to study chemistry with
  W&ouml;hler, Fittig and H&uuml;bner but soon left for Berlin to
  study for one semester under A.W. Hofmann and G. Magnus. After
  his return to G&ouml;ttingen he worked so hard that he managed to
  obtain his doctor's degree - in 1869 under H&uuml;bner - after
  studying for only five semesters. (At that time working hours at
  the W&ouml;hler laboratory were from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m., after
  which gas was turned off and some work had to be rounded-off
  under the light of privately bought candles.) His thesis dealt
  with the position isomers in the toluene series.<br>
  <br>
  In 1869 and 1870 he was assistant to H. Wichelhaus in Berlin,
  with whom he worked on the nitration of b-naphthol. Easter 1870
  found him in Bonn with
  Kekul&eacute;. The latter, himself an artist at heart and who once
  seriously considered making architecture his profession, had
  written to Wallach: "It will not hurt you to come to Bonn. Here
  we are leading a scientific artist life." That same year,
  however, Wallach had to leave Bonn for military service in the
  Franco-Prussian war.<br>
  <br>
  After the war he tried for the third time to establish himself in
  Berlin, working with a newly founded firm "Aktien-Gesellschaft
  f&uuml;r Anilin-Fabrikation" (later "Agfa"), but his fragile
  health could not stand the noxious fumes of the factory, and in
  1872 he returned to Bonn, where he stayed for 19 years. He first
  became assistant in the organic laboratory, and later was
  appointed Privatdozent. In 1876 came his appointment as Professor
  Extraordinary. When in 1879 the Chair of Pharmacology became
  vacant he was obliged to occupy it, which forced him to
  specialize in this direction. It was during this period that he
  discovered the iminochlorides by the action of phosphorus
  pentachloride on the acid amides. But when Kekul&eacute; drew his
  attention to the existence of an old forgotten cupboard full of
  bottles containing essential oils, and invited him to make a
  study of the contents, he became absorbed in the matter, thus
  entering a field of study in which he was to be the eminent
  pioneer for more than a decade, and which was to be his main
  life-work, crowned with the highest possible distinction.<br>
  <br>
  Already in his first publication (1884) he raised the question of
  the diversity of the various members of the
  C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> group, which in current practice at
  that time came under a multitude of names ranging from terpene to
  camphene, citrene, carvene, cinene, cajuputene, eucalyptine,
  hesperidine, etc. Utilizing common reagents such as hydrogen
  chloride and hydrogen bromide, he succeeded in characterizing the
  differences between the structure of these compounds. A year
  later he could establish that many of them were indeed identical.
  In 1909 he published the results of his extensive studies in his
  book <i>Terpene und Campher</i>, a volume of 600 pages dedicated
  to his pupils.<br>
  <br>
  Mention should also be made of his other investigations; the
  conversion of chloral into dichloroacetic acid, the series of
  studies on the amide chlorides, imide chlorides, amidines,
  glyoxalines, etc., his work on azo dyes and diazo compounds, and
  many others. They all denote his practical skill: like <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a> and <a href=
  "../1905/index.html">Adolf von Baeyer</a>, he relied more on
  carefully performed experiments than on theoretical
  deliberations.<br>
  <br>
  In 1889 he was appointed Victor Meyer's successor in
  W&ouml;hler's Chair, which made him at the same time Director of
  the Chemical Institute at G&ouml;ttingen. He retired in 1915 from
  these posts when at the start of World War I six of his
  assistants were killed in action.<br>
  <br>
  Wallach received the Nobel Prize in 1910 for his work on
  alicyclic compounds. His other honours included Honorary
  Fellowships of the Chemical Society (1908), Honorary Doctorates
  of the Universities of Manchester, Leipzig and the
  Technological
  Institute of Braunschweig. In 1912 he became Honorary Member
  of the Verein Deutscher Chemiker. He received the Kaiserlicher
  Adlerorden III. Klasse (Imperial Order of the Eagle) in 1911, the
  Davy Medal in Gold and Silver in 1912, and in 1915 the
  K&ouml;niglicher Kronorden II. Klasse (Royal Order of the
  Crown).<br>
  <br>
  Wallach remained a bachelor throughout his life, and died on
  February 26, 1931.</p>
