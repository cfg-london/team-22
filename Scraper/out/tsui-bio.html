  <h1>Daniel C. Tsui - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tsui.jpg" class="bio-img"> I tend to
  partition my life into three compartments: childhood years in a
  remote village in the province of Henan in central China,
  schooling years in Hong Kong, and the years since I came to
  attend college in the United States. The only thread connecting
  them is the kindness, generosity and friendship from the people
  around me that I have experienced all my life.<br>
  <br>
  My childhood memories are filled with the years of drought, flood
  and war which were constantly on the consciousness of the
  inhabitants of my over-populated village, but also with my
  parents' self-sacrificing love and the happy moments they created
  for me. Like most other villagers, my parents never had the
  opportunity to learn how to read and write. They suffered from
  their illiteracy and their suffering made them determined not to
  have their children follow the same path at any and whatever cost
  to them. In early 1951, my parents seized the first and perhaps
  the only opportunity to have me leave them and their village to
  pursue education in so far away a place that neither they nor I
  knew how far it truly was.<br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, I began my formal schooling at the sixth grade
  level with fear and trembling, mixed with some pride and elation.
  I remember the difficulties that I encountered in not knowing the
  Cantonese dialect in the beginning, but, even more vividly, the
  overwhelming kindness of schoolmates who went out of their way to
  help by offering me their friendship, bringing me into their
  circle, and taking me to their out-of-class activities. In the
  middle of my second year in Hong Kong, I entered Pui Ching Middle
  School, which was known for being outstanding, especially in
  natural science subjects. Many of the teachers there were
  overqualified. They were the brightest graduates of the best
  universities in China and under normal circumstances would have
  been highly accomplished scholars and scientists. The upheaval of
  war in China, however, forced them to hibernate in Hong Kong
  teaching high school kids. They might not have been the best
  teachers pedagogically, but their intellects and their visions
  inspired us. Even their casual remarks and the stories from their
  romantic reminiscences of the glorious days at Peking
  University could leave indelible marks on us. It was they, I
  think, who in their unconscious ways dared us students, living in
  a most commercialized city, to look beyond the dollar sign and
  see the exploration of new frontiers in human knowledge as an
  intellectually rewarding and challenging pursuit.<br>
  <br>
  I graduated from Pui Ching in 1957 and was admitted to the
  medical school of National Taiwan University in Taiwan. However,
  since it was unclear at the time how my parents were and whether
  I could return to them in China, I stayed in Hong Kong and
  entered a two-year special program run by the government to
  prepare Chinese high school graduates for the University of Hong
  Kong. In late spring the next year, I received the surprising
  good news from the United States that I was admitted with a full
  scholarship to my church pastor's Lutheran alma mater, Augustana College
  in Rock Island, Illinois. I arrived on campus right after Labor
  Day 1958, and there spent the best three years of my life. It was
  there that I had for the first time the leisure to wrestle with
  my Lutheran faith and to think through and make some sense out of
  my life experience. In Hong Kong, I was always extremely busy as
  a scholarship student, heavily involved with church activities
  and responsibilities, and worn-out from long distance daily
  commuting. Here, I was free to read, to learn and to think
  through things at my own pace. I knew from the start that I would
  go to graduate school, and the choice of subject and school was
  never a problem. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/index.html">C.N. Yang</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/index.html">T.D. Lee</a> were awarded
  the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1957 and they both went to the
  University of
  Chicago. Yang and Lee were the role models for Chinese
  students of my generation and going to the University of Chicago
  for a graduate education was the ideal pilgrimage.<br>
  <br>
  The University of Chicago was intense and intellectual. I liked
  its being in a major city, its cosmopolitan atmosphere, and even
  its grimy buildings and the austerity they appeared to convey.
  There, I luckily met and fell in love with Linda Varland, an
  undergraduate in the college, and we were married after her
  graduation. I was also fortunate that Royal Stark, who had just
  joined the physics faculty as a solid state experimentalist, took
  me on as a research assistant in the building-up of his
  laboratory. I realized quite early that I wanted to do
  experimental physics and that I lacked the aptitude for colossal
  experimental setups and also the taste for grandeur. I wanted to
  do tabletop experiments and be allowed to tinker. Royal Stark
  trusted me and let me try my hands on everything in his
  laboratory. I was given the best opportunity to learn from the
  bottom up: from engineer drawing, soldering, machining, and
  design, to construction and building of our laboratory apparatus.
  By the time I received my Ph.D., I was confident that I could
  make a living using the technical skills I had learned there.
  Since I could always fall back on a job using my technical
  skills, I reasoned, why not then take a risk and try a research
  position doing something entirely novel and at the same time
  intellectually challenging.<br>
  <br>
  I left Chicago in early spring 1968 and took a position in Bell
  Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to do research in solid
  state physics. I found myself a niche in semiconductor research,
  though I never got into the main stream either in semiconductor
  physics, which was mostly optics and high energy band-structures,
  or its use in device applications. I wandered into a new
  frontier, which was dubbed the physics of two-dimensional
  electrons. In February 1982, shortly after the discovery of the
  fractional quantum Hall effect, I moved to Princeton and started
  teaching.<br>
  <br>
  Many of my friends and esteemed colleagues had asked me: "Why did
  you choose to leave Bell Laboratories and go to Princeton
  University?". Even today, I do not know the answer. Was it to do
  with the schooling I missed in my childhood? Maybe. Perhaps it
  was the Confucius in me, the faint voice I often heard when I was
  alone, that the only meaningful life is a life of learning. What
  better way is there to learn than through teaching!</p>
