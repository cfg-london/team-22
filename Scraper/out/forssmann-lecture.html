  <h2>The Role of Heart Catheterization and Angiocardiography in
  the Development of Modern Medicine</h2>

  <p>The ancient world and the Middle Ages had
  no idea of the existence of the circulation of the blood. It was
  not until the Late Renaissance that efforts were made to grasp
  this process anatomically and understand its function. Thus,
  Miguel Serveto searched in vain for a connection between the
  right heart and the left, and in so doing discovered the lesser
  circulation in 1553. In 1569, Caesalpinus traced the path of the
  large circulation. Jacobus Sylvius (1543), Canani (1564), and
  Fabricius of Aquapendente (1574) concurred in recognizing the
  centripetal movement of the venous bloodstream from the structure
  and arrangement of valves in the veins. Before their time it had
  been believed that blood flowed outwards to the periphery, even
  in the veins.</p>

  <p>William Harvey, one of the most gifted
  pupils of Fabricius (1578-1657), combined all these individual
  findings with the results of his own research to form the general
  picture of what we today call the circulation of the blood. But
  even he had no clear idea of the circulation in the region of the
  capillaries. This section was explained and described for the
  first time by Malpighi in 1661, after he had viewed a frog's lung
  under a microscope.</p>

  <p>In any event, it is the year 1628, in which
  Harvey published his classic work <i>De motu cordis et
  sangunis</i>, that we can call the birth-year of cardiology.</p>

  <p>However, this great discovery appears to
  have had no immediate effect on the method of observing the
  function of the sound and sick heart. This had to wait some 170
  years, until, at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of
  the nineteenth centuries, scientific methods of examination made
  their appearance in medicine. The beginning of this epoch was
  marked by the introduction of digitalis for the treatment of
  oedema, achieved by William Withering in 1785.</p>

  <p>Further milestones on the way were the
  introduction of percussion by Auenbrugger in 1761 and of
  auscultation, by La&euml;mec. These innovations made the
  increasingly refined discoveries of the new science of pathology
  useful at the sickbed. The last landmark of this period was
  Einthoven's introduction of the electrocardiogram into clinical
  practice and research rays, discovered shortly before, enabled
  the grosser modifications of the heart's structure to be seen
  even in a living person.</p>

  <p>With this, cardiology had entered a stage
  of stagnation, which made it necessary to seek new and more exact
  methods than those hitherto available.</p>

  <p>The starting-point of the modern trend in
  research came from classic French experimental physiology,
  notably the trials on animals to obtain blood for metabolism
  experiments described by Claude Bernard in his <i>Physiologie
  op&eacute;rative</i>. In particular, the procedure employed by
  Chauveau and Marey in 1861 became the model. They were the first
  to achieve measurement of blood pressure inside the heart and the
  recording of pressure curves from the interior of the heart of a
  living animal. This was done with manometers, which were led from
  the neck vessels into both compartments of the right heart as
  well as into the left heart chamber.</p>

  <p>But even Claude Bernard, Chauveau, and
  Marey had been forestalled. As far as I know, the credit for
  carrying out the first catheterization of the heart of a living
  animal for a definite experimental purpose is due to an English
  parson, the Reverend Stephen Hales. This scientifically
  interested layman undertook in Tordington in 1710, 53 years after
  the death of William Harvey (1578-1657), the first precise
  definition of the capacity of a heart. He bled a sheep to death
  and then led a gun-barrel from the neck vessels into the
  still-beating heart. Through this, he filled the hollow chambers
  with molten wax and then measured from the resultant cast the
  volume of the heart-beat and the minute-volume of the heart,
  which he calculated from the pulse-beat. Besides this, Stephen
  Hales was also the first, in 1727, to determine arterial blood
  pressure, when he measured the rise in a column of blood in a
  glass tube bound into an artery.</p>

  <p>In 1912, Unger, Bleichr&ouml;der, and Loeb
  published a work under the title <i>Intra-arterial therapy</i>.
  They were at that time aiming at a special chemotherapy for
  puerperal sepsis. In order to bring a drug in the greatest
  possible concentration to the place where it was needed, they
  wanted to insert ureter catheters into human patients from the
  leg arteries up to the presumed height of the fork of the aorta
  and inject from there. After experiments on animals, they carried
  out vein probings on four people as a preliminary trial from the
  point of view of intra-arterial therapy. These caused no ill
  effects. No X-ray checks were used, nor were the cardiological
  aspects taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>In 1928, the Italian Montanari carried out
  probing of the right heart on animals and on the human
  cadaver.</p>

  <p>Here I may as well review my own first
  attempts at probing the right heart, undertaken in 1929 and based
  on the work of Chauveau and Marey.</p>

  <p>The reason they at first made no headway
  was because, in the years 1929-1931, all the technical
  requirements for the planned investigations were lacking and had
  first to be laboriously created. So it can be understood that it
  was some time before the broad outlines of important problems of
  developing modern cardiology could be seen emerging from my
  admittedly rather unusual experimental procedure. Perhaps it is
  significant that the pioneer work of O. Frank and Broemser on the
  development of the manometer also took place in these years.</p>

  <p>Thus the experimental methods and the
  results they yielded needed many years to come to fruition. They
  achieved their modern practical significance only because
  fundamental discoveries had been made in other fields, for
  example in modern anaesthetic techniques, in antibiotics and
  through the pioneering publications of Helen Taussig, which in
  time bore further fruit. Nevertheless, in 1930, about six months
  after my first publication, O. Klein reported from Nonnrenbruch's
  Prague clinic on a series of patients whose heart minute-volumes
  he had ascertained according to Fick's principle, by means of the
  heart catheter. This procedure has its place even today in the
  standard practice of heart and lung clinics.</p>

  <p>At the same time; I carried out my first
  experiments in angiocardiography. Here for the first time the
  living heart of a dog was successfully visualized radiologically
  with the aid of a contrast medium. Even at that time, the
  complete lesser circulation in the dog could be shown with the
  cinematographic radioscopy according to Gottheiner.</p>

  <p>Although no results could be attempted with
  human beings, because no apparatus had been devised, their
  possibility had at least been demonstrated in principle. Only
  four months after this publication, Moniz, Carvalho, and Lima
  were able to disclose rather better results. with them began the
  immense quantity of writing on angiocardiography.</p>

  <p>Further development of technique was
  impeded not only by the absence of technical essentials and
  consequent lack of knowledge. To some outsiders, ethical
  considerations also weighed heavily in the balance against it.
  And when one thinks how hard men like Cournand and McMichael had
  to fight against such people in 1941 and later, one can perhaps
  understand what difficulties stood in my way twelve years
  before.</p>

  <p>A turning-point in the history of
  cardiology is the year 1941, when Cournand and Ranges made known
  their first experiments with the heart catheter as a clinical
  method of investigation. But he will be reporting on this
  himself.</p>

  <p>The work of Cournand and Richards and their
  pupils had fanned a small flame into a blazing fire which began
  to rage all over the world. The Cournand-Richards school achieved
  particularly fruitful results in the United States and
  Scandinavia. In England, McMichael is the most important advocate
  of this method of investigation. His great service is his
  employment of it to solve pharmacological problems.</p>

  <p>For Cournand and McMichael, too, as they
  have told me themselves, the beginning was not easy. They, too,
  had strong resistance to overcome, the harder to deal with
  because people did not hesitate to obstruct practical research
  work with threadbare ethical and moral objections, such as are
  still occasionally raised today. But these voices also must fall
  silent now it has been shown, how responsibly this circulation
  research has been conducted everywhere and with what high moral
  earnestness it has been applied. And so now there is an army of
  diligent men and women at work, an army so big that it is
  impossible in this context to mention any beyond those named. You
  must pardon this omission.</p>

  <p>As for angiocardiography, this method has
  given strong new impetus not only to cardiology, but also to
  X-ray technology as a whole. Whereas earlier X-ray diagnosis
  stopped short at explaining the morphology from the reproduction
  of shadows, here a leap was made right to the core of the
  function.</p>

  <p>At this point, the close and inseparable
  interrelation of heart and lungs became obvious - something we
  had certainly guessed at, but which previously we could not
  grasp. And so, with the selective angiography of the lung vessels
  (Bolt, 1949-1950), our knowledge was consciously extended to the
  outermost periphery.</p>

  <p>With this, heart catheterization had burst
  the bounds of cardiology in the stricter sense, and now set about
  conquering other fields of research.</p>

  <p>Right at the start of my experiments upon
  animals it had occurred to me, as to other investigators, that
  one could penetrate diagonally through the right auricle from the
  upper into the lower vena cava. Now use is made of this path to
  collect blood from the liver, and it is to be hoped that many
  long-standing questions of metabolism will be solved in this way.
  The kidney, too, is accessible in the same manner. Thus it can be
  seen that heart catheterization must in no way be looked upon as
  an almost worked-out field of research.</p>

  <p>Angiocardiography, in the form in which it
  is practised today, is of course still burdened with risks which
  impose limitations on its use. Its use cannot therefore be
  justified for examinations which are not strictly necessary, but
  here, too, new possibilities can be discerned.</p>

  <p>Further development will in many cases
  enable us to dispense with the massive and dangerous quantities
  of contrast media which at the moment we still need, and to
  manage instead with smaller, less harmful amounts of radioactive
  isotopes. Their progress through the small circulation can
  already be followed in outline with Gripping's isotope retina,
  and shown graphically.</p>

  <p>From all this, we can see that modern
  cardiology has become something much more universal than was
  originally supposed.</p>

  <p>One may compare the art of healing with a
  work of art, which from different standpoints and under different
  lighting reveals ever new and surprising beauty.</p>

  <p>So, besides the epochs of cellular and
  humoral pathology and many others, we can now perhaps speak of an
  age of cardiological and circulatory investigation. We do this
  with the comforting awareness that, by the correct application of
  their teaching, earlier discoveries remain useful to us, for they
  now appear in a new light. Thus we guard ourselves against the
  mistake which runs all through the history of medicine: that of
  concentrating dogmatically upon first one, then another facet of
  research, instead of standing back to view the whole as a growing
