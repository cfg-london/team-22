  <h1>Wolfgang Paul - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="paul.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on August 10, 1913 in
  Lorenzkirch a small village in Saxony, as the forth child of
  Theodor and Elisabeth Paul nee Ruppel. All in all we were six
  children. Both parents were descendants from Lutheran ministers
  in several generations. I grew up in M&uuml;nchen where my father
  has been a professor for pharmaceutic chemistry at the
  university. He had studied chemistry and medicine having been a
  research student in Leipzig with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1909/index.html">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>, the
  Nobel Laureate 1909. So I became familiar with the life of a
  scientist in a chemical laboratory quite early. Unfortunately, my
  father died when I was still a school boy at the age of fifteen
  years. But my interest in sciences was awaken, even my parents
  were very much in favour of a humanistic education. After
  finishing the gymnasium in M&uuml;nchen with 9 years of Latin and
  6 years of ancient greek, history and philosophy, I decided to
  become a physicist. The great theoretical physicist, Arnold
  Sommerfeld, an University colleague of my late father, advised me
  to begin with an apprenticeship in precision mechanics.
  Afterwards, in the fall 1932, I commenced my studies at the
  Technische Hochschule M&uuml;nchen. Listening to the very
  inspiring physics lectures by Jonathan Zenneck with lots of
  demonstrations - 6 full hours a week - I felt being on the right
  track.<br>
  <br>
  After my first examination in 1934 I turned to the Technische
  Hochschule in Berlin. I was lucky in finding in Hans Kopfermann a
  teacher with a feeling for the essentials in physics but also a
  very liberal man, who had taken a fatherly interest in me. He, a
  former Ph.D. student of James Franck, had just returned from a
  three years stay at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen,
  working in the field of hyperfine spectroscopy and nuclear
  moments. All in all I worked 16 years with him.<br>
  <br>
  As a theorist Richard Becker taught at the TH Berlin whom I met
  later at the University of G&ouml;ttingen again. Both men had the
  strongest influence on my scientific thinking. But it was not
  only the scientific aspect. In the Germany of these days just as
  important was the human and the political attitude. And I am
  still a little bit proud having been accepted by these sensitive
  men in this respect. Here are the roots for my later engagement
  in the anti nuclear weapon discussion and for having signed the
  declaration of the so-called "G&ouml;ttinger Eighteen" in 1957
  with its important consequences in german politics.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937 after my diploma exam with Hans Geiger as examinator I
  followed Kopfermann to the University of Kiel where he had just
  been appointed Professor Ordinarius. For my doctor thesis I had
  chosen the determination of the nuclear moments of Beryllium from
  the hyperfine spectrum. I developed an atomic beam light source
  to minimize the Doppler effect. But just before the decisive
  measurements I was drawn to the air force a few days before the
  war started. Fortunately, a few month later I got a leave of
  absence to finish my thesis and to take my doctor exam at the TH
  Berlin. In 1940 I was exempted from military service. I joined
  again the group around Kopfermann which 2 years later moved to
  Gottingen. There in 1944 I became Privatdozent at the
  University.<br>
  <br>
  In these years I worked in mass spectrometry and isotope
  separation together with W. Walcher. When we heard of the
  development of the betatron by D. Kerst in the United States and
  also of a similar development by Gund at the Siemens company,
  Kopfermann saw immediately that scattering experiments with high
  energy electrons would enable the study of the charge structure
  of nuclei. He convinced me to turn to this new very promising
  field of physics and I soon participated in the first test
  measurements at the 6 MeV betatron at the Siemens laboratory.
  Later after the war we succeeded in getting this accelerator to
  Gottingen.<br>
  <br>
  But due to the restriction in physics research imposed by the
  military government I turned for a few years my interest to
  radiobiology and cancer therapy by electrons in collaboration
  with my colleague G. Schubert from the medical faculty.<br>
  <br>
  Besides we performed some scattering experiments and studied
  first the electric disintegration of the deuteron, and not to
  forget for the first time we measured the Lamb shift in the
  He-spectrum with optical methods.<br>
  <br>
  In 1952 I was appointed Professor at the University of Bonn and
  Director of the Physics Institute, with very good students
  waiting for a thesis advisor. I was very lucky that my best young
  collaborators followed me 0. Osberghaus, H. Ehrenberg. H.G.
  Bennewitz, G. Knop and H. Steinwedel as a "house theoretician".
  Here we started new activities: molecular beam physics, mass
  spectrometry and high energy electron physics. It was a scanty
  period after the war. But in order to become in a few years
  competitive with the well advanced physics abroad we tried to
  develop new methods and instruments in all our research.<br>
  <br>
  In this period these focusing methods in molecular beam physics
  with quadrupole and sextupole lenses having already started in
  Gottingen with H. Friedburg, were further developed and enabled
  new types of experiments. The quadrupole mass spectrometer and
  the ion trap were conceived and studied in many respects by
  research students. And with the generous support of the Deutsche
  Forschungsgemeinschaft we have built a 500 MeV <i>electron</i>
  synchrotron, the first in Europe working according to the new
  principle of strong focusing. It was followed in 1965 by a
  synchroton for 2500 MeV. My colleagues H. Ehrenberg, R.H. Althoff
  and G. Knop were sharing this success with me.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years my interest turned to neutron physics with a new
  device, a magnetic storage ring for neutrons.<br>
  <br>
  U. Trinks and K.J. K&uuml;gler and later my two sons Lorenz and
  Stephan, joined me in our experiments with stored neutrons at the
  ILL in Grenoble. My experience in accelerator physics brought me
  in close contact to CERN. I served there from the very early days
  on as an advisor. Having spent the year 1959 in Gen&egrave;ve I
  became director of the nuclear physics division for the years
  1964 - 67. I was for several years member and later chairman of
  the Scientific Policy Committee and for many years scientific
  delegate of Germany in the CERN-Council. For a short period I was
  chairman of ECFA, the European Committee for Future
  Accelerators.<br>
  <br>
  Together with my friends W. Jentschke and W. Walcher in 1957 we
  started the German National Laboratory DESY in Hamburg which I
  joined as chairman of the directorate 1970 - 73. For several
  years I was chairman of its scientific council. In the same
  positions I served in the first years of the Kernforschungsanlage
  J&uuml;lich.<br>
  <br>
  In 1970 I spent some weeks as Morris Loeb lecturer at Harvard
  University. 1978 I was lecturing as distinguished scientist at
  the FERMI Institute of the University of Chicago and in a similar
  position at the University of Tokyo. Since 1981 I am Professur
  Emeritus at the Bonn University.<br>
  <br>
  In the past decades of recovery of German Universities and
  Physics research I was engaged in many advisory bodies. I have
  served as a referee and later as member of senate to the Deutsche
  Forschungsgemeinschaft. I was member and chairman of several
  committees: for reforming the university structure and for
  research planning of the federal government.<br>
  <br>
  Ten years ago I was elected President of the Alexander von
  Humboldt Foundation which since 130 years fosters the
  international collaboration among scientists all over the world
  in the universal spirit of its patron Humboldt.<br>
  <br>
  I was married for 36 years to the late Liselotte Paul, nee
  Hirsche. She shared with me the depressing period during and
  after the war and due to her optimistic view of life she gave me
  strength and independence for my profession. Four children were
  born to us, two daughters, Jutta and Regine, an historian of art
  and a pharmacist, and two sons, Lorenz and Stephan, both being
  physicists. Since 1979 I am married to Dr. Doris Walch-Paul,
  teaching medieval literature at the University of Bonn.</p>
