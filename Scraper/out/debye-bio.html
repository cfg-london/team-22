  <h1>Peter Debye - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="debye.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Petrus (Peter) Josephus Wilhelmus
  Debye</b> was born March 24, 1884, at Maastricht, the
  Netherlands. He received his early education at the elementary
  and secondary schools in his home town and from then on his life
  has been devoted to a search for knowledge. He continued his
  studies at the Aachen Institute of Technology (Technische
  Hochschule) and gained a degree in electrical technology there,
  in 1905. This led to his appointment as Assistant in Technical
  Mechanics at the Aachen Technological Institute, where he worked
  for two years. In 1906 Debye obtained a similar position in
  Theoretical Physics at Munich University, where he qualified as a
  University lecturer in 1910 (having obtained this University's
  Ph.D. in Physics in 1908).<br>
  <br>
  In the following year, i.e. 1911, Debye became Professor of
  Theoretical Physics at Zurich University, where he remained for two years.
  He returned to The Netherlands in 1912 when he was appointed
  Professor of Theoretical Physics at Utrecht University, and in
  1914 he moved to the University of G&ouml;ttingen, to take charge
  of the Theoretical Department of the Physical Institute. Later,
  he became Director of the entire Institute and lectured on
  experimental physics until 1920.<br>
  <br>
  In 1915 Professor Debye became Editor of <i>Physikalische
  Zeitschrift</i> and continued to act in this capacity until
  1940.<br>
  <br>
  Debye returned to Zurich in 1920, as Professor of Physics, and
  Principal of the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule. In 1927
  he held the same post at Leipzig and from 1934 to 1939 he was
  Director of the Max Planck Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm
  Institute for Physics in Berlin-Dahlem and Professor of Physics
  at the University of Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  This appointment terminated his work in Europe, and in 1940 he
  became Professor of Chemistry and Principal of the Chemistry
  Department of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, taking
  American citizenship in 1946.<br>
  <br>
  The year 1952 saw Debye's resignation of his post of Head of the
  Chemistry Department at Cornell University and his appointment
  later as Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at Cornell
  University.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Debye was wedded to Physics and Chemistry and his
  devotion to his work gained him many distinctions, and Honorary
  Doctorates have been conferred upon him by the following
  universities and learned institutes: Brussels and Li&egrave;ge;
  Oxford; Sofia;
  Mainz; Technische Hochschule, Aachen; Eidgen&ouml;sissche
  Technische Hochschule, Switzerland; and in the United States:
  Harvard;
  St. Lawrence; Colgate; Notre Dame; Holy Cross; Brooklyn
  Polytechnic; Boston College; Providence College. He holds the
  Rumford Medal of the Royal Society, London, and the Franklin and Faraday
  Medals, the Lorentz Medal of the Royal Netherlands Academy, the
  Max Planck Medal (1950) awarded by the West Germany Physical
  Society, the Willard Gibbs Medal "Chicago (1949), the Nichols
  Medal (1961), the Kendall Award (Miami, 1957), and the Priestley
  Medal of the American Chemical Society (1963); and was appointed
  Kommandeur des Ordens Leopold II in 1956.<br>
  <br>
  Debye was a Visiting Lecturer at many universities - Columbia,
  California, Paris, Li&egrave;ge, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard,
  Michigan, South California - and has been associated with
  scientific academies in many countries: Washington, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia in
  the United States of America; The Netherlands; Great Britain (the
  Royal Institute of Great Britain and the Royal Society, London);
  Denmark; Berlin, G&ouml;ttingen, and Munich (Germany); Brussels
  and Li&egrave;ge (Belgium); Royal Irish Academy, Dublin; the Papal Academy,
  Rome; the Indian Academy, Bangalore and the National Institute of
  Science (India); the Real Sociedad Espa&ntilde;ola de Fisica y
  Quimica and Academia de Ciencias, Madrid (Spain); and the
  Academies of Science of the U.S.S.R., Hungary and Argentina. The
  year 1936 saw the award of the greatest honour possible to him -
  the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.<br>

  Professor Debye is married to Mathilde Alberer and has a son
  Peter Paul Rupprecht (b. 1916) and a daughter Mathilde Maria
  (b. 1921), both married.</p>
