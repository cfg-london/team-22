  <h1>Otto Meyerhof - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="meyerhof.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Otto Fritz
  Meyerhof</b> was born on April 12, 1884, in Hannover. He was the
  son of Felix Meyerhof, a merchant of that city and his wife
  Bettina May. Soon after his birth his family moved to Berlin,
  where he went to the Wilhelms Gymnasium (classical secondary
  school). Leaving school at the age of 14, he was attacked, at the
  age of 16, by kidney trouble and had to spend a long time in bed.
  During this period of enforced inactivity he was much influenced
  by his mother's constant companionship. He read much, wrote
  poetry, and went through a period of much artistic and mental
  development. After he had matriculated, he studied medicine at
  Freiburg, Berlin, Strasbourg, and
  Heidelberg.<br>
  <br>
  In 1909 he graduated in medicine with a thesis on a psychiatric
  subject and devoted himself for a time to psychology and
  philosophy, publishing a book entitled <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur
  psychologischen Theorie der Geistesst&ouml;rungen</i>
  (Contributions to the psychological theory of mental
  disturbances) and an essay on Goethes <i>Methoden der
  Naturforschung</i> (Goethe's methods of scientific research).
  Under the influence of <a href="../1931/index.html">Otto
  Warburg</a>, however, who was then at Heidelberg, he became more
  and more interested in cell physiology. After working for a short
  time on physical chemistry with Bredig at Heidelberg, Meyerhof
  spent some time in the laboratory of the Heidelberg Clinic and at
  the Zoological Station at Naples. In 1912 he went to Kiel, where he qualified in 1913,
  under Professor Bethe, as a university lecturer in physiology;
  and lectures which he delivered at Kiel, in England and the
  United States were published as <i>The Chemical Dynamics of
  Living Matter</i>. In 1915, when Professor H&ouml;ber assumed the
  Directorship of the Institute of Physiology, Meyerhof was
  appointed Assistant. In 1918 he became Assistant Professor. In
  1923 he was offered a Professorship of Biochemistry in the United
  States, but Germany was unwilling to lose him and in 1924 he was
  asked by the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft to join the group
  working at Berlin-Dahlem, which included C. Neuberg, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/index.html">F. Haber</a>, M. Polyani,
  and H. Freundlich.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929 he was asked to take charge of the newly founded Kaiser
  Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research at Heidelberg. In 1938
  conditions became too difficult for him and he decided to leave
  Germany. From 1938 to 1940 he was Director of Research at the
  Institut de Biologie physico-chimique at Paris, where he was
  helped financially by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  In June, 1940, however, when the Nazis invaded France, he had to
  flee from Paris. Driving with his family to Toulouse, he was
  befriended by the Medical Faculty there, but escape became
  essential and a tragic flight followed. Eventually, with the help
  of the Unitarian Service Committee, he reached Spain and
  ultimately, in October 1940, the United States, where the post of
  Research Professor of Physiological Chemistry had been created
  for him by the University of
  Pennsylvania and the Rockefeller Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Meyerhof's own account of his earlier work states that he was
  occupied chiefly with oxidation mechanisms in cells and with
  extending methods of gas analysis through the calorimetric
  measurement of heat production. In this manner he studied the
  metabolism of sea-urchin eggs, blood corpuscles, and various
  bacteria and especially the respiratory processes of nitrifying
  bacteria.<br>
  <br>
  He also studied the effects of narcotics and methylene blue on
  oxidation processes, and the respiration of killed cells. The
  physico-chemical analogy between oxygen respiration and alcoholic
  fermentation caused him to study both these processes in the same
  subject, namely, yeast extract. By this work he discovered a
  co-enzyme of respiration, which could be found in all the cells
  and tissues up till then investigated. At the same time he also
  found a co-enzyme of alcoholic fermentation. He also discovered
  the capacity of the SH-group to transfer oxygen; after <a href=
  "../1929/index.html">Hopkins</a> had isolated from cells the SH
  bodies concerned, Meyerhof showed that the unsaturated fatty
  acids in the cell are oxidized with the help of the sulphydryl
  group. After studying closer the respiration of muscle, Meyerhof
  investigated the energy changes in muscle.<br>
  <br>
  Of Meyerhof's many achievements, perhaps the most important is
  his proof that, in isolated but otherwise intact frog muscle, the
  lactic acid formed is reconverted to carbohydrate in the presence
  of oxygen, and his preparation of a KC1 extract of muscle which
  could carry out all the steps of glycolysis with added glycogen
  and hexose-diphosphate in the presence of hexokinase derived from
  yeast. In this system glucose was also glycolysed and this was
  the foundation of the Embden-Meyerhof theory of glycolysis. For
  his discovery of the fixed relationship between the consumption of
  oxygen and the metabolism of lactic acid in the muscle, Meyerhof
  was awarded, together with the English physiologist <a href=
  "index.html">A.V. Hill</a>, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or
  Medicine for 1922.<br>
  <br>
  The discovery of Otto Meyerhof and his students that some
  phosphorylated compounds are rich in energy led to a revolution,
  not only of our concepts of muscular contraction, but of the
  entire significance of cellular metabolism. A continuously
  increasing number of enzymatic reactions are becoming known in
  which the energy of adenosine triphosphate, the compound isolated
  by his associate Lohmann, provides the energy for endergonic
  synthesis reactions. The importance of this discovery for the
  understanding of cellular mechanisms is generally recognized and
  can hardly be overestimated.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 Meyerhof succeeded in extracting the glycolytic enzyme
  system from muscle, retracing a pathway which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1907/index.html">Buchner</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/index.html">Harden</a> and Young had
  explored in yeast. This proved to be a decisive step for the
  analysis of glycolysis. Meyerhof and his associates were able to
  reconstruct <i>in vitro</i> the main steps of the complicated
  chain of reactions leading from glycogen to lactic acid. They
  verified some, and extended other, parts of the scheme proposed
  by Gustav Embden in 1932, shortly before his death.<br>
  <br>
  Among other honours and distinctions, Meyerhof was a Foreign
  Member of the Harvey Society and of the Royal Society of London, and a
  Member of the National
  Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A.<br>
  <br>
  As a man Meyerhof was a fine experimenter and a master of
  physiological chemistry. By temperament he was most interested in
  theory and interpretation and he had a remarkable gift of
  integrating a variety of phenomena. He spent much time daily at
  his desk and in stimulating discussions with his pupils and
  collaborators. His chief scientific work was accomplished while
  he was at Heidelberg, but he also produced much while he was in
  America; and in America also he showed that he had never
  relinquished his active interest in philosophy by presenting to
  the Goethe Biennial Celebration of the Rudolf Virchow Society in
  New York a profound and critical evaluation of Goethe's
  scientific ideas. Throughout his life he retained a great love of
  art, literature, and poetry. His interest in painting was much
  stimulated by his wife Hedwig Schallenberg, herself a painter,
  whom he married in 1914. There were three children of this
  marriage.<br>
  <br>
  In 1944 he suffered a heart attack; in 1951 another one which
  ended his life.</p>
