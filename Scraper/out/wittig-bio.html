  <h1>Georg Wittig - Biographical</h1>

  <p class="smalltext"><i>Ttranslation from the German text</i></p>

  <p><img src="wittig.jpg" class="bio-img">Born in Berlin in 1897. Doctorate and
  University Teaching Thesis in Marburg/Lahn from the Faculty of
  Chemistry. Head of Department at Braunschweig (Technical College)
  from 1932; Associate Professor at Freiburg/Brsg. from 1937;
  Professor and Faculty Director at the Institute of Chemistry,
  T&uuml;bingen, from 1944; turned down the same position as
  successor to H. Staudinger at Freiburg/Brsg.; accepted the same
  position at Heidelberg as successor to K. Freudenberg. Professor
  Emeritus since 1967.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Scientific Activities</b><i><br></i> Textbook on
  stereochemistry, 1930. Papers on the subject of ring tension and
  double bonds as well as valency tautomerism. Main research into
  organic reactions of alkali metals and elaboration of
  carbon-based chemistry. Discovery of the halogen-metal exchange
  reaction (simultaneously with H. Gilman). Development of ylide
  chemistry and, together with that, study of the Stevens and
  Sommelet rearrangements as well as intra-anionic ether
  isomerisation. Through the synthesis of the pentaaryl derivatives
  of the elements of group 5, the phosphorous ylides were
  discovered and also, in 1953, the carbonylolefins which have
  since proven to be crucial for the manufacture of synthetic
  fabrics and also important in other industrial processes. In 1942
  dehydrobenzol was proven to be a shortlived by-product, a fact
  demonstrated bye. D. Roberts in 1953 and by me, only this time
  using different means, viz. control experiments on <a href=
  "../1950/index.html">Diels - Alder</a> adducts. More recently the
  concept of the "at"-complexes as a counterpart to the "onium"
  complexes has led to the development of a new chemistry from
  which have come the sodium tetra phenylborates.<br>
