  <h2><br>The Imperatives of Survival</h2>

  <p>Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  It is nearly with a feeling of despair that I come to your
  beautiful country and city to receive this hardly deserved honor.
  Despair partly because we are living in a world where war,
  violence, brutality and ever increasing armament dominate the
  thinking of humanity; but, more so, because humanity itself gives
  the appearance of having become numbed or terrified by its own
  impotence in the face of disaster.</p>

  <p>Little thought seems to have been given to
  the effects of the fundamental changes that have taken place
  around us in the course of the last 30 years, and that are still
  taking place. Yet, the tremendous scientific and material
  developments that have taken place in this period have altered
  radically the whole structure of human society - and even
  threatened the survival of the human race. This stupendous
  scientific and material revolution has brought basic changes into
  every aspect of our lives and of the ecology in which we live.
  These scientific developments were accompanied by equally radical
  changes in our social and political structures. Of these, the
  demolition of colonialism began the dismantling, not before its
  time, of the most unjust system of racial, social and economic
  discrimination that could exist. During this period an
  ill-defined effort was developed to replace colonialism and
  economic dominance based on wealth or military supremacy, by a
  just social order that would ensure freedom from hunger, justice
  and security based on equality. The strivings for these results,
  let us face it, have not been universally successful. Hunger and
  famine still stalk vast areas of the world causing death and
  spreading disease.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this rapid revolution man
  discovered nuclear energy and harnessed it to weapons of
  destruction, Now, for the first time in the history of humanity,
  human beings have it within their power to destroy all living
  beings on this planet. Nearly as soon as it was discovered, the
  nuclear bomb was used and annihilated the populations of
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then additional countless and
  unknown thousands have been killed or damaged by nuclear "fall
  out" used experimentally.</p>

  <p>This stupendous scientific and material
  revolution has changed practically every factor in our ecology
  and society. There has never been in the history of mankind a
  revolution so fundamental or far-reaching. Never before has
  humanity been presented with so many or such grave problems.
  Perhaps as a result of this scientific revolution, or
  coincidentally with it, there has taken place a near total
  collapse of public and private morality in practically every
  sector of human relationship. The previously existing standards
  of public and private morality may have left a lot to be desired
  but at least they existed. They were regarded as standards and
  did command a certain degree of observance. Now they have ceased
  to be either accepted or observed.</p>

  <p>It is a rule of international law that
  weapons and methods of warfare which do not discriminate between
  combatants and civilians should never be used. Aerial bombings
  from balloons were outlawed; the use of "dum-dum" bullets was
  outlawed and made a crime, on the grounds that they inflict
  unnecessary suffering<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The
  bombing of hospitals and civilian targets was outlawed. All these
  principles and standards have suddenly vanished. They are not
  even mentioned by those whose responsibility it is to uphold
  them. The use of the most cruel, terrible and indiscriminate
  weapon of all time, the nuclear weapons, is not even outlawed.
  The manufacture and development of these doomsday weapons
  throughout the world is regarded as "normal" and "quite
  respectable". One of the frightening, if not shocking, aspect of
  this particular breakdown in our public standards of morality has
  been the comparative silence of many of the established guardians
  of humanitarian law.</p>

  <p>Governments go to war directly or by proxy
  without declaring war. Force, or threat of force, are constantly
  used to dominate other countries. In these undeclared wars,
  civilians, men, women and children are bombed and massacred
  indiscriminately; chemical agents are used to destroy humans,
  animals and crops. Prisoners are not only ill-treated but are
  tortured systematically in a worse manner than at any barbaric
  period of history. In many cases this is done with the direct or
  tacit approval of governments that claim to be civilized or even
  Christian. In some cases special courses in torture are conducted
  by army and police forces and new torture techniques are exported
  from country to country. Secret services are used to assassinate
  political opponents or to provoke internal dissension in another
  country or to procure the overthrow of a democratically elected
  government. In many cases leaders of governments have used their
  positions improperly to remain in power or to amass wealth. In
  other cases the overthrow of a government is followed by a
  massacre of its members and supporters. Again cases occur when
  one ethnic group seeks to supplant another in order to impose its
  domination and, for this purpose resorts to outright
  genocide.</p>

  <p>From a survey of the contemporary scene it
  is only too obvious that it is often those in authority who set
  the bad example. If those vested with authority and power
  practice injustice, resort to torture and killing, is it not
  inevitable that those who are the victims will react with similar
  methods? This does not condone savagery or inhuman conduct but it
  does provide part of the explanation for the increasing violence
  and brutality of our world.</p>

  <p>The rising generation are dismayed and
  deceived by the world we have created for them. I insist that it
  is <i>"WE"</i>, the mankind of this century, that have created
  the doomsday world in which we live. A section of the youth of
  today have not unnaturally lost faith in the future and faith in
  God; some have become cynical; some seek escape "from it all" by
  creating escapist fantasies of their own or by resorting to
  drugs; some, on the other hand, seek to pursue actively and
  idealistically the objective set out in the Universal Declaration
  of Human Rights and the achievement of General and Complete
  Disarmament. These, however, are often disheartened by the
  credibility gap between the ideas enunciated by governments, by
  religious leaders and by the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United Nations</a> itself. This credibility gap leads to
  a loss of confidence in all institutions.</p>

  <p>It is clear from this recital, that
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1952/index.html">Albert
  Schweitzer</a><a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> was absolutely
  correct when he pointed out that man had lost the capacity "to
  foresee and to forestall the consequences of his own acts". Not
  only has man lost this capacity but he does not realize that
  knowledge without wisdom and idealism is dangerous. What does
  wisdom involve in this context? A realization that the world was
  not created by man and that in tampering with nature and
  creation, man is endangering human survival. And what does
  idealism involve? An ethical belief in a duty to help human
  beings to survive and to benefit from the natural goodness and
  beauty with which Providence has surrounded humanity. It is clear
  that it is not man who has created the universe - whether you
  believe in God, or in gods or deny any divine presence - man
  cannot alter the laws that govern the universe without damaging
  it.</p>

  <p>I have drawn attention to these
  philosophical and ethical issues to underline the responsibility
  that rests on the religious leaders of the world in this
  situation. The breakdown in public and private morality is in no
  small measure due to their failure to adjust to the tremendous
  scientific revolution through which we are passing. Churches, by
  the very reason of their structures, are monolithic and do not
  adapt easily. But, in many cases they, too, have allowed
  themselves to become allied or even part of an unjust
  establishment or system. Often they have remained silent when
  they should have led the demand for justice; often they have
  resisted reform when they should have been leading the demand for
  it. It is the duty of the religious to give an unequivocal lead
  in the struggle for justice and peace. Those who believe in
  divine providence should insist that their religious structures
  provide such a lead.</p>

  <p>It is important that rulers and religious
  and political leaders should realize that there can be no peace
  without justice. Likewise, that economic conditions which condemn
  human beings to starvation, disease or poverty constitute in
  themselves aggression against their victims. Structures which
  deprive human beings of their human rights or of their human
  dignity prevent justice from being realized. Racial and religious
  discrimination also constitute acts of aggression. Very often
  those who are defending the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>
  are in fact defending the continuance of oppression or of an
  order which is unjust. This is so, particularly in the regions of
  southern Africa, where the political and economic structures are
  built upon racial discrimination and colonial exploitation.</p>

  <p>Presumably Alfred Nobel by his bequest
  intended that the individual selected to receive his award would
  avail of the occasion which he thus created to propound his
  suggestions for world peace. If I have appeared to complain
  against the existing complacency of institutional establishments
  - governmental and religious - it is to permit me to make
  concrete suggestions. The first I would like to make, deals with
  what Alfred Nobel properly describes as "the horrors of horrors
  and the greatest of all crimes" - war. This is the threat that
  hangs over all humanity at the moment. War destroys all human
  values and is the greatest danger to everything which human
  beings desire and cherish.</p>

  <p>I think that it is only right that I should
  quote here in Oslo a former Swedish Ambassador to Norway,
  Governor Rolf Edberg, who is now Chairman of SIPRI<a href=
  "#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> and who describes the meaninglessness
  of war in the nuclear age:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"In earlier wars, aggressions could be unleashed against a
    visible enemy; not so in the clinically impersonal war
    envisaged for the future, in which a human automaton, perhaps
    directed by a computer, presses a button to annihilate people
    on the other side of an ocean. Earlier wars, including the
    corporal's, were a more or less naked struggle for living
    spaces and territories; in a nuclear war there is no territory
    to conquer nor any to defend, since the attacked and the
    attackers are alike threatened with annihilation. In earlier
    wars the man at the front was presuming to be sacrificing
    himself out of loyalty to his group and in the belief that he
    had a reasonable chance to defend his family and his nation; in
    a war of hydrogen bombs everything he was supposed to defend
    will perish with him.</p>

    <p>Some meaning, whatever it was, could be imputed to earlier
    wars. The hydrogen bomb has made the waging of war an exercise
    in global futility.</p>

    <p>Truly, once we feel at liberty to monkey with the forces of
    nature, the possibilities for doing mischief are
    innumerable".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Peace then has to be the DESPERATE
  IMPERATIVE of humanity. Many imperatives flow from this only too
  obvious conclusion. These imperatives would be comparatively
  easier of achievement if those in authority throughout the world
  were imbued with an ethic that made world peace the primary
  objective and if they were inspired by a moral sense of social
  responsibility. It should be the primary role of the Churches to
  build this new morality.</p>

  <p>The practical imperatives for peace are
  many and far-reaching. But there is no shortcut and each must be
  tackled energetically. They are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>General and Complete Disarmament - including nuclear
    weapons.</li>

    <li>The glorification of peace and not of war.</li>

    <li>The effective protection of human rights and minorities at
    national and international levels.</li>

    <li>Automatic and de-politicized mechanism for the settlement
    of international and non-international disputes that may
    endanger peace or that are causing injustices.</li>

    <li>An international order that will ensure a fair distribution
    of all essential products.</li>

    <li>An International Court of Justice and legal system with
    full automatic jurisdiction to rectify injustice or abuse of
    power.</li>

    <li>An international peace-keeping force and police force with
    limited function.</li>

    <li>Ultimately, a world parliament and government.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I can already hear many say "Utopia".
  "Impossible of achievement". Of course, it will be difficult but
  what is the alternative? The nearly certain destruction of the
  human race.</p>

  <p>I cannot deal comprehensively in this paper
  with each of the 8 imperatives I have outlined but I can
  emphasize some immediate steps that can be taken and point to
  some indefensible contradictions that exist in our present
  endeavors.</p>

  <h3>
  General and Complete Disarmament</h3>

  <p>This was the accepted aim of all
  governments and of the United Nations up to the end of 1961. Why
  has this objective been dropped? Why is it never even mentioned
  now? The extent to which agreement had been reached in 1961 may
  be gauged from the two opening paragraphs of the joint
  Soviet-United States statement of 20 September 1961:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>"The goal of negotiations is to achieve agreement on a
    program which will ensure

      <blockquote>
        <p>(a) that disarmament is general and complete and war is
        no longer an instrument for settling international
        problems, and</p>

        <p>(b) that such disarmament is accompanied by the
        establishment of reliable procedures for the peaceful
        settlement of disputes and effective arrangements for the
        maintenance of peace in accordance with the principles of
        the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>The program for general and complete disarmament shall
    ensure that states will have at their disposal <i>only such
    non-nuclear armaments,</i> forces, facilities and
    establishments as are agreed to be necessary to maintain
    internal order and protect the personal security of citizens;
    and that states shall support and provide agreed manpower for a
    United Nations peace force".</li>
  </ol>

  <p><br>
  The Soviet and American draft treaties prepared at that period
  represented an extremely wide measure of agreement and few points
  of controversy remained. Yet, in a matter of a very few years
  these objectives were dropped and replaced by the "cold war". Is
  it not time that we got back to General and Complete
  Disarmament?</p>

  <p>Far from considering General and Complete
  Disarmament the major powers are engaged in the greatest arms
  race that has existed in the world. Negotiations are only aimed
  at limiting the <i>increase</i> of defensive weapons and the
  <i>increase</i> of ballistic nuclear weapons. And this, only
  because the arms race is so costly that it is bankrupting their
  economies; they can no longer afford further escalation. The
  present negotiations do not relate to disarmament - they relate
  to phased armament.</p>

  <h3>
  Nuclear Armament</h3>

  <p>While strictly speaking nuclear weapons
  come within the scope of General and Complete Disarmament, they
  should also be dealt with in the context of Humanitarian
  Laws.</p>

  <p>The arsenal of nuclear weapons is now such
  that there are now enough nuclear missiles to destroy the world
  twenty times over. Despite conferences and what are
  euphemistically called "Partial Disarmament Measures", no
  progress has been made to outlaw nuclear weapons. The nuclear
  arsenal is growing day by day. Nuclear warheads are spread all
  over the world in bases, aircraft, ship and submarines to a
  greater extent than ever before. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and
  the Non-Proliferation Treaty<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>
  have been of little value but have been used to defuse public
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>There is probably no field in which the
  credibility gap between profession and performance is greater
  than in the field of nuclear armament. As pointed out, weapons
  which are unnecessarily cruel, or weapons which are
  indiscriminate in their effect on combatants and civilian targets
  are outlawed by The Hague and Geneva Conventions<a href=
  "#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>. These are the basic cardinal
  principles of Humanitarian Law enshrined in International
  Conventions and in many United Nations resolutions. What weapon
  could be more cruel or more indiscriminate than a nuclear bomb or
  warhead? Why outlaw a "dum-dum" bullet and not an atomic bomb?
  Yet, for some unexplained reason, there has been a refusal to
  include nuclear weapons among the weapons to be specifically
  outlawed in the revised texts of the Geneva Conventions. If any
  meaningful credibility is to be given to humanitarian law or to
  the ban on nuclear weapons, the first concrete measure which
  should be taken is to OUTLAW THE <i>USE</i> OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. A
  simple Convention, or article in a Convention outlawing the
  <i>USE</i> of nuclear weapons would be a first simple step.</p>

  <p>Yet, this has not been done. Of course,
  this step should be accompanied by provisions to outlaw the
  manufacture, sale, transfer or stockpiling of nuclear weapons and
  the destruction of all existing stock. All kinds of problems, of
  course, arise as to control verification and inspection; but it
  is difficult often to escape the impression that many of these
  issues are raised only to find difficulties and to block or delay
  agreements. Why not begin simply by outlawing the USE,
  MANUFACTURE, SALE, TRANSFER and STOCKPILING of nuclear weapons or
  components thereof? Why not <i>now</i> stop completely the
  production of all nuclear weapons?</p>

  <p>Is not the real truth that all or some of
  the nuclear powers want to be free to manufacture, sell,
  transfer, stockpile and use nuclear weapons? If this is the case,
  the truth should be exposed starkly to world public opinion. The
  distribution of drugs and narcotics is outlawed. Yet,
  self-righteous and civilized governments claim the right to make
  and distribute these engines of nuclear mass destruction.</p>

  <p>For many years some governments sought to
  create the impression that they, and only they, had the secret to
  make nuclear weapons and that so long as it was only they which
  possessed this secret the world was safe. It was, of course, an
  idiotic fantasy to suggest that the technique of nuclear
  destruction could remain the secret of a few selected
  "trustworthy" powers. Or that the particular powers in question
  were worthy of such a trust. The conduct of governments in this
  era does not encourage one's trust in their judgment or in their
  integrity.</p>

  <h3>
  The Proposed United Nations World Disarmament Conference</h3>

  <p>It must be admitted that the efforts made
  through the United Nations for disarmament have been fairly
  negative; not for fault of trying but, of course, the United
  Nations can only go as far, or as fast, as its members will let
  it go. The major nuclear powers have the right to veto all
  decisions of the Security Council; in addition, out of the 138
  member states only a few have been very active on disarmament.
  The impression has been created that it is so complex that it
  must be left to the big powers; that there is an aura of magic
  relating to nuclear weapons that only the major powers really
  understand. In any event, many of the smaller states are too
  preoccupied with their own immediate problems and that of
  economic survival to get involved in disarmament; also many of
  them, for one reason or another, are themselves busy trying to
  build up armies. Let me immediately make an honorable exception
  of the Nordic countries whose steadfast and constructive
  initiatives on disarmament have been of considerable value. I
  should also mention the valuable contributions of Ghana (under
  the late President Nkrumah, which I hope will be revived by
  contemporary Ghana), Poland, Romania, Canada and India - and even
  if India has now become a nuclear power. It is sincerely hoped
  that the Non-Aligned states will again now turn their attention
  actively and persistently to the achievement of General and
  Complete Disarmament. It is they and the countries that I have
  mentioned that have the greatest interest in peace.</p>

  <p>It is now generally recognized that the CCD
  (the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament<a href=
  "#note6"><sup>6</sup></a>) which has been virtually in existence,
  in one form or another, since 1961, has achieved little or
  nothing; it seems in recent years to have successfully buried
  both the Soviet "Draft Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament
  Under Strict International Control" and the United States
  "Outline of Basic Provisions for a Treaty on General and Complete
  Disarmament in a Peaceful World". Perhaps the failure of the CCD
  was due to its structure; or perhaps the failure of the CCD was
  due to the lack of a real desire by some, or all, of the major
  powers to disarm.</p>

  <p>Because of the failure or lack of progress
  of the CCD, 36 Non-Aligned states in 1965 recommended the
  convening by the United Nations of a World Disarmament
  Conference. Somehow or another this proposal vanished into thin
  air and was forgotten until 1971 when the Soviet Union revived
  the idea. The Soviet proposal was received frigidly, and even
  with animosity, by some countries. However, finally a resolution
  was adopted by the General Assembly expressing the conviction
  that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"... it is more desirable to take <i>immediate</i> steps in
    order that careful consideration be given to the convening,
    following adequate preparation, of a world disarmament
    conference open to all states".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Someone, sometime should make a compendium
  of the gobbledegook verbiage used in United Nations resolutions.
  It is this meaningless language and everlasting procrastination
  at the UN that disenchant people, who have faith and who realize
  the dangers which our world faces. It is not the fault of the
  Secretariat but rather of those who torture words in order to say
  nothing. To talk of "taking immediate steps" after ten years of
  feet-dragging was encouraging; but we are now at the end of 1974
  and there is not yet a United Nations Disarmament Conference in
  sight - despite the call for <i>immediate steps.</i> Conferences
  are being held all over the world about every imaginable topic;
  why this slowness and hesitancy on the United Nations World
  Conference on Disarmament?</p>

  <p>These are the reasons which prompted the
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1910/index.html">International Peace
  Bureau</a> at its International Conference on Disarmament at
  Bradford to call on the General Assembly to announce on or before
  17th June 1975 the date on which it is proposed to convene the
  United Nations World Disarmament Conference.</p>

  <p>Many will ask "what is the use of calling
  another conference, after all the conferences there have been?"
  It is a valid question. The answer is that it would be nearly
  useless if it were to be left to governments only. This brings me
  to what I regard as a single most important factor in the
  struggle for peace and disarmament. Unfortunately, it is the rule
  rather than the exception that in all matters relating to war,
  peace and disarmament it is not the people who decide the issues
  but the governments. In fact, while it is nominally the
  governments which take decisions, the decisions are definitely
  influenced by a number of powerful vested interests.</p>

  <h3>
  Vested Interests and Experts</h3>

  <p>I use the words "vested interests" here in
  a broad sense to include, not only financial vested interests but
  also professional vested interests, sectarian and political
  vested interests. The issues of peace or war, or the armaments
  race versus disarmament, are never put to the people. The people
  are never given the opportunity of either knowing the facts or of
  deciding the issues. Even parliaments are often bypassed on such
  issues or only partially consulted. The real decisions relating
  to armament are taken behind closed doors by the Joint Chiefs of
  Staffs or by the General Staffs of the Defense Forces. It is they
  who are the "experts" to whom all questions relating to armament,
  disarmament, nuclear weapons, war and peace are referred. It is
  even to them that questions on Humanitarian Laws are referred.
  They are the experts to whom governments turn to for advice on
  all these vital questions on which depend the future of humanity.
  It is natural that members of governments should do so; the
  members of a government are not military experts. Therein lies
  the nerve center of our problems in regard to Complete and
  General Disarmament.</p>

  <p>Who are these "experts?" Military officers,
  often drawn from a particular caste or class of society, whose
  profession it is to prepare for war; defensive or offensive war,
  it matters not; it depends on circumstances. But to prepare for
  war they require arms. Their professional objectives must be to
  have the best army and armament possible. What is the best
  armament possible? The armament that will wreak the greatest
  destruction on any potential enemy. Therefore, the experts the
  governments rely on for advice are generals whose profession is
  war and whose objective is the building of a military machine
  equipped with the biggest and best engines of destruction it is
  possible to obtain. Their ambition is to have the greatest land,
  sea and air fire power possible. Of course, an atom bomb is more
  effective than a conventional one and therefore the experts do
  not want the use of atomic bombs outlawed. Of course, a
  fragmentation bomb will kill more people than an ordinary one,
  therefore it is desirable. Nerve gases and napalm are very
  effective killers, therefore we must be free to use them.
  "Dum-dum" bullets are of little value therefore they can be
  outlawed without any real inconvenience. An army looks more
  respectable and is less unpopular if it makes minor concessions
  to a few humanitarian concepts such as the outlawing of "dum-dum"
  bullets.</p>

  <p>So, the experts upon whom the governments
  rely for ultimate advice on disarmament are those whose
  profession it is to make war and who want bigger and more
  destructive arms. By training, by philosophy, by formation and by
  profession, they are against "General and Complete Disarmament"
  and in most cases against any form of disarmament or weapon
  prohibition. They are probably very decent, sincere and
  God-fearing men; but their profession is war and armament. They
  cannot help a bias or vested interest by reason of their
  profession and training. No conscientious objector or peace
  leader is ever likely to be consulted by a government! Why
  not?</p>

  <p>In addition to the military experts who
  advise governments on armament, there are the financial interests
  which make money out of armament and also the industrial-military
  complex that live by increased armament. To the
  industrial-military complex and to the banks and financial
  interests that finance the industrial-military complex, the arms
  race is a boon. A war faraway, such as in South-East Asia or in
  the Middle East means increased arms sales and more profits to
  the industrial-military complex; it is not unwelcome. Peaceful
  conditions in the world are not welcome to the arms industry.
  General and Complete Disarmament would spell disaster to the
  industrial-military complexes in the United States, France,
  Britain and Germany, to mention but a few of the countries that
  thrive on increased armament.</p>

  <p>The socialist countries do not have a
  profit-motivated industrial-military complex. They can therefore
  adjust more readily to disarmament. The military industrial
  complex is state owned and controlled. To them disarmament means
  an automatic switch from increased arms production to increase in
  production for industrial development and for the consumer and
  export markets. They cannot lose by disarmament, they can only
  gain. This, no doubt, accounts for the much more sincere and
  far-reaching approach of the Soviet Union to General and Complete
  Disarmament than that of the Western powers.</p>

  <p>While vested interests arising from the
  military-industrial complexes in the communist countries favor
  disarmament, the industrial-military complexes in the West are
  very powerful factors in favor of every increase in armament. It
  would be foolish to underrate the massive influence of the
  organized lobbies of military-industrial complexes in the United
  States and Western Europe. They constitute an unseen and
  unmentioned powerful force operating silently in the corridors of
  NATO and of most Western governments. Their resources are
  unlimited and their influence is great. This constitutes a huge
  vested interest which works silently against General and Complete
  Disarmament.</p>

  <p>In addition to the military and industrial
  vested interest there are also the vested interests arising from
  political or ideological considerations and that favor armament
  as part of the processes for the imposition of policies or
  ideologies on other areas. These obstacles to disarmament
  unfortunately exist all over the world. They are not the monopoly
  of one side.</p>

  <p>If I have drawn attention to the importance
  of the military, financial and ideological vested interest that
  oppose General and Complete Disarmament, it was to enable me to
  emphasize the importance of the role of Non-Governmental
  Organizations and of public opinion in the field of
  disarmament.</p>

  <h3>
  Public Opinion - "We The People ..."</h3>

  <p>Many of the results of the tremendous
  scientific revolution which has taken place in the last 30 years
  have been counterproductive and dangerous, e.g., the atomic bomb.
  However, this revolution has also brought with it some means
  which may enable us to protect ourselves from the atomic bomb and
  other engines of destruction. The advent of the mass media of
  communication (radio and TV) coupled with higher standards of
  literacy and education are giving a much greater degree of
  influence to public opinion in the world than it has ever had in
  the past. The public can now be informed as to current events and
  policies. Governments can no longer keep their actions and
  policies secret from their public. There can no longer be an
  impenetrable curtain which can prevent the spread of news and
  views. The press, radio, TV and political commentators probe deep
  into the secret activities of governments and inform public
  opinion. Once informed and alerted to the issues involved, in
  turn, public opinion can be formed and can make itself heard.</p>

  <p>This is a new development which is leading
  to a change in the center of gravity of power from governments to
  the public through the press and the mass media. This is a new
  development; it began to make itself noticed during the Vietnam
  War. It was American and world public opinion that forced the
  United States to withdraw from Vietnam. It was the first time
  that a country at war was stopped in its tracks by its own and by
  world public opinion. Before that, a government at war, rightly
  or wrongly, received the support of its people. Now, because the
  public can learn and see what its government is doing, it is able
  to curb its government. The same thing has happened and is
  happening in the Soviet Union in regard to human rights and the
  right to intellectual freedom. This is a new and welcome
  development which neither governments nor the non-governmental
  sector have as yet understood fully. It will give tremendous new
  powers to the press and the mass media. Greater vigilance than
  ever will have to be exercised to ensure that the press and the
  mass media do not become controlled by governments or financial
  interests. The non-governmental sector will have to use this new
  power constructively. In no field is it more necessary, and at no
  time was it more urgent than now, to alert public opinion to the
  danger of war that exists and to the imperatives of peace.</p>

  <p>Why do I think it necessary to inject this
  note of urgency? The answer is simple. The armament buildup has
  soared so high and is so costly that, at any time, the General
  Staff of one side or the other may warn its government: "We have
  armament superiority <i>now</i> but we will not have it in six
  months' time; therefore now is the time to strike". It does not
  matter how wrong the generals who give this advice may be; it is
  the kind of advice which influences governments and which may
  cause a crisis to explode into a full-blown war.</p>

  <p>These are the reasons why the time has come
  for "WE THE PEOPLE . .." referred to in the Charter of the United
  Nations to assert ourselves and to demand the outlawing of all
  nuclear weapons and the achievement of General and Complete
  Disarmament. It is essential that the ordinary people of the
  world should have a say as to their own survival. The
  non-governmental sector is just as qualified as the "experts" or
  those who have a vested interest in armament and war.</p>

  <p>The International Conference of the
  International Peace Bureau at Bradford has formulated a demand
  for the representation of "We the people ..." at the proposed
  United Nations World Disarmament Conference by not less than 30
  representatives from the non-governmental sector. Quite rightly
  the International Peace Bureau Conference pointed out:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"It is essential if the Conference is to succeed that effect
    be given to the spirit of the Charter so that "WE THE PEOPLE"
    can be heard. In the absence of direct democratic
    representation at the United Nations, this must be done through
    non-governmental organizations which are concerned with general
    and complete disarmament. Otherwise the World Disarmament
    Conference will represent in the main the official, military
    and industrial establishments that have vested interest in
    maintaining and increasing armaments. It is the governments and
    the industrial-military complexes that have failed so far to
    achieve disarmament. It is they who have been responsible for
    the increased military establishments and the arms race".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Unless this is done and governments can be
  persuaded to take a much more enlightened view as to the urgency
  of General and Complete Disarmament, the proposed Conference will
  be of little value.</p>

  <h3>
  The Special Role of Women</h3>

  <p>Just as the questions relating to
  disarmament are usually left to military experts and to those
  with a vested interest in armament, these questions are also
  usually regarded as the exclusive prerogative of men. Women (with
  the honorable exception of Mrs. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1982/index.html">Alva Myrdal</a><a href=
  "#note7"><sup>7</sup></a>) are excluded from disarmament
  negotiations, indeed, as they generally are from important
  government posts. Yet, it is their children and their homes that
  will be ravaged by war. In my life I have found that women have a
  much better understanding of the imperatives of peace and are
  much less easily "taken in" by the specious arguments of experts
  or diplomats. They should be given a real decisive role in all
  disarmament negotiations and conferences. War and peace is surely
  the concern of women as much as it is that of men - and perhaps
  much more so.</p>

  <h3>
  Peace and Human Rights are Inter-related</h3>

  <p>The fundamental relationship between peace
  and human rights is now recognized. Structures which deprive
  persons of their human rights and dignity prevent justice from
  being realized; and systems which condemn people to starvation or
  to substandard conditions are a denial both of human rights and
  human dignity. It is these conditions which compel people to
  resort to violence. Hence, the Universal Declaration of Human
  Rights proclaimed:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"It is essential, if man is not to have recourse, as a last
    resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human
    rights should be protected by the rule of law".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Recognition that violations of human rights
  were among the causes of war led to the adoption by the nations
  of the world the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10th
  December 1948. This historical instrument was, and remains, the
  most important declaration ever adopted by mankind. It should be
  taught as a text in all the schools; it should be displayed in
  all parliaments; it should be used as a text by the churches.</p>

  <p><i>Magna Carta</i> (England, 1215), the
  American Declaration of Independence (1776), <i>La
  D&eacute;claration des Droits de l'Homme</i> (France, 1789), Karl
  Marx's <i>Das Kapital</i> (1867) were all important historical
  documents but they were all limited in scope or territory. The
  Universal Declaration of 1948 is both universal and
  comprehensive. I cannot over emphasize the importance of the
  Universal Declaration. It provides a basis for the relationship
  between human beings and states <i>inter se.</i> The political
  and religious leaders of the world should utilize it as part of
  an effort to rebuild standards of morality that have crumbled in
  the decadence of this age.</p>

  <p>However, it is deplorable that so little
  progress has as yet been made towards its implementation. The two
  Covenants to implement it, which took over fifteen years to draw
  up are still not yet in operation. They were adopted unanimously
  but can only come into operation when signed and ratified by 35
  states. The position in regard to these two Covenants is as
  follows:</p>

  <p>International Covenant on Economic, Social
  and Cultural Rights, 1966<br>
  (adopted unanimously on 16 December 1966).<br>
  <br>
  As of December 1974 this Covenant was:<br>
  <br>
  - Signed by 51 states<br>
  <br>
  - States that have ratified or acceded: 29 states<br>
  <br>
  - Number of ratifications or accessions required to enable entry
  into operation: 35 states</p>

  <p>International Covenant on Civil and
  Political Rights, 1966<br>
  (adopted unanimously on 16 December 1966).</p>

  <p>As of December 1974 this Covenant
  was:<br>
  <br>
  - Signed by 50 states<br>
  <br>
  - States that have ratified or acceded: 28 states<br>
  <br>
  - Number of ratifications or accessions required to enable entry
  into operation: 35 states.</p>

  <p>In addition to the two Covenants there are
  also many other Human Rights Conventions that require
  ratification and implementation. But above all, there is a need
  for effective implementation mechanism at domestic and at
  international levels. May I suggest that the universities and
  youth organizations should concentrate actively on these
  questions and make their voices heard. The rising generation are
  entitled to demand of their governments that they ratify and
  implement the principles which they proclaim as being theirs and
  which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration. An active
  public opinion campaign should be mounted in every country on
  these issues.</p>

  <p>There is nothing more damaging to the
  concept of world order and peace than the massive violations of
  human rights that continue to occur in various parts of the
  world. The torture and massacres of political prisoners have
  spread like a malignant contagious disease from country to
  country. The detailed Reports of Amnesty International, which are
  not seriously challenged, provide an index to the extent and
  ramification of this malignant disease. In Southern Africa the
  imposition of racial discrimination and of slave-like conditions
  on the African populations are an affront to the principles of
  the United Nations. Likewise, South Africa's refusal to
  relinquish its illegal occupation of Namibia and its flogging of
  Namibian political prisoners are acts that call for determined
  action by the governments.</p>

  <p>To the rights enshrined in the Universal
  Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be
  added. It is "The Right to Refuse to Kill". Both at the World
  Conference on Religion and Peace at Kyoto (1970) and at the Baden
  Consultation on Churches (1970) very clear-cut conclusions were
  adopted:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"We consider that the exercise of conscientious judgment is
    inherent in the dignity of human beings and that, accordingly,
    each person should be assured the right, on grounds of
    conscience or profound conviction, to refuse military service,
    or any other direct or indirect participation in wars or armed
    conflicts. The right of conscientious objection also extends to
    those who are unwilling to serve in a particular war because
    they consider it unjust or because they refuse to participate
    in a war or conflict in which weapons of mass destruction are
    likely to be used. This Conference also considers that members
    of armed forces have the right, and even the duty, to refuse to
    obey military orders which may involve the commission of
    criminal offenses, or of war crimes, or of crimes against
    humanity".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have drawn attention to the issues raised
  in these Conclusions because they appear to be of particular
  relevance to the present-day world. The right of an individual to
  refuse to kill, to torture or to participate in the preparation
  for the nuclear destruction of humanity seem to me to be
  fundamental.</p>

  <h3>
  The Role of the United Nations</h3>

  <p>It is easy to criticize the United Nations
  but it must be borne in mind that it is dependent upon the
  goodwill of its member states and that its Secretariat can only
  go as far as the states will allow it to go. Again I would like
  to emphasize the importance of the role of public opinion in
  regard to the United Nations. The more public opinion can be
  interested in the work of the United Nations the further will
  governments be prepared to go. Unfortunately, however, much of
  what transpires at the United Nations does not reach public
  opinion and has little effect on it. Also, it would be useful if
  governments and parliaments themselves could participate in and
  follow more closely the work of the United Nations. The World
  Federation of United Nations Associations plays a useful role in
  this field but should receive greater direct assistance from the
  United Nations and governments to enable it to step up its
  work<br>
  considerably.</p>

  <p>There are certain things that could
  usefully be done to make the United Nations more effective:</p>

  <p>(a) The provision of conciliation machinery
  that would automatically initiate discussions and mediation
  wherever the likelihood of a conflict can be foreseen.<br>
  <br>
  (b) Conciliation mechanism that would continue to operate during
  the existence of any conflict that is taking place.<br>
  <br>
  (c) A United Nations mechanism to enable the receipt of
  complaints, and their investigation in all cases of allegations
  of violations of Humanitarian Laws in the course of armed
  conflicts.<br>
  <br>
  (d) Full authority to the Secretary-General to send fact-finding
  missions in any cases involving gross violations of human rights
  and in particular in cases involving the torture of
  prisoners.<br>
  <br>
  (e) An extended compulsory jurisdiction for the International
  Court of Justice and a wider jurisdiction to pronounce advisory
  opinions.</p>

  <p>These are not very far-reaching reforms,
  but I think that they would prove of value. Much more fundamental
  changes involving a surrender of partial sovereignty should also
  be envisaged at a later stage, particularly when General and
  Complete Disarmament is in sight.</p>

  <h3>
  Importance of Voluntary Organizations</h3>

  <p>By reason of higher educational standards
  and of the mass media, public opinion is now capable of
  influencing events more than ever before. In recent years the
  non-governmental organizations have been playing an increasingly
  important role. They are virtually the only independent voices
  that are heard and that can alert public opinion through the
  press and the media. The International Commission of Jurists and
  the International Association of Democratic Lawyers have rendered
  valuable services in the process of integrating human rights into
  the practical application of the Rule of Law. Amnesty
  International has succeeded in focusing attention very
  successfully on the torture of prisoners. These three
  organizations have also rendered invaluable humanitarian service
  by sending missions to areas where human rights were being
  violated and by sending observers to trials. In the field of
  <i>apartheid</i> the work of the Anti-Apartheid Associations
  coupled with that of the World Council of Churches has been of
  considerable value. In regard to Disarmament, the Society of
  Friends, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,
  the International Peace Bureau, the International Confederation
  for Disarmament and Peace and the World Peace Council have all
  made valuable contributions. In particular, special credit should
  be given to the Soviet Peace Council for its initiative in
  organizing and hosting the World Congress of Peace Forces.</p>

  <p>In my view the role of voluntary
  organizations is becoming more and more essential. They are the
  only bodies that will have the necessary independence and
  initiative to restore some faith and idealism in our world. They
  deserve a great deal more support and encouragement.</p>

  <p>If disarmament can be achieved it will be
  due to the untiring selfless work of the non-governmental sector.
  This is what Alfred Nobel appreciated in his days. It is more
  urgent than ever now. The big powers are traveling on the
  dangerous road of armament. The signpost just ahead of us is
  "Oblivion". Can the march on this road be stopped? Yes, if public
  opinion uses the power it now has.</p>
