  <h2>Development of Quantum Electrodynamics</h2>

  <h3>Personal recollections</h3>

  <p><i>(1)</i> In 1932, when I started my
  research career as an assistant to Nishina, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a> published a paper
  in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society, London</i><a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In this paper, he discussed the
  formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics, especially that of
  electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field. At that
  time a comprehensive theory of this interaction had been formally
  completed by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Pauli</a><a href=
  "#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>, but Dirac was not satisfied with this
  theory and tried to construct a new theory from a different point
  of view. Heisenberg and Pauli regarded the (electromagnetic)
  field itself as a dynamical system amenable to the Hamiltonian
  treatment; its interaction with particles could be described by
  an interaction energy, so that the usual method of Hamiltonian
  quantum mechanics could be applied. On the other hand, Dirac
  thought that the field and the particles should play essentially
  different roles. That is to say, according to him, "the role of
  the field is to provide a means for making observations of a
  system of particles" and therefore "we cannot suppose the field
  to be a dynamical system on the same footing as the particles and
  thus be something to be observed in the same way as the
  particles".</p>

  <p>Based on such a philosophy, Dirac proposed
  a new theory, the so-called many-time theory, which, besides
  being a concrete example of his philosophy was of much more
  satisfactory and beautiful form than other theories presented up
  to then. In fact, from the relativistic point of view, these
  other theories had a common defect which was inherent in their
  Hamiltonian formalism. The Hamiltonian dynamics was developed on
  the basis of non-relativistic concepts which make a sharp
  distinction between time and space. It formulates a physical law
  by describing how the state of a dynamical system changes with
  time. Speaking quantum-mechanically, it is a formalism to
  describe how the probability amplitude changes with time
  <i>t</i>. Now, as an example, let us consider a system composed
  of <i>N</i> particles, and let the coordinates of each particle
  be <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>r</b><sub>2</sub>,...,
  <b>r</b><sub>N</sub>. Then the probability amplitude of the
  system is a function of the <i>N</i> variables
  <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>r</b><sub>2</sub>,...,
  <b>r</b><sub>N</sub>, and in addition, of the time <i>t</i> to
  which the amplitude is referred. Thus this function contains only
  one time variable in contrast to <i>N</i> space variables. In the
  theory of relativity, however, time and space must be treated on
  an entirely equal footing so that the above imbalance is not
  satisfactory. On the other hand, in Dirac's theory which does not
  use the Hamiltonian formalism, it becomes possible to consider
  different time variables for each particle, so that the
  probability amplitude can be expressed as a function of
  <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>r</b><sub>2</sub>
  <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>,...,<b>r</b><sub>N</sub>
  <i>t</i><sub>N</sub>. Accordingly, the theory satisfies the
  requirement of the principle of relativity that time and space be
  treated with complete equality. The reason why the theory is
  called the many-time theory is because <i>N</i> distinct time
  variables are used in this way.</p>

  <p>This paper of Dirac's attracted my interest
  because of the novelty of its philosophy and the beauty of its
  form. Nishina also showed a great interest in this paper and
  suggested that I investigate the possibility of predicting some
  new phenomena by this theory. Then I started computations to see
  whether the Klein-Nishina formula could be derived from this
  theory or whether any modification of the formula might result. I
  found out immediately however, without performing the calculation
  through to the end, that it would yield the same answer as the
  previous theory. This new theory of Dirac's was in fact
  mathematically equivalent to the older Heisenberg-Pauli theory,
  and I realized during the calculation that one could pass from
  one to the other by a unitary transformation. The equivalence of
  these two theories was also discovered by Rosenfeld<a href=
  "#not3"><sup>3</sup></a> and by Dirac-Fock-Podolsky<a href=
  "#not4"><sup>4</sup></a> and was soon published in their
  papers.</p>

  <p>Though Dirac's many-time formalism turned
  out to be equivalent to the Heisenberg-Pauli theory, it had the
  advantage that it gave us the possibility of generalizing the
  former interpretation of the probability amplitude. Namely, while
  one could calculate the probability of finding particles at
  points with coordinates <b>r</b><sub>1</sub>,
  <b>r</b><sub>2</sub>,..., <b>r</b><sub>N</sub>, all at the time
  <i>t</i> according to the previous theory, one could now compute
  more generally the probability that the first particle is at
  <b>r</b><sub>1</sub> at time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, the second at
  <b>r</b><sub>2</sub> at time <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, &#8230; and
  the <i>N</i>-th at <b>r</b><i>N</i> at time <i>tN</i>. This was
  first discussed by Bloch<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> in
  1934.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>(2)</i> In this many-time theory
  developed by Dirac, electrons were treated according to the
  particle picture. Alternatively, in quantum theory, any particle
  should be able to be treated according to the wave picture. As a
  matter of fact, electrons were also treated as waves in the
  Heisenberg-Pauli theory, and it was well known that this wave
  treatment was frequently more convenient than the particle
  treatment. So the question arose as to whether one could
  reformulate the Heisenberg-Pauli theory in a way which would be
  more satisfactory relativistically, when electrons were treated
  as waves as well as the electromagnetic field.</p>

  <p>As Dirac already pointed out, the
  Heisenberg-Pauli theory is built upon the Hamiltonian formalism
  and therefore the probability amplitude contains only one time
  variable. That is to say, the probability amplitude is given as a
  function of the field strength at different space points and of
  one common time variable. However, the concept of a common time
  at different space points does not have a relativistically
  covariant meaning.</p>

  <p>Around 1942, Yukawa<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a> wrote a paper emphasizing this
  unsatisfactory aspect of the quantum field theory. He thought it
  necessary to use the idea of the g.t.f. (generalized
  transformation function) proposed by Dirac<a href=
  "#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> to correct this defect of the theory.
  Here I shall omit talking about the g.t.f., but, briefly,
  Yukawa's idea was to introduce as the basis of a new theory a
  concept which generalized the conventional conception of the
  probability amplitude. However, as pointed out also by Yukawa, we
  encounter the difficulty that, in doing this, cause and effect
  can not be clearly separated from each other. According to
  Yukawa, the inseparability of cause and effect would be an
  essential feature of quantum field theory, and without abandoning
  the causal way of thinking which strictly separates cause and
  effect, it would not be possible to solve various difficulties
  appearing in quantum field theory about which I will talk later.
  I thought however, that it might be possible (without introducing
  such a drastic change as Yukawa and Dirac tried to do) to remedy
  the unsatisfactory, unpleasant aspect of the Heisenberg-Pauli
  theory of having a common time at different space points. In
  other words, it should be possible, I thought, to define a
  relativistically meaningful probability amplitude which would be
  manifestly covariant, without being forced to give up the causal
  way of thinking. In having this expectation I was recalling
  Dirac's many-time theory which had enchanted me 10 years
  before.</p>

  <p>When there are <i>N</i> particles in
  Dirac's many-time theory, we assign a time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>
  to the first particle, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> to the second, and so
  on, thus introducing <i>N</i> different times,
  <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>,
  ...,t<sub><i>N</i></sub>, instead of the one common time
  <i>t</i>. Similarly, I tried in quantum field theory to see
  whether it was possible to assign different times, instead of one
  common time, to each space point. And in fact I was able to show
  that this was possible<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>As there are an infinite number of space
  points in field theory in contrast to the finite number of
  particles in particle theory, the number of time variables
  appearing in the probability amplitude became infinite. But it
  turned out that no essential difficulty appeared. An
  interpretation quite analogous to the one discussed by Bloch in
  connection with Dirac's many-time theory could be given to our
  probability amplitude containing an infinite number of time
  variables. Further, it was found that the theory thus formulated
  was completely covariant and that this covariant formulation was
  equivalent in its whole content to the Heisenberg-Pauli theory:
  it was shown, just as in the case of the many-time theory, that
  we could pass from one to the other by a unitary transformation.
  I began this work about 1942, and completed it in 1946.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>(3)</i> As I mentioned a little while
  ago, there are many difficulties in the quantum mechanics of
  fields. In particular, infinite quantities always arise which are
  associated with the presence of field reactions in various
  processes. The first phenomenon which attracted our attention as
  a manifestation of field reactions was the electromagnetic mass
  of the electron. The electron, having a charge, produces an
  electromagnetic field around itself. In turn, this field, the
  so-called self-field of the electron, interacts with the
  electron. We call this interaction the field reaction. Because of
  the field reaction the apparent mass of the electron differs from
  the original mass. The excess mass due to this field reaction is
  called the electromagnetic mass of the electron and the
  experimentally observed mass is the sum of the original mass and
  this electromagnetic mass. The concept of the electromagnetic
  mass had already appeared in the classical theory of the electron
  by Lorentz, who computed the electromagnetic mass by applying the
  classical theory and obtained the result that the mass becomes
  infinite for the point (zero size) electron. On the other hand,
  the electromagnetic mass was computed in quantum theory by
  various people, and here I mention particularly the work of
  Weisskopf<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>. According to him, the
  quantum-mechanical electromagnetic mass turned out to be
  infinite, and although the order of the divergence was much
  weaker than in the case of the Lorentz theory, the observed mass,
  which included this additional mass, would be infinite. This
  would be, of course, contrary to experiment.</p>

  <p>In order to overcome the difficulty of an
  infinitely large electromagnetic mass, Lorentz considered the
  electron not to be point-like but to have a finite size. It is
  very difficult, however, to incorporate a finite sized electron
  into the framework of relativistic quantum theory. Many people
  tried various means to overcome this problem of infinite
  quanties, but nobody succeeded.</p>

  <p>In connection with field reactions, the
  next problem which attracted the attention of physicists was
  determining what kind of influence the field reaction exerts in
  electron-scattering processes. Let us consider, as a concrete
  example, a problem in which an electron is scattered by an
  external field. In the ordinary treatment, we neglect the effect
  of field reactions on the scattered electron, assuming that it is
  negligibly small. Then the behavior of the scattering obtained by
  calculation (<i>e.g.</i> the Rutherford formula) fits very well
  with experiment. But what will happen if the influence of field
  reaction is taken into account? This theoretical problem was
  examined non-relativistically by Braunbeck-Weinmann<a href=
  "#not10"><sup>10</sup></a> and Pauli-Fierz<a href=
  "#not11"><sup>11</sup></a> and relativistically by
  Dancoff<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>While Dancoff applied an approximation
  method, the perturbation method, in his relativistic calculation,
  Pauli and Fierz treated the problem in such a way that the most
  important part of the field reaction was first separated out
  exactly by employing a contact transformation method which was
  similar to the one which Bloch-Nordsieck<a href=
  "#not13"><sup>13</sup></a> had published a year before. Since
  Pauli and Fierz adopted a non-relativistic model, and further
  simplified the problem by using the so-called dipole
  approximation, their calculation was especially transparent. At
  any rate, both non-relativistic and relativistic calculations
  exhibited several infinities in the scattering processes<a href=
  "#not*">*</a>.</p>

  <p>The conclusions of these people were fatal
  to the theory. That is, the influence of the field reaction
  becomes infinite in this problem. The effect of field reaction on
  a quantity called the scattering cross section, which expresses
  quantitatively the behavior of the scattering, rather than
  becoming negligibly small, becomes infinitely large. This does
  not, of course, agree with experiment.</p>

  <p>This discouraging state of affairs
  generated in many people a strong distrust of quantum field
  theory. There were even those with the extreme view that the
  concept of field reaction itself had nothing to do at all with
  the true law of nature.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there was also the view
  that the field reaction might not be altogether meaningless but
  would play an essential role in the scattering processes, though
  the appearance of divergences revealed a defect of the theory.
  Heisenberg<a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>, in his paper
  published in 1949, emphasized that the field reaction would be
  crucial in meson-nucleon scattering. Just at that time I was
  studying at Leipzig, and I still remember vividly how Heisenberg
  enthusiastically explained this idea to me and handed me galley
  proofs of his forthcoming paper. Influenced by Heisenberg, I came
  to believe that the problem of field reactions far from being
  meaningless was one which required a frontal attack.</p>

  <p>Thus, after coming back to Japan from
  Leipzig, I began to examine the nature of the infinities
  appearing in scattering processes at the same time that I was
  engaged in the above-mentioned work of formulating a covariant
  field theory. What I wanted to know was what kind of relationship
  exists between the infinity associated with the scattering
  process and that associated with the mass. If you read the
  above-mentioned papers of Bloch-Nordsieck and Pauli-Fierz, you
  will see that one of the terms containing infinite quantities is
  first separated out by a contact transformation and this term
  turns out to be just the term modifying the mass. Besides this
  kind of infinity there appeared, according to Pauli-Fierz,
  another kind of infinity characteristic of the scattering
  process. I further investigated a couple of simple models which
  were not realistic, but could be solved exactly. What was
  understood from these models, was that the most strongly
  divergent terms in the scattering process had the same form as
  the expression giving the modification of the particle mass due
  to field reactions, and therefore both should be manifestations
  of the same effect. In other words, at least a portion of the
  infinities appearing in the scattering process could be
  amalgamated into the infinity associated with the particle mass,
  leaving infinities proper to the scattering process alone. These
  turned out to be more weakly divergent than the infinity
  associated with the mass.</p>

  <p>Since these conclusions were derived from
  non-relativistic or unrealistic models, it was still doubtful
  whether the same thing would occur in the case of relativistic
  electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field. Dancoff
  tried to answer this question. He calculated relativistically the
  infinities appearing in the scattering process and determined
  which of them could be amalgamated into the mass and which
  remained as infinities proper to the scattering process alone. He
  found that there remained, in the latter group of infinite terms,
  one which was at least as divergent as the infinity of the mass,
  a finding which differed from the conclusion based on fictitious
  models.</p>

  <p>Actually, there are two kinds of field
  reactions in the case of the relativistic electron and
  electromagnetic field. One of them ought to be called "of mass
  type" and the other "of vacuum polarization type". The field
  reaction of mass type changes the apparent electronic mass from
  its original value by the amount of the electromagnetic mass as
  was calculated by Weisskopf. On the other hand, the field
  reaction of vacuum polarization type changes the apparent
  electronic charge from its original value. As was discussed in
  further papers by Weisskopf15 and others, infinite terms appear
  in the apparent electronic charge if the effect of vacuum
  polarization is taken into account. However, in this talk, for
  simplicity, I will mention only briefly the divergence of the
  vacuum polarization type.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>(4)</i> In the meantime, in 1946,
  Sakata<a href="#not16"><sup>16</sup></a> proposed a promising
  method of eliminating the divergence of the electron mass by
  introducing the idea of a field of cohesive force. It was the
  idea that there exists unknown field, of the type of the meson
  field which interacts with the electron in addition to the
  electromagnetic field. Sakata named this field the cohesive force
  field, because the apparent electronic mass due to the
  interaction of this field and the electron, though infinite, is
  negative and therefore the existence of this field could
  stabilize the electron in some sense. Sakata pointed out the
  possibility that the electromagnetic mass and the negative new
  mass cancel each other and that the infinity could be eliminated
  by suitably choosing the coupling constant between this field and
  the electron. Thus the difficulty which had troubled people for a
  long time seemed to disappear insofar as the mass was concerned.
  (It was found later that Pais<a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a>
  proposed the same idea in the U.S. independently of Sakata.) Then
  what concerned me most was whether the infinities appearing in
  the electron-scattering process could also be removed by the idea
  of a plus-minus cancellation.</p>

  <p>An example of a computation of how the
  field reaction influences the scattering process was already
  given by Dancoff. What we had to do was just to replace the
  electromagnetic field by the cohesive force field in Dancoff's
  calculation. I mobilized young people around me and we performed
  the computation together<a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a>
  Infinities with negative sign actually appeared in the scattering
  cross-section as was expected. However, when we compared these
  with the infinities with positive sign which Dancoff calculated
  for the electromagnetic field, the two infinities did not cancel
  each other completely. That is to say, according to our result,
  the Sakata theory led to the cancellation of infinities for the
  mass but not for the scattering process. It was also known that
  the infinity of vacuum polarization type was not cancelled by the
  introduction of the cohesive force field.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Dancoff did not publish the
  detailed calculations in his paper, and while we were engaged in
  the above considerations, we felt it necessary to do Dancoff's
  calculation over again for ourselves in parallel with the
  computation of the influence of the cohesive force field. At the
  same time I happened to discover a simpler method of
  calculation.</p>

  <p>This new method of calculation was to use
  the technique of contact transformations based on the previously
  mentioned formalism of the covariant field theory and was in a
  sense a relativistic generalization of the Pauli-Fierz method.
  This method had the advantage of separating the electromagnetic
  mass from the beginning, just as was shown in their paper.</p>

  <p>Our new method of calculation was not at
  all different in its contents from Dancoff's perturbation method,
  but had the advantage of making the calculation more clear. In
  fact, what took a few months in the Dancoff type of calculation
  could be done in a few weeks. And it was by this method that a
  mistake was discovered in Dancoff's calculation ; we had also
  made the same mistake in the beginning. Owing to this new, more
  lucid method, we noticed that, among the various terms appearing
  in both Dancoff's and our previous calculation, one term had been
  overlooked. There was only one missing term, but it was crucial
  to the final conclusion. Indeed, if we corrected this eror, the
  infinities appearing in the scattering process of an electron due
  to the electro-magnetic and cohesive force fields cancelled
  completely, except for the divergence of vacuum polarization
  type.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>(5)</i> When this unfortunate error of
  Dancoff's was discovered, we had to reexamine his conclusions
  concerning the relation between the divergence of the scattering
  process and the divergence of the mass, in particular, the
  conclusion that there remained a portion of the infinities of the
  scattering process which could not be amalgamated into the
  modification of the mass. In fact, it turned out that after
  correcting the error, the infinity of mass type appearing in the
  scattering process could be reduced completely to the
  modification of the mass, and the remaining field reaction
  belonging to the scattering proper was not divergent<a href=
  "#not19"><sup>19</sup></a>. In other words, the highest
  divergence part of the infinities appearing in the scattering
  process, in the relativistic as well as in the non-relativistic
  case, could be attributed to the infinity of mass. The reason why
  the remaining part became finite in the relativistic case was due
  to the fact that the order of the highest divergence was only log
  co, and after amalgamating the divergence into the mass term, the
  remainder was convergent. The great value of this method of
  contact transformations was that once the infinity of the mass
  was separated out, we obtained a divergence-free theoretical
  framework.</p>

  <p>In this way the nature of various
  infinities became fairly clear. Though I did not describe here
  the infinity of vacuum polarization type, this too appears in the
  scattering process, as mentioned earlier. However, Dancoff had
  already discovered that this infinity could be amalgamated into
  an apparent change in the electronic charge. To state the
  conclusion, therefore, all infinities appearing in the scattering
  process can be attributed either to the infinity of the
  electromagnetic mass or to the infinity appearing in the
  electronic charge - there are no other divergences in the
  theory.</p>

  <p>It is a very pleasant thing that no
  divergence is involved in the theory except for the two
  infinities of the electronic mass and charge. We cannot say that
  we have no divergences in the theory, since the mass and charge
  are in fact infinite. It is to be noticed, however, that if we
  reduce the infinities appearing in the scattering process to
  modifications of mass and charge, the remaining terms all become
  finite. Further, if we examine the structure of the theory, after
  the infinities are amalgamated into the mass and charge terms, we
  see that the only mass and charge appearing in the theory are the
  values modified by field reactions - the original values and
  excess ones due to field reactions never appear separately.</p>

  <p>This situation gives rise to the following
  possibility. The theory does not of course yield a resolution of
  the infinities. That is, since those parts of the modified mass
  and charge due to field reactions contain divergence, it is
  impossible to calculate them by the theory. However, the mass and
  charge observed in experiments are not the original mass and
  charge but the mass and charge as modified by field reactions,
  and they are finite. On the other hand, the mass and charge
  appearing in the theory are, as I mentioned above, after all the
  values modified by field reactions. Since this is so, and
  particularly since the theory is unable to calculate the modified
  mass and charge, we may adopt the procedure of substituting
  experimental values for them phenomenologically. When a theory is
  incompetent in part, it is a common procedure to rely on
  experiment for that part. This procedure is called the
  renormalization of mass and charge, and our method has brought
  the possibility that the theory will lead to finite results by
  the renormalization even if it contains defects.</p>

  <p>The idea of renormalization is far from
  new. Many people used explicitly or implicitly this idea, and we
  find the word renormalization already in Dancoff's paper. In his
  calculation it appeared, because of an error that there still
  remained a divergence in the scattering even after the
  renormalization of the electron mass. This error was very
  unfortunate; if he had performed the calculation correctly, the
  history of renormalization theory would have been completely
  different.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>(6)</i> This period, around 1946-1948,
  was soon after the second world war, and it was quite difficult
  in Japan to obtain information from abroad. But soon we got the
  news that in the U.S., Lewis and Epstein<a href=
  "#not20"><sup>20</sup></a> found Dancoff's mistake and gave the
  same conclusions as ours, Schwinger<a href=
  "#not21"><sup>21</sup></a> constructed a covariant field theory
  similar to ours, and he was probably performing various
  calculations making use of it. In particular, little by little
  news arrived that the so-called Lamb-shift was discovered<a href=
  "#not22"><sup>22</sup></a> as a manifestation of the
  electromagnetic field reaction and that Bethe<a href=
  "#not23"><sup>23</sup></a> was calculating it theoretically. The
  first information concerning the Lamb-shift was obtained not
  through the <i>Physical Review</i>, but through the popular
  science column of a weekly U.S. magazine. This information about
  the Lamb-shift prompted us to begin a calculation more exactly
  than Bethe's tentative one.</p>

  <p>The Lamb-shift is a phenomenon in which the
  energy levels of a hydrogen atom show some shifts from the levels
  given by the Dirac theory. Bethe thought that the field reactions
  were primarily responsible for this shift. According to his
  calculation, field reactions give rise to an infinite level
  shift, but he thought that it should be possible to make it
  finite by a mass renormalization and a tentative calculation
  yielded a value almost in agreement with experiments.</p>

  <p>This problem of the level shift is
  different from the scattering process, but it was conceivable
  that the renormalization which was effective in avoiding
  infinities in the scattering process would be workable in this
  case as well. In fact, the contact transformation method of Pauli
  and Fierz devised to solve the scattering problem could be
  applied to this case, clarifying Bethe's calculation and
  justifying his idea. Therefore the method of covariant contact
  transformations, by which we did Dancoff's calculation over again
  would also be useful for the problem of performing the
  relativistic calculation for the Lamb-shift. This was our
  prediction.</p>

  <p>The calculation of the Lamb-shift was done
  by many people in the U.S.<a href="#not24"><sup>24</sup></a>.
  Among others, Schwinger, commanding powerful mathematical
  techniques, and by making thorough use of the method of covariant
  contact transformations, very skilfully calculated not only the
  Lamb-shift but other quantities such as the anomalous magnetic
  moment of the electron. After long, laborious calculations, less
  skilful than Schwinger's, we<a href="#not25"><sup>25</sup></a>
  obtained a result for the Lambshift which was in agreement with
  Americans'. Furthermore, Feynman<a href=
  "#not26"><sup>26</sup></a> devised a convenient method based on
  an ingenious idea which could be used to extend the approximation
  of Schwinger and ours to higher orders, and Dyson<a href=
  "#not27"><sup>27</sup></a> showed that all infinities appearing
  in quantum electrodynamics could be treated by the
  renormalization procedure to an arbitrarily high order of
  approximation. Furthermore, this method devised by Feynman and
  developed by Dyson was shown by many people to be applicable not
  only to quantum electrodynamics, but to statistical mechanics and
  solid-state physics as well, and provided a new, powerful method
  in these fields. However, these matters will probably be
  discussed by Schwinger and Feynman themselves and need not be
  explained by me. So far I have told you the story of how I played
  a tiny, partial role in the recent development of quantum
  electrodynamics, and here I would like to end my talk.</p>
