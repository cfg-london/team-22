  <h1>Archibald V. Hill - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hill.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Archibald
  Vivian Hill</b> was born in Bristol on September 26,1886. His
  early education was at Blundell's School, Tiverton, whence he
  obtained scholarships to Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he studied
  mathematics and took the Mathematical Tripos, being Third
  Wrangler (1907). After graduating, he was urged to take up
  physiology by his teacher, Dr. (later Sir) Walter Morley
  Fletcher.<br>
  <br>
  Hill started his research work in 1909. It was due to J.N.
  Langley, Head of the Department of Physiology at that time that
  Hill took up the study on the nature of muscular contraction.
  Langley drew his attention to the important (later to become
  classic) work carried out by Fletcher and <a href=
  "../1929/index.html">Hopkins</a> on the problem of lactic acid in
  muscle, particularly in relation to the effect of oxygen upon its
  removal in recovery. During his initial studies Hill made use of
  the Blix' apparatus, obtaining his first knowledge of the subject
  from papers of this Swedish physiologist. This led him to study
  the dependence of heat production on the length of muscle fibre
  (a relation later developed by Starling in his investigation of
  the mechanism of the heart beat).<br>
  <br>
  After having obtained a Fellowship at Trinity in 1910, Hill spent
  the winter of 1910-1911 in Germany, working among others with
  B&uuml;rker (who taught him much about the technique of
  myothermic observations) and Paschen (who introduced the
  galvanometer to him, which he since used for his investigations).
  From 1911-1914, until the outbreak of World War I, he continued
  his work on the physiology of muscular contraction at Cambridge.
  During this for him important period, however, he also took up
  other studies: on the nervous impulse (with Keith Lucas), on
  haemoglobin (with Barcroft), and on calorimetry of animals
  (partly with T. B. Wood), having also as colleagues Gaskell,
  Anderson, W. B. Hardy, Mines, <a href=
  "../1932/index.html">Adrian</a>, Hartridge, and others.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 he tended to drift away from physiology and was actually
  appointed University Lecturer in Physical Chemistry at Cambridge.
  During the war he served for the entire period as captain and
  brevet-major, and as Director of the Anti-Aircraft Experimental
  Section, Munitions Inventions Department.<br>
  <br>
  In 1919 he took up again his study of the physiology of muscle,
  and came into close contact with <a href=
  "index.html">Meyerhof</a> of Kiel who, approaching the problem
  from a different angle, has arrived at results closely analogous
  to his study. They have cooperated continuously ever since, by
  personal contact and through correspondence. In 1919 Hill's
  friend W. Hartree, mathematician and engineer, joined in the
  myothermic investigations - a cooperation which had rewarding
  results.<br>
  <br>
  In 1920 Hill was appointed Brackenburg Professor of Physiology at
  Manchester University; there he continued the work
  on muscular activity and began to apply the results obtained on
  isolated muscles to the case of muscular exercise in man. From
  1923 to 1925 he became Jodrell Professor of Physiology at
  University
  College, London, succeeding E.H. Starling. In 1926 he was
  appointed the Royal Society's Foulerton Research Professor and
  was in charge of the Biophysics Laboratory at University College
  until 1952. After retiring he returned to the Physiology
  Department, where he continues with his experiments to the
  present.<br>
  <br>
  His work on muscle function, especially the observation and
  measurement of thermal changes associated with muscle function,
  was later extended to similar studies on the mechanism of the
  passage of nerve impulses. Very sensitive techniques had to be
  developed and he was eventually able to measure temperature
  changes of the order of 0.003&deg;C over periods of only
  hundredths of a second. He was the discoverer of the phenomenon
  that heat was produced as a result of the passage of nerve
  impulses. His researches gave rise to an enthusiastic following
  in the field of biophysics, a subject whose growth owes much to
  him.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Hill is the author of many scientific papers, lectures, and
  books. Perhaps his best-known books are <i>Muscular Activity</i>
  (1926), <i>Muscular Movement in Man</i> (1927); also <i>Living
  Machinery</i> (1927), <i>The Ethical Dilemma of Science and Other
  Writings</i> (1960), and <i>Traits and Trials in Physiotogy</i>
  (1965).<br>
  <br>
  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
  1918, serving as Secretary for the period 1935-1945, and Foreign
  Secretary in 1946. He was awarded the Society's Copley Medal in
  1948. He holds honorary degrees of many universities, British and
  foreign. He was decorated with the Order of the British Empire in 1918 and became a
  Companion of Honour in 1948. He also holds the Medal of Freedom
  with Silver Palm (U.S.A., 1947) and is a Chevalier of the Legion
  of Honour (1950). He has also been prominent in public life,
  being a Member of Parliament during the period 1940-1945, when he
  represented Cambridge University in the House of Commons as an
  Independent Conservative. He was a member of the University
  Grants Committee for 1937-1944 and served on the Science
  Committee of the British Council, 1946-1956. He was appointed a
  Trustee of the British Museum in 1947.<br>
  <br>
  During World War II, he served on many commissions concerned with
  defence and scientific policy. He was a member of the War Cabinet
  Scientific Advisory Committee (1940-1946). He was Chairman of the
  Research Defence Society (1940-1951) and Chairman of the
  Executive Committee of the National Physical Laboratory
  (1940-1945).<br>
  <br>
  He is also a member of the Society for the Protection of Science
  and Learning, and was President in 1952 of the British Society
  for the Advancement of Science.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Hill married Margaret Neville Keynes in 1913. They have two
  sons and two daughters.</p>
