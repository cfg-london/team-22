  was born at Todmorden, England, on May 27th, 1897. His family had
  for several generations been cotton manufacturers.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at Todmorden Secondary School and studied
  mathematics at Manchester University under Horace Lamb in
  1914-1915. After serving in the First World War in the Royal
  Field Artillery he returned to Manchester to study electrical
  engineering at the College of Technology under Miles Walker. After two
  years apprenticeship with Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company
  he went to St. John's College, Cambridge, and took the
  Mathematical Tripos in 1924. He then worked under Lord Rutherford
  in the Cavendish Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  He first collaborated with <a href="../1978/index.html">P.
  Kapitsa</a> in the production of intense magnetic fields and low
  temperatures. In 1928 he turned to work on the acceleration of
  protons by high voltages and was soon joined in this work by
  E.T.S. Walton. In 1932 they succeeded in transmuting lithium and
  boron by high energy protons. In 1933 artificial radioactivity
  was produced by protons and a wide variety of transmutations
  produced by protons and deuterons was studied. In 1934 he took
  charge of the Royal Society Mond Laboratory in Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929 he was elected to a Fellowship in St. John's
  College and became successively University demonstrator,
  lecturer and in 1939 Jacksonian Professor of Natural
  Philosophy.<br>
  <br>
  In September 1939 he took up a war-time appointment as Assistant
  Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply and
  started to work on the application of radar to coast and air
  defence problems. He was a member of the Tizard Mission to the
  United States in the autumn of 1940. After this he was appointed
  Head of the Air Defence Research and Development Establishment.
  In 1944 he went to Canada to take charge of the Canadian Atomic
  Energy project and became Director of the Montreal and Chalk
  River Laboratories until 1946 when he returned to England as
  Director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment,
  Harwell.<br>
  <br>
  For the period 1954-1959 he was scientific research member of the
  U.K. Atomic Energy Authority and has since continued this
  function on a part time basis. Election to Master, Churchill College,
  Cambridge, followed in October 1959. In addition he is
  Chancellor of the Australian National University, Canberra, and a past
  President of the Institute of Physics, the Physical Society (1960
  to 1962) and the British Association for the Advancement of
  Science (1961 to 1963).<br>
  <br>
  He has received honorary doctorates from some 19 universities and
  is a fellow or honorary member of many of the principal
  scientific societies. In addition, numerous honours and awards
  have also been bestowed upon him.<br>
  <br>
  He married Eunice Elizabeth Crabtree in 1925 and has four
