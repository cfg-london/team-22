  <h1>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="passy.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy</b> (May 20, 1822-June 12, 1912) was
  born in Paris and lived there his entire life of ninety years.
  The tradition of the French civil service was strong in Passy's
  family, his uncle, Hippolyte Passy (1793-1880), rising to become
  a cabinet minister under both Louis Philippe and Louis Napoleon.
  Educated as a lawyer, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy entered the civil
  service at the age of twenty-two as an accountant in the State
  Council, but left after three years to devote himself to
  systematic study of economics. He emerged as a theoretical
  economist in 1857 with his <i>M&eacute;langes &eacute;conomiques</i>,
  a collection of essays he had published in the course of his
  research, and he secured his scholarly reputation with a series
  of lectures delivered in 1860-1861 at the University of
  Montpellier and later published in two volumes under the title
  <i>Le&ccedil;ons d'&eacute;conomie politique</i>. An admirer of
  Richard Cobden, he became an ardent free trader, believing that
  free trade would draw nations together as partners in a common
  enterprise, result in disarmament, and lead to the abandonment of
  war. Passy lectured on economic subjects in virtually every city
  and university of any consequence in France and continued a
  stream of publications on economic subjects, some of the more
  important being <i>Les Machines et leur influence sur le
  d&eacute;veloppement de l'humanit&eacute;</i> (1866), <i>Malthus et
  sa doctrine</i> (1868), <i>L'Histoire du travail</i> (1873).
  Passy's passionate belief in education found expression in <i>De
  la propri&eacute;t&eacute; intellectuelle</i> (1859) end <i>La
  D&eacute;mocratie et l'instruction</i> (1864). For these
  contributions, among others, he was elected in 1877 to membership
  in the Acad&eacute;mie de sciences morales et politiques, a unit of
  the Institut de France.<br>
  <br>
  Passy was not, however, a cloistered scholar; he was a man of
  action. In 1867, encouraged by his leadership of public opinion
  in trying to avert possible war between France and Prussia over
  the Luxembourg question, he founded the &laquo;Ligue
  internationale et permanente de la paix&raquo;. When the Ligue
  became a casualty of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, he
  reorganized it under the title &laquo;Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
  fran&ccedil;aise des amis de la paix&raquo; which in turn gave way
  to the more specifically oriented &laquo;Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
  fran&ccedil;aise pour l'arbitrage entre nations&raquo;, established
  in 1889.<br>
  <br>
  Passy carried on his efforts within the government as well. He
  was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1881, again in 1885,
  and defeated in 1889. In the Chamber he supported legislation
  favorable to labor, especially an act relating to industrial
  accidents, opposed the colonial policy of the government, drafted
  a proposal for disarmament, and presented a resolution calling
  for arbitration of international disputes.<br>
  <br>
  His parliamentary interest in arbitration was whetted by <a href=
  "../1903/index.html">Randal Cremer</a>'s success in guiding
  through the British Parliament a resolution stipulating that
  England and the United States should refer to arbitration any
  disputes between them not settled by the normal methods of
  diplomacy. In 1888 Cremer headed a delegation of nine British
  members of Parliament who met in Paris with a delegation of
  twenty-four French deputies, headed by Passy, to discuss
  arbitration and to lay the groundwork for an organization to
  advance its acceptance. The next year, fifty-six French
  parliamentarians, twenty-eight British, and scattered
  representatives from the parliaments of Italy, Spain, Denmark,
  Hungary, Belgium, and the United States formed the Interparliamentary
  Union, with Passy as one of its three presidents. The Union,
  still in existence, established a headquarters to serve as a
  clearinghouse of ideas, and encouraged the formation of informal
  individual national parliamentary groups willing to support
  legislation leading to peace, especially through
  arbitration.<br>
  <br>
  Passy's thought and action had unity. International peace was the
  goal, arbitration of disputes in international politics and free
  trade in goods the means, the national units making up the
  Interparliamentary Union the initiating agents, the people the
  sovereign constituency.<br>
  <br>
  Through his prodigious labors over a period of half a century in
  the peace movement, Passy became known as the &laquo;apostle of
  peace&raquo;. He wrote unceasingly and vividly. His <i>Pour la
  paix</i> (1909), which came out when he was eighty-seven years
  old, is a personalized account - in lieu of an autobiography
  which he deplored - of his work for international peace, noting
  especially the founding of the Ligue, the &laquo;p&eacute;riode
  d&eacute;cisive&raquo; when the Interparliamentary Union was
  established, the development of peace congresses, and the value
  of the Hague Conferences.<br>
  <br>
  Passy was a renowned speaker, noted for the intellectual demands
  he made on his audiences, as well as for his powerful voice, his
  ample gestures, and his majestic and dignified manner.</p>
