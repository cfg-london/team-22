  <h1>William D. Phillips - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="phillips.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on 5 November 1948 in
  Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, just across the river from the town
  of Kingston, where my parents lived with my one and a half year
  old sister, Maxine. My parents had come to this small
  Pennsylvania town from places and backgrounds that were far apart
  and yet quite similar.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Mary Catherine Savino (later, Savine), was born in the
  southern Italian village of Ripacandida in 1913. Among her
  earliest memories are riding into her grandfather's vineyards in
  a horse-drawn cart. Her father emigrated to the US and brought
  the family to Altoona, Pennsylvania in 1920. Her new American
  schoolmates teased her for her inability to speak English and
  taunted her as a "Wop" for her Italian heritage. She resolved to
  excel, and so she did, graduating near the top of her class from
  Altoona High School.<br>
  <br>
  My father, William (Bill) Cornelius Phillips, was born in
  Juniata, a community on the edge of Altoona, in 1907. His father
  was a carpenter and his mother operated a boarding house to
  augment the family income. His grandfather was a barrel-maker,
  who would demonstrate the quality of his product by jumping onto
  the finished barrel in front of the customer. Dad could trace his
  heritage to ancestors from Wales who fought in the American
  Revolution.<br>
  <br>
  My father and mother were each the first in their families to go
  to college, each attending Juniata College, a small school in
  Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, founded and strongly influenced by the
  pacifist Church of the Brethren. My father and mother graduated
  from Juniata in 1930 and 1936, respectively, but never met until
  a Juniata professor who knew them both suggested to my father
  that he might call a young Juniata alumna and ask her out. This
  Italian Catholic young woman and this Welsh-American Methodist
  young man met, fell in love, got married, earned Masters degrees
  and became professional social workers in the hard coal country
  of Pennsylvania.<br>
  <br>
  I grew up surrounded by family and friends, church and school,
  and physical and mental activity. I clearly remember the value my
  parents placed on reading and education. My parents read to us
  and encouraged us to read. As soon as I could read for myself,
  walking across town to the library became a regular activity.
  Almost as far back as I can remember, I was interested in
  science. I assembled a collection of bottles of household
  substances as my "chemistry set" and examined almost anything I
  could find with the microscope my parents gave me. Although they
  had no particular knowledge or special interest in science, they
  supported mine. Science was only one of the passions of my
  childhood, along with fishing, baseball, bike riding and tree
  climbing. But as time went on, Erector sets, microscopes, and
  chemistry sets captured more of my attention than baseball bats,
  fishing rods, and football helmets. In 1956, my family moved from
  Kingston to Butler, near Pittsburgh. I remember that during that
  time I decided that science was going to be my life work, and
  sometime during the late 1950s, I came to appreciate, in a very
  incomplete and naive way, the simplicity and beauty of
  physics.<br>
  <br>
  My brother Tom was born in 1957 - a concrete confirmation, my
  sister and I believed, of the power of prayer. We had been
  praying for a sibling, unaware that our parents could decide, and
  had decided, that two children were enough. Apparently our
  prayers were effective. The result was a thrill and a blessing
  for all of us. Another blessing was my being placed into an
  experimental "accelerated" class. There, dedicated and concerned
  teachers taught us things that were not part of the ordinary
  elementary school curriculum, like French and advanced
  mathematics. When my family moved to Camp Hill, near Harrisburg,
  in 1959, interested teachers continued to provide me with
  advanced instruction, and when I entered the 7th grade of Camp
  Hill High School in 1960, it was in another accelerated
  program.<br>
  <br>
  During this time, I had a laboratory in the basement of our
  family home. Ignorant and heedless of the dangers of asbestos,
  electricity, and ultraviolet light, I spent many hours
  experimenting with fire, explosives, rockets and carbon arcs. But
  life was not all science. I ran for the track team and played for
  the tennis team at school. During the summer, I spent all day
  either on the tennis courts or in the community swimming pool,
  and considered the advantages of life as a tennis bum.<br>
  <br>
  While my parents were not directly involved in my scientific
  interests, they tolerated my experiments, even when the circuit
  breakers all tripped because of my overloads. They were always
  encouraging, and there was never any lack of intellectual
  stimulation. Dinner table conversations included discussions of
  politics, history, sociology, and current events. We children
  were heard and respected, but we had to compete for the privilege
  of expressing our opinions. In these discussions our parents
  transmitted important values about respect for other people, for
  their cultures, their ethnic backgrounds, their faith and
  beliefs, even when very different from our own. We learned
  concern for others who were less fortunate than we were. These
  values were supported and strengthened by a maturing religious
  faith.<br>
  <br>
  In high school, I enjoyed and profited from well-taught science
  and math classes, but in retrospect, I can see that the classes
  that emphasized language and writing skills were just as
  important for the development of my scientific career as were
  science and math. I certainly feel that my high school
  involvement in debating competitions helped me later to give
  better scientific talks, that the classes in writing style helped
  me to write better papers, and the study of French greatly
  enhanced the tremendously fruitful collaboration I was to have
  with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji's research group.<br>
  <br>
  The summer after my junior year in high school, I worked at the
  University of
  Delaware doing sputtering experiments. It was a great
  experience and I learned an important truth from Jim Comas, the
  graduate student who supervised me. "An experimental physicist,"
  he told me, "is someone who gets paid for working at his
  hobby."<br>
  <br>
  Another important part of my high school experience was meeting
  Jane Van Wynen. Her family had moved from Maine when we were in
  ninth grade, but we largely ignored each other until our senior
  year when, during a school trip to the New York World's Fair
  during its closing days in 1965, I became suddenly aware of her
  considerable charms. She was not so immediately convinced that I
  had any charms of interest to her, but my natural tenacity paid
  off, and we started dating.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1966 I started my studies at Juniata College, as
  my mother and father, my Aunt Betty, and my sister had before me,
  and as my younger brother, Tom would later. Juniata had a foreign
  language requirement, which could be satisfied by studying two
  years of a language or by passing a test. I passed the test in
  French, whereupon the chairman of the French department, who knew
  my sister, a French major in her senior year, suggested that I
  enroll in an advanced French literature class. Being a naive
  freshman, I did. The professor lectured in French, we read
  classic French literature and wrote our exams in French - not
  what I was used to in high school! I got a "C" on my first test
  and realized that college was not going to be as easy as high
  school. I finished the course with an "A", and learned an
  important lesson: I would have to work hard at Juniata.<br>
  <br>
  Physics with calculus was a challenge as well, but a true joy.
  Ray Pfrogner, who taught that first course, revealed a beauty and
  a unity in physics and mathematics that, until then, I had lacked
  the tools to appreciate. Some evenings he invited us students to
  showings of films of <a href="../1965/index.html">Richard
  Feynman</a>'s classic public lectures on "The Character of
  Physical Law." These events included popcorn that Pfrogner popped
  himself. Feynman's breezy yet incisive style on occasional
  evenings and Pfrogner's clear expositions every other morning
  fueled my passion for physics.<br>
  <br>
  My passion for Jane was also increasing during this time, fueled
  by daily letters, weekly phone calls and infrequent visits to her
  school, Penn State
  University. It is a passion that has matured and deepened but
  remained undiminished over the years. Our separation during our
  college years meant that I did not have a highly active social
  life, leaving lots of time for physics.<br>
  <br>
  During my first year at Juniata, Wilfred Norris, the Physics
  Department chairman, invited me to start on the laboratory course
  normally taken by third-year students - a series of classic
  physics experiments, which I did under his supervision. Later, I
  started doing serious research under Norris's direction,
  rebuilding an X-band electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer
  and trying to resolve discrepancies in the literature about ESR
  linewidths.<br>
  <br>
  In my senior year I spent a semester doing ESR at Argonne National
  Laboratories, working with Juan McMillan and Ted Halpern.
  There, I experienced full-time research, performed by a team of
  professionals who would discuss what the important problems were,
  decide what to do, how to do it, and then go into the lab and do
  it. I loved it!<br>
  <br>
  Back at Juniata for my final semester, I was applying to graduate
  schools. First on my list was Princeton - because I had heard its graduate program
  was superb and because a visitor to Juniata had told me that a
  physics student from my school would never be accepted to
  Princeton! I was accepted, but a visit to Princeton left me
  unconvinced that I wanted to go there. From the lobby of the
  Princeton physics building, I called Dan Kleppner at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology (MIT).<br>
  <br>
  Dan had seen my application to MIT, including my experience in
  magnetic resonance, and had invited me to visit his group and
  consider working on a hydrogen maser experiment. So I visited MIT
  (and Harvard for good measure); I was struck by the
  pleasant camaraderie, and the friendly yet electric atmosphere
  that Dan had created in his group. That emotional reaction, and
  Jane's desire to return to New England, more than any purely
  scientific considerations, made me decide to go to MIT. I never
  regretted that decision, or any of the other decisions I made
  afterwards based on considerations of the heart.<br>
  <br>
  During a hectic several weeks in 1970, Jane and I graduated from
  our respective colleges, married, honeymooned and moved to
  Boston. At MIT I started working with Fred Walther on the
  high-field hydrogen maser, another X-band magnetic resonance
  spectrometer. I learned how to do electronics, machining,
  plumbing and vacuum - all skills I have found essential in
  experimental research. I also learned from Dan, and from the
  others in his group, a way of thinking about physics intuitively,
  and a way of inquiring about a problem that has shaped the way I
  approach physics to this day. The style of open and lively
  discussion of physics problems that I found in Dan's group is one
  that I have tried to emulate in my own group at NIST. I also try to
  follow the principle Dan taught by example: that one can do
  physics at the frontiers, competing with the best in the world,
  and do it with openness, humanity and cooperation.<br>
  <br>
  For my thesis research I measured the magnetic moment of the
  proton in H<sub>2</sub>O. Through this project I met others in
  the community of precision measurements and fundamental constants
  - in particular, Barry Taylor and Ed Williams at the National
  Bureau of Standards. By the time I completed that measurement
  (which is, at least for the moment, still the best of its kind),
  tunable dye lasers had become commercially available and had
  found their way into our lab. I decided that I should learn more
  about these new toys and, with Dan's encouragement, embarked on
  an experiment to study the collisions of laser-excited atoms. I
  finally wrote up both experiments for my thesis and defended it
  in 1976.<br>
  <br>
  I accepted a Chaim Weizmann fellowship to work on projects of my
  own choosing at MIT for another two years. During that time, I
  continued to work on collisions with Dave Pritchard and Jim
  Kinsey; I also started work on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
  in spin-polarized hydrogen with Dan and Tom Greytak. We were
  filled with optimism in the early days of that experiment, but
  today, 22 years later, BEC of hydrogen is still "just around the
  corner." Nevertheless, the innovations achieved by that group,
  long after I left, along with the developments in laser cooling
  recognized by this year's Nobel Prize, were crucial in showing
  the way to the eventual success of BEC in alkali vapors.<br>
  <br>
  At the party celebrating my thesis in 1976, Dan Kleppner said it
  was fortunate that I had done the second experiment, using
  lasers, because otherwise I would probably have ended up going to
  the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). In 1978 I accepted a
  position at NBS (later renamed the National Institute of
  Standards and Technology-NIST) in Barry Taylor's division,
  working with Ed Williams and Tom Olsen on precision measurements
  of the proton gyromagnetic ratio and of the Absolute Ampere.
  These were exciting projects, but my experience with lasers and
  atomic physics had also earned me the opportunity to devote part
  of my time to exploring ways of improving measurement
  capabilities using those tools. I used that opportunity to pursue
  laser cooling, and the story of how that went is told in the
  accompanying Nobel Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  In 1979, shortly after Jane and I moved to Gaithersburg, we
  joined Fairhaven United Methodist Church. We had not been regular
  church-goers during our years at MIT, but Ed and Jean Williams
  invited us to Fairhaven and there we found a congregation whose
  ethnic and racial diversity offered an irresistible richness of
  worship experience. Later that year, our first daughter,
  Catherine, now known as Caitlin, was born. In 1981 Christine was
  born. Our children have been an unending source of blessing,
  adventure and challenge. Their arrival, at a time when both Jane
  and I were trying to establish ourselves in new jobs, required a
  delicate balancing of work, home, and church life. Somehow, our
  faith and our youthful energy got us through that period.<br>
  <br>
  At NBS, with some borrowed equipment and some extra money that
  Barry Taylor, in his inimitable fashion, obtained from somewhere,
  I got started with laser cooling. Support from the Office of
  Naval Research allowed Hal Metcalf to spend time at NBS in those
  early days. I had worked with Hal a little at MIT, and I knew
  that his unbounded enthusiasm and his effervescent creativity
  were priceless qualities. My collaborating with Hal on laser
  cooling was the first and one of the most important among many
  valuable interactions with colleagues who came to NIST, or whom I
  met elsewhere. I have mentioned many of these in my Lecture, and
  I want to emphasize again how much they have contributed to the
  development of laser cooling, and particularly, how important the
  senior group members, Kris Helmerson, Paul Lett, Steve Rolston,
  and Chris Westbrook, have been. I also want to recall the words
  of Bengt Nagel in his formal remarks to Steve Chu, Claude
  Cohen-Tannoudji and myself on 10 December 1997 in Stockholm. He
  said that we were being recognized as leaders and representatives
  of our groups. The three of us feel very strongly that this Prize
  honors all of those wonderful colleagues who contributed so much
  to the development of laser cooling.<br>
  <br>
  Since the announcement of the award of the 1997 Nobel Prize in
  Physics, I have been honored to receive greetings and
  congratulations from colleagues and friends all over the world,
  as well as from many people whom I did not know. One such
  greeting came, not to me but to my children, from Susan Hench
  Bowis. She had read newspaper accounts of the announcement and
  recalled to my teenage daughters that she had been 17 when in
  1950 her father, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/index.html">Philip Hench</a>, had been
  awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He had been
  far from home at the time of the announcement, as I had been,
  and, like Caitlin, Susan Hench had been away at school.
  Transatlantic telephone calls were not common in those days, and
  so when she eventually made contact and congratulated her father,
  it was by cable. He cabled back to her, "Prouder of you, my
  darling, than of any prize." Surely the Nobel Prize is the
  highest award a scientist could hope to receive, and I have
  received it with a sense of awe that I am in the company of those
  who have received it before. But no prize can compare in
  importance to the family and friends I count as my greatest
  treasures.</p>
