  <h2>Structural and Spectral Changes of Chemical Atoms</h2>

  <p>The question of the composition of
  perceptible objects is one which already occupied the mind of the
  ancient Greeks. They formed the concept, as a philosophical
  speculation, of the indivisible particle, the atom, as the
  smallest component of perceptible objects. However, they did not
  pass beyond this stage of the hypothesis; they did not bring it
  to productivity through experimental research.</p>

  <p>It is otherwise with the mind of the
  Germanic peoples. They proceeded from the experience of their
  chemical dealings with matter, established the existence of a
  number of basic substances, or chemical elements, which could not
  be decomposed further, and proposed the hypothesis that a
  chemical element consists of homogeneous individuals, or atoms,
  which are responsible for the peculiar properties of the element,
  and which with the aid of chemical methods can neither be broken
  down further nor distinguished from one another.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the last century a
  certain torpidity fell upon this concept of the chemical atom.
  Its verification in thousands of chemical experiments led to the
  belief that the chemical atom not only could not be decomposed
  into further parts by familiar chemical methods, but that it was
  completely and absolutely indivisible. Moreover, the abundance of
  chemical compounds and their importance in daily life hindered
  the chemist from investigating the question, in what does the
  individuality of the atoms of different elements consist. In the
  last three decades the concept of the chemical atom has been set
  free from this torpidity by our experiences in physics. The
  discovery of various phenomena has led to a recognition of the
  fact that the chemical atom is an individual which again is
  itself made up of several units into a selfcontained whole.</p>

  <p>At the head of these new discoveries and
  insights comes the establishment of the facts that electricity is
  composed of discrete particles of equal size, or quanta, and that
  light is an electromagnetic wave motion. It followed necessarily
  from this that single separate electric quanta must be present in
  the composition of a chemical atom. For under certain conditions
  the chemical atoms emit light waves of a specific length or
  oscillation frequency - their familiar characteristic spectra -
  and these can come in the form of electromagnetic waves only from
  accelerated electric quanta.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the discovery that the negative
  electron is a component of the chemical atom is of fundamental
  importance. In cathode rays the physicist became acquainted with
  free negative electric quanta capable of independent movement,
  the mass of which is smaller than a thousandth of the mass of the
  hydrogen atom. In the process of ionization he saw the liberation
  of such negative quanta or electrons from the chemical atoms. By
  exerting the influence of a magnetic field on the spectral lines
  of chemical elements, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">Zeeman</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">Lorentz</a> even succeeded
  in detecting the negative electron in its place in, and as a
  component of, the atomic whole.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, in these last three decades of
  great physical discoveries, as never before in history, Nature
  has drawn back the veil from a third undreamt-of secret before
  the eyes of the physicist. The discovery and investigation of
  radioactivity has made clear even for the most sceptical not only
  the separability of the parts of an atom, but also the chemical
  and physical individuality of a chemical atom - particularly of a
  parent atom, but equally of the atoms arising from its decay.</p>

  <p>By recognizing that the chemical atom is
  composed of single separable electric quanta, humanity has taken
  a great step forward in the investigation of the natural world.
  However, this advance has faced us with a new, even greater
  problem - that of the structure of the atom. How many electric
  quanta are present in the atom of a chemical element? What are
  their fields of force? What are their mutual distances? What are
  their movements? What forces are roused on them if their state of
  equilibrium is disturbed by external interference?</p>

  <p>We have been faced with these questions for
  a decade and a half. It is improbable that speculations will
  succeed in providing the answer to all these questions at one
  stroke, by one bold vision. It is more likely that more than a
  century will pass before we know the structure of the chemical
  atoms as thoroughly as we do our solar system. The path to this
  goal will lead, as it has so far, through the difficulties and
  surprises of experimental research. Many scientists will have to
  contribute to the solution of the great problem; they will have
  to follow up and measure all those phenomena in which the atomic
  structure is directly expressed.</p>

  <p>With this in mind, for some twenty years I
  have set myself as my particular task the experimental
  investigation of the connexion between change in the structure
  and change in the spectra of chemical atoms. First of all, two
  questions may be posed in this connexion.</p>

  <p>The first of them is tied up with the
  phenomenon of change in the structure of the surface of the atom.
  In order that we may have clearly set out before us every
  possibility in this respect, we shall proceed from the single
  atom, the parts of which are all arranged according to mutual
  equilibrium. We have learnt through experience that when an
  electrical ray strikes the surface of an atom, an electron, and
  in some circumstances a second and even a third electron, can be
  detached. In place of the structure of the neutral atom we are
  left with the structure of the corresponding monovalent,
  divalent, or trivalent atomic ion. We ask ourselves: what are the
  two spectra which belong to the two atomic structures - to
  neutral atoms and to positive atomic ions? And this question may
  be supplemented by the second question: is a specific spectrum
  emitted if the positive atomic ion is changed into a neutral
  atom?</p>

  <p>To these questions I had given certain
  answers, at first in the form of working hypotheses, after a
  tentative examination of all previous observation known to me, in
  order to be able to think out a specific series of experiments to
  test the hypotheses.</p>

  <p>The answer to the first of these questions
  was as follows: the spectral series of a chemical element are
  peculiar to the structure of the positive atomic ions, and are
  observed principally in arcs and sparks, and their lines, as
  Rydberg showed most successfully, can be grouped together, the
  lines of each group being a function of the integers.</p>

  <p>The second hypothesis was as follows:
  during the attachment of negative electrons on the positive
  atomic ions of a chemical element its fine-structure band-spectra
  are emitted, as in numerous different orbits of attachment the
  potential energy is emitted in multiples of Planck's quantum
  constant.</p>

  <p>These two working hypotheses have met with
  very different fates. Not long after its postulation I realized
  that the second of them was wrong, and neither bore it
  experimental fruit. However, what has been extraordinarily
  fruitful theoretically is the nucleus of it - that is, the
  assumption that energy is emitted in accordance with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck</a>'s quantum law
  through an electron changing orbits about a positive charge. This
  assumption forms the startingpoint of Bohr's theory of the
  emission of serial lines. Although I myself once stood on the
  threshold of this theory, and although the final formulae give a
  series of frequency relationships in the spectral series which
  agree well with observed facts, I am nevertheless unable to
  believe it, because in its provisions it postulates suppositions
  which contradict, not only Maxwell's theory, but the very spirit
  of physics. This criticism is directed not at Planck's quantum of
  action, but at the hypotheses of Bohr which are bound up with
  it.</p>

  <p>But let us return to the hypothesis that
  the positive atomic ions are responsible for the spectral series.
  Shortly after it was formed, I was able to make it bear
  experimental fruit through the following reflection.</p>

  <p>By allowing the positive ions to pass
  through an electric field and thus giving them a certain
  velocity, it is possible to distinguish them from the neutral,
  stationary atoms. If it is possible to deduce their velocity from
  the spectral lines emitted by them, then this deduction implies
  the assignment of the displaced spectral lines to the moving
  atomic ions as emitters. The movement of the emitters of the
  spectral lines may be deduced on the basis of the Doppler
  principle.</p>

  <p>We can in fact first place the beam of rays
  of moving positive atomic ions in a plane perpendicular to the
  axis in which we see the spectral lines emitted by them. These
  only appear in the places in which they are normally situated in
  the spectrum when their emitters are stationary. Secondly we can
  allow the beam of positive atomic ions in our axis of vision to
  approach us, and then their spectral lines appear to us displaced
  from their normal place in the spectrum towards the shorter
  wavelengths, by an amount which is proportional to the velocity
  of the emitting system. And thirdly, if we make the atomic ions
  in our axis of vision travel away from us, then their spectral
  lines appear to us displaced from their normal position towards
  the opposite side.</p>

  <p>In the year 1905 I set about proving
  experimentally the phenomenon just described. The state of
  research at that time meant that one had to regard as positive
  ions the canal rays, which approach the cathode of the glow
  current and emerge on the other side through perforations in it.
  I directed the axis of the collimator of my spectrograph first
  perpendicular to the axis of a beam of hydrogen canal rays, and
  on a second occasion I allowed the canal rays in the axis of the
  collimator to approach it. During the comparison of the two
  spectrograms so obtained, the anticipated Doppler effect in the
  serial lines of hydrogen appeared, and the same result was later
  obtained on the serial lines of numerous other chemical
  elements.</p>

  <p>Thus at the beginning of 1906 it seemed to
  be established that the emitters of the spectral series of
  chemical elements are their positive atomic ions. This
  interpretation of my observations, it is true, was soon
  questioned. For, as particularly <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/index.html">W. Wien</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a> have shown,
  canal rays usually contain, beside the positive atomic-ion rays,
  also neutral rays, so that it was not possible to determine
  accurately whether the spectral lines showing a Doppler effect
  should be attributed to the former or the latter. However, cases
  came to light later in which canal rays containing only positive
  ions showed a Doppler effect in the spectral lines emitted by
  them. If even today I still regard the positive atomic ions of a
  chemical element as the emitters of their spectral series,
  nevertheless I do not take this concept now as restricted as I
  did when I only considered free positive atomic ions which owing
  to their positive total charge are accelerated by the electric
  field. Rather, in my present opinion, it is possible that the
  serial lines can in addition be emitted from a positive atomic
  ion which is not free, and to which a negative electron has
  already begun to attach itself; only the electron must not yet
  have come so close to the atomic ion that emission from the
  latter will already be sensitive to and disturbed by the electric
  field of the electron.</p>

  <p>In this connexion the ultraviolet
  continuous spectrum of hydrogen may be mentioned. I expected that
  a continuous spectrum would be emitted when in the course of the
  attachment of the negative electron to the positive atomic
  hydrogen ion its encroachment has continued so far that the
  emission of the serial lines is noticeably disturbed. I therefore
  looked for - and found - a continuous spectrum in hydrogen canal
  rays.</p>

  <p>Since the discovery of the Doppler effect
  in canal rays a great number of experiments on this phenomenon
  have taken place. The following results may, briefly, be deduced
  from them.</p>

  <p>The emitters of the spectral series are
  without exception single atoms, not compounds of atoms. The
  spectra of atomic ions of higher valence are different from the
  spectra of atomic ions of the same element, but of lower
  valence.</p>

  <p>The band-spectra - for example, those of
  hydrogen and nitrogen - do not as a rule show a canal-ray Doppler
  effect. Because I expected on the one hand that their emitters
  were positive molecular ions consisting of more than one atom,
  and because on the other hand positive molecular ions are also
  found as canal rays under low pressure, I was led to explain the
  absence of the Doppler effect in bands by the theory that when
  stimulation by collision takes place, so that light is emitted,
  the molecular ions of more than one atom are dissociated after a
  short period of existence. This concept also makes the canal-ray
  Doppler effect appear possible in bands, at a small velocity and
  low pressure. And in fact Mr. Rau of the W&uuml;rzburg Institute
  of Physics has recently succeeded in proving this in the case of
  negative-nitrogen bands. All his observations, moreover, lead to
  the conclusion that the emitters of these bands are positive
  diatomic nitrogen molecular ions.</p>

  <p>The announcement of this new step forward
  bids us recognize that research work on the canal-ray Doppler
  effect is by no means complete and the question of where the
  various spectra of chemical elements originate has not yet been
  conclusively answered.</p>

  <p>If the experimental physicist has already
  done a great deal of work in this field, nevertheless the
  theoretical physicist has still hardly begun to evaluate the
  experimental material which may lead him to conclusions about the
  structure of the atom. It has, however, been established that the
  conversion of the structure of the neutral atom into the
  structure of the ion involves fundamental changes in the
  oscillation of the electric quanta which remain in the structure.
  What conclusions, however, may be drawn from this about the
  structure of the neutral atom and of the ion remains an
  unanswered question.</p>

  <p>The removal of an electron from the surface
  of an atom - that is, the ionization of the atom - means a
  fundamental structural change in its surface layer. That this is
  accompanied by an equally fundamental change in the spectrum of
  the surface layer was to be expected from the very first. Matters
  are different in the case of the second sort of structural change
  which I made the subject of my experimental research.</p>

  <p>We must always bear firmly in mind that the
  chemical atom is an individual, self-contained structure of
  positive and negative electric quanta. An external electric
  field, meeting it and passing through it, affects the negative as
  much as the positive quanta of the atom, and pushes the former to
  one side, and the latter in the other direction. Certainly this
  displacement is soon stopped by the opposing forces which it
  awakens among the quanta, which are displaced relative to one
  another, but nevertheless the displacement does take place, and
  it means a deformation, an alteration of the atomic structure in
  comparison with its form before the influence of the external
  electric field. And the question arises whether this sort of
  alteration of the atomic structure, this deformation by an
  electric field, manifests itself in an alteration of the spectrum
  of the atom. In other words, the question of the effect of an
  electric field on spectral lines has thus arisen.</p>

  <p>At the time when I became engaged on this
  question Voigt had already developed and worked out
  mathematically a theory of an electric analogue to the Zeeman
  effect. The result of this theory was not encouraging; because it
  implied that the alteration to the oscillation frequency, or
  wavelength, of spectral lines by an electric field would be so
  small that it would be immeasurable. And this result seemed to be
  confirmed by the complete absence of success in research to find
  this effect extending over a number of years.</p>

  <p>However, I was unable to accept the
  presupposition of the theory - namely, the assumption that the
  emission of a spectral line on the part of an atom was the work
  of only one single independently moving electron in the atom. In
  my view the structure of the whole atom was that of an
  individual, with all its parts interconnected, and the emission
  of a spectral line appeared to me to be the result of the
  coherence and co-operation of several electric quanta. Therefore
  I expected that from the alteration of the atomic structure by an
  external electric field there would arise also an alteration of
  the spectrum of the atomic structure. And I tried to solve my
  problem by producing a strong electric field in a luminous gas. I
  achieved this by making canal rays, passing through perforations
  in the cathode, on the other side travel in a strong electric
  field between the cathode and a second supplementary electrode
  placed opposite it.</p>

  <p>My very first spectrogram of canal rays in
  hydrogen and helium revealed the effect of the electric field on
  a number of spectral lines and gave some hint of the wealth of
  phenomena in the newly opened-up field. Moreover this discovery
  also showed again how much richer and more original are the works
  of Nature than the ideas of Man. In the event of the axis on
  which the observer views the luminous electric field being
  perpendicular to the axis of the field, the theory had postulated
  that every single spectral line would be splitted under the
  influence of the electric field into two components, both of
  which would appear, relative to the normal line, displaced
  towards the longer wavelengths, and of which one would vibrate
  parallel, the other perpendicular, to the field. How different
  the reality! For example, the red hydrogen line is splitted
  symmetrically to the normal line into nine components, of which
  the electric vibrations of six are parallel, and three
  perpendicular, to the field.</p>

  <p>Since the discovery of the effect of an
  electrical field on spectral lines in the year 1913, already a
  great number of experiments on it have taken place. The most
  common and most important result of them is that the nature and
  size of the effect on corresponding series of different elements
  are largely an expression of the peculiarity of their atomic
  structure - or, at least, of the structure of the surface. Thus
  the effects on the hydrogen series, on the series of mono- and
  bivalent positive atomic helium ions, on the series of lithium,
  mercury, and aluminium, differ from one another in characteristic
  ways.</p>

  <p>The following results may be of interest in
  detail.</p>

  <p>Along a series of lines running from longer
  to shorter wavelengths the effect of the electric field becomes
  greater as the serial numbers increase - that is, as the
  wavelength decreases.</p>

  <p>The proportion of the intensity of various
  series within a serial system is, in the case of several
  elements, dependent on the strength of the deforming electric
  field. Thus under its influence new series may become visible,
  which outside the electric field possess so little intensity that
  they are not observable.</p>

  <p>The broadening and displacement of spectral
  lines which accompanies an increase in the pressure of the gas or
  in the density of ions, originates in the effect of the electric
  fields of single atoms on neighbouring light-emitting atoms.
  Connected with this is Haber's highly promising idea of tracing
  the heterogeneous catalysis in solid surfaces back to the
  deformation of the molecular structure by the molecular electric
  field. Perhaps it will be possible to spectro-analyse accurately
  such electric fields.</p>

  <p>But let us leave these details and return
  to the problem of the structure of the atom. We must ask
  ourselves whether a conclusion about the structure of the atom,
  or at least about the process of the emission of serial lines,
  may be drawn from the effects of an electric field on serial
  lines. Now, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a>
  and Epstein have developed a theory for the effect in question
  which gives the number and interval for the component lines in
  electric fields which agree surprisingly well with observed
  facts, at least in the case of the series of the monovalent
  atomic hydrogen ion and of the bivalent atomic helium ion-or,
  rather, in the case of the electron adhering to these ions. This
  agreement strongly supports Bohr's theory of the emission of
  spectral lines, and thus also his presupposition, originating
  from <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Rutherford</a>, about the
  structure of the hydrogen and helium atoms.</p>

  <p>In spite of my high estimation of this
  achievement by the theory, nevertheless I am unable to accept it
  as definitive; apart from the fact that I am unable to believe in
  some of its presuppositions, it does not fully correspond to our
  experience. It cannot explain the following observation, which
  seems to me very important to research into the structure of the
  atom.</p>

  <p>A beam of luminous hydrogen canal rays has,
  owing to its velocity, exactly the same direction as that of the
  electric field in which it may be made to move. If the axis of
  the beam is placed perpendicular to the axis of the field, the
  intensities of the components of every single line which is
  splitted are as symmetrical relative to the normal lint as the
  intervals at which the components are situated to right and left
  of it. On the other hand, if the direction of the rays is the
  same as that of the field, then the intensity of those components
  which lie on the side towards the longer wavelengths increases.
  And if the canal rays are made to travel in the opposite
  direction to that of the field, then <i>vice versa</i>, the
  components towards the shorter wavelengths appear with greater
  intensity. It would therefore seem as if a hydrogen atom, or its
  ion, in an electric field possesses polarity along the axis of
  the field - that is, two sides may be distinguished in this
  axis.</p>

  <p>This phenomenon is as remarkable as it is
  important. We may legimately expect to be able to come, from its
  theoretical implications, to a conclusion about the structure of
  the hydrogen atom. It may well be successful, if we not only take
  into account, as has been the case up till now, the effect on a
  single electron at the surface of the atom, but take as the point
  of departure for our inferences from the observations the
  connexion between the parts of an atom which go to make up an
  individual structure.</p>

  <p>Reference to this brings us back to the
  problem of the structure of the atom. We shall realize the
  immensity of this problem when we cast a glance behind us at the
  ground which has already been covered. Research into changes in
  the spectrum of chemical atoms as a result of changes in their
  structure has disclosed a whole series of new phenomena. The
  removal of an electron from the surface of an atom - or its
  reattachment - leads to fundamental changes in the spectrum of
  the atomic parts capable of oscillation; and the deformation of
  the atomic structure by an electric field is expressed by various
  forms of influence on the oscillation of those atomic parts. But
  even though these new phenomena have already so richly borne
  experimental fruit, even though the theories which are beginning
  to be built on them seem so promising, nevertheless they have
  hardly begun to clarify the great problem, have only shed light
  on a small part of the experimental work, and still less on the
  theoretical field. Research into these phenomena can do no more
  than contribute a little to the solution of the great problem of
  the structure of the atom. It will still need the work of many
  generations to reach that solution. Our advance from the
  speculative hypothesis of the atom formed by the Greek mind to
  the discovery of the electric nature of the structure of the atom
  through the Germanic research of the past century should be an
  encouragement and a lesson for the century to come.</p>
