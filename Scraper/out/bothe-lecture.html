  <h2>The Coincidence Method</h2>

  <p>Before embarking on the subject of my
  lecture, permit me to devote a few words to the man to whom,
  apart from my teacher, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Max Planck</a>, I owe so
  much, and who died ten years ago after a long period of painful
  suffering. In 1912 Hans Geiger was appointed Director of a new
  Laboratory for Radioactivity at the Physikalisch-Technische
  Reichsanstalt, Berlin-Charlottenburg of which Emil Warburg was
  then the President; previous to this, he had worked for six years
  under Rutherford at Manchester. In June 1913, I became Geiger's
  assistant. The Laboratory for Radioactivity consisted of only two
  rooms at the time; at a later date, when tests of radioactive
  substances became more extensive, it expanded into four rooms.
  This modesty of his room requirements - Geiger repeatedly stated
  that he had no desire for a giant institute - is characteristic
  of the principal trait in Geiger's personality as a scientist:
  the desire to keep scientific work within economic bounds. No
  doubt, the unique influence of Rutherford had something to do
  with this; equally indubitably, this influence harmonized with a
  natural tendency. However this may be, the experiments by Geiger
  and Marsden on the scattering of alpha rays are known to form
  part of the beginning of the entire experimental atom physics of
  recent days. I think the main lesson which I have learnt from
  Geiger is to select from a large number of possible and perhaps
  useful experiments that which appears the most urgent at the
  moment, and to do this experiment with the simplest possible
  apparatus, i.e. clearly arranged and variable apparatus.</p>

  <p>It was in 1924 that I came across the
  theoretical paper by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a>, Kramers, and
  Slater, which had just been published and which suggested a
  possible interpretation of the wave-particle dualism in the
  accepted description of the properties of light. This must be
  understood to mean the experimental fact that light of all
  wavelengths behaves as a wave process (interference) with pure
  propagation, but behaves as particles (light quanta:
  photo-effect, Compton effect) on conversion into other types of
  energy. The new idea consisted in denying strict validity to the
  energy-impulse law. In the individual or elementary process, so
  long as only a single act of emission was involved, the laws of
  conservation were held to be statistically satisfied only, to
  become valid for a macroscopic totality of a very large number of
  elementary processes only, so that there was no conflict with the
  available empirical evidence. It was immediately obvious that
  this question would have to be decided experimentally, before
  definite progress could be made. That such a decision was
  <i>possible</i>, Geiger and I agreed immediately, when I
  discussed the paper by Bohr, Kramers, and Slater with Geiger.</p>

  <p>The experimental problem offered several
  means of attack. We decided in favour of an experiment with the
  effect discovered a short time previously by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/index.html">A.H. Compton</a>, i.e. the
  scattering of light on practically free electrons. Apart from the
  scattered light, there occur the "recoil electrons" which had
  been observed and interpreted by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/index.html">C.T.R. Wilson</a> in the
  cloud chamber, and by me both in the cloud chamber and by an
  ionization method. The "question to Nature" which the experiment
  was designed to answer could therefore be formulated as follows:
  is it exactly a scatter quantum and a recoil electron that are
  simultaneously emitted in the elementary process, or is there
  merely a statistical relationship between the two?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Geiger had developed the
  so-called needle counter which has the advantage of responding
  not only to heavy particles but also to electrons, and therefore
  to light quanta of sufficiently high energy capable of releasing
  electrons within the counter.</p>

  <p>Our arrangement therefore consisted of two
  needle counters, past the common front wall of which, without
  touching it, swept a beam of X-rays. The X-ray beam travelled in
  a hydrogen atmosphere; the Compton processes occurred in the one
  counter which indicated the recoil electrons, whereas only the
  scatter quanta were able to penetrate into the other counter and
  actuated it by electron release with very much lower probability.
  The readings of both counters were recorded side by side on a
  moving paper chart. In this way we succeeded after a few failures
  to establish the accuracy of any temporal "coincidence" between
  the two pointer readings as being 10<sup>-4</sup> sec. Film
  consumption however was so enormous that our laboratory with the
  film strips strung up for drying sometimes resembled an
  industrial laundry.</p>

  <p>The final result we obtained was that
  systematic coincidences do indeed occur with the frequency that
  could be estimated from the experimental geometry and the
  response probabilities of the counters on the assumption that, in
  each elementary Compton process, a scatter quantum and a recoil
  electron are generated <i>simultaneously</i>. The strict validity
  of the law of the conservation of energy even in the elementary
  process had been demonstrated, and the ingenious way out of the
  wave-particle problem discussed by Bohr, Kramers, and Slater was
  shown to be a blind alley.</p>

  <p>This result was confirmed by different
  researchers using various experimental arrangements. When, more
  than ten years later, some doubts as to the correctness of this
  result were voiced, I tried with my then assistant, H.
  Maier-Leibnitz, to supplement and improve the original experiment
  in one point: the object was to demonstrate both simultaneity and
  uniformity of direction of scatter quantum and recoil electron,
  as was to be expected according to Compton's theory, i.e.
  according to the laws of elastic impact between two bodies. On
  this occasion, we employed the energy-rich gamma radiation of a
  radiothorium preparation. Again, the result was clearly positive.
  This demonstrated both the conservation of energy and the
  conservation of the impulse.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the collaboration with
  Geiger came to an end in 1925, when Geiger was called to Kiel
  University. When dividing up the field on which we had hitherto
  worked together, the coincidence method was, at Geiger's generous
  suggestion, allocated to me.</p>

  <p>The possibility of the purely statistical
  validity of the conservation theorems discussed by Bohr, Kramers,
  and Slater appeared sufficiently important to be tested in yet
  another case. A spherical wave is emitted in the elementary
  process of <i>light emission</i>. The problem was: can this
  spherical wave initiate an absorption act in one direction of
  emission only, as the energy theorem postulates, or can it do so
  also statistically independently in several directions, as is to
  be expected according to Bohr, Kramers, and Slater? It must be
  borne in mind in an experiment of this kind, that, by contrast
  with the Compton effect, the probability of demonstrating an
  absorption act may not be of an order of magnitude much below
  unity, because otherwise any systematic coincidences that might
  occur would be submerged in the inevitable accidental
  coincidences. This was achieved by harmonizing the radiation
  source (iron or copper-K-fluorescence radiation) and the gas
  charge of the needle counters (argon) erected on either side so
  that the absorption probability in the gas charge was as close as
  possible to unity. Besides, the solid angles which the two
  counters offered to the radiation source had to amount as far as
  possible to 2 <font face="Symbol">p</font>. The result of this
  experiment (1926) was that <i>no</i> systematic coincidences
  occurred, at least not with the frequency to be expected
  according to Bohr, Kramers, and Slater. Strict conservation of
  energy in the elementary process had thus been confirmed also by
  a negative experiment. The wave-particle problem was destined to
  remain open for a short time only. During this time I had the
  singular good fortune of being able to discuss the problem
  constantly with Einstein. Some experiments done at Einstein's
  suggestion yielded no decisively new result. The (at least
  formal) solution was provided by wave mechanics; it is contained
  simply in the assumption that the Schr&ouml;dinger wave of a
  system consisting of <i>n</i> particles is a wave in the
  <i>3n</i>-dimensional "configuration space".</p>

  <p>An entirely different field in which the
  coincidence method bore fruit, was that of "cosmic radiation" or
  "ultra radiation" as its discoverer, Hess, called it. Meanwhile,
  Geiger had developed, in Kiel, the powerful tool of the
  Geiger-M&uuml;ller counter. Coincidences between unscreened
  counters, caused by cosmic rays, had been observed both by Geiger
  himself and by W. Kolh&ouml;rster, then a guest in my Berlin
  laboratory. More profound discoveries were to be expected by
  arranging absorbing layers of variable thickness between or/and
  above the counters. Such experiments which I conducted together
  with Kolh&ouml;rster in 1929 prompted the daring conclusion that
  cosmic radiation does not consist primarily of gamma rays, as had
  generally been assumed previously because of the high permeating
  power, but of material particles with an energy of at least 1,000
  million electron volt. Such countercoincidence arrangements were
  increasingly used in the period which followed, using increasing
  numbers of counters, in part combined with cloud chambers,
  ionization chambers, scintillation counters, etc. The material
  particle nature of primary cosmic radiation has been confirmed,
  although the processes turned out to be extraordinarily more
  complicated than we had assumed. As a simple example of this we
  would only mention that B. Rossi who also spent some time as
  guest in my PTR laboratory, later succeeded in observing by means
  of coincidences between <i>juxtaposed</i> counters ("Rossi
  curve") the first signs of the occurrence of showers of
  particles. The possible applications of the coincidence method to
  the subject of cosmic radiation have by no means been exhausted
  yet.</p>

  <p>The same principle of measurement as in
  cosmic radiation can of course also be applied to ordinary beta
  and gamma rays. It is for example possible to determine in a very
  simple manner, with the assistance of only two counters and a
  variable absorber between them, the mean gamma energy in a
  mixture of gamma rays and their secondary electrons (Bothe and
  Becker, 1930). This method can be useful where for some reason it
  is impossible to apply the usual spectrometer method with
  magnetic deviation.</p>

  <p>The technology of coincidence counting has
  been considerably improved meanwhile. Instead of the complicated
  photographic recording, we have long since passed on to valve
  circuits in conjunction with mechanical counters, which provides
  the advantage of greater simplicity and permits reduction of the
  so-called resolution period by several orders of magnitude, so
  that the interfering "accidental" coincidences in many cases play
  no part at all. I used a circuit employing a multiple-grid
  coincidence valve as early as 1929. Rossi was the first to
  describe another system working with valves in parallel; it has
  the advantage that it can easily be extended to coincidences
  between more than two events, and is therefore predominantly used
  today. (Recently, Z. Bay and others succeeded, in the U.S.A., in
  reducing the coincidence resolution period to 10<sup>-11</sup>
  sec by means of multipliers.)</p>

  <p>A further large field for the application
  of the coincidence method is that of nuclear reactions. In a
  joint investigation with my collaborator H. Fr&auml;nz (1928) and
  Pose in Halle it was discovered that in the artificial conversion
  of a nucleus (<sup>10</sup>B in our case) by alpha rays, there
  occur several discrete proton groups of different energy. Shortly
  afterwards (1930) I discovered, with H. Becker, the gamma rays
  that are generated on bombarding not only boron, but also other
  elements, with alpha rays. Both these results found a common
  interpretation. During conversion, the newly formed nucleus is
  not always immediately in the ground state, but is at times in
  one of the possible activated states. In this case, the particle
  formed has correspondingly less energy, whereas the product
  nucleus passes into the ground state with emission of the
  quantity of energy saved as gamma radiation. As a rule, this
  transition occurs in a period of immeasurably short duration,
  i.e. practically simultaneously with the emission of the new
  particle. To demonstrate this simultaneity is by no means
  trivial, because it may for example happen that the product
  nucleus <i>always</i> forms in an activated state at first. This
  can be decided by coincidence measurements. In this case, even
  the most energyrich group of particles that occurs would have to
  be coupled with gamma radiation, which is not the case if this
  group belongs to the ground state of the product nucleus. (For
  the case of "metastable" states of excitation, these arguments
  must be modified analogously.) Such measurements were first
  carried out in 1925 by H.J. von Baeyer who was then my student at
  Heidelberg, again for the case, already mentioned, of boron
  conversion by alpha rays. In the same manner, it is possible to
  determine whether two or several of the gamma quanta generated in
  a nuclear reaction form in the same nucleus, i.e. practically
  simultaneously, or whether they are emitted alternatively during
  the conversion of separate nuclei. Such questions are of
  importance for the balance of energy, i.e. for the measurement of
  reaction energies and nuclear mass. Direction coupling between
  the various radiations generated in a nuclear reaction both with
  one another and with the initiating radiation can also be
  detected and measured by coincidences; this provides valuable
  information about the structure of the atomic nuclei. Analogous
  problems in spontaneous conversions (natural and artificial
  radioactivity) can be tackled experimentally in the same manner,
  as has been demonstrated with RaC decomposition (Bothe and
  Maier-Leibnitz, 1937).</p>

  <p>Many applications of the coincidence method
  will therefore be found in the large field of nuclear physics,
  and we can say without exaggeration that the method is one of the
  essential tools of the modern nuclear physicist.</p>
