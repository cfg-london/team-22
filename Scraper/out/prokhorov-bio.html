  <h1>Aleksandr M. Prokhorov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="prokhorov.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Aleksandr Mikhailovich
  Prokhorov</b> was born on July 11th, 1916, in Australia. After
  the Great October Revolution he went in 1923 with his parents to
  the Soviet Union.<br>
  <br>
  In 1934 Alexander Prochorov entered the Physics Department of the
  Leningrad State University. He attended lectures of Prof. V.A.
  Fock (quantum mechanics, theory of relativity), Prof. S.E. Frish
  (general physics, spectroscopy), and Prof. E.K.Gross (molecular
  physics). After graduating in 1939 he became a postgraduate
  student of the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, in the
  laboratory of oscillations headed by Academician N.D. Papaleksi.
  There he started to study the problems of propagation of radio
  waves. In June 1941, he was mobilized in the Red Army. He took
  part in the Second World War and was wounded twice. After his
  second injury in 1944, he was demobilized and went back to the
  laboratory of oscillations of the P.N. Lebedev Physical
  Institute. There he began to investigate nonlinear oscillations
  under the guidance of Prof. S.M. Rytov.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 he defended his thesis on the theme Theory of
  Stabilization of Frequency of a Tube Oscillator in the Theory of
  a Small Parameter..<br>
  <br>
  Starting in 1947, upon the suggestion of Academician V.I.
  Veksler, Prochorov carried out a study of the coherent radiation
  of electrons in the synchotron in the region of centimetre waves.
  As a result of these investigations he wrote and defended in 1951
  his Ph.D. thesis a "Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the
  Synchotron Accelerator".<br>
  <br>
  After the death of Academician I.D. Papaleksi in 1946, the
  laboratory of oscillations was headed by Academician M.A.
  Leontovich. Starting from 1950 being assistant chief of the
  laboratory, Prochorov began to investigate on a wide scale the
  question of radiospectroscopy and, somewhat later, of quantum
  electronics. He organized a group of young scientists interested
  in the subjects.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954, when Academician M.A. Leontovich started to work in the
  Institute of Atomic Energy, Prochorov became head of the
  laboratory of oscillations, which position he still holds. In
  1959 the laboratory of radio astronomy headed by Prof. V.V.
  Vitkevitch) was organized from one of the departments of the
  laboratory of oscillations, and in 1962 another department was
  separated as the laboratory of quantum radiophysics (headed by
  Prof. N.G. Basov).<br>
  <br>
  Academician D.V. Skobeltzyn, director of the Institute, and
  Academician M.A. Leontovich as well, rendered great assistance in
  the development of the research on radiospectroscopy and quantum
  electronics. The investigations carried out by Basov and
  Prochorov in the field of microwave spectroscopy resulted in the
  idea of a molecular oscillator. They developed theoretical
  grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and also
  constructed a molecular oscillator operating on ammonia. In 1955,
  Basov and Prochorov proposed a method for the production of a
  negative absorption which was called the pumping method.<br>
  <br>
  From 1950 to 1955, Prochorov and his collaborators carried out
  research on molecular structures by the methods of microwave
  spectroscopy.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955 Professor Prochorov began to develop the research on
  electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR). A cycle of
  investigations of EPR spectra and relaxation times in various
  crystals was carried out, in particular investigations on ions of
  the iron group elements in the lattice of
  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955, Prochorov studied with A.A. Manenkov the EPR spectra of
  ruby that made it possible to suggest it as a material for lasers
  in 1957. They designed and constructed masers using various
  materials and studied characteristics of the masers as well. This
  research was done in cooperation with the laboratory of
  radiospectroscopy of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the
  Moscow University; this laboratory was organized by Prochorov in
  1957. One of the masers constructed for a wavelength of 21 cm is
  used in the investigations of the radioastronomical station of
  the Physical Institute in Pushino.<br>
  <br>
  The EPR methods were also utilized for the study of free
  radicals. In particular, the transition of a free radical of DPPH
  from a paramagnetic state into an antiferromagnetic state at 0.3K
  was observed.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 Prochorov suggested a laser for generation of far-infrared
  waves. As a resonator it was proposed to use a new type of cavity
  which was later called "the cavity of an open type". Practically
  speaking, it is Fabri-Pero's interferometer. Similar cavities are
  widely used in lasers.<br>
  <br>
  At present Prochorov's principal scientific interests lie in the
  field of solid lasers and their utilization for physical
  purposes, in particular for studies of multiquantum processes. In
  1963, he suggested together with A.S. Selivanenko, a laser using
  two-quantum transitions.<br>
  <br>
  Alexander Prochorov is Professor at the Moscow State
  University and Vice-President of URSI.<br>
  <br>
  He married in I941; his wife, G.A. Shelepina, is a geographer.
  They have one son.</p>
