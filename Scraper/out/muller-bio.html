  <h1>Paul M&uuml;ller - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="muller.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Paul
  Hermann M&uuml;ller</b> was born at Olten, Solothurn,
  Switzerland, on January 12th, 1899, and his early childhood was
  spent at Lenzburg, Aargau, the birthplace of his father who was
  an employee of the Swiss Federal Railway. The family moved to
  Basle where Paul attended primary school and, later, Free
  Evangelical elementary and secondary schools. He commenced work
  in 1916 as a laboratory assistant at Dreyfus and Company and the
  following year he joined Lonza A.G. as an assistant chemist in
  the Scientific-Industrial Laboratory of their electrical plant,
  gaining a wealth of practical knowledge which later stood him in
  good stead in his career as an industrial chemist. He
  matriculated in 1918 and returned to school to obtain his diploma
  (1919) which entitled him to attend Basle University: he
  studied there under Professors Fichter and Rupe for his Doctorate
  which he received in 1925. He began his career with J. R. Geigy
  A.G., Basle, in May, 1925, to become Deputy Director of
  Scientific Research on Substances for Plant Protection in
  1946.<br>
  <br>
  M&uuml;ller's first researches concerned the chemical and
  electrochemical oxidation of <i>m</i>-xylidine, and his early
  work at J. R. Geigy concerned vegetable dyes and natural tanning
  agents. He devoted some of his spare time to research on tanning
  agents and he invented synthetic agents which tanned hides pure
  white - they were, however, not fast to light. Later, in 1930, he
  developed the light-fast synthetic tanning agents Irgatan FL and
  Irgatan FLT. He worked on disinfectants for a short while, on
  moth-proofing agents for textiles, on pesticides in general, and
  he developed Graminone, a mercury-free seed disinfectant, before,
  in 1935, he started his researches on new synthetic contact
  insecticides.<br>
  <br>
  Four years of intensive work led to the synthesis of
  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and the basic Swiss patent
  was granted in 1940. This compound was originally made in 1873 by
  an Austrian student, but had never received any particular
  attention. Field trials now showed it to be effective not only
  against the common housefly, but also against a wide variety of
  pests, including the louse, Colorado beetle, and mosquito; and
  two products based on DDT, Gesarol and Neocide, were marketed in
  1942. These formulations were brought to the notice of British
  and American medical entomologists at a time, during World War
  II, when supplies of pyrethrum were rapidly falling short of
  demand. Production was soon established on both sides of the
  Atlantic and they proved to be of enormous value in combatting
  typhus and malaria - malaria was, in fact, completely eradicated
  from many island areas. These compounds have also had great value
  in agricultural entomology and they have provided a great
  stimulus in the search for other insecticides.<br>

  M&uuml;ller has had several papers on his work published in
  <i>Helvetica Chimica Acta.</i> He married Friedel R&uuml;egsegger
  in 1927. They have two sons, Heinrich (b. 1929) and Niklaus (b.
  1933), and one daughter, Margaretha (b. 1934), all married.</p>
