  <h1>Rudolf Eucken - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="eucken.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Rudolf Eucken</b> (1846-1926) was
  born in Aurich, Germany. He studied philosophy, philology, and
  history at the universities of G&ouml;ttingen and Berlin and wrote
  his dissertation on the language of Aristotle. He became a
  professor of philosophy at Basle in 1871 and from 1874 on held the chair
  of philosophy at Jena. Eucken was an idealist philosopher who
  developed his flexible system in many works. He revised his books
  and brought them up to date over a period of several decades, so
  that some of his works ran into more than a dozen editions. His
  main works were <i>Geistige Stromungen der Gegenwart</i> (1908)
  [<i>Main Currents of Modern Thought</i> ], <i>Die
  Lebensanschauungen der grosser Denker</i> (1890) [<i>The Problem
  of Human Life as Viewed by the Great Thinkers from Plato to the
  Present Time</i> ], <i>Der Kampf um einen geistigen
  Lebensinhalt</i> (1896) [The Struggle for a Spiritual Content of
  Life], <i>Der Wahrheitsgehalt der Religion</i> (1901) [<i>The
  Truth of Religion</i> ], <i>Grundlinien einer neuen
  Lebensanschauung</i> (1907) [<i>Life's Basis and Life's Ideal:
  The Fundamentals of a New Philosophy of Life</i> ], <i>Present
  Day Ethics in their Relation to the Spiritual Life</i> (the Deem
  Lectures given at New York University in 1913), and <i>Der Sinn
  und Wert des Lebens</i> (1908) [<i>The Meaning and Value of
  Life</i> ]. Eucken developed his philosophy of history in an
  essay entitled &laquo;Philosophie der Geschichte&raquo; (1907),
  which appeared in the series <i>Die Kultur der Gegenwart</i>
  [Contemporary Civilization].</p>
