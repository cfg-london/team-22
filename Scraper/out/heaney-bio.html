  <h1>Seamus Heaney - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="heaney.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Seamus Heaney</b> was born in April
  1939, the eldest member of a family which would eventually
  contain nine children. His father owned and worked a small farm
  of some fifty acres in County Derry in Northern Ireland, but the
  father's real commitment was to cattle-dealing. There was
  something very congenial to Patrick Heaney about the
  cattle-dealer's way of life to which he was introduced by the
  uncles who had cared for him after the early death of his own
  parents. The poet's mother came from a family called McCann whose
  connections were more with the modern world than with the
  traditional rural economy; her uncles and relations were employed
  in the local linen mill and an aunt had worked "in service" to
  the mill owners' family. The poet has commented on the fact that
  his parentage thus contains both the Ireland of the
  cattle-herding Gaelic past and the Ulster of the Industrial
  Revolution; indeed, he considers this to have been a significant
  tension in his background, something which corresponds to another
  inner tension also inherited from his parents, namely that
  between speech and silence. His father was notably sparing of
  talk and his mother notably ready to speak out, a circumstance
  which Seamus Heaney believes to have been fundamental to the
  "quarrel with himself" out of which his poetry arises.<br>
  <br>
  Heaney grew up as a country boy and attended the local primary
  school. As a very young child, he watched American soldiers on
  manoeuvres in the local fields, in preparation for the Normandy
  invasion of 1944. They were stationed at an aerodrome which had
  been built a mile or so from his home and once again Heaney has
  taken this image of himself as a consciousness poised between
  "history and ignorance" as representative of the nature of his
  poetic life and development. Even though his family left the farm
  where he was reared (it was called Mossbawn) in 1953, and even
  though his life since then has been a series of moves farther and
  farther away from his birthplace, the departures have been more
  geographical than psychological: rural County Derry is the
  "country of the mind" where much of Heaney's poetry is still
  grounded.<br>
  <br>
  When he was twelve years of age, Seamus Heaney won a scholarship
  to St. Columb's College, a Catholic boarding school situated in
  the city of Derry, forty miles away from the home farm, and this
  first departure from Mossbawn was the decisive one. It would be
  followed in years to come by a transfer to Belfast where he lived
  between 1957 and 1972, and by another move from Belfast to the
  Irish Republic where Heaney has made his home, and then, since
  1982, by regular, annual periods of teaching in America. All of
  these subsequent shifts and developments were dependent, however,
  upon that original journey from Mossbawn which the poet has
  described as a removal from "the earth of farm labour to the
  heaven of education." It is not surprising, then, that this move
  has turned out to be a recurrent theme in his work, from
  "Digging", the first poem in his first book, through the much
  more orchestrated treatment of it in "Alphabets"(<i>The Haw
  Lantern,</i> 1987), to its most recent appearance in "A Sofa in
  the Forties" which was published this year in <i>The Spirit
  Level</i>.<br>
  <br>
  At St. Columb's College, Heaney was taught Latin and Irish, and
  these languages, together with the Anglo-Saxon which he would
  study while a student of Queen's University, Belfast, were determining
  factors in many of the developments and retrenchments which have
  marked his progress as a poet. The first verses he wrote when he
  was a young teacher in Belfast in the early 1960s and many of the
  best known poems in <i>North</i>, his important volume published
  in 1975, are linguistically tuned to the Anglo-Saxon note in
  English. His poetic line was much more resolutely stressed and
  packed during this period than it would be in the eighties and
  nineties when the "Mediterranean" elements in the literary and
  linguistic heritage of English became more pronounced. <i>Station
  Island</i> (1984) reveals Dante, for example, as a crucial
  influence, and echoes of Virgil - as well as a translation from
  Book VI of <i>The Aeneid</i> - are to be found in <i>Seeing
  Things</i> (1991). Heaney's early study of Irish bore fruit in
  the translation of the Middle Irish story of Suibhne Gealt in
  <i>Sweeney Astray</i> (1982) and in several other translations
  and echoes and allusions: the Gaelic heritage has always has been
  part of his larger keyboard of reference and remains culturally
  and politically central to the poet and his work.<br>
  <br>
  Heaney's poems first came to public attention in the mid-1960s
  when he was active as one of a group of poets who were
  subsequently recognized as constituting something of a "Northern
  School" within Irish writing. Although Heaney is stylistically
  and temperamentally different from such writers as Michael
  Longley and Derek Mahon (his contemporaries), and Paul Muldoon,
  Medbh McGuckian and Ciaran Carson (members of a younger Northern
  Irish generation), he does share with all of them the fate of
  having be en born into a society deeply divided along religious
  and political lines, one which was doomed moreover to suffer a
  quarter-century of violence, polarization and inner distrust.
  This had the effect not only of darkening the mood of Heaney's
  work in the 1970s, but also of giving him a deep preoccupation
  with the question of poetry's responsibilities and prerogatives
  in the world, since poetry is poised between a need for creative
  freedom within itself and a pressure to express the sense of
  social obligation felt by the poet as citizen. The essays in
  Heaney's three main prose collections, but especially those in
  <i>The Government of the Tongue</i> (1988) and <i>The Redress of
  Poetry</i> (1995), bear witness to the seriousness which this
  question assumed for him as he was coming into his own as a
  writer.<br>
  <br>
  These concerns also lie behind Heaney's involvement for a decade
  and a half with Field Day, a theatre company founded in 1980 by
  the playwright Brian Friel and the actor Stephen Real. Here, he
  was also associated with the poets Seamus Deane and Tom Paulin,
  and the singer David Hammond in a project which sought to bring
  the artistic and intellectual focus of its members into
  productive relation with the crisis that was ongoing in Irish
  political life. Through a series of plays and pamphlets
  (culminating in Heaney's case in his version of Sophocles'
  <i>Philoctetes</i> which the company produced and toured in 1990
  under the title, <i>The Cure at Troy</i>), Field Day contributed
  greatly to the vigour of the cultural debate which flourished
  throughout the 1980s and 1990s in Ireland.<br>
  <br>
  Heaney's beginnings as a poet coincided with his meeting the
  woman whom he was to marry and who was to be the mother of his
  three children. Marie Devlin, like her husband, came from a large
  family, several of whom are themselves writers and artists,
  including the poet's wife who has recently published an important
  collection of retellings of the classic Irish myths and legends
  (<i>Over Nine Waves,</i> 1994). Marie Heaney has been central to
  the poet's life, both professionally and imaginatively, appearing
  directly and indirectly in individual poems from all periods of
  his oeuvre right down to the most recent, and making it possible
  for him to travel annually to Harvard by staying on in Dublin as
  custodian of the growing family and the family home.<br>
  <br>
  The Heaneys had spent a very liberating year abroad in 1970/71
  when Seamus was a visiting lecturer at the Berkeley campus of the
  University of California. It was the sense of self-challenge
  and new scope which he experienced in the American context that
  encouraged him to resign his lectureship at Queen's University
  (1966-72) not long after he returned to Ireland, and to move to a
  cottage in County Wicklow in order to work full time as a poet
  and free-lance writer. A few years later, the family moved to
  Dublin and Seamus worked as a lecturer in Carysfort College, a
  teacher training college, where he functioned as Head of the
  English Department until 1982, when his present arrangement with
  Harvard
  University came into existence. This allows the poet to spend
  eight months at home without teaching in exchange for one
  semester's work at Harvard. In 1984, Heaney was named Boylston
  Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, one of the university's most
  prestigious offices. In 1989, he was elected for a five-year
  period to be Professor of Poetry at Oxford University, a
  post which requires the incumbent to deliver three public
  lectures every year but which does not require him to reside in
  Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  In the course of his career, Seamus Heaney has always contributed
  to the promotion of artistic and educational causes, both in
  Ireland and abroad. While a young lecturer at Queen's University,
  he was active in the publication of pamphlets of poetry by the
  rising generation and took over the running of an influential
  poetry workshop which had been established there by the English
  poet, Philip Hobsbaum, when Hobsbaum left Belfast in 1966. He
  also served for five years on The Arts Council in the Republic of
  Ireland (1973-1978) and over the years has acted as judge and
  lecturer for countless poetry competitions and literary
  conferences, establishing a special relationship with the annual
  <a href="../1923/index.html">W.B. Yeats</a> International Summer
  School in Sligo. In recent years, he has been the recipient of
  several honorary degrees; he is a member of Aosdana, the Irish
  academy of artists and writers, and a Foreign Member of The
  American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1996, subsequent to his
  winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, he was made a
  Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French Ministry
  of Culture.</p>
