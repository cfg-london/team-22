  <h2>The Contributions of Right Heart Catheterization to
  Physiology and Medicine, with Some Observations on the
  Physiopathology of Pulmonary Heart Disease</h2>

  <p>The study of the right heart in man has
  held a continuing place in the researches of Dr. Cournand and
  myself over the past twenty-five years, both under physiological
  and pathological conditions. Measurements made in this exact
  location have provided a key to almost all the syntheses, all the
  integrations that we have attempted, in elucidating the nature of
  cardiopulmonary function.</p>

  <p>In the realm of pathology, pulmonary heart
  disease also occupies a key position, affected as it is by all
  manner of pulmonary as well as circulatory dysfunctions. With
  many of these we are particularly concerned in our research
  studies of the present day.</p>

  <p>In expressing my acknowledgement and
  appreciation to the Nobel Prize Committee and to the Caroline
  Institute for the supreme honour which they have so generously
  conferred on our work, I should like now, using these two
  subjects as a central theme, to give a brief account of our
  research from its beginning.</p>

  <p>The origins of any systematic research are
  many, extending widely, as well as far back in time. Many also
  are the supporting and sustaining research activities which are
  in progress simultaneously. We find ourselves deeply indebted to
  our colleagues throughout the world, for such assistance over
  many years.</p>

  <p>The foundation upon which the work of Dr.
  Cournand and myself chiefly rests is that of Lawrence J.
  Henderson of Harvard. Biochemist, physiologist, natural
  philosopher, student of Arrhenius, ardent disciple of Claude
  Bernard, Henderson achieved as his great single contribution the
  definitive integration of the respiratory function of the
  blood<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. But his horizon was
  far wider than this. He was a general physiologist in the
  broadest sense. For him the physical chemistry of the blood was
  but a single link in the whole circulorespiratory synthesis. Such
  breadth of view was inherent in everything he thought or did, and
  this could not help but be reflected, in some degree, in those
  whose good fortune it was to be associated with him. It was from
  Henderson that we derived the simple but essential concept that
  lungs, heart, and circulation should be thought of as one single
  apparatus for the transfer of respiratory gases between outside
  atmosphere and working tissues.</p>

  <p>This concept was of course not new, was in
  fact in the great tradition of Krogh, of Lindhard<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, of Liljestrand<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3,</sup></a><a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> and their collaborators, who with
  the methods then available, worked out to a remarkable extent in
  man the performance of the normal cardiorespiratory apparatus, in
  rest and exercise. Liljestrand made also a number of studies in
  disease. In the late nineteen-twenties and early thirties, the
  active research team at the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory under
  Henderson continued this exploration of cardiocirculatory
  patterns<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, to which their
  complete studies of the respiratory function of the blood
  constituted an important contribution.</p>

  <p>During all this time, however, and indeed
  for a total period of nearly forty years, there was in the study
  of the heart and circulation in man, one measurement or set of
  measurements which were conspicuously in default, viz. the state
  of the blood as it enters the right heart, its respiratory gas
  contents, its pressure relations, and its rate of flow.</p>

  <p>While the full potentialities of these
  measurements were not then appreciated, it was well known that an
  accurate figure for the respiratory gases in the mixed venous
  blood would enable, under conditions of a physiological steady
  state, a reliable measurement of total blood flow through the
  lungs. The principle was the simple one originally stated by
  Fick<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, of dividing the
  arteriovenous difference - the amount of oxygen taken up (or
  CO<sub>2</sub> given off) by unit volume of flowing blood -into
  the total amount of this gas taken up (or given off) by the lungs
  per minute.</p>

  <p>Only those who have worked through all or a
  part of those times can appreciate how ardently this information
  was sought after, and by how many devious approaches. The
  majority of these involved the use of the lungs as a tonometer,
  equilibrating the oxygen or the CO<sub>2</sub> of the lungs with
  that of the incoming pulmonary arterial blood. The early
  experiments of Loewy and von Schr&ouml;tter<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, the rebreathing techniques of
  Plesch<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, later of
  Christiansen, Douglas, and Haldane<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, and of Yandell Henderson<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>, were among the more important of
  these.</p>

  <p>I give special emphasis to this in the
  present account because it was to this long-standing problem that
  Dr. Cournand and I applied ourselves when we began our work in
  1931, on the service of Dr. James Alexander Miller in Bellevue
  Hospital. There was nothing original in our approach. We simply
  tried, as others had done before, to establish gaseous
  equilibrium between lungs and inflowing blood by rebreathing
  procedures, and to do this especially in patients with chronic
  pulmonary disease. But as others had also found before us,
  diseased lungs would not mix air evenly, and after three years it
  became apparent that we had failed completely in these
  attempts<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. And yet the
  failure was not quite complete. There proved to be some highly
  interesting things about this uneven mixing in diseased lungs.
  Robert Darling, working with us, extended earlier work in the
  same field by developing a breath-by-breath analysis of
  intrapulmonary mixing of inspired air, using the simple method of
  washing out intrapulmonary nitrogen through inhalation of pure
  oxygen<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>. This subject has
  since been further studied by many investigators and it
  constitutes now an important branch of pulmonary physiology. In
  our early experiments with Darling, two immediately practical
  features were worked out: an open circuit method of measuring
  residual lung volume, and in the same procedure, a rough but
  useful index of intra-pulmonary mixing: namely, the nitrogen
  remaining in the lungs after oxygen breathing<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. At this time also, with Eleanor
  Baldwin we were developing other practical methods of measuring
  pulmonary functions, greatly aided here by similar work in
  progress elsewhere, especially in the clinic of Knipping and
  Anthony in Hamburg<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13,</sup></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>.
  By the late nineteen-thirties, we were able to describe the
  ventilatory functions of the lungs, and with pulmonary
  measurements supplemented by arterial blood studies, in rest and
  exercise, define to some extent the mixing and the diffusional
  aspects of pulmonary alveolar or alveolar-capillary
  functions<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>. But we still
  could not measure blood flow through the lungs, and could not
  therefore move into those broader concepts of cardiopulmonary
  function which now began to be our goal.</p>

  <p>We were aware of the earlier experiment of
  Forssmann<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> and had followed
  closely its isolated uses in Germany, Portugal, South America,
  and France. Dr. Forssmann has just given you an excellent review
  of this. It suffices for me to say that late in 1940, Cournand
  and Ranges<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> took up the
  catheterization technique, showing in their initial studies that
  consistent values for blood gases could be obtained from the
  right atrium, that with this, cardiac output could be reliably
  and fairly accurately determined by the Fick principle, and
  furthermore that the catheter could be left in place for
  considerable periods without harm. Not long after, through the
  interest of Homer Smith, and the assistance of Bradley, pressure
  recordings by a Hamilton manometer were added to the other
  techniques. Blood volumes by Gregersen's method were also
  included<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>By this time, therefore, after ten years of
  work, we had assembled a fairly comprehensive group of methods
  for the analysis of cardiopulmonary function, methods which could
  be applied not only to normal man but to patients even in the
  most severe and acute stages of decompensation.</p>

  <p>The stage was now set for study of cardiac
  and pulmonary functions in many forms of clinical disease.</p>

  <p>First to be undertaken was an investigation
  of traumatic shock in man<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18,</sup></a>
  <a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>. The United States was by
  this time at war, and further information on the hemodynamics of
  shock, quantitative measurements of this, and of the effects of
  treatment, were urgently needed. These studies proceeded quite
  rapidly. It was demonstrated: that with a deficit of 40 to 50 per
  cent in blood volume, there were critical depressions in cardiac
  output and in return of blood to the right heart, worsening as
  shock continued unrelieved; that peripheral resistance tended to
  be maintained in hemorrhage and skeletal trauma, and greatly
  increased in severe bums; that an important corollary of this was
  reduced peripheral blood flow, demonstrated particularly in the
  case of the kidneys; that whole blood offered great advantages
  over plasma as sustaining therapy. Other forms of treatment were
  evaluated. Vasomotor factors, problems of so-called irreversible
  shock were approached but not solved. In certain cases of severe
  bum, the catheter was left in place for more than 24 hours, to
  provide a means of intravenous treatment, with no harm resulting,
  a further indication of the safety of the procedure.</p>

  <p>Even during these war years a number of
  basic contributions were made. Dr. Cournand will discuss the
  advancing of the catheter, first into the right ventricle, and
  then into the pulmonary artery, enabling new measurements, some
  of them as important physiologically as the original right
  atrial<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>. In the field of
  clinical heart disease, cases of heart failure with high cardiac
  output were identified and differentiated from "low output"
  failures<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>. McMichael and
  Sharpey-Schafer<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> in London
  had made similar observations independently. Baldwin<a href=
  "#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> studied a case of congenital
  heart disease with interventricular septal defect. There were
  numerous improvements in technique. With the cessation
  ofhostilities in 1945, we were free to look more broadly at
  problems of disease. By this time others were at work with the
  same procedures, in various parts of the world.</p>

  <p>The application of cardiac catheterization
  to the diagnosis of congenital heart lesions was an obvious one,
  and a number of investigators became interested and pursued this
  inquiry with great skill. The early studies of Cournand, Janet
  Baldwin, and Himmelstein<a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>
  were extended by much additional work by Bing<a href=
  "#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>, Dexter<a href=
  "#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>, and others. It should be noted
  that the great advance represented by the surgery of congenital
  heart disease, under such men as Gross<a href=
  "#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>, Blalock<a href=
  "#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>, Crafoord<a href=
  "#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a>, and Brock<a href=
  "#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>, was under way before cardiac
  catheterization, and has moved fundamentally on its own. The
  cardiac catheter has been, however, a primary aid. Sharing with
  angiocardiography the ability to define the anatomical lesions,
  the catheter also quantitates the volumes and pressures of
  abnormal flow, thus defining for the surgeon both the nature and
  extent of the disorder. By repeated catheterization can be
  determined postoperatively the degree to which a normal
  circulation has been restored.</p>

  <p>The measurements now available were
  adequate for a more general study of the physiology of heart
  failure; particularly since these could be carried out under
  conditions of cardiac decompensation and again following
  recovery. Pressures and flow in the pulmonary circulation gave an
  index of performance of the left ventricle, the same measurements
  in right heart and great veins an index of performance of the
  right ventricle. Many forms and degrees of failure were defined,
  and their responses to treatment measured: limited or fixed
  cardiac output, not responding to exercise; left ventricular
  failure with pulmonary hypertension; right ventricular failure
  with systemic venous hypertension; the congestive state with high
  blood flow, and with low; very low cardiac output without
  congestion; the dynamic effects of cardiac arrhythmias; the
  circulation in constrictive pericarditis<a href=
  "#footnote31"><sup>31,</sup></a> <a href=
  "#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>. The congestive state as such was
  established as a dominant aspect of heart failure, regardless of
  the level of general or regional blood flow.</p>

  <p>An important contribution, in its
  therapeutic as well as its physiological implications, was the
  analysis of the action of the digitalis glucosides, by Ferrer and
  Harvey in our Laboratory<a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>,
  also by McMichael and Sharpey-Schafer<a href=
  "#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>, by Bloomfield<a href=
  "#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a>, and others. It was established
  that digitali acts favorably only upon ventricles overdilated,
  with excessive filling pressures and inadequate emptying; that in
  such hearts it acts rapidly to increase the energy of
  contraction, increase stroke volume, and promote adequate
  emptying, thus relieving the congestive state; that it performs
  with regular as well as irregular cardiac rhythms.</p>

  <p>This large body of new knowledge of the
  dynamics of the circulation inevitably brought again under
  critical review the original Starling principle<a href=
  "#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a> namely, that the energy of
  ventricular contraction is proportional to fiber length, that is,
  to diastolic ventricular volume; and that this relation holds up
  to a certain optimal fiber length, beyond which myocardial
  contraction progressively fails. Alternatively, in clinical
  studies, the more readily measured diastolic filling pressure has
  been commonly used, instead of diastolic volume, a relationship
  developed before Starling, by Otto Frank. In this general
  inquiry, contrary to the usual sequence, it was the clinical
  physiologists who stimulated the general physiologists to further
  research<a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a>, and additional
  work in animals, especially by Hamilton<a href=
  "#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>, by Rushmer<a href=
  "#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a>, and others, has added much
  interesting material. Many questions are still in controversy,
  but there would appear to be fairly general agreement that in the
  normal heart under stress, the basic Starling relation is
  overridden by other influences, such as sympathetic control of
  muscle tone, the heart in exercise increasing its emptying rather
  than its filling volume; but that in the failing heart the
  fundamental relation between fiber length and energy of
  contraction may again emerge.</p>

  <p>One particular form of acquired heart
  disease that has come under intensive study in the last six years
  is, of course, mitral stenosis. The magnificent achievement of
  cardiac surgeons in the partial or complete relief of this
  mechanical block has permitted also the comparative study of the
  hemodynamics of the circulation before and after this surgical
  procedure. Many factors are involved in the selection of patients
  for surgery<a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>. By and large,
  clinical improvement postoperatively has coincided with fall in
  pulmonary arterial pressures, and frequently with increase in
  resting or in exercise cardiac output. The total physiological
  readjustment, however, is a complex one, and the interrelations
  between cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic pressures, and
  ventilatory and other pulmonary functions have not yet been fully
  worked out. Among many important contributors in this field may
  be mentioned Ellis<a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a>,
  Werk&ouml;<a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a>, Dexter,
  Souli&eacute;, Donald, and Lequime.</p>

  <p>The further extensions of the
  catheterization technique that are now being made, exploring the
  left atrium, the left ventricle, and the systemic aorta, are
  beyond the scope of the present discussion.</p>

  <p>These numerous excursions into cardiac
  physiology, which I have just reviewed, have indeed been a major
  feature of our work, and yet they somewhat obscure the fact that
  Dr. Cournand and I have from the beginning thought of ourselves
  as primarily pulmonary rather than cardiac physiologists. I
  should like to outline now, though in the briefest possible
  terms, some of the aspects of clinical pulmonary physiology that
  have also been under study in our Laboratory during the past
  several years.</p>

  <p>I return for a moment to the work of our
  former colleague, the late Dr. Eleanor Baldwin, and in doing so
  wish to pay tribute to her for the vital part that she played in
  our whole research achievement. With the group of standard
  methods that I have referred to earlier, she studied over a
  ten-year period a large number and variety of cases of chronic
  pulmonary disease. Inclusion of circulatory data from cardiac
  catheterization in many of these patients completed the picture
  of cardiorespiratory failure. It was found that these cases on
  analysis fitted well into the broad categories of pulmonary
  insufficiency that we had earlier described: the gross
  ventilatory, with restrictive or obstructive aspects; and the
  alveolar-capillary, with primary disturbances in respiratory gas
  exchange. Some disorders, such as pulmonary emphysema, were
  complex with various combinations of these factors. One
  definitely new physiological group emerged, that of the
  diffusional insufficiency or alveolar-capillary block, with the
  major interference at the alveolar-capillary interface<a href=
  "#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>This type of broad physiological analysis,
  with subsequent therapy directed to precise and specific aspects
  of insufficiency, has proved to be of great value in the clinical
  management of this large category of chronic disease.</p>

  <p>In the past decade there has developed a
  much more exact analysis of intrinsic pulmonary function, to
  which I can refer here only briefly and inadequately. It is a
  development, however, which constitutes one of the most
  significant advances in basic physiology that have been made in
  the various fields to which cardiac catheterization has
  contributed. The general subject is that of diffusion of gases
  across the alveolar-capillary membrane and of the
  ventilation-perfusion relationships in the lungs. Two independent
  groups of investigators have been largely responsible for this
  development. At the University of Rochester, Rahn and
  Fern<a href="#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a> approached the
  subject initially by way of a description of the various possible
  relationships between oxygen uptake and CO<sub>2</sub>
  elimination in the lungs - the respiratory exchange ratio. The
  other, consisting first of Riley, and Lilienthal, later Riley,
  Cournand, Donald, and associates<a href=
  "#footnote44"><sup>44,</sup></a> <a href=
  "#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>, developed first a simple formula
  for the determination of mean alveolar oxygen tension, then
  proceeded to study the special properties of the oxygen
  dissociation curves of blood. Using the principle that at high
  oxygenation there is a distinct alveolar-capillary oxygen
  gradient, they found it feasible to use high and low oxygenations
  in human subjects to measure the diffusion process. Extension of
  the work led to a general definition of ventilation-perfusion
  relationships, separating effective "alveolar" ventilation from
  ineffective "dead space" ventilation on the one hand; and
  effective "alveolar" perfusion from ineffective "venous
  admixture" on the other. Developments in this field, under Riley,
  Comroe and Forster, Rossier, and others, cannot be further
  reviewed here.</p>

  <p>The discussion up to this point has indeed
  been an overlong introduction to the problem of pulmonary heart
  disease. Yet this information is not irrelevant. The heart in
  chronic pulmonary disease is at a crossroads, itself a
  consequence of both pulmonary and cardiocirculatory
  disturbances.</p>

  <p>Pulmonary heart disease - cardiac
  hypertrophy and dilation secondary to disease of the lungs, - or
  <i>cor pulmonale</i>, was clearly delineated by La&euml;nnec
  nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, but has attracted
  considerable attention only within the past generation. Its
  importance and its incidence are increasing, in large part
  because patients with chronic pulmonary disease now live longer,
  being protected somewhat from infection, and relieved and
  sustained, in some instances for considerable periods, by
  symptomatic therapy.</p>

  <p>At the present time, a very considerable
  proportion of patients suffering from chronic pulmonary disease
  with progressing pulmonary insufficiency will eventually develop
  cor pulmonale. In some instances the heart failure becomes
  chronic and continues for years; in others it appears only
  terminally; in still others there may be repeated episodes of
  right heart strain and failure, especially during recurring
  pulmonary infection. These clinical patterns are only now
  beginning to be defined, as the cases are followed over many
  years; as yet, a generally accepted classification of pulmonary
  heart disease has not been made. In the present brief sketch I
  shall move rapidly through some of the more frequently
  encountered forms, their natural history and physiological
  components. This description is based chiefly on the work of
  Harvey and Ferrer<a href="#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a> in our
  Laboratory.</p>

  <p>It will be convenient to use as a prototype
  chronic diffuse pulmonary emphysema, concentrating on the
  features concerned with the flow of blood through the lungs and
  the action of the right heart.</p>

  <p>The principal factors inducing right
  ventricular strain, hypertrophy, and failure can be stated very
  simply: (1) pulmonary hypertension, from one cause or another;
  and (2) secondary influences throwing a burden on the right
  heart, such as anoxia, increased blood volume, polycythemia,
  increased cardiac output, disordered breathing mechanics.</p>

  <p>The division of pulmonary emphysema, as
  originally made by Baldwin <i>et al</i>.<a href=
  "#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>, into four physiological groups,
  is applicable also to a consideration of cor pulmonale. We shall
  assume here the most common pathogenetic form of emphysema, that
  proceeding from chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction,
  moving on to the hyperinflated obstructive type of ventilatory
  insufficiency.</p>

  <p>In the first and mildest of these groups,
  the disturbances of pulmonary mechanics are not associated with
  arterial hypoxia or difficulties with CO<sub>2</sub>,
  elimination. In these cases pulmonary vascular pressures are
  within normal limits and there is no significant right heart
  strain<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In the second group, ventilatory function
  is more severely curtailed, often to one-fourth or one-fifth of
  normal, and anoxia appears. Work or effort of breathing is much
  increased. Carbon dioxide elimination is still adequate. It is
  extraordinary in some cases how much destruction of pulmonary
  tissue can exist, how little the remaining effective diffusing
  area, with the lungs still able to carry on CO<sub>2</sub>,
  exchange. Similarly, pulmonary arterial pressures can remain
  normal, at least during rest, with a remarkably small proportion
  of available vascular channels. In general, pulmonary arterial
  pressures seem to rise - roughly in proportion to the degree of
  arterial hypoxia<a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>. That
  this is due in large part to the constricting effect of anoxia
  upon the pulmonary vascular apparatus is suggested by the fact
  that physiologically this hypertension is usually reversible when
  the patient's compensation has been restored, and the anoxic
  state relieved. On the negative side, we have found not too clear
  a correlation between the degree of pulmonary hypertension, and
  the extent of anatomical pulmonary vascular change, either
  muscular hypertrophy or arteriosclerosis.</p>

  <p>Clinically, the right heart often begins to
  show objective evidence of hypertrophy and dilation when
  pulmonary arterial pressures exceed twice normal values.</p>

  <p>In the next or third group, anoxia is more
  profound, and CO<sub>2</sub> retention with hypercapnea is added.
  The aeration of the alveolar spaces has entered its final stage
  of decompensation, and the full state of alveolar hypoventilation
  is established. Here the primary constricting effects of anoxia
  send the pulmonary arterial pressures to higher levels; and
  secondary effects of both anoxia and hypercapnea place their
  added burdens on the heart.</p>

  <p>The extent of breakdown here, actually of
  reversal of supposedly homeostatic mechanisms, is remarkable.
  Profound arterial oxygen unsaturation leads to marked
  polycythemia, total blood volume increasing by the amount of the
  increased red cell mass. This overfills the blood bed, including
  the heart, and this drives the heart, so to speak, to increased
  output and eventual failure. The pulmonary vascular channels may
  also be congested, with further anoxia resulting. That this is
  not a favorable homeostasis, but an unfavorable excess response,
  can be shown directly by a phlebotomy, which often brings
  immediate and striking improvement in all functions.</p>

  <p>Even more widespread are the systemic
  effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The rise in alveolar and
  blood CO<sub>2</sub> tensions produces at the kidneys, as shown
  by the work of Pitts<a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a> and
  of Gilman<a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>, a retention of
  bicarbonate, thus further raising blood and tissue CO<sub>2</sub>
  levels, though of course relieving in part the uncompensated
  gaseous acidosis. Continued high pCO<sub>2</sub> apparently
  depresses the sensitivity of the respiratory center to the
  CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus, with still further loss of effective
  pulmonary ventilation.</p>

  <p>What further effects the retained
  bicarbonate may have on electrolyte and water balances in the
  body is not known.</p>

  <p>Most extreme of the forms of physiological
  dysfunction in emphysema are those rather uncommon cases of
  severe alveolar hypoventilation sometimes called the Ayerza
  syndrome, in which all of the above trends are manifested to
  maximum degree, and yet often with only mild anatomical changes
  in the lungs<a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>.
  Functionally, however, there is always bronchial obstruction,
  marked alveolar hypoventilation<a href=
  "#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a>, and the most severe
  ventilation/perfusion disturbances. Even in these cases the
  entire circulation can often be restored to normal, with normal
  pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac output reduced to normal
  values, by vigorous symptomatic therapy, relieving bronchial
  obstruction, the hypoxia, hypercapnea, polycythemia and
  hypervolemia, and by active treatment of congestive failure.</p>

  <p>There are other forms of pulmonary disease
  in which cor pulmonale is a significant complication. There is a
  category, for example, in which there has been a progressive loss
  of function or a destruction of total pulmonary tissue, down to a
  critical level, to an irreducible minimum. Cor pulmonale with
  failure may develop in such cases, usually terminally or as a
  very late stage<a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a>. Such
  cases include those of severe kyphoscoliosis, occasionally
  widespread and far-advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, some cases of
  bullous emphysema with replacement or compression of active lung
  tissue. I have mentioned earlier another newly defined form of
  pulmonary dysfunction, that of diffusion insufficiency or
  alveolar-capillary block. Such cases, in the advanced stages with
  continuous hypoxia, commonly have right-sided heart failure as a
  late complication. Still another important type is that of
  primary pulmonary vascular narrowing, represented by multiple
  pulmonary embolization, pulmonary schistosomiasis, and the
  somewhat controversial entity called primary pulmonary
  hypertension. In these the right heart strain is directly
  proportional to pulmonary hypertension, and the patients go
  eventually into massive right heart failure with low and
  diminishing cardiac output<a href=
  "#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I have dealt with this particular subject,
  pulmonary heart disease, in somewhat greater detail than the rest
  of my account, partly to show the type of functional analysis
  that can readily be made in clinical cases, but partly also to
  illustrate what is perhaps obvious, that such analysis is at best
  superficial, does no more at the present time than set forth what
  some of the more fundamental problems are.</p>

  <p>It is no part of a survey such as this to
  predict the future, but I should like, in closing, to mention a
  few of the areas in which we believe that further basic research
  might well be concentrated. Dr. Cournand will touch on an
  important field, viz. the pharmacodynamics of the lung, and
  especially of the pulmonary circulation. Another that interests
  me greatly would be an effort to bring together function and
  structure, a reexamination of pulmonary anatomy by pathologists
  who are aware of functions and dysfunctions. May it not be
  possible to obtain, by such collaborative effort, more
  fundamental evidence on pathogenesis in such presently obscure
  and yet devastating conditions as pulmonary fibrosis in its many
  forms, the emphysematous change, bulla formation, the many-sided
  problem of pulmonary vascular change, the disorders of the
  bronchial circulation? Fortunately, work is already under way on
  many of these problems, by a new and dynamically minded
  generation of pathologists. So also with many of the other
  problems that I have touched upon, in renal and electrolyte
  physiology, as related to pulmonary disease, in blood formation,
  the physiology of the respiratory center, and so on.</p>

  <p>Summarizing, I have endeavored to present
  in this review a brief account of the development of cardiac
  catheterization in our hands, and some of the adventures that we
  have had with it. These have carried the work into many aspects
  of cardiopulmonary physiology and pathology. Our findings have
  been for the most part preliminary, revealing new problems more
  often than solving old ones. Of great value has been the interest
  which has been aroused and the excellent new work that has been
  stimulated in many laboratories and clinics in many
  countries.</p>
