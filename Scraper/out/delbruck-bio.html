  <h1>Max Delbr&uuml;ck - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="delbruck.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Max Delbr&uuml;ck</b> was born on
  September 4th, 1906, in Berlin, Germany, the youngest of seven
  children. His father, Hans Delbr&uuml;ck, Professor of History at
  the University of Berlin, was for many years editor and political
  columnist of the <i>Preussische Jahrb&uuml;cher.</i> His mother
  was a granddaughter of the chemist, Justus von Liebig.<br>
  <br>
  Max Delbr&uuml;ck grew up in a suburb of Berlin (Grunewald)
  populated by moderately affluent members of the academic,
  professional, and merchant community, many of them with large
  families. The period of affluence and lively hospitality before
  1914 was followed by the war years with hunger, cold, and death,
  and the postwar period of revolution, inflation, and
  impoverishment.<br>
  <br>
  His interest in science dates back to boyhood and was directed
  first towards astronomy, which he seized upon as a means of
  finding an identity in an environment of strong personalities.
  All senior to him, many with high accomplishments, none was in
  the sciences. The one exception, the oldest boy in the Bonhoeffer
  family, Karl Friedrich (his father Karl Bonhoeffer was Professor
  of Psychiatry), eight years older than Max Delbr&uuml;ck, was a
  physical chemist of high distinction, and became the mentor and
  lifelong friend of Delbr&uuml;ck. The shift to theoretical
  physics during the latter part of his graduate studies in
  G&ouml;ttingen was an easy one from astrophysics and a natural
  one in the late twenties, just after the breakthrough of quantum
  mechanics, for which G&ouml;ttingen was one of the centers.<br>
  <br>
  Among his friendships during the later student years, the most
  intense and influential one was with Werner Brock, now emeritus
  Professor of Philosophy, Freiburg.<br>
  <br>
  There followed three postdoctoral years (1929-1932) abroad, in
  England, Switzerland, and Denmark. The stay in England, with its
  immersion into a new language and a new culture, had a vast
  effect on widening his outlook on life. In Switzerland and
  Denmark the associations with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Wolfgang Pauli</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>
  shaped his attitude toward the pursuit of truth in science.<br>
  <br>
  Delbr&uuml;ck's interest in biology was first aroused by Bohr, in
  connection with his speculations that the complementarity
  argument of quantum mechanics might have wide applications to
  other fields of scientific endeavor and especially in regard to
  the relations between physics and biology. A move to Berlin in
  1932, as assistant to Lise Meitner, was largely motivated by the
  hope that the proximity of the various Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes
  to each other would facilitate the beginning of an acquaintance
  with the problems of biology. Paradoxically, this good intention
  was helped by the rise of Nazism which made official seminars
  less interesting. A small group of physicists and biologists
  began to meet privately beginning about 1934. To this group
  belonged N. W. Timofeeff-Ressovsky (genetics). Out of these
  meetings grew a paper by Timofeeff, Zimmer, and Delbr&uuml;ck on
  mutagenesis. A popularization of this paper of 1935 in <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schroedinger</a>'s little
  book &laquo;<i>What is Life?</i>&raquo; (1945) had a curiously
  strong influence on the development of molecular biology in the
  late 1940's.<br>
  <br>
  The move to the United States in 1937 was made possible by a
  second fellowship of the Rockefeller Foundation, permitting
  Delbr&uuml;ck to pursue with greater freedom and effectiveness
  his interests in biology. He chose Caltech because of
  its strength in <i>Drosophila</i> genetics, and to some extent
  because of its distance from the impending perils at home.
  Although his job in Germany seemed reasonably secure, it was
  clear that political reasons would bar him from
  advancement.<br>
  <br>
  At Caltech he soon teamed up with E. L. Ellis doing phage
  research. The fellowship of the Rockefeller Foundation ran out in
  September 1939. World War II had started and Delbr&uuml;ck
  elected to stay in the United States. He accepted an
  instructorship in the Physics Department at Vanderbilt
  University in Nashville, Tennessee. The years at Vanderbilt
  were the war years. Both <a href="index.html">Luria</a> (at
  Bloomington, Indiana) and Delbr&uuml;ck (at
  Vanderbilt) were technically enemy aliens, a status affording
  them the privacy to concentrate on science.<br>
  <br>
  In 1941 Delbr&uuml;ck married Mary Bruce. She has given his life
  the harmony needed for its fulfillment. They have four children -
  a first set, Jonathan and Nicola, born in 1947 and 1949, and,
  since these turned out so happily, a second set, Tobias and
  Ludina, born in 1960 and 1962.<br>
  <br>
  Since the early 1950's Delbr&uuml;ck's research interests have
  shifted from molecular genetics to sensory physiology and
  especially to the idea of introducing here, too, a microorganism
  of suitable simplicity. He turned to the sporangiophores of
  <i>Phycomyces</i> as a model system for the study of stimulus
  transductions. The goal of clarifying the molecular nature of the
  primary transducer processes of sense organs in general and of
  <i>Phycomyces</i> in particular has held his attention since
  then, with one interruption.<br>
  <br>
  This interruption was the setting up of an institute of molecular
  genetics at the University of Cologne. Delbr&uuml;ck's goal
  was to demonstrate the feasibility of modern interdisciplinary
  research and of the &laquo;department system&raquo; (with several
  professors in one institute) within a German university setup,
  and to boost molecular genetics in Germany.<br>
  <br>
  The Institut f&uuml;r Genetik der Universit&auml;t K&ouml;ln was
  formally dedicated on June 22nd, 1962, with Niels Bohr as the
  principal speaker. His lecture entitled &laquo;Light and Life -
  Revisited&raquo; commented on his original one of 1933, which had
  been the starting point of Delbr&uuml;ck's interest in biology.
  It was to be Bohr's last formal lecture. He died before
  completing the preparation of the manuscript of this lecture for
  publication.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1964 the experimental work on <i>Phycomyces</i> is once
  more being pursued with full force, together with theoretical
  studies on related systems.</p>
