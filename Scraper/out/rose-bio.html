  <h1>Irwin Rose - Biographical</h1>
 
<p><img src="rose.jpg" class="bio-img">We left my birthplace, Brooklyn, New York in 1939 when I was 13. I enjoyed
the ethnic variety and the interesting students in my public school, P.S. 134.
The kids in my neighborhood were only competitive in games although
unfriendly gangs tended to define the limits of our neighborhood. The major
extracurricular activities that I can remember were a Victory Garden on
school grounds, our contribution to the war effort, and a favorite sport, handball,
played between the walls of our apartment house.</p>
  <p>Mother, Ella Greenwald, was an American born into a family
    that included one sister and four brothers, all born in Hungary. Father,
    Harry Royze, had two brothers and a sister from the Odessa region of Russia.
    The Greenwalds and the Roses were secular Jews and the children more so although
    my younger brother and I spent some time in Hebrew school to please Grandfather
    Rose.</p>
  <p>Due to my brother having rheumatic fever the family was advised to go to
a high and dry climate, Spokane, Washington, where my mother's sister had
a comfortable home that could accommodate us. This left my father behind
tending his flooring business, an arrangement that I never understood and
felt conflicted about. Father's visits were few and far between. The war was
going on. Mother did secretarial work in the Navy Supply Depot in Spokane
while we kids were making our way through the Spokane school system.</p>
  <p>I worked during the summers at a local hospital, chiefly helping out in the
psychiatric ward. In time I came to see myself following some career that
involved solving medical problems. No one in my family had followed a career
in research. Uncle Arthur G. was an excellent violinist and artist, and taught
cabinet making at a trade school in Brooklyn. Uncle Dave R. would have become
a lawyer had the economic depression not led him into the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. There was no one in my circle from whom I could
expect to get advice.</p>
  <p>Initially, I thought problems on how the brain works
    to be the most interesting. But it was necessary to be practical, and concentrate
    on less obscure matters when I entered Washington State College. Besides,
    there were no courses given in neurobiology. However, I was strongly influenced
    by Prof. Herbert Eastlick, who urged his zoology students to set high standards
    for themselves, and then proceeded to the University of Chicago after a brief
    period in the Navy. My PhD thesis problem was to determine if the DNA content
    of rat tissues increased if there was B12 in the diet. This problem was suggested
    by my adviser based on the observation that thymine could replace vitamin
    B12 in a lactobacillus. I analyzed the DNA of tissues of rats fed with diets
    that varied in B12. This project was doomed to failure when the genetic nature
    of DNA was revealed, and I found that the DNA content per cell of liver was
    independent of diet<sup><a href="#not1">1</a></sup>.</p>
  <p><i>PhD Work.</i> I had to think of a new thesis project.
    Anxious to make up for lost time, I picked a problem out of my freshman biochemistry
    lecture notes. The Putnam/Evans group was interested in determining the origin
    of the nucleic acid components of bacteriophage synthesized in E. coli and
    Frank Putnam's lectures described experiments of Hammarsten, Reichard, and
Saluste<sup><a href="#not2">2</a></sup> as background information. <sup>15</sup>N-cytosine,
the free base, had been found not to be incorporated into DNA although <sup>15</sup>N-cytidine
was incorporated into rat liver DNA. It was obvious for me to ask if there might
be direct utilization of the whole of cytidine, ribose and all, in the biosynthesis
of deoxycytidine. That would be a shock. I learned from Peter Reichard, during
a 2004 meeting in Stockholm, that the export to Sweden of <sup>14</sup>C-compounds
was forbidden by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission at that time, otherwise
they certainly would have done the obvious follow-up experiment, using
uniformly U-<sup>14</sup>C labeled cytidine themselves.</p>
  <p>I made RNA from <i>Euglena gracilis</i> grown on <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>. I had to work out the
determination of the independent specific activities of the sugars and bases
which I did by treating the nucleosides with nucleoside phosphorylase and
hypoxanthine to exchange for the base to be analyzed. Then by paper
chromatography, using a medium containing borate to retard the migration
of ribosides, I could also isolate deoxyinosine and cytosine. Although U-<sup>14</sup>C
cytidine did not label the deoxyribose of <i>E. coli</i> DNA, I found the deoxycytidine
of DNA of rat organs to be almost uniformly labeled. The <sup>14</sup>C content
was far in excess of the negligible radioactivity in the purine deoxynucleotides<sup><a href="#not3">3</a></sup>.
Therefore by both criteria it appeared certain that the <sup>14</sup>C reached the
deoxyribose directly from the cytidine. Reichard repeated and extended this
experiment with U-<sup>14</sup>C uridine in 1957 with much the same result for the
deoxycytidine and thymidine<sup><a href="#not4">4</a></sup>.</p>
  <p>It would have been reasonable for me to try to work out the enzymology of
ribonucleotide reduction after graduating. Peter Reichard at Yale on a post-doc
from Sweden, asked me about my intentions. But I was not anxious to take on
a heroic problem at this early point in my career. I was interested in learning
more about the principals of enzymology.</p>

  <p><i>Stereochemistry at Chicago</i>. Ogston's 1948 paper
    proposing, in effect, that the ability of an enzyme-substrate complex to
    distinguish between identical groups on a tetrahedral carbon was a consequence
    of the asymmetry of the complex<sup><a href="#not5">5</a></sup>, was a matter
    of hot debate in chemistry/biochemistry circles at Chicago in 1950 where
    the enzyme was still a black box and the emphasis was on the chemistry of
    changes in the substrate. In particular the Ogston idea could justify the
    conclusion in the experiments of Myron Bender, done in Chemistry at University
    of Chicago, that the absence of back labeling of an ester in <sup>18</sup>O-water
    during enzymatic hydrolysis could not rule out a tetrahedral intermediate.
    Bender had already shown that back labeling occurred during ester hydolysis
    in alkali<sup><a href="#not6">6</a></sup>. In the case of the enzymatic reaction based on Ogston one would
    expect to lose all the <sup>18</sup>O on stereospecific return of such an intermediate
to the ester. These thoughts morphed into the positional isotope
exchange idea in 1976.</p>

<p class="photo-gallery-caption">1997 at Fox Chase.</p>


  <p>Thus I became challenged to establish the absolute stereochemistry
    of enzymatic reactions and determine its mechanistic significance, if any.
    This did not seem such a formidable task, although it was not until 1963
    that Kenneth Hanson and I solved the historically important problem of the
    prochirality of citric acid<sup><a href="#not7">7</a></sup>, which was necessary
    for me to gain a proper perspective on the aconitate hydratase reaction.</p>
  <p><i>Yale.</i> In 1955, after post-doctorals at Western Reserve University with C. E.
Carter and at New York University with <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/index.html">Severo
Ochoa</a>, I was fortunate to be
invited by Joseph Fruton to become an Instructor in Biochemistry at Yale
University Medical School. The first year at Yale was notable for the following
three developments. Not willing to spend the time it would take to get the
Department's mass spectrometer working, I turned to the scintillation counter
that was available in the medical school lab of Seymour Lipsky, an M.D. with
a passion for exploring and exploiting new methods. One of the pioneer
instruments to become available came from a small start-up company in
New Haven that Lipsky had been encouraging, the Technical Instrument
Company. Lipsky also had a sample of tritiated water which together with his
counter got me started on experiments I wanted to do.</p>

<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i> Figure 1.</i> Fructose-6-P formation from glucose-6-P
        in H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O, as measured colorimetrically by the Roe test for ketoses.</p>

 
  <p>A second important event of my first year at Yale was to learn from Mel
Simpson of his paper showing an apparent ATP requirement for protein
breakdown in a liver slice system. This observation required further study
which I attempted on the side for the next twenty years.</p>
  <p>But the crowning event of 1954-1955 was my proposal of marriage to Zelda
Budenstein, a graduate student in the Department. Fortunately, I caught up
with her before she graduated. Her mother, widowed since Zelda was age five,
came to live with us. She was much loved and a great help with the four children
that were in our onrushing future. She enabled Zelda to have a research
career, often paralleling mine, which she continued until 1987 when she retired
to devote full time to her peace and social interests.</p>
  <p><i>Aldose-ketose isomerases.</i> Probably the most interesting
    experiment of my nine years at Yale, l954-1963, was interesting from the
    way it developed and the confidence it gave me that I might be able to do
    research after all. I had been looking for evidence of proton transfer in
    enzymes that catalyzed aldose-ketose interconversions. We had been mistakenly
    unsuccessful in not finding the small amount of transfer that was later detected
    in the triose P isomerase reaction. Y.J. Topper had reported that glucose
    6-P isomerase in D<sub>2</sub>O formed
glucose-6-P (G6P) containing about one deuterium using crystallization of
the barium salt as a G6P trap<sup><a href="#not8">8</a></sup> suggesting that
there might be no proton transfer between reactants of this enzyme. The importance
of showing some transfer would be that it would provide a clue to the catalytic
process. Complete transfer would suggest a hydride transfer. Complete exchange
would suggest a carbanion intermediate but would not implicate the enzyme as
the base. However, the occurrence of both transfer and exchange would result
if the abstracted proton were to exchange to some extent before a second proton
transfer. Such a result would imply a single base mechanism. No such result had
yet been reported. In unrelated experiments I observed a puzzling phenomenon
with G6P isomerase. When G6P was used with isomerase in D<sub>2</sub>O the colorimetric
analysis for fructose-6-P passed through a maximum before reaching a final value.
This overshoot of equilibrium that occurred only in D<sub>2</sub>O, Figure 1,
was very puzzling.</p>

  <img src="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2004/rose_bio_4.gif" alt="Formula.">
<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i>Figure 2.</i> Demonstration of tritium transfer in F-6-P->G-6-P.</p>
 
  <p>Professor Julian Sturtevant of the Chemistry Department
    sagely asked me if I was sure of my assumptions. I soon figured out that
    Topper's experiment
might have been misleading. Perhaps his barium trap of G6P was not good
enough. If there were both transfer and exchange in D<sub>2</sub>O then as the product
returns to the enzyme there would be another opportunity for exchange until
the product becomes fully exchanged. The fructose-P would go from a partly
H- form initially, to an all D-form in the exchanged position at C-1. Now the
only thing necessary for my strange result to make sense was to find an isotope
effect in the color reaction for ketoses in acid. This was shown by finding the
equal amounts of fructose-6-P at 20 hrs when assayed by a different method<sup><a href="#not9">9</a></sup>.</p>

  <img src="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2004/rose_bio_5.gif" alt="Table.">
<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i>Table 1.</i> Stereochemical course of 2R and 2S isomerase.</p>

  <p>We could show transfer using 1-T fructose-6-P with the
    isomerase using Ba to form the crystalline salt of G6P as it formed in the
    presence in a small amount of seed crystals, Figure 2. The 6Pgluconate made
    from the G6P was only labeled at C-2, the site to which transfer had occurred.
    We also showed that transfer was between carbons of the same molecule and
    that the extent of transfer was greatest at low temperature, indicating that
    the greatest effect of heat was on the dissociation of the intermediate E-T.
    The proposed intermediate, EH.enediol-P was found to partition about equally
    in the forward and back direction as shown by the equal incorporation of
    T-water into product and substrate at early times. A low specific activity
    of the product was consistent with the slow exchange of the intermediate
    which would also be expected to show some discrimination against T of the
    solvent. Since only one T entered the C-1 position of the fructose-6P at
    equilibrium in tritiated water the abstraction and exchange with solvent
    were stereospecific. The absolute stereochemistry of 1-<sup>2</sup>H-fructose-6P
    was rigorously established by neutron diffraction crystallography as suggested
    by Lindo Patterson of Fox Chase using the <sup>6</sup>Li salt of monodeuteroglycolate<sup><a href="#not10">10</a></sup>.
    This was the first example of the use of neutron diffraction to establish
    the absolute configuration of a molecule made asymmetric by isotopic substitution.</p>
  <p><i>All isomerases use cis-enediols intermediates.</i> As
    shown in Table 1, isomerases that are specific for 2R-aldoses were found
    to activate the 1-R proton of the ketose produced. Isomerases specific for
    2S-aldoses produce ketoses that exchange their 1S proton<sup><a href="#not11">11</a></sup>.
    For these proton transfers to have been intramolecular, they would both have
    come from the same face of the enediol intermediates. This implies a cis-enediol
    intermediate. cis-enediol intermediates have the advantage of requiring only
    a single electrophile to polarize the carbonyl of either substrate. The requirement
    for one base and one electrophile may be a major factor in preserving the
    cis-enediol mechanism in evolution.</p>

  <p><i>A relation between the cis-enediol mechanism and the
      anomeric specificity of isomerases. </i>The open chain forms of sugars are minor species in aqueous equilibria.
Therefore a ring opening step will be the first step catalyzed by isomerases for
any pentose or hexose substrate. Since ring closing is the reverse of ring opening,
we wondered if enzymes with a cis-enediol intermediate would be defined
in the ring closing step. Ring closing should occur from the face opposite that
used by the proton donor. For example, if the proton approaches C-3 from
above the plane, the C2-C3 bond will become oriented below the plane and
the C5OH must approach the C-1 carbonyl that is being generated to form
the cyclic product from below, see figure 3<sup><a href="#not11">11-13</a></sup>.</p>
  <p>The anomeric specificities of 5 isomerases were determined
    in the course of our studies on the isomerases that continued until 1973.
    The results were as predicted, see Table 2. Thus <font face="Symbol">a</font>-xylose
    were the substrates for the 2R-aldose enzymes in their production of fructose
    6P+NH<sub>3</sub> and xylulose,
    respectively, and <font face="Symbol">b</font>-L-arabinose and B-D-mannose-6-P
    were the specific substrate for the 2S-aldose isomerase.</p>

<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i>Table 2.</i> Anomeric specificties.</p>

 
  <p>The specificity of glucose-6-P isomerase is unusual.
    Consistent with the above considerations <font face="Symbol">a</font>-G6P
    and <font face="Symbol">a</font>-F6P are the favored
    substrates. However, isomerization of <font face="Symbol">b</font>-G6P occurs at a significant rate.
    It has been proposed that the open chain aldose while on the enzyme undergoes
    torsional inversion at the C2-C3 bond before ring closing. This kind of motion,
    if it were to occur in the ene-diol of G6P could add the C-2 proton to the
    flip face and produce mannose-6-P. Seeholzer has reported the activation
    of the C-2 proton of mannose-6-P by G6P isomerase<sup><a href="#not14">14</a></sup>.</p>
  <p><i>A nomenclature for ring face designation</i><sup><a href="#not15">15</a></sup>.
    In looking for a way to designate the ring face of a simple ring compound
    such as G6P or of the two rings of a nucleoside, or of fused ring compounds
    such as sterols, we realized that a universal method could be devised using
    the established rules for numbering the atoms of rings as contained in standard
    chemical handbooks<sup><a href="#not15">15</a></sup>. A face is considered
    <font face="Symbol">a</font> if the numbered ring atoms are seen to increase
    in a clockwise direction, otherwise this face is designated the <font face="Symbol">b</font>-face.
    The method is not subject to changes in ring substituents as is the D/L naming
    of sugars. One can readily communicate structural information without resorting
    to pictures by this method. For example, noting that in <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Watson-Crick</a> base
    pairing the paired bases have the same face-orientation in forming the antiparallel
    double helix tells us much of what we need to know to build the correct structure.</p>
  <p><i>Fox Chase.</i> In l963, we moved to The Institute
    for Cancer Research of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. The Institute
    was a unique place, in my experience. Since its founding it was governed
    by the notion that to understand cancer one needed a broader understanding
    of biological science. In its first expansion from center city in 1949, its
    faculty included crystallographers, embryologists, chemists, biochemists
    and medical biologists without departmental restrictions. I was attracted
    by the chance to learn from a wide range of researchers attending each other's
    seminars as well as the freedom from teaching. Research support came from
    our own competitive grants but the Institute had a generous history of tiding
    you over. We were not required to go after our own salaries which came from
    an NIH core grant, the first of its kind, which also supported institutional
    facilities. Decisions were made by the Director, Timothy R. Talbot, M.D.
    with the advice of a group of the staff and eminent outsiders. Zelda had
    a lab and grant of her own. She quit science to be more active in the Nuclear
    Freeze and other peace efforts in 1987. In 1977 when Avram Hershko requested
    to share our lab space and facilities, he and his group were welcomed for
    the 22 years he was with us, either on sabbatical or during summers.</p>
  <p><i>Whole cell systems.</i> In the next few years I started
    a series of investigations using isotopes to examine problems of metabolism.
    It had been observed by Harland Wood's group at Western Reserve that when <sup>14</sup>C-lactate
    or <sup>14</sup>C-glycerol
are fed to a fasted animal the labeling of the glucose units of liver glycogen
was such as to suggest that triose-P isomerase had failed to equilibrate its
    two triose phosphate substrates during synthesis, or that the condensation
    reaction of FDP aldolase did not give equal labeling of the two halves of
    FDP. We had earlier investigated this latter, using isotope exchange at equilibrium
    (possibly for the first time) showing that the C456 of FDP exchanged more
    rapidly than C123<sup><a href="#not16">16</a></sup>.</p>
  <p>Asymmetric labeling due to incomplete equilibration at the triose-P
isomerase step seemed unlikely given the enzyme's high efficiency. This question
was settled by showing, with Wood's group, that the asymmetry obtained with
<sup>14</sup>C-labeled glycerol in which a deuterium was present in the position
abstracted in the isomerase reaction was greater in the direction predicted by
incomplete equilibration of that enzyme<sup><a href="#not17">17</a></sup>, an expression of the primary
isotope effect of the isomerase reaction that we had shown previously.</p>
  <p>Yale graduate student Bob Kemp determined the fates of reduced pyridine
nucleotides, NAPDH and NADH in Leuconostoc mesenteroides fermentation and
growth using 1-T glucose, 1-T 2 deoxy-glucose and 3-T glucose. Preferential use
of 1-T for ethanol production and 3-T for lactate production indicated
partial separation of dehydrogenase products<sup><a href="#not18">18</a></sup>. NADH derived from glucose
6P dehydrogenase which also oxidizes 2 deoxyglucose-6-P was the primary
source of reducing equivalents for lipid brosynthesis.</p>
  <p><i>Control of glycolysis.</i> In the following years
    we reported studies on the regulation of glucose degradation in human red
    blood cells. Glucose transport is rapid so that the first irreversible step,
    hexokinase, must determine the rate of net flux. <sup>14</sup>C-glucose utilization
    was shown to be inversely related to the G6P level over a 40 fold range using
    methylene blue and inosine to vary the steady state G6P, even as many other
    metabolites varied greatly without showing effects on this linearity<sup><a href="#not19">19</a></sup>. Thus
    any condition that affects the rate of glucose utilization of red cells must
    do so by either having an effect on G6P or on the activity of the hexokinase
    itself. A remarkable effect of Pi in stimulating red cell glycolysis was
    traced to its interference with the binding of G6P to the enzyme without
    itself having an effect on the hexokinase rate<sup><a href="#not20">20</a></sup>.</p>
  <p>Using measurements of isotope exchange rates we were led to conclude
that the accumulation of triose-P intermediates in human red cells that were
incubated with high levels of orthophoshate was due to equilibrium and not
a rate limiting step. The low levels of NAD and pyruvate caused by net synthesis
of 2, 3-bisPglycerate shifted the equilibrium of the glycolytic intermediates
toward high triose-Ps<sup><a href="#not21">21</a></sup>.</p>
  <p><i>Glucose-1, 6-P<sub>2</sub> of the brain.</i> Lowry <i>et
      al.</i> reported the rapid depletion of the
normally significant amount of G16P<sub>2</sub> during mouse brain ischemia.
We have been particularly interested in the role this compound might play in
brain function. We purified an enzyme that used G1P with glycerate-1,3-P<sub>2</sub>,
as the phosphate donor, not ATP or FDP<sup><a href="#not22">22, 23</a></sup>.
Mg was a required confactor but Zn was equally active and much more tightly held.
About 65% of the activity of a fresh brain extract resistant to EDTA is probably
the enzyme in the Zn-form. The synthetase is strongly inhibited by concentrations
of citrate and FDP that are found in the brain suggesting a regulatory role of
G16P<sub>2</sub>,
and that its synthetic rate may be different in different regions of the brain
just as its distribution was shown to be localized<a href="#not24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>Zelda discovered a brain-specific G16P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase with an absolute
requirement for inosine-5-P<a href="#not25"><sup>25</sup></a>. Since IMP is the major product of ATP breakdown
in the ischemic brain this strongly points to activation of the phosphatase
as the cause of the rapid fall in G-1,6-P<sub>2</sub> in ischemia.</p>
  <p><i>Mitochondrial hexokinase.</i> A problem that warrants further study derives
from our observation in 1967 that instead of being in the cytosol most of the
hexokinase of tumor and animal cells is associated with the outer membrane
of the mitochondrial fraction<a href="#not26"><sup>26</sup></a>. It has recently been reported that the release
of mitochondrial hexokinase and some associated proteins may play a role in
the onset of the apoptosis cascade<a href="#not27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>
  <p><i>The mechanism of synthetases.</i> When I felt that
    we understood control of the red cell glycolytic system my attention returned
    to mechanism questions: ATP driven synthetases, reactions such as glutamine
    synthetase (gluamate + NH<sub>3 </sub>+ ATP &ndash;> glutamine + ADP + Pi)
    may be written to go in three steps: ATP + E ->
ADP + E~P, E~P + glutamate &ndash;> E. glutamyl~P, E. glutamyl~P + NH<sub>3</sub> &ndash;> -glutamine
+ Pi<a href="#not28"><sup>28</sup></a>. However, no ADP/ATP isotope exchange
could be found unless all of the reaction components were present. On the other
hand, Meister had performed a pulse/chase experiment that seemed to suggest the
formation of an activated intermediate. The enzyme, pulsed with ATP and <sup>14</sup>C-glutamate,
was chased with unlabeled glutamate plus hydroxylamine. <sup>14</sup>C-glutamyl-hydroxamate
was found in the chase. However, one could argue that a non-covalent complex
of E.ATP.glutamate may not have lost the labeled glutamate more rapidly than
the chemical reaction would have occurred when the NH<sub>2</sub>OH entered the
complex. A similar assumption was made by Jacob bar Tana, who I met at the Hadassah
Medical School in Jerusalem on our sabbatical in 1972. He was having trouble
with irreproducible results with phosphofructokinase testing for an E~P mechanism
by preincubating the enzyme with ATP<a href="#not32"><sup>32</sup></a> and chasing
it with a mixture of F-6-P and unlabeled ATP. I suggested that he might be capturing
E.ATP rather than E~P.ADP. We agreed to examine the assumption that dissociation
of a binary complex must be faster than chemistry on bar Tana's next visit to
the U.S. We used yeast hexokinase with <sup>14</sup>C-glucose (the pulse) followed
by ATP plus a large excess of unlabeled glucose (the chase). Labeled G6P was
indeed found in Michaeli's proportion to the ATP in the chase up to the full
measure of enzyme occupied by glucose in the pulse<a href="#not29"><sup>29</sup></a>.
Dissociation of glucose was indeed slower than its phosphorylation contrary to
the generalization that chemistry is slow. Thus was demonstrated the first pulse/chase
experiment from which could be determined the functionality of binary complexes,
their rate of dissociation and the extent of dissociation of glucose from the
ternary complex.</p>
  <p><i>Pulse/chase variants.</i> Subsequently, our lab used
    the pulse/chase method to study hexokinase in the steady state by comparing
    the <sup>14</sup>C-G6P formed in an
acid quench with that formed in a high substrate chase with time of quenching,
a procedure that gave the position of the central equilibrium, ~1, and the
rate constants for all interconversions<a href="#not30"><sup>30</sup></a>. We
did pulse/chase experiments in which the labeled glucose came from hexokinase
in the crystalline state either alone or together with ADP<a href="#not31"><sup>31</sup></a>.
Although the crystals dissolve slowly the results suggest that their form at
that time reflects the form in the crystal. Crystals with glucose alone required
the same amount of ATP for 50% trapping as did E.glucose in solution. On the
other hand E.glucose.ADP grown crystals from which the ADP had been removed by
washing required much less ATP. We also used standard pulse/chase to find that
4 atoms of tritium, with the specific activity of water in the pulse have positions
on the enzyme aconitate hydratase, probably an arginine-threonine pair in the
active site that could be trapped by the cis-aconitate in the conversion to citrate<a href="#not32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>
  <p><i>Positional isotope exchange (PIX).</i> Although traditional
    ATP/ADP exchange as a test of E~PO<sub>3</sub> or E-glutamyl~PO<sub>3</sub> intermediates
    in the glutamine synthetase reaction would fail if the ADP did not leave
    the enzyme a different kind of isotope exchange might be observed, one in
    which the beta-gamma bridge oxygen and the beta-nonbridge oxygens of reisolated
    ATP had mixed with each other. This would only require the phosphoryl oxygens
    of the bound ADP intermediate be capable of undergoing positional isotope
    exchange, depending on a symmetrical torsional motion before returning to
    ATP. This new exchange process was observed in a cleverly designed experiment
    done by post doc, Fred Midelfort<a href="#not33"><sup>33</sup></a>. The PIX
    rate in the presence of glutamate was consistent with the reverse rate of
    the enzyme. The exchange rate was decreased by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> consistent with a decrease
    in the concentration of E.glut~P.ADP complex.</p>
  <p><i>Recycling.</i> More recently, we have become interested
    in how an enzyme recovers after product formation. Changes in the active
    site of an enzyme that occur when a substrate is converted to product must
    be reversed before the reaction can occur again. With rare exception, this
    recycling of the active site occurs before the product has left the enzyme
    and is therefore counted as part of the product-off step. Are recycling steps
    ordered or random? Does the sequence replicate the order of steps during
    the reaction itself? Fumarase has several properties that mark it as a rare
    example in which, when salt is present to accelerate the release of a product,
    a further sequence of steps remains that is rate limiting for the whole reaction
    cycle. Distinctive enzyme isoforms become identifiable as shown by the occurrence
    of noncompetitive inhibition by product analogues<a href="#not34"><sup>34,
    35</sup></a>. Added labeled reaction product rebounds to substrate
when unlabeled substrate is added showing that the product form of the enzyme
is slow to recycle, the Britton counterflow effect<a href="#not36"><sup>36, 37</sup></a>.
D<sub>2</sub>O and glycerol show
uncompetitive inhibition patterns indicating that their effects occur after an
irreversible step, product release. Noncompetitive inhibition is rarely seen
in enzymes that catalyze reactions requiring only one substrate. When it is seen,
it is an indication of slow recycling.</p>
  <p>The chemical interconversion of fumarase reaction, a
    carbanion mechanism, is the most rapid part of the reaction cycle. Thus at
    equilibrium, <sup>18</sup>O-water
exchanges into malate more rapidly than does fumarate. Perhaps the details
of the reaction chemistry can be determined from the details of the recycling.
That this seems to be the case is indicated by the pattern of inhibition. The
carbanion intermediate analog, 2-hydroxy, 3-nitropropionate is competitive
with respect to both malate and fumarate and therefore represents the intermediate
species in the recycling whereas all other inhibitors are competitive
with only one or the other of the substrates and therefore represent product
species.</p>
  <p>The ability of salt to increase the rate of product release is lost when the
basic amino acid residues that reside between the active site and the solvent
are mutated to neutral forms<a href="#not38"><sup>38</sup></a>. The mutated enzyme is now rate limited by
the product-off step, not recycling. We speculated that the negatively charged
products are released through a positively charged channel that is made
more rapid by salt.</p>
  <p><i>Enol-pyruvate.</i> Heavy atom NMR spectroscopy of the hydrogens of P-enolpyruvate
led to Mildred Cohn's solution of the reaction stereochemistry of
the reaction of enolase using (3R)-phosphoglyceric acid-3-d<a href="#not39"><sup>39</sup></a>. This led us to
the solution of many reaction stereochemistries with enzymes using specifically
labeled 3D, T-PEP<a href="#not40"><sup>40</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>Our longstanding belief that enolpyruvate is the intermediate in the pyruvate
kinase reaction was confirmed by direct chemical analysis of pyruvate kinase
in the steady state<a href="#not41"><sup>41</sup></a>. We could also show that enolpyruvate synthesized by
treating PEP with a phosphatase was used by pyruvate kinase at an appropriate
rate although its affinity was less than expected for an intermediate<a href="#not42"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>
  <p><i>Other problems.</i> In a surprise result, the Schiffs bases of dihydroxyacetone-P and
of FDP were found to precipitate with the protein of muscle aldolase in cold
acid<a href="#not43"><sup>43</sup></a>. This property due to the stability of the Schiffs base intermediates in
acid and the acid lability of the eneamin-Ps were used to determine their concentrations
as intermediates in the aldolase reaction<a href="#not44"><sup>44</sup></a>. Ring formation of the
adducts was indicated. Thus 5-deoxyFDP formed a much less stable acid precipitate
than did FDP.</p>

  <p>The interconversion of citrate and isocitrate by aconitate hydratase was
shown to occur with complete retention of the proton transferred between C<sub>2</sub>and C<sub>3</sub> but with 
no retention of the OH- between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. The bound
cis-aconitate intermediate must flip over, probably around a CH<sub>2</sub>COO- pivoting
on the ferrous iron of the active site so that the enzyme bound proton can
approach from the opposite faces of the intermediate in generating either of
the products<a href="#not45"><sup>45</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>Aconitate isomerase catalyzes the interconversion of cis- and trans-aconitate
by a 1, 3 allylic rearrangement that uses the (pro-S) hydrogens of the two
substrates. The stereochemistry and the transfer of tritium are consistent with
a single base carbanion mechanism<a href="#not46"><sup>46</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>The physical separation of H- from D-labeled molecules made possible by
their different rates of reaction was used to establish that the transfer of
hydrogen in G6P isomerase was intramolecular<sup><a href="#not9">9</a></sup> and that the site of attachment
of CO<sub>2</sub> to ribulose-1, 5-P<sub>2</sub> to produce two molecules of phosphoglyceric
acid had to be to C-2 rather than C-4 in the RUDP carboxylase reaction<a href="#not47"><sup>47</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In this chapter I have mentioned most of the problems
    that have engaged me and my coworkers until the time of my retirement in
    1997 with the exception of ubiquitin related studies that are summarized
    in the next chapter,
&quot;Ubiquitin at Fox Chase&quot;. Following my retirement, Zelda and I moved
to Laguna Woods in Southern California where I was able to continue lab work
using space and facilities shared by Ralph Bradshaw at nearby U.C. Irvine.</p>
  <p>During this period Dr. James Nowick of Chemistry and I examined the
mechanism of methylglyoxal synthetase (dihydroxyacetone-P -> methylglyoxal)
trying to understand our observation<sup>48</sup> that the methyl group of the
product was formed nonstereospecifically. We could show spectroscopically
that the enol-aldehyde of methylglyoxal was really the enzyme's product<a href="#not49"><sup>49</sup></a>.
Ketonization occurs off the enzyme and therefore is nonstereospecific.
Ketonization to methylglyoxal is very slow but is assisted by thiols which
interrupt the double bond conjugation by formation of a thiolhemiacetal. It
was perhaps for this reason that the next enzyme, of the sequence, glyoxalase
I, has the adduct of methylglyoxal with glutathione as its substrate and D-lactyl
- glutathione as its product.</p>
  <p>We concluded our paper with the observation that organisms that had no
glutathione would have to evolve another mechanism to dispose of methyglyoxal
which is toxic to cells due to its action in cross linking macromolecules.
Our most recent study shows that the mycobacteria that have mycothiol,
(N-acetyl cysteine-glucosamine-inositol), as its major reducing compound have
indeed evolved an enzyme that carries out the same kind of sequence with a
&quot;glyoxalase&quot; that produces lactyl-mycothiol (unpublished). This is therefore a
second example in which an enzyme uses the non-enzymatic product of a
previous step as its substrate.</p>
  <p>Looking back on my 50 year eclectic journey in research,
    I am grateful that it has gone as well as it has, although still not clever
    enough to open the black box of enzyme structure. The approach I have taken
    was successful, in the least, in attracting outstanding postdocs, some of
    whom were on hand in 1975-1980
when with Avram Hershko, we pursued the ubiquitin/protein breakdown work.</p>
