  <h1>Hans G. Dehmelt - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dehmelt.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Georg, had studied law at
  the Universit&auml;t Berlin for some years, and in the first
  World War had been an artillery officer. He was of a
  philosophical bend of mind and a man of independent opinions. In
  the depth of the depression he just managed to make a living in
  real estate. When the family fortunes had shrunk to ownership of
  a heavily mortgaged apartment building located in an
  overwhelmingly Communist part of Berlin, it seemed reasonable to
  move into one of the apartments ourselves as nobody paid any
  rent. Cannons were deployed on the streets on occasion and the
  class war had entered the class rooms. After a few bloody noses
  administered by a burly repeater, I shifted my interests from
  roaming the streets more towards playing with rudimentary radio
  receivers and noisy and smelly experiments in my mother's
  kitchen. In the spring of 1933 my mother, a very energetic lady,
  saw to it that, at the age of ten, I entered the Gymnasium zum
  Grauen Kloster, the oldest Latin school in Berlin, which counted
  Bismarck amongst its Alumni. This involved a stiff entrance
  examination and I was admitted on a scholarship. My father at
  that time expressed the opinion that I probably would be happier
  as a plumber. However, he apparently didn't quite believe this
  himself. Thus, in years before, he had bought me an erector set
  and books on the lives of famous inventors and Greek mythology,
  and when I was ill he had given me the encyclopedia to read. I
  supplemented the school curriculum with do-it-yourself radio
  projects until I had hardly any time left for my class work. Only
  tutoring from my father rescued me from disaster. Reading popular
  radio books deepened my interest in physics. While physics was
  taught at the Kloster only in the later grades, in the public
  library I read books with titles such as "Umsturz im Weltbild der
  Physik" and learned about the Balmer series and Bohr's energy
  levels of the hydrogen atom. My teachers at the Kloster were
  excellent, I remember in particular Dr. Richter, who taught Latin
  and Greek, and Dr. Splettstoesser, who taught biology and
  physics. Richter liked to expand on the classical works, which we
  were reading in class. I spent most of the ample breaks in
  related intense discussions with a group of classmates, Heppke,
  Hubner, Landau and Leiser while others engaged in boxing matches.
  Splettstoesser was a working scientist who spent Summers as a
  visitor with a marine biology institute on the Adriatic. I jumped
  a term and graduated in the spring of 1940.<br>
  <br>
  Having received a notice from the draft board, I found it wise to
  volunteer for the anti-aircraft artillery and a motorized unit. I
  was not able to serve as a radio man but was assigned to a gun
  crew and never rose above the rank of senior private. Sent to
  relieve the German armies at Stalingrad, my battery was extremely
  lucky to escape the encirclement. A few months later I was even
  more lucky to be ordered back to Germany to study physics under
  an army program at the Universit&auml;t Breslau in 1943. After
  one year of study, I was sent to the Western Front and captured
  in the Battle of the Bulge. I spent a year in an American
  prisoner of war camp in France and was released early in 1946.
  Supporting myself with the repair and barter of prewar radios, I
  took up my study of physics again at the Universit&auml;t
  G&ouml;ttingen. Here I attended lectures by Pohl, Richard Becker,
  Hans Kopfermann and Werner Heisenberg; Max v. Laue and Max Planck
  attended the physics colloquia. At the funeral of Planck I was
  chosen to be one of the pall bearers. At the university, I
  greatly enjoyed repeating the Frank-Hertz experiment, the
  Millikan oil drop, Zeemann effect, Hull's magnetron, Langmuir's
  plasma tube and other classic modern physics experiments in an
  excellent laboratory class run by Wolfgang Paul. In one of his
  Electricity &amp; Magnetism classes Becker drew a dot on the
  blackboard and declared "Here is an electron..." Having heard in
  another class that the wave function of an electron at rest
  spreads out over all of space, and having read about ion trapping
  in radio tubes in my teens set me to wonder how one might realize
  Becker's localization feat in the laboratory. However, that had
  to wait a while. In 1948, in Kopfermann's Institute, which was
  heavily oriented towards hyperfine structure studies, I completed
  an experimental Diplom-Arbeit (master's thesis) on a Thomson mass
  spectrograph under Peter Brix. The results were published in "Die
  photographischen Wirkungen mittelschneller Protonen II," the
  first paper of which I was a (co)author. Soon thereafter, I began
  work on my doctoral thesis under Hubert Kruger in the same
  Institute. Well prepared by a series of excellent Institute
  seminars on the NMR work of Bloch and of Purcell, we were able to
  successfully compete with workers at Harvard University. In 1949
  we discovered Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance and reported it in our
  paper "Kernquadrupolfrequenzen in festem Dichloraethylen." My
  doctoral thesis had the title "Kernquadrupolfrequenzen in
  kristallinen Jodverbindungen." This work led to an invitation to
  join Walter Gordy's well known microwave laboratory at Duke
  University as postdoctoral associate.<br>
  <br>
  At Duke I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of James
  Frank, Fritz London, Lothar Nordheim and Hertha Sponer. I advised
  Hugh Robinson, a graduate student of Gordy's in an NQR
  experiment, did my own research and also contributed some NMR
  expertise to an experiment by Bill Fairbank and Gordy on spin
  statistics in <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He mixtures, gaining
  some very useful low temperature experience in this brief
  collaboration. Through Gordy's and Nordheim's good offices I was
  able to receive a visiting assistant professor appointment at the
  University of Washington with a charge to advise Edwin Uehling's
  students during his sabbatical and to do independent research. I
  had built my first electron impact tube during a brief interlude
  in 1955 in George Volkoffs laboratory at the University of
  British Columbia. Prior to that I had attempted a paramagnetic
  resonance experiment on free atoms in Gottingen and succeeded in
  doing so at Duke. During seminars at G&ouml;ttingen on the
  magnetic resonance techniques of Rabi and of Kastler, it had
  occurred to me that because of the analogy between an atom and a
  radio dipole antenna, (a), a<i>lignment</i> of the atom should
  show up in its optical absorption cross section, and (b),
  electron impact should produce <i>aligned</i> excited atoms. I
  put these two ideas to good use in 1956 in Seattle in an
  experiment entitled "Paramagnetic Resonance Reorientation of
  Atoms and Ions Aligned by Electron Impact." In this paper I first
  pointed out the usefulness of <i>ion trapping for high resolution
  spectroscopy</i> and mentioned the 1923 Kingdon trap as a
  suitable device. This work also brought me into close contact
  with spin exchange between electron and target atom, which gave
  me the idea for my 1958 experiment "Spin Resonance of Free
  Electrons Polarized by Exchange Collisions." However, first I had
  to learn how to produce polarized atoms, which could then
  transfer their orientation to trapped electrons. Falling back on
  buffer gas techniques developed in my 1955 Duke paper "Atomic
  Phosphorus Paramagnetic Resonance Experiment," I quickly
  demonstrated in my 1956 Seattle paper "Slow Spin Relaxation of
  Optically Polarized Sodium Atoms" how to efficiently produce and
  monitor a polarized atom cloud. Trapping the electrons in a
  neutralizing ion cloud slowly diffusing in the buffer gas, I was
  able to carry out the spin resonance experiment. My optical
  transmission monitoring scheme proved also very useful in the
  development of rubidium vapor magnetometers and frequency
  standards by Earl Bell and Arnold Bloom at Varian Associates, in
  which I acted as a consultant. The rubidium frequency standard is
  still the least expensive, smallest and most widely used
  commercial atomic frequency standard. The thesis "Experimental
  Upper Limit for the Permanent Electric Dipole Moment of
  Rb<sup>85</sup> by Optical Pumping Techniques" of my first
  graduate student, Earl Ensberg, also made use of these novel
  optical pumping schemes and was finished in 1962. These early
  results were improved orders of magnitude by my doctoral student
  Philip Ekstrom in his 1971 thesis "Search for Differential Linear
  Stark Shift in Cs<sup>133</sup> and Rb<sup>85</sup> Using Atomic
  Light Modulation Oscillators."<br>
  <br>
  I was not satisfied with the plasma trapping scheme used for the
  electrons and asked my student, Keith Jefferts, to study ion
  trapping in an electron beam traversing a field free vacuum space
  between two grids. Also, I began to focus on the
  magnetron/Penning discharge geometry, which, in the Penning ion
  gauge, had caught my interest already at G&ouml;ttingen and at
  Duke. In their 1955 cyclotron resonance work on photoelectrons in
  vacuum Franken and Liebes had reported undesirable frequency
  shifts caused by accidental electron trapping. Their analysis
  made me realize that in a pure electric quadrupole field the
  shift would not depend on the location of the electron in the
  trap. This is an important advantage over many other traps that I
  decided to exploit. A magnetron trap of this type had been
  briefly discussed in J.R. Pierce's 1949 book, and I developed a
  simple description of the axial, magnetron, and cyclotron motions
  of an electron in it. With the help of the expert glassblower of
  the Department, Jake Jonson, I built my first high vacuum
  magnetron trap in 1959 and was soon able to trap electrons for
  about 10 sec and to detect axial, magnetron and cyclotron
  resonances. About the same time, my G&ouml;ttinger colleague,
  Otto Osberghaus, sent me a research report on the Paul rf ion
  cage. This trap had very desirable properties for atomic ions and
  it did not require a magnetic field. Therefore, I asked my
  student, Fouad Major, to experiment with a simplified cylindrical
  version of such a trap in the hope that it might be useful in hfs
  resonance experiments on hydrogenic helium ions. The early
  results were very encouraging and Jefferts also switched to the
  Paul trap. In 1962, Jefferts and Major both finished their
  Doctoral Theses entitled respectively "Alignment of Trapped
  H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> Molecular Ions by Selective
  Photodissociation" and "The Orientation of Electrodynamically
  Contained He<sup>4</sup> Ions." As a continuation of the latter,
  a new postdoc, Norval Fortson, Major and I published the 1966
  paper "Ultrahigh Resolution <font face="Symbol">D</font>F=0
  &plusmn; 1<sup>3</sup>He<sup>+</sup> HFS Spectra by an Ion
  Storage-Exchange Collision Technique." My own attempts to detect
  the polarization of the electrons acquired from a polarized beam
  of alkali atoms in my Penning (magnetron) trap, described in a
  1961 research report to the NSF "Spin Resonance of Free
  Electrons," were not so quickly successful. However in this work
  I was much impressed by seeing the beam of sodium atoms
  traversing my glass apparatus in the reflected light from a
  sodium vapor street lamp adapted as illuminating light source.
  Only a later concerted effort by Gr&auml;ff and Werth at Bonn,
  reinforced by Major and Fortson, as visitors, made a similar spin
  resonance experiment work in 1968.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1966 paper with Fortson and Major, I also proposed to
  develop an infrared laser based on ions in an rf trap. To this
  end my student, David Church, completed a thesis in 1969 entitled
  "Storage and Radiative Cooling of Light Ion Gases in RF
  Quadrupole Traps." In this work we demonstrated a
  race-track-shaped trap and cooled the ions by coupling to a
  resonant LC circuit. In parallel work my student, Stephan
  Menasian, in 1968, with some help from G.R. Huggett, succeded in
  cooling Hg<sup>+</sup> ions in a race-track-trap with a helium
  buffer gas and in detecting them by optical absorption. Jefferts'
  research on hfs spectra of H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> was
  continued in Seattle by my postdoc Charles Richardson and later
  by Menasian in his 1973 doctoral thesis "High Resolution Study of
  the (1, 1/2, 1/2) - (1, 1/2,3/2) HFS Transition in
  H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>." The resolution in the
  <sup>3</sup>He<sup>+</sup> hfs work was greatly enhanced in work
  with my colleague Fortson and my postdoc Hans Schuessler.
  Realizing in 1961 that precision measurements of the electron
  magnetic moment would require a large magnetic field and that
  Becker's electron localization feat might be approximated in a
  Penning trap, I began to consider other avenues for magnetic
  resonance experiments. Some success in the electron work,
  achieved with the help of my new student, Fred Walls, was
  described in our 1968 paper "'Bolometric' Technique for the RF
  Spectroscopy of Stored Ions." I reviewed the work on ions and
  electrons up to 1968 in two articles "Radiofrequency Spectroscopy
  of Stored Ions."<br>
  <br>
  The able assistance of two postdocs, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/">David Wineland</a> and my former
  student Phil Ekstrom, made the isolation of a single electron
  become a reality in 1973 with our paper "Monoelectron
  Oscillator." Measuring its magnetic moment was another story. At
  G&ouml;ttingen in the late forties I had attended a seminar given
  by Helmut Friedburg, a doctoral Student of Wolfgang Paul, on
  focussing spins with a magnetic hexapole. This may be viewed as a
  refinement of the Stern-Gerlach effect. In subsequent discussions
  with fellow students a rumor of a Stern-Gerlach experiment for
  electrons was brought up, and also Bohr's and Pauli's thesis that
  such experiments were impossible in principle. Though it greatly
  piqued my interest, I could not understand this thesis.
  Stimulated by a 1927 paper of Brillouin on the subject, I
  followed another of the guiding principles formulated by Bohr:
  "In my Institute we take nothing absolutely serious, including
  this statement." In 1973 I proposed, together with Ekstrom, to
  monitor spin and cyclotron quantum numbers of the lone electron
  by means of the "continuous Stern-Gerlach effect" in an abstract
  "Proposed g-2/<font face="Symbol">d</font>v<sub>z</sub>
  Experiment on Stored Single Electron or Positron." My new postdoc
  Robert Van Dyck, Philip Ekstrom and myself reported the first
  such experiment in our 1976 paper "Axial, Magnetron, and
  Spin-Cyclotron Beat Frequencies Measured on Single Electron
  Almost at Rest in Free Space (Geonium)." This work also already
  made use of the important technique of side band cooling of the
  electron. The demonstration of sideband cooling had eluded us in
  earlier attempts undertaken together with Walls and later with
  Wineland. Encouraged by the success of the monoelectron
  oscillator I had also published in 1973 an abstract "Proposed
  10<sup>14</sup> <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>v</i> &lt;
  <i>v</i> Laser Fluorescence Spectroscopy on Tl<sup>+</sup>
  Mono-Ion Oscillator." Unfortunately, this proposal infuriated one
  of the agencies funding our research to the degree that they
  terminated their support almost immediately. I was rescued by a
  prize from the Humboldt Foundation and an invitation by Gisbert
  zu Putlitz to initiate the proposed laser spectroscopy project in
  his Institute at the Universit&auml;t Heidelberg. As the fruit of
  these efforts a paper "Localized visible Ba<sup>+</sup> mono-ion
  oscillator" by Neuhauser, Hohenstatt, Toschek and myself appeared
  in 1980.<br>
  <br>
  In 1981 Van Dyck, my doctoral student Paul Schwinberg and myself
  extended the electron work to its antiparticle in our paper
  "Preliminary Comparison of the Positron and Electron Spin
  Anomalies" and I reviewed it in an article "Invariant Frequency
  Ratios in Electron and Positron Geonium Spectra Yield Refined
  Data on Electron Structure." In 1986 we published a detailed
  paper "Electron Magnetic Moment from Geonium Spectra: Early
  Experiments and Background Concepts" and in 1987 our
  collaboration reported a 4 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> resolution in
  the g factor for electron and positron in "New High-Precision
  Comparison of Electron and Positron g Factors." A very promising
  scheme to detect cyclotron excitation through the small
  relativistic mass increase accompanying it was published in a
  1985 paper "Observation of Relativistic Bistable Hysteresis in
  the Cyclotron Motion of a Single Electron" together with my
  postdoc, Gerald Gabrielse, and William Kells, a visitor from
  Fermi Lab.<br>
  <br>
  Two years after the Heidelberg pioneering work an individual
  magnesium ion was isolated in Seattle with my postdoc Warren
  Nagourney and my student Gary Janik. The latter's thesis bore the
  title "Laser Cooled Single Ion Spectroscopy of Magnesium and
  Barium." "Shelved optical electron amplifier: Observation of
  quantum jumps," was published in 1986 with my colleague
  Nagourney, and Jon Sandberg, an exceptional undergraduate
  assistant. The paper introduced a new technique which has made
  optical spectroscopy on an individual ion possible with record
  resolution and reproducibility. To date the best resolution has
  been realized at NIST by a group headed by my former collaborator
  Wineland. Peter Toschek who had made important contributions to
  the visible ion work in Heidelberg has built up a thriving
  laboratory for monoion-spectroscopy at the Universit&auml;t
  Hamburg. With Herbert Walther a collaboration almost came off in
  1974. Walther, with his large staff and excellent facilities in
  Munich, has since developed his own expertise in the field and
  made outstanding contributions to it. Gabrielse, now a full
  professor at Harvard, has assembled a large group and is trapping
  and cooling antiprotons at CERN.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1988 paper "A Single Atomic Particle Forever Floating at
  Rest in Free Space: New Value for Electron Radius" I have
  surveyed the field and suggested new avenues for its extension.
  More precise measurements of the g factor of the electron may
  well be the most promising approach to study its structure. No
  less important, a trapped individual atomic ion may reveal itself
  as a timekeeping element of unsurpassed reproducibility. The
  research effort in Seattle continues on troth projects. The
  National Science Foundation has supported my research since 1958
  without interruption. Initially the Army Office of Ordnance
  Research and the Office of Naval Research did also provide
  support for many years.<br>
