  <h1>Ralph Bunche - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bunche.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ralph
  Johnson Bunche</b> (August 7, 1904-1971) was born in Detroit,
  Michigan. His father, Fred Bunche, was a barber in a shop having
  a clientele of whites only; his mother, Olive (Johnson) Bunche,
  was an amateur musician; his grandmother, &laquo;Nana&raquo;
  Johnson, who lived with the family, had been born into slavery.
  When Bunche was ten years old, the family moved to Albuquerque,
  New Mexico, in the hope that the poor health of his parents would
  improve in the dry climate. Both, however, died two years later.
  His grandmother, an indomitable woman who appeared Caucasian
  &laquo;on the outside&raquo; but was &laquo;all black fervor
  inside&raquo;<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, took Ralph and his
  two sisters to live in Los Angeles. Here Ralph contributed to the
  family's hard pressed finances by selling newspapers, serving as
  house boy for a movie actor, working for a carpet-laying firm,
  and doing what odd jobs he could find.<br>
  <br>
  His intellectual brilliance appeared early. He won a prize in
  history and another in English upon completion of his elementary
  school work and was the valedictorian of his graduating class at
  Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, where he had
  been a debater and all-around athlete who competed in football,
  basketball, baseball, and track. At the University of
  California at Los Angeles he supported himself with an
  athletic scholarship, which paid for his collegiate expenses, and
  with a janitorial job, which paid for his personal expenses. He
  played varsity basketball on championship teams, was active in
  debate and campus journalism, and was graduated in 1927, <i>summa
  cum laude</i>, valedictorian of his class, with a major in
  international relations.<br>
  <br>
  With a scholarship granted by Harvard University and a fund of a thousand
  dollars raised by the black community of Los Angeles, Bunche
  began his graduate studies in political science. He completed his
  master's degree in 1928 and for the next six years alternated
  between teaching at Howard University and working toward the doctorate
  at Harvard. The Rosenwald Fellowship, which he held in 1932-1933,
  enabled him to conduct research in Africa for a dissertation
  comparing French rule in Togoland and Dahomey. He completed his
  dissertation in 1934 with such distinction that he was awarded
  the Toppan Prize for outstanding research in social studies. From
  1936 to 1938, on a Social Science Research Council fellowship, he did
  postdoctoral research in anthropology at Northwestern University,
  the London School
  of Economics, and Capetown University in South Africa.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career, Bunche has maintained strong ties with
  education. He chaired the Department of Political Science at
  Howard University from 1928 until 1950; taught at Harvard
  University from 1950 to 1952; served as a member of the New York
  City Board of Education (1958-1964), as a member of the Board of
  Overseers of Harvard University (1960-1965), as a member of the
  Board of the Institute of International Education, and as a
  trustee of Oberlin College, Lincoln University, and New Lincoln
  School.<br>
  <br>
  Bunche has always been active in the civil rights movement. At
  Howard University he was considered by some as a young radical
  intellectual who criticized both America's social system and the
  established Negro organizations, but generally he is thought of
  as a moderate. From his experience as co-director of the
  Institute of Race Relations at Swarthmore
  College in 1936, added to his firsthand research performed
  earlier, he wrote <i>A World View of Race</i> (1936). He
  participated in the Carnegie Corporation's well-known survey of the
  Negro in America, under the direction of the Swedish sociologist,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/index.html">Gunnar Myrdal</a>,
  which resulted in the publication of Myrdal's <i>An American
  Dilemma</i> (1944). He was a member of the &laquo;Black
  Cabinet&raquo; consulted on minority problems by Roosevelt's administration; declined President Truman's offer of the position of
  assistant secretary of state because of the segregated housing
  conditions in Washington, D. C.; helped to lead the civil rights
  march organized by <a href="../1964/index.html">Martin Luther
  King, Jr.</a>, in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965; supported the
  action programs of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
  People (NAACP) and of the Urban League. Bunche has not himself formed
  organizations, nor has he aspired to positions of administrative
  leadership in existing civil rights organizations. Rather, he has
  exerted his influence personally in speeches and publications,
  especially during the twenty-year period from 1945 to 1965. His
  message has been clear: Racial prejudice is an unreasoned
  phenomenon without scientific basis in biology or anthropology;
  &laquo;segregation and democracy are incompatible&raquo;; blacks
  should maintain the struggle for equal rights while accepting the
  responsibilities that come with freedom; whites must demonstrate
  that &laquo;democracy is color-blind&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Ralph Bunche's enduring fame arises from his service to the U. S.
  government and to the UN. An
  adviser to the Department of State and to the military on Africa
  and colonial areas of strategic military importance during World
  War II, Bunche moved from his first position as an analyst in the
  Office of Strategic Services to the desk of acting chief of the
  Division of Dependent Area Affairs in the State Department. He
  also discharged various responsibilities in connection with
  international conferences of the Institute of Pacific Relations,
  the UN, the <a href="../1969/index.html">International Labor
  Organization</a>, and the Anglo-American Caribbean
  Commission.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie &laquo;borrowed&raquo;
  Bunche from the State Department and placed him in charge of the
  Department of Trusteeship of the UN to handle problems of the
  world's peoples who had not yet attained self-government. He has
  been associated with the UN ever since.<br>
  <br>
  From June of 1947 to August of 1949, Bunche worked on the most
  important assignment of his career - the confrontation between
  Arabs and Jews in Palestine. He was first appointed as assistant
  to the UN Special Committee on Palestine, then as principal
  secretary of the UN Palestine Commission, which was charged with
  carrying out the partition approved by the UN General Assembly.
  In early 1948 when this plan was dropped and fighting between
  Arabs and Israelis became especially severe, the UN appointed
  Count Folke Bernadotte as mediator and Ralph Bunche as his chief
  aide. Four months later, on September 17, 1948, Count Bernadotte
  was assassinated, and Bunche was named acting UN mediator on
  Palestine. After eleven months of virtually ceaseless
  negotiating, Bunche obtained signatures on armistice agreements
  between Israel and the Arab States.<br>
  <br>
  Bunche returned home to a hero's welcome. New York gave him a
  &laquo;ticker tape&raquo; parade up Broadway; Los Angeles declared
  a &laquo;Ralph Bunche Day&nbsp;&raquo;. He was besieged with requests to
  lecture, was awarded the Spingarn Prize by the NAACP in 1949, was
  given over thirty honorary degrees in the next three years, and
  the Nobel Peace Prize for 1950.<br>
  <br>
  Bunche still works for the UN. From 1955 to 1967, he served as
  undersecretary for Special Political Affairs and since 1968 has
  been undersecretary-general. During these years he has taken on
  many special assignments. When war erupted in the Congo in 1960,
  <a href="../1961/index.html">Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld</a>, then
  secretary-general of the UN, appointed him as his special
  representative to oversee the UN commitments there. He has
  shouldered analogous duties in Cyprus, Kashmir, and Yemen.<br>
  <br>
  Replying to an interviewer on the UN's intervention in
  international crises, Bunche remarked that the &laquo;United
  Nations has had the courage that the League of Nations lacked -
  to step in and tackle the buzz saw&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Ralph Bunche has supplied a part of
  that courage.<a href="#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
