			  <b>Ancestral origins</b><br>
                In 1862, Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, a bill opening
                 one half million square miles of territory in the western United
                States for settlement. The Homestead Act offered new arrivals
                 from other countries the opportunity to stake and develop farms
                 of 160 acres by simply working the land for five years. Although
                 they were only in their teens or early twenties, my great grandparents
                 individually left their villages in Norway and Sweden between
                 1875 and 1885 and migrated to western Minnesota and South Dakota.
                 Similar to the protagonists in the epics of Ole Rolvaag and
                Vilhelm  Moberg, they worked the rich farmland, married, raised
                families,  and achieved prosperity unattainable at that time
                in Scandinavia.</p>
              <p>Things changed for my parents' generation. 
                My father, Courtland Agre, and his two sisters grew up in Wallace, 
                a hamlet in eastern South Dakota where his parents ran the general 
                store. Wallace was also the hometown of Hubert Humphrey, and while 
                my aunt Pearl remembers baby-sitting young Hubert, my father, 
                an ardent Republican, claimed that they never met. To accommodate 
                their educational needs, my grandparents moved the family to a 
                larger town and ultimately to Minneapolis where Dad earned his 
                B.S. and Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Minnesota. 
                He contributed to the U.S. effort in World War II by working as 
                an experimental polymer chemist for the 3M company. My mother, 
                Ellen Swedberg, was the sixth of eight children. Her upbringing 
                was more severe. She was only five years old when her mother died; 
                later her father lost their farm in Twin Brooks, South Dakota 
                during the Depression. At age 18, Mother moved to St. Paul in 
                order to support herself. Despite eleven years difference in age, 
                Dad and Mom met at a Lutheran church social, fell in love, and 
                married. I was never certain how much their families approved, 
                since even small differences in geographical origins are taken 
                very seriously by Scandinavians. The Agres were Norwegian (Osterdalen 
                and Trondelag), while the Swedbergs had mixed origins - Swedish 
                (Sk√•ne) and Norwegian (Telemark).</p>
              <p><b>Childhood</b><br>
                Following WWII, my parents moved to Northfield, a town 40 miles 
                south of Minneapolis where Dad was recruited to the chemistry 
                department at St. Olaf College. Dad was energetic and, with the 
                help of his St. Olaf students during the summers, he built our 
                house across the street from the college athletic fields and meadows. 
                We could look up at the college from our living room. As was the 
                tradition, Mom had babies and took care of the family. Preceded 
                two years by my sister Annetta, I was born on January 30, 1949 
                and received the anglicized name of my grandfather, Peder. My 
                closest sibling, James (Jim), was born one year later, followed 
                by Paul, Ruth, and Mark. We had an idyllic childhood. Grandmother 
                Agre lived nearby and coaxed us to speak rudimentary Norwegian 
                in return for cookies and other bribes ("Jeg liker Bestemor's 
                mat!"). Northfield was in many ways a new-world enclave of pre-Ibsen 
                Norway with 19th century religious and socially conservative values. 
                My friends had family names like Lunder, Finholt, Berglund, and 
                Fredriksen. We schoolchildren all sat on the hillside waving our 
                Norwegian flags when King Haakon visited St. Olaf. He was chauffeured 
                from the train station to the college in the only Cadillac in 
                town - owned by the local plumber. We always had lutefisk for 
                Christmas dinner, after which Dad read from the Norwegian Bible. 
                During the summers, he welcomed us into his laboratory at St. 
                Olaf where he rigged simple "experiments" for us such as changing 
                the color of solutions containing indicator dye by adding acid 
                or base. As a youngster, it was obvious to me that I would follow 
                my father's career path, since he was my greatest hero.</p>

      </p>
              <p>Life changed for our family while I was in 
                the third grade. Grandmother Agre died, and Dad decided to take 
                a sabbatical year at the University of California. Dad had high 
                aspirations, and through the American Chemical Society he became 
                acquainted with renowned scientists. Berkeley was an amazing change 
                from Northfield, and Jim and I attempted, with limited success, 
                to demonstrate our Norwegian athletic and scholastic superiority 
                to the smart and culturally heterogeneous Berkeley youngsters. 
                It was at this time that my brother Paul was recognized as mentally 
                retarded, and my sister Ruth began to exhibit her lifelong personality 
                disorder with lack of impulse control. While they never fretted 
                openly, these problems must have caused my parents profound heartache.</p>
              <p>Following the year in Berkeley, we returned 
                to Minnesota. Always eager for a challenge, Dad accepted a professorship 
                at Augsburg College, a small Norwegian Lutheran college in Minneapolis 
                with a chemistry department in need of help. We lived in a beautiful, 
                large brick house on the banks of Lake Nokomis and went to the 
                public schools. My inconsistent academic performance was usually 
                well tolerated, as I tried to amuse my school classes with my 
                practical jokes and amateurish wit. As in Northfield, my teachers 
                were the kindest and nicest people imaginable. It is impossible 
                to overestimate the importance of a teacher in the life of a child, 
                and my all-time favorite was my sixth grade teacher Richard Hughes 
                whose kindly personality and gentle sense of humor inspired in 
                us the idea that learning is wonderfully fun. This impression 
                was shared by many. My classmate Julia Lofness remains a close 
                personal friend and still cheers me by retelling events from our 
                days in Mr. Hughes' class.</p>
              <p>My brother Jim and I spent many wonderful 
                summers working on dairy farms in Wisconsin owned by Mom's cousins, 
                and as members of our local Boy Scout troop. Scouting was a particularly 
                important activity for us, and through the generous instruction 
                of our Scoutmasters, Harold Neuendorf and Francis McMahon, we 
                learned the resourcefulness needed to camp out even in Minnesota 
                winters. One of our happiest times was in 1964 when Jim and I 
                received our Eagle Scout Awards together - Dad carried that snapshot 
                in his wallet for the rest of his life. Dad's presence was always 
                palpable. Needing a medical doctor to perform physical examinations 
                before summer camp, Dad always arranged for one of his former 
                St. Olaf students to serve. One summer, Dr. Charles Mayo, grandson 
                of the Mayo Clinic founder, examined the boys of Troop 185. Also 
                as a Scout, I developed a deep interest in the culture of the 
                Ojibway Indians of Northern Minnesota and explored the Canadian 
                wilderness by canoe - an activity that I still undertake with 
                family members each summer. In retrospect, another remarkable 
                experience was the several-days visit to our home by Dad's friend 
                Linus Pauling who presented lectures on physical chemistry (subject 
                of his <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">1954 Nobel 
                Prize in Chemistry</a>) and the dangers of nuclear arms (subject 
                of his <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1962/index.html">1962 Nobel 
                Peace Prize</a>). In person, Pauling was jovial, confident, and 
                more engaging than anyone we had ever met. Dad always raved that 
                Pauling's accomplishments were the greatest, and he instilled 
                in us his view that the Nobel Prize is the closest thing to the 
                Holy Grail.</p>
              <p><b>High school and college</b><br>
                My years at Theodore Roosevelt high school were notable for reasons 
                other than academics. Like other adolescents, I developed a strong 
                attraction to girls and discovered that my parents' ideas were 
                not the least bit interesting. I earned money as a concession 
                salesman at the Minnesota Twins and Vikings games. At this time 
                I developed a lifelong love of cross country skiing and long distance 
                bicycling with my close friend and classmate Tom Page, an aspiring 
                artist and fellow adventurer. Following my junior year in high 
                school, I went on a camping trip through Russia in a group led 
                by Horst Momber, a young language teacher from Roosevelt. This 
                permanently sparked great enthusiasm for international travel 
                in me. After my return, I gravitated in a Bohemian direction. 
                Fancying myself as some sort of Bolshevik, my senior year in high 
                school went badly in terms of conforming with my family's expectations. 
                Rebelling against the establishment, my friends and I self-published 
                an underground newspaper, <i>The Substandard</i> - a parody of 
                the <i>Roosevelt High School Standard</i>. Our foray into newspaper 
                work caused much delight amongst everyone except the school administration. 
                Facing dismissal, I withdrew from school in the winter of 1967 
                when my grade in chemistry had dropped to a "D." Nevertheless, 
                I finished my high school degree in night school, and I studied 
                Russian language at the University of Minnesota during the day. 
                I worked the evening shift and drove a truck for a factory making 
                dummy land mines and parts for military equipment destined for 
                the war in Vietnam.</p>
              <p>This experience in the real world was far 
                less appealing than I had anticipated, but Dad's faculty position 
                offered a logical solution. I swallowed my pride and enrolled 
                at Augsburg where I majored in chemistry in preparation for a 
                career in medicine. Living at home, my social life was restricted 
                to bicycle rides along the Mississippi River and around the lakes. 
                My closest friends Tom and Julia remained in Minnesota for college 
                and were generous sources of support. My second year at Augsburg 
                was enlivened when brother Jim and I organized and played for 
                the varsity soccer team. I also worked part time delivering flowers 
                for a local florist. Although I was not sympathetic to the Lutheran 
                affiliation of the school, I developed my first real academic 
                self-discipline at Augsburg. I greatly benefited from excellent 
                faculty, especially John Holum, the organic chemistry professor, 
                and from the warm and friendly personalities of the other chemistry 
                majors. Unlike many campuses, Augsburg lacked an overly competitive 
                pre-med atmosphere, and all eight of the premedical chemistry 
                majors in the class of 1970 were accepted into medical school. 
                My brothers Jim and Mark also attended Augsburg and went on to 
                medical school. Annetta graduated from Augsburg before marrying 
                and raising her family; her daughter Christina has also become 
                a medical doctor.</p>
              <p><b>Early medical career and marriage</b><br>
                The long, cold Minnesota winters instilled in me a fascination 
                for exotic far off places; I aspired toward a career in tropical 
                diseases and world health problems. Johns Hopkins is highly regarded 
                in these areas of research, and I was ecstatic when I was accepted 
                into their medical school. Having enough credits to finish Augsburg 
                early, I left Minnesota in the winter of 1970 to travel alone 
                throughout Asia for several months. This was an eye-opening experience, 
                and after hitchhiking throughout Japan and Taiwan, I journeyed 
                to Laos where I traveled up the Mekong River and explored the 
                hills of northern Thailand by motorcycle. Determined to visit 
                Angkor Wat, I entered Cambodia and eventually arrived in Pnom 
                Penh just as the U.S. Air Force launched its 'Parrots Beak' offensive 
                against Vietcong east of the city. Advised by the U.S. Embassy 
                to depart immediately, I boarded an evacuation flight to Vietnam 
                where I viewed the U.S. forces in and around Saigon for several 
                days before leaving for the calm and verdurous Malay highlands. 
                Following a counterculture passage through Ceylon, India, Pakistan, 
                Afghanistan, and Iran, I eventually arrived in Istanbul, weakened 
                from multiple travelers' ailments including viral hepatitis.</p>
              <p>I began my medical studies at Johns Hopkins 
                in September 1970. After being footloose in Asia, I found it difficult 
                to concentrate on medical school, and my best efforts seemed barely 
                enough to earn passing grades. I concluded that my presence at 
                Hopkins fulfilled some sort of affirmative action quota for a 
                Scandinavian student from Minnesota or the Dakotas. My medical 
                school roommate, Vann Bennett, was from Hawaii, and he was thoroughly 
                committed to surfing and laboratory science. Unlike most Hopkins 
                medical students, Vann and I led severely ascetic lives, inhabiting 
                a series of dilapidated rooms. We enjoyed touring the countryside 
                by bicycle, and I made some long rides through Mexico and Canada. 
                I maintained my counterculture image by always making my return 
                trips to Minnesota by hitchhiking.</p>
              <p>Johns Hopkins introduced me to two defining 
                events in my life: commitment to biomedical research and meeting 
                my future wife, Mary. It was known in 1970 that most traveler's 
                diarrhea was caused by a protein similar to the cholera toxin 
                secreted by certain strains of <i>E. coli</i>. I began a summer 
                project to purify the <i>E. coli</i> toxin in the lab of Brad 
                Sack in the Infectious Disease group at Johns Hopkins. At Vann's 
                suggestion, I performed some of the biochemical studies in the 
                laboratory of Pedro Cuatrecasas in the Pharmacology Department. 
                The project fascinated me so much that I stayed in Pedro's lab 
                during my final year in medical school, 1974, and put in an additional 
                year as a postdoctoral fellow. I eventually succeeded in purifying 
                the toxin, but of larger importance was my discovery that I wanted 
                to make biomedical research my life's work. This was in part due 
                to the fascinating scientists in the group. Looking back, it seems 
                unlikely that such a passionate but disparate group of scientists 
                could form a team and become close personal friends. Led by Pedro, 
                a cosmopolitan intellectual with Spanish and South American roots, 
                our group included a Palestinian from Lebanon, a conservative 
                Jew from Brooklyn, a French psychiatrist, a Swiss-Indian chemist, 
                a Canadian Rhodes Scholar, a Spanish anti-Franco activist, and 
                a strikingly handsome Italian film actor who attracted the notice 
                of every woman at Hopkins as he elucidated the molecular basis 
                of femininity by performing the first purification of the estrogen 
                receptor.</p>
              <p>During these lab years, I met Mary Macgill, 
                an attractive and intelligent young woman who was working in a 
                Hopkins neurovirology lab. Mary and I immediately fell in love 
                and became inseparable. Her calm and wise approach to life balanced 
                my frenetic nature. From our first days together, Mary always 
                encouraged me in my scientific career, and she often brought food 
                to the lab late at night so we could keep working. Despite my 
                ragamuffin appearance, Mary's family received me warmly. Representing 
                a fascinating mix of blueblood lineage and farm-raised practicality, 
                both sides of her family were among the early settlers in Maryland. 
                Her mother, who had died a year before I met Mary, was a direct 
                descendant of Pocahontas, and her father was a distinguished trial 
                judge in Howard County, Maryland. We were married on March 29, 
                1975.</p>
              <p><b>Postgraduate training </b><br>
                My goal was to develop into an independent research scientist 
                studying clinical problems at the laboratory bench, but I felt 
                that postgraduate residency training in internal medicine was 
                necessary. Mary and I settled in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, from 
                1975 to 1978 while I completed clinical training at Case Western 
                University Hospitals of Cleveland. The CWRU Hospitals were led 
                by Charles C.J. Carpenter, Jr., a distinguished physician and 
                former member of the cholera group at Hopkins. I found the clinical 
                years to be emotionally and physically draining. Nevertheless, 
                I enjoyed the patients and took pride when elderly African-American 
                patients referred to me as their "jive doctor." </p>
              <p>During this time, Pedro's group had moved 
                to the Wellcome Laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North 
                Carolina. I accepted a clinical fellowship in hematology and oncology 
                at the nearby University of North Carolina (UNC), and Mary and 
                I moved to Chapel Hill in late June 1978. I supplemented the meager 
                fellowship stipend by working as a physician at the army hospital 
                at Fort Bragg (home of the 82nd Airborne Division). Mary and I 
                purchased a small cottage in the country and two Irish Setter 
                puppies. Our daughter Sara was born in September; Claire was born 
                a year and a half later. Our family life was Spartan but delightful. 
                We made many bicycle trips to neighboring farms and camping trips 
                in the Smokies with our adorable little daughters - Sara a towhead 
                with beautiful blue eyes and an engaging smile, and Claire with 
                a thick shock of red hair and many clever but often mischievous 
                ideas.</p>

              <p>My clinical duties taking care of cancer patients 
                at UNC were frequently depressing, but I enjoyed attending the 
                outpatient clinic with John Parker, a clear-sighted Professor 
                of Medicine who always encouraged me to study red cell membranes. 
                Vann had also joined the Wellcome Laboratories, and he developed 
                techniques to study the principal structural proteins from red 
                blood cell membranes - spectrin, which formed the girders of the 
                membrane skeleton, and ankyrin, the attachment protein that he 
                discovered. Campbell McMillan, a UNC pediatric hematologist, had 
                identified two little girls in his clinic with an extreme form 
                of hereditary spherocytosis, a disorder of red cell shape causing 
                increased fragility. Spherocytosis is generally accompanied by 
                only mild anemia, but the sisters were nearly lethally affected. 
                Together with Vann, I evaluated the membranes and found them to 
                be grossly deficient in spectrin, and we reported the study in 
                the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. This strongly reinforced 
                my desire to pursue biomedical research.</p>
              <p><b>Return to Baltimore and Hopkins faculty</b><br>
                When Vann returned to Johns Hopkins in 1981 as a faculty member, 
                I applied for an NIH career development grant to join him for 
                more research training. This did not make sense financially, as 
                it meant a 40% reduction in salary and loss of my staff position 
                in the Wellcome Labs and adjunct faculty position at UNC. I consulted 
                with my friend John Parker who generously reassured me that the 
                opportunity at work with Vann at Hopkins would be important for 
                me. Encouraged by Mary, we sold our lovely cottage, packed up 
                our station wagon and a rental truck, and returned to Baltimore 
                in August 1981. We scraped together funds and purchased a brick 
                Dutch colonial house next to the Stoneleigh Elementary School 
                and a large park and forest. The location was fortunate; I could 
                commute the 6 miles to Hopkins every day by bicycle. To supplement 
                our resources, I moonlighted as a ringside physician at professional 
                boxing matches.</p>
              <p>The Department of Cell Biology at Johns Hopkins 
                was founded and directed by Tom Pollard, an engaging young scientist 
                with remarkable energy and enthusiasm. I continued working with 
                Vann and reported a series of studies of red cell membranes. I 
                would have been happy to have remained in Vann's lab, but he recognized 
                my need for an independent faculty position. In early autumn 1983, 
                I received a faculty offer from the Hematology Division at Brigham 
                and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School - a program regarded 
                as the best in the country. I accepted the offer verbally, but 
                Mary was pregnant with our third child, and while she remained 
                supportive, she strongly desired to remain in Baltimore near her 
                family. The Hematology Division at Johns Hopkins was in a transitional 
                mode and exhibited minimal interest in me. However, Victor McKusick, 
                then-Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Hopkins, interceded 
                and I was offered an Assistant Professorship but with a much smaller 
                start-up package.</p>
              <p>This offer from Hopkins coincided with the 
                blackest period in our family life. In the 9th month of her pregnancy, 
                Mary experienced a premature separation of the placenta. After 
                induction of labor, our daughter Lydia was born in severe distress. 
                Although she survived, our baby never recovered. Like her sisters, 
                Lydia was a gorgeous child, but her spontaneous movements were 
                few. She moaned softly whenever she was repositioned in her crib, 
                but she always relaxed when we held her. Devastated and expecting 
                a need for permanent home nursing assistance, I accepted the offer 
                at Hopkins, since it would provide the supplemental health care 
                insurance needed for Lydia's care. Although Mary always exhibited 
                the utmost determination to provide the best possible life for 
                Lydia, I wavered badly and only with great difficulty was I able 
                to accept our situation. We were again crushed when Lydia died 
                four days before Christmas 1983.</p>
              <p>We had the advantage of broad support from 
                family and friends but struggled to cope. Mary stayed home to 
                care for Sara and Claire while I set up a tiny lab in the old 
                Blalock Building in Johns Hopkins Hospital. I was able to hire 
                a technician, Andy Asimos, a bright-eyed young man from a Greek 
                family who applied to work for two years before going to medical 
                school. Andy and I continued the spherocytosis studies, establishing 
                that the level of spectrin deficiency correlated with the clinical 
                severity of the disease in new reports published in <i>Nature</i> 
                and the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>
              <p>Although the importance of the blood group 
                antigen Rh was universally recognized, I was surprised to learn 
                from Wendell Rosse, our friend at Duke Medical Center, that the 
                molecular identity of Rh was completely unknown. The existence 
                of 32 kDa polypeptides in red cells from Rh(D) individuals was 
                reported by two European groups. We initiated a new project on 
                the Rh blood group antigen in the hope that isolation of the polypeptide 
                would allow us to define the components of the Rh antigen. Andy 
                and I injected a series of rabbits with the partially purified 
                32 kDa Rh polypeptide. When Andy left for medical school, Barbara 
                Smith, a former blood bank technologist, replaced him and set 
                about purifying the Rh polypeptide. We soon recognized that we 
                actually had isolated two membrane proteins - the 32 kDa Rh and 
                a second protein of 28 kDa. My research expanded and we focused 
                our major attention on Rh but continued to dabble with the 28 
                kDa protein.</p>

      </p>
              <p>Our son Clarke was born in 1985 - an adorable 
                little boy with a dimple in his left cheek. Mary and I took Clarke 
                with us on a motor trip through Ireland the next year, and our 
                family life gradually returned to normal. Mary organized camping 
                trips for us to the national parks in the U.S and Canada each 
                summer and Appalachian Trail hikes and visits to farms on the 
                weekends. The tent shook as we played monkey pile, a game where 
                I wrestled with the children and tickled them until they giggled 
                themselves speechless. The children loved camping, and I made 
                up crazy bedtime stories about a pirate named Cinco Grumpy and 
                his brother Buffalo Grumpy who rode a horse named Snapping Pony. 
                Sara and Claire attended Stoneleigh Elementary, played on recreation 
                league soccer teams, and greatly enjoyed the synchronized swim 
                program at the community pool. Mary always played the major role 
                of parent. She organized an aluminum-recycling program for the 
                elementary school and volunteered to teach science to the children 
                at Stoneleigh. She made friends with the McKnights, a neighboring 
                family with three children close in age to our own. I met the 
                father, Steve, at a neighborhood function when Claire pointed 
                him out as "Gracie's Dad." Steve had done pioneering work on DNA 
                transcription factors and had already established himself as a 
                major figure in molecular biology. I was inspired to join his 
                lab at the Carnegie Institution as a sabbatical worker for the 
                1988-1989 academic year. This proved to be enormously productive 
                - I learned DNA technology and made a worthwhile contribution 
                to the understanding of transcription factor-DNA interactions. 
                By coincidence, another child was born to each family in 1989 
                - Johnny McKnight and Anne Carlyle Agre (Carly).</p>
              <p><b>Discovery of the aquaporins and growth 
                of our children</b><br>
                Upon returning to our lab, I felt that we should explore the 28 
                kDa protein further. Barb and postdoctoral Fellow Brad Denker 
                worked to develop a simple method for purifying the 28 kDa protein 
                from the membranes of human red blood cells based upon its relative 
                insolubility in N-lauroylsarcosine, a detergent that extracted 
                the other membrane proteins. The 28 kDa protein was found to be 
                amazingly abundant in red cell membranes (approximately 200,000 
                copies per cell) and behaved physically like a membrane-spanning 
                homotetramer. Other scientists had failed to observe the protein 
                because it did not react with the usual protein stains. The 28 
                kDa protein was astonishingly abundant in renal proximal tubules 
                and in thin descending limbs of the loop of Henle. Determination 
                of the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein showed it to 
                be related to a series of proteins from diverse sources - lens 
                of cow eye, fruit fly brain, bacteria, and plants.</p>
              <p>These clues intrigued me. I wondered if the 
                28 kDa protein might be some sort of channel. I discussed the 
                protein with numerous scientists who were as puzzled as I and 
                who could not provide any insight. In April 1991, we stopped in 
                Chapel Hill while returning from a camping trip to Florida - a 
                compromise vacation during which we took the children to their 
                choice of park (Disney World) and our choice (the Everglades). 
                I visited Vann, who had joined Duke as a Howard Hughes Investigator. 
                I then dropped by UNC to visit John Parker. Although it was late 
                in the afternoon, and he was visibly tired from a long day in 
                the clinic, John sat quietly as I described the mysterious 28 
                kDa protein. After listening thoughtfully, John leaned forward 
                in his chair and suggested that the protein might be a channel 
                for water - something he stated that physiologists regarded as 
                controversial since no one had ever been able to define the molecular 
                identity of such a protein.</p>
              <p>John's idea yielded the breakthrough that 
                opened a new field. Greg Preston, a Postdoctoral Fellow with strong 
                molecular biological experience, cloned the cDNA for the 28 kDa 
                protein. We were also extremely fortunate to have Bill Guggino, 
                Hopkins Department of Physiology, as a collaborator. Greg expressed 
                the protein in frog eggs isolated from <i>Xenopus laevis</i> - 
                a useful expression system known to have low water permeability. 
                Greg tested our hypothesis on October 9, 1991. Although the oocytes 
                expressing the 28 kDa protein and the control oocytes looked the 
                same, when he transferred them from isotonic solution to distilled 
                water, an amazing difference was immediately obvious - all six 
                control oocytes were unaffected whereas all six 28 kDa oocytes 
                immediately exploded like popcorn. Greg ran into my office almost 
                speechless, and we both celebrated with joy. We knew from the 
                first experiment that the 28 kDa protein conferred water permeability 
                and must be the long-sought water channel.</p>
              <p><b>Professional fulfillment and home front 
                amusements</b><br>
                Our lab had always refrained from keeping our studies secret. 
                We openly shared the information of our studies with Joseph Handler 
                and his group in the Hopkins Nephrology Division. Joe considered 
                this a major breakthrough and congratulated us; however, he warned 
                me to publish the information as soon as possible. He was aware 
                of other scientists with large groups who were attempting to isolate 
                or clone the putative water channel. Word got out quickly, and 
                within a month investigators from high-powered laboratories in 
                the U.S., Japan, and Europe requested our plasmid and information 
                about our studies. Intensely nervous, Greg and I worked through 
                the Christmas holidays in marathon sessions to perform every conceivable 
                control.</p>
              <p>We submitted the paper on February 4, 1992, 
                but I lay awake at night worrying that my openness would cause 
                us to be scooped. My departmental chairmen Jack Stobo, Department 
                of Medicine, and Tom Pollard, Department of Cell Biology/Anatomy, 
                reassured me that we had taken the ethical high road and would 
                not be denied credit for the discovery. I subsequently learned 
                that other groups had immediately focused all their attention 
                on the 28 kDa protein after hearing about our unpublished observations. 
                We succeeded in attaining priority when our paper was accepted 
                for publication in the April 17 issue of <i>Science</i>. Greg 
                was selected to present the study as a plenary lecture at the 
                American Society of Clinical Investigation. Several colleagues 
                joined us for lunch before Greg's talk, and the name "aquaporin" 
                emerged. We all agreed that it was perfect, and our 28 kDa protein 
                became officially designated as AQP1.</p>
              <p>We initiated a series of collaborations with 
                laboratories outside of Hopkins, and these scientists soon became 
                close friends of my lab and family. The collaborations yielded 
                a rich set of studies that catapulted us into prominence within 
                the membrane transport field. Mark Knepper, at the NIH Laboratory 
                for Kidney and Electrolyte Metabolism, introduced us to his junior 
                colleague, S√∏ren Nielsen, at the University of Aarhus, and his 
                former mentor, Arvid Maunsbach. With S√∏ren in the lead, we defined 
                the sites of expression of AQP1 in kidney, brain, capillaries, 
                and other tissues by high resolution light microscopy and immunogold 
                electron microscopy. Using AQP1 protein that Barb Smith purified 
                to homogeneity, our collaborators Mark Zeidel at Harvard and Suresh 
                Amubudkar at Hopkins defined the biophysical functions of AQP1 
                reconstituted into synthetic liposomes. Ueli Aebi, a former Hopkins 
                colleague, introduced us to Andreas Engel at the M.E. M√ºller- 
                Institute at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel in Switzerland. 
                Andreas and his grad student Tom Walz prepared membrane crystals 
                containing our highly purified AQP1 protein and determined the 
                structure by negative staining electron microscopy, atomic force 
                microscopy, and electron crystallography.</p>
              <p>The next two years (1992-94) proved critical 
                to my academic development and our laboratory's research. My lab 
                had temporarily resided within the Cell Biology Department, but 
                when space constraints emerged, we were faced with the need to 
                relocate. This was not initially popular with our team, and signs 
                emblazoned "Hell No - We won't go!" appeared in the lab. Fortunately, 
                Dan Lane, Chairman of the Department of Biological Chemistry, 
                offered me the lab once occupied by the renowned biochemist, Albert 
                Lehninger. This was a godsend, and I have held a faculty position 
                in the Department of Biological Chemistry ever since. Promotion 
                to full professor came in 1993. Also at this time, I assisted 
                Tom Pollard in the launching of a new Ph.D. graduate program. 
                With funding from the Markey Charitable Trust, the Johns Hopkins 
                Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) was 
                initiated to permit talented students in the laboratories of clinical 
                and basic science departments to attain fundamental research skills 
                and in-depth understanding of clinical diseases. Our first students 
                matriculated in September 1994.</p>

              <p>These years brought the realities of adult 
                life. Mary was always very close to her father, but his health 
                had declined and he died at age 81 while we were on a camping 
                trip in California. Rather than returning for his funeral, we 
                joined with the children in a special Jamie-remembrance at our 
                campsite at Yosemite. John Parker was tragically stricken with 
                a malignancy and died soon after at age 58. My father had been 
                diagnosed with prostate cancer and succumbed at age 82. Mary and 
                I both became the senior generation of our families. Fortunately, 
                Mary's sister Sally moved nearby and added immensely to our lives 
                and the lives of our four children. Sara and Claire became artists 
                and scholars in high school. Clarke became a Cub Scout. Carly 
                enjoyed special status as the "baby of the family" and kept us 
                all amused with her wacky sense of humor. Sometimes her siblings 
                teased Carly too much. The children all enjoyed our family dogs 
                - especially when they misbehaved, but Carly experienced an emotional 
                meltdown when Sara once misinformed her that the rabbit that our 
                dog had killed was the Easter Bunny!</p>
              <p><b>Getting the word out - a scientific itinerant</b><br>
                The decade of 1994-2003 proved exhilarating but exhausting. We 
                continued at a fast pace in our own laboratory and in key collaborations 
                with outstanding laboratories in Europe; together we generated 
                more than 100 publications. Of these, a few stand out in my mind 
                as particularly notable achievements.</p>
              <p>The structural studies begun with analysis 
                of recombinants in our lab by Greg Preston and Jin Sup Jung led 
                to proposition of the hourglass model - a unique structure with 
                four subunits each containing an individual aqueous pore formed 
                from two hemi-channels oriented at 180¬∞ to each other that overlap 
                within the bilayer. The electron crystallographic studies with 
                Andreas Engel were expanded to include Yoshinori Fujiyoshi and 
                his group in Kyoto. These studies of biologically active membrane 
                crystals revealed electron densities at 3.8 √Ö, and merging with 
                the recombinant studies yielded the first high resolution structure 
                of a human membrane channel. X-ray crystallography and molecular 
                dynamics simulations by other scientists soon advanced the structure 
                further.</p>
              <p>The identification of humans lacking AQP1 
                protein resulted from co-localization of the structural gene with 
                the Co blood group antigens on human chromosome 7 by Chulso Moon 
                and demonstration of the Co polymorphism by Barb Smith and Greg 
                Preston. Co-null individuals are extremely rare, and knockout 
                mutations were identified in the gene encoding AQP1 (hence, AQP1-null). 
                Although AQP1-null individuals are extremely rare, they feel perfectly 
                well. Nevertheless, definitive studies by Landon King elucidated 
                a major defect in renal concentration after thirsting and a marked 
                delay in vascular water permeability.</p>
              <p>Cloning the AQP4 homolog in brain by Jin Sup 
                Jung led to a major new chapter in the recognition of water transporters 
                at the blood brain barrier by S√∏ren Nielsen and Ole Petter Ottersen. 
                The structural basis of AQP4 localization resulted from a pivotal 
                observation by John Neely and led to the recognition by Mahmood 
                Amiry-Moghaddam that AQP4 contributes detrimentally to the onset 
                of brain edema.</p>
              <p>AQP5, the aquaporin from secretory glands, 
                was cloned by Surabhi Raina and was shown by Landon and S√∏ren 
                to have unique distribution in glands and alveolar pneumocytes. 
                While multiple clinical roles are anticipated, functional demonstration 
                of AQP5 in sweating may have profound relevance to body temperature 
                regulation. AQP6 was shown by Masato Yasui to be unique amongst 
                aquaporins in that it freely transports anions within acid secretory 
                cells of renal collecting ducts. Experiments by Jen Carbrey and 
                Dan Gorelick predict that AQP9 is essential for conversion of 
                glycerol to glucose in liver during starvation. Barry Rosen and 
                his group at Wayne State identified arsenite transport through 
                AQP9, thereby explaining the hepatotoxicity of the compound. Multiple 
                studies by Giuseppe Calamita, Melanie Bonhivers, Jen Carbrey, 
                David Kozono, Mario Borgnia, and Eric Beitz have documented fascinating 
                roles for aquaporins in micro-organisms.</p>
              <p>The astonishing interest in our work demonstrated 
                by groups throughout the U.S. and abroad provided a direct means 
                of showcasing the efforts of our young scientists and collaborators. 
                During the decade, I undertook an extensive series of lecture 
                trips, making over 250 presentations at universities, institutes, 
                and scientific meetings on five continents. While the opportunity 
                to speak directly to scientists around the world was important 
                to establish visibility for the aquaporin field, the chance to 
                meet and encourage hundreds of students and postdoctoral fellows 
                was a most wonderful experience, since these young people represent 
                the future of science.</p>
              <p>Our family life accommodated my extended absences. 
                We undertook special family wilderness camping trips and each 
                child accompanied me on some of the international travels. However, 
                missing birthday celebrations, anniversaries, and graduations 
                is something I am not proud of. Nevertheless, all members of the 
                family have done very well. Sara graduated from Colgate University 
                and is an administrator at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. 
                Engaged to Jason Watson, we look forward to her wedding this coming 
                summer. Claire graduated from Duke University and taught science 
                to 8-yearold children in Italy. She is now studying landscape 
                architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design in Cambridge. 
                Clarke earned his Eagle Scout Award and received numerous honors 
                for art and photography. He is a student at Hampshire College 
                in Amherst MA. Carly sometimes expresses dismay for being the 
                only child left at home, but her interests in wilderness adventures 
                and studio arts follow the interests of her siblings. Mary took 
                graduate school courses in education and became a pre-school teacher. 
                When we share observations, it is clear that her 3-year-old pupils 
                bite each other more often than my 25-year-old graduate students 
                do, but the difference is quantitative and not absolute.</p>
              <p><b>"It's unbelievable"</b><br>
                Prior to the acclaim resulting from the aquaporin studies, my 
                greatest academic recognition was the 1991 Young Investigator 
                Award from the Eastern Section of the American Federation of Clinical 
                Research. The presentation at a small meeting in New York City 
                was delightful. My children, however, concluded that I, at age 
                42, must be "the world's oldest young investigator." Although 
                I never considered myself a physiologist or a nephrologist, scientists 
                in those fields generously embraced our studies on aquaporins 
                and showered our lab with accolades including the 1999 Homer Smith 
                Award. The international recognition of our work was made shockingly 
                real when I received an invitation to present the aquaporin story 
                as part of the Jubilee Symposium in Stockholm preceding the 100th 
                anniversary of the Nobel Prizes in December 2001.</p>

              <p>The possibility that I might someday actually 
                win a Nobel was raised by my father during his terminal illness. 
                Not being superstitious, I chose to disregard the notion, but 
                pleasant Nobel daydreams must occasionally enter the minds of 
                many scientists. It became a vivid reality when the phone rang 
                at 5:30 a.m. on October 8, 2003. The Royal Swedish Academy of 
                Sciences and the Nobel Chemistry Committee awakened me with extraordinary 
                news. A deluge of journalists descended upon our house, and only 
                with difficulty was Mary able to contact my mother to share the 
                news. Consistent with her modest Scandinavian farming origins, 
                she responded calmly, "That's very nice, but tell Peter not to 
                let it go to his head." When I arrived at the laboratory, celebrations 
                had already begun. The telephone message system had filled up, 
                but the excited voice of my Norwegian colleague was special. "Peter, 
                Peter, we just heard the news. It's unbelievable!" Then, after 
                a short pause, the voice returned. "I mean it's very believable, 
                but it's wonderful!" Within the next few days, I was contacted 
                by hundreds of scientific colleagues, relatives from the U.S. 
                and Scandinavia, friends from childhood, classmates from grade 
                school through medical school - many whom I had not seen in years. 
                For me, the chance to renew these bonds is perhaps the best part 
                of winning a Nobel Prize.</p>
