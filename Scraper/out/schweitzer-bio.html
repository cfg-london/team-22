  <h1>Albert Schweitzer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schweitzer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Albert Schweitzer</b> (January 14, 1875-September 4,
  1965) was born into an Alsatian family which for generations had
  been devoted to religion, music, and education. His father and
  maternal grandfather were ministers; both of his grandfathers
  were talented organists; many of his relatives were persons of
  scholarly attainments.<br>
  <br>
  Schweitzer entered into his intensive theological studies in 1893
  at the University of Strasbourg where he obtained a doctorate in
  philosophy in 1899, with a dissertation on the religious
  philosophy of Kant, and received his licentiate in theology in
  1900. He began preaching at St. Nicholas Church in Strasbourg in
  1899; he served in various high ranking administrative posts from
  1901 to 1912 in the Theological College of St.Thomas, the college
  he had attended at the University of Strasbourg. In 1906 he
  published <i>The Quest of the Historical Jesus</i>, a book on
  which much of his fame as a theological scholar rests.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile he continued with a distinguished musical career
  initiated at an early age with piano and organ lessons. Only nine
  when he first performed in his father's church, he was, from his
  young manhood to his middle eighties, recognized as a concert
  organist, internationally known. From his professional
  engagements he earned funds for his education, particularly his
  later medical schooling, and for his African hospital.
  Musicologist as well as performer, Schweitzer wrote a biography
  of Bach in 1905
  in French, published a book on organ building and playing in
  1906, and rewrote the Bach book in German in 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Having decided to go to Africa as a medical missionary rather
  than as a pastor, Schweitzer in 1905 began the study of medicine
  at the University of Strasbourg. In 1913, having obtained his
  M.D. degree, he founded his hospital at Lambar&eacute;n&eacute; in
  French Equatorial Africa, but in 1917 he and his wife were sent
  to a French internment camp as prisoners of war. Released in
  1918, Schweitzer spent the next six years in Europe, preaching in
  his old church, giving lectures and concerts, taking medical
  courses, writing <i>On the Edge of the Primeval Forest, The Decay
  and Restoration of Civilization, Civilization and Ethics</i>, and
  <i>Christianity and the Religions of the World</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Schweitzer returned to Lambar&eacute;n&eacute; in 1924 and except for
  relatively short periods of time, spent the remainder of his life
  there. With the funds earned from his own royalties and personal
  appearance fees and with those donated from all parts of the
  world, he expanded the hospital to seventy buildings which by the
  early 1960's could take care of over 500 patients in residence at
  any one time.<br>
  <br>
  At Lambar&eacute;n&eacute;, Schweitzer was doctor and surgeon in the
  hospital, pastor of a congregation, administrator of a village,
  superintendent of buildings and grounds, writer of scholarly
  books, commentator on contemporary history, musician, host to
  countless visitors. The honors he received were numerous,
  including the Goethe Prize of Frankfurt and honorary doctorates
  from many universities emphasizing one or another of his
  achievements. The Nobel Peace Prize for 1952, having been
  withheld in that year, was given to him on December 10, 1953.
  With the $33,000 prize money, he started the leprosarium at
  Lambar&eacute;n&eacute;.<br>
  <br>
  Albert Schweitzer died on September 4, 1965, and was buried at
  Lambar&eacute;n&eacute;.</p>
