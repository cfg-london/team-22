  <h1>Nathan S&ouml;derblom - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="soderblom.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Nathan S&ouml;derblom</b> (January 15, 1866-July 12,
  1931), near the beginning and near the end of his illustrious
  career, found his name linked with that of another Swedish
  citizen of the world, <a href=
  "/alfred_nobel/index.html">Alfred Nobel</a>. He was called
  to San Remo in 1897 to conduct the memorial service for Nobel and
  in 1930 to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.<br>
  <br>
  Lars Olof Jonathan (called Nathan) S&ouml;derblom was born at
  Tr&ouml;n&ouml;, in the Swedish province of H&auml;lsingland, to
  Jonas S&ouml;derblom, a Pietistic pastor, and Sophia (Blume)
  S&ouml;derblom, among whose ancestors there had once been a
  bishop of Oslo.<br>
  <br>
  As a student at Uppsala University, S&ouml;derblom won respect not
  only for his intellectual attainments but also for his personal
  charm, abundant vitality, and talent as a speaker. He took his
  bachelor's degree in 1886, with honors in Greek and competency in
  Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin. This admirable linguistic background
  equipped him for the exacting scholarship of the School of
  Theology at Uppsala where, for the next six years, he continued
  his wide-ranging studies in theology and the history of religion.
  From its founding in 1888, S&ouml;derblom was the editor for five
  years of <i>Meddelanden</i>, the Student Missionary Association
  review, in whose pages he published the first piece in what was
  eventually to become a personal bibliography of 700 items. In
  1890 he attended the Christian Student Conference in New England
  and there, after listening to a lecture by a visiting clergyman,
  wrote in his diary a sentence that was to prove prophetic,
  &laquo;Lord, give me humility and wisdom to serve the great cause
  of the free unity of thy church.&raquo;<sup><a href=
  "#not_1">1</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  After being ordained a priest in 1893 and appointed chaplain to a
  mental hospital in Uppsala, he cast about for a post that would
  enable him to marry Anna Forsell, a gifted woman student - one of
  twenty among 1,700 men at Uppsala University - who was later to
  bear him thirteen children, as well as to collaborate in the
  preparation of many of his published works. He accepted a call to
  the Swedish Church in Paris.<br>
  <br>
  For seven years, from 1894 to 1901, S&ouml;derblom preached in
  Paris, where his congregation included Alfred Nobel and August
  Strindberg, as well as Swedish and Norwegian painters, authors,
  businessmen, diplomats, and visitors to the city. Summers he
  spent in Calais in research and writing while also serving as
  chaplain to Swedish seamen in the area. Meanwhile he pursued
  graduate studies in theology, history of religions, and in
  languages predating those of the classical ages, and eventually
  became the first foreigner ever to earn a Doctor of Theology
  degree at the Protestant Faculty of the Sorbonne.<br>
  <br>
  S&ouml;derblom's experience in France strengthened his youthful
  resolve to promote &laquo;free unity&raquo; among Christian
  churches. One of his biographers, Charles J. Curtis, points out
  that fluency in French and understanding of French and Parisian
  culture gave him an international outlook, that the theological
  currents of France merging with those from his native land
  solidified his theological liberalism, and that social work among
  the Scandinavians in France convinced him that in the life of the
  church right action was as important as right belief<sup><a href=
  "#not_2">2</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  From 1901 to 1914, S&ouml;derblom occupied a chair in the School
  of Theology at Uppsala University and concurrently, from 1912 to
  1914, a chair at Leipzig University. In these productive years he
  wrote a series of books on religious history, religious
  psychology, and religious philosophy. With a group of brilliant
  colleagues and students at Uppsala, S&ouml;derblom led a
  theological revival in Sweden, giving stature to the field of
  comparative religion, pursuing the theme of the uniqueness of
  Christianity in the historical and personal character of
  Revelation, incorporating the study of non-Christian religions
  into the discipline of Christianity, and stimulating intense
  studies in the life and thought of Martin Luther<sup><a href=
  "#not_3">3</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  S&ouml;derblom's election in 1914 as archbishop of Uppsala, and,
  in consequence, primate of the Church of Sweden, was a surprise.
  Customarily, the king chose the first name on a slate of the
  three who topped the list in the voting in the sixteen electoral
  colleges. In first and second place were two distinguished
  bishops who split eighty-two percent of the electoral vote almost
  evenly; in third place was S&ouml;derblom, a priest and
  professor, with eighteen percent of the vote. Not since 1670 had
  the bishops been passed over.<br>
  <br>
  During the next, and last, seventeen years of his life,
  S&ouml;derblom administered the duties of the head of the
  ecclesiastical establishment, visiting churches throughout the
  nation, raising funds to reopen old churches and build new ones,
  reviving the elaborate ecclesiastical rituals of the past,
  imbuing the work of the church with evangelistic fervor,
  directing conferences, advising the administration of Uppsala
  University as <i>ex officio</i> pro-chancellor - and all the
  while carrying on with his own research and writing.<br>
  <br>
  Internationally, he is best known, however, as the architect of
  the ecumenical movement of the twentieth century. He had already
  begun to move toward intercommunion between the Swedish Church
  and the Church of England as early as 1909; in 1920 he arranged
  to have Bishop Woods of Peterborough, England, participate in the
  consecration of two Swedish bishops; the following year Woods
  welcomed S&ouml;derblom's &laquo;Life and Work&raquo; movement to
  Peterborough. S&ouml;derblom found that the ecumenical movement
  was hampered during this period for various reasons: the French,
  German, and American church officials were conservative, the
  Archbishop of Canterbury cautious, the patriarchs of the Eastern
  Orthodox churches just emerging from isolation, the Roman
  Catholic Church decidedly opposed, and the proponents usually men
  without power. S&ouml;derblom himself did have power, however,
  since he was the head of a national church, and he possessed
  other important attributes, including scholarly prestige and
  persuasive personal charm.<br>
  <br>
  The Stockholm Conference in 1925, which brought together
  Anglican, Protestant, and Orthodox Christians, was the
  culminating event in S&ouml;derblom's ecumenical efforts. Rome
  was not represented and in his opening address, S&ouml;derblom
  regretted the absence of the &laquo;Apostle Peter&raquo;. The
  Conference, described in detail in S&ouml;derblom's book
  <i>Stockholm 1925</i>, laid the basis for a future ecumenical
  creed, emphasized the need to reconcile the competing
  philosophies of subjective spirituality and of objective social
  action, and sought to find unity in appealing for world
  peace.<br>
  <br>
  S&ouml;derblom was proud of his election to the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> in 1921, of his Nobel Peace Prize in 1930, and of his
  invitation to deliver the Gifford Lectures in Edinburgh in 1931.
  For this famous lectureship he planned a great scholarly effort -
  one series of lectures to be delivered in 1931 and another in
  1932, both series to be published in two volumes. He delivered
  the first series of ten lectures between May 19 and June 8, 1931.
  An appropriate title for his book eluded him, but on the last day
  of his life, July 12, he found it: <i>The Living
  God</i><sup><a href="#not_4">4</a></sup>.</p>
