  <h1>Christian Anfinsen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="anfinsen.jpg" class="bio-img">Born in
  Monessen, Pennsylvania, March 26, 1916 Dr. Anfinsen obtained a
  B.A. degree from Swarthmore College in 1937 and an M.S. in organic
  chemistry in 1939 from the University of Pennsylvania. He spent
  the year 1939-40 as a Visiting Investigator at the Carlsberg Laboratory in
  Copenhagen. In 1943, he received a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical
  School in biochemistry and spent the next seven years at
  Harvard Medical School; first as Instructor and then as Assistant
  Professor of Biological Chemistry. During this time, he spent a
  year (1947-48) as a Senior Fellow of the American Cancer
  Society working with Dr. Hugo Theorell at the Medical Nobel Institute. Dr. Anfinsen left Harvard
  in 1950 to become Chief of the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology
  and Metabolism in the National Heart Institute of the National Institutes of
  Health. He was again at Harvard Medical School as Professor
  of Biological Chemistry in 1962-63 and then returned to the
  National Institutes of Health to assume his present
  position.<br>

  In Anfinsen's early work, he and Steinberg studied the
  non-uniform labelling in newly synthesized proteins - a technique
  which later permitted Dintzis, Canfield and others to determine
  that proteins are synthesized sequentially from the
  amino-terminal and <i>in vivo</i>, and to calculate the rate at
  which amino acids are polymerized.<br>
  <br>
  In the mid 1950's Anfinsen began to concentrate on the problem of
  the relationship between structure and function in enzymes. On
  the basis of studies on ribonuclease with Sela and White, he
  proposed that the information determining the tertiary structure
  of a protein resides in the chemistry of its amino acid sequence.
  Investigations on reversible denaturation of several proteins
  served to verify this proposal experimentally. It was
  demonstrated that, after cleavage of disulfide bonds and
  disruption of tertiary structure, many proteins could
  spontaneously refold to their native forms. This work resulted in
  general acceptance of the "thermodynamic hypothesis". Studies on
  the rate and extent of renaturation <i>in vitro</i> led to the
  discovery of a microsomal enzyme which catalyzes
  sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange and thereby accelerates, <i>in
  vitro</i>, the refolding of denatured proteins containing
  disulfide bonds. In the presence of this enzyme the rate of
  renaturation approaches that sufficient to account for folding of
  newly completed polypeptide chains during protein biosynthesis.
  These findings have given important impetus to studies on the
  organic synthesis of proteins, since they demonstrate that, under
  physiological conditions of environment, attainment of the native
  structure rests solely upon the correct sequential polymerization
  of the amino acids.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to his research activities, Dr. Anfinsen is an editor
  of <i>Advances in Protein Chemistry</i>, served on the Editorial
  Board of the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> and wrote
  "The Molecular Basis of Evolution" which was published in 1959.
  He is active as a member of the Board of Governors of the
  Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and was elected
  President of the American Society of Biological Chemists for the
  Academic Year 1971-72. His honors include a Rockefeller
  Foundation Public Service Award in 1954, a Guggenheim
  Fellowship in 1958, election to the National Academy of Sciences
  in 1963 and the Royal Danish Academy in 1964, and Honorary Doctor
  of Science degrees from Swarthmore College (1965), Georgetown
  University (1967), and New York Medical College (1969).<br>

  In recent years, Anfinsen has devoted himself primarily to
  comprehensive investigations of an extracellular nuclease of
  <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. He and his colleagues have
  determined the sequence of its 149 amino acids and have described
  its fundamental enzymological, physical, and immunological
  properties. They have used an extensive range of spectroscopic
  and chemical techniques, including new methods of affinity
  labeling and cross-linking, to delineate the identity and
  relationship of amino acids in its active site. Dr. Anfinsen has
  collaborated closely with a crystallographic group at M.I.T., under Professor
  F.A. Cotton, which has determined the three-dimensional structure
  of nuclease at high resolution.</p>
