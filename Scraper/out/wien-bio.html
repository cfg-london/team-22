  <h1>Wilhelm Wien - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wien.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Wilhelm Wien</b> was born on January
  13, 1864 at Fischhausen, in East Prussia. He was the son of the
  landowner Carl Wien, and seemed destined for the life of a
  gentleman farmer, but an economic crisis and his own secret sense
  of vocation led him to University studies. When in 1866 his
  parents moved to Drachstein, in the Rastenburg district of East
  Prussia, Wien went to school in 1879 first at Rastenburg and
  later, from 1880 till 1882, at the City School at Heidelberg.
  After leaving school he went, in 1882, to the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen to study mathematics and the natural sciences
  and in the same year also to the University of
  Berlin. From 1883 until 1885 he worked in the laboratory of
  Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1886 he took his doctorate with a
  thesis on his experiments on the diffraction of light on sections
  of metals and on the influence of materials on the colour of
  refracted light.<br>
  <br>
  His studies were then interrupted by the illness of his father
  and, until 1890, he helped in the management of his father's
  land. He was, however, able to spend, during this period, one
  semester with Helmholtz and in 1887 he did experiments on the
  permeability of metals to light and heat rays. When his father's
  land was sold he returned to the laboratory of Helmholtz, who had
  been moved to, and had become President of, the
  Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, established for the study
  of industrial problems. Here he remained until 1896 when he was
  appointed Professor of Physics at Aix-la-Chapelle in succession
  to Philipp Lenard. In 1899, he was appointed Professor of Physics
  at the University of Giessen. In 1900 he became Professor
  of the same subject at W&uuml;rzburg, in succession to <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">W.C. R&ouml;ntgen</a>, and in this year he
  published his <i>Lehrbuch der Hydrodynamik</i> (Textbook of
  hydrodynamics).<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 he was invited to succeed Ludwig Boltzmann as Professor
  of Physics at the University of Leipzig and in 1906 to succeed Drude
  as Professor of Physics at the University of Berlin; but he
  refused both these invitations.<br>
  <br>
  In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Physics at Munich, where he
  remained throughout the rest of his life.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the early work already mentioned, Wien worked, at
  the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, with Holborn on
  methods of measuring high temperatures with the Le Chatelier
  thermoelements and at the same time did theoretical work on
  thermodynamics, especially on the laws governing the radiation of
  heat.<br>
  <br>
  In 1893 he announced the law which states that the wavelength
  changes with the temperature, a law which later became the law of
  displacement.<br>
  <br>
  In 1894 he published a paper on temperature and the entropy of
  radiation, in which the terms temperature and entropy were
  extended to radiation in empty space. In this work he was led to
  define an ideal body, which he called the black body, which
  completely absorbs all radiations. In 1896 he published the
  formula of Wien, which was the result of work undertaken to find
  a formula for the composition of the radiation of such a black
  body. Later it was proved that this formula is valid only for the
  short waves, but Wien's work enabled Max Planck to resolve the
  problem of radiation in thermal equilibrium by means of quantum
  physics. For this work Wien was awarded the Nobel Prize for
  Physics for 1911. An interesting point about it is that this
  theoretical work came from an Institute devoted to technical
  problems and it led to new techniques for illumination and the
  measurement of high temperatures.<br>
  <br>
  When Wien moved, in 1896, to Aix-la-Chapelle to succeed Lenard,
  he found there a laboratory equipped for the study of electrical
  discharges <i>in vacuo</i> and in 1897 he began to work on the
  nature of cathode rays. Using a very high vacuum tube with a
  Lenard window, he confirmed the discovery that dean Perrin had
  made two years earlier, that cathode rays are composed of
  rapidly-moving, negatively-charged particles (electrons). And
  then, almost at the same time as <a href="../1906/index.html">Sir
  J.J. Thomson</a> in Cambridge, but by a different method, he
  measured the relation of the electric charge on these particles
  to their mass and found, as Thomson did, that they are about two
  thousand times lighter than the atoms of hydrogen.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 Wien studied the canal rays discovered by Goldstein and
  concluded that they were the positive equivalent of the
  negatively-charged cathode rays. He measured their deviation by
  magnetic and electric fields and concluded that they are composed
  of positively-charged particles never heavier than
  electrons.<br>
  <br>
  The method used by Wien resulted some 20 years later in the
  spectrography of masses, which has made possible the precise
  measurement of the masses of various atoms and their isotopes,
  necessary for the calculation of the energies released by nuclear
  reactions. In 1900 Wien published a theoretical paper on the
  possibility of an electromagnetic basis for mechanics.
  Subsequently he did further work on the canal rays, showing, in
  1912, that, if the pressure is not extremely weak, these rays
  lose and regain, by collision with atoms of residual gas, their
  electric charge along their course of travel. In 1918 he
  published further work on these rays on the measurement of the
  progressive decrease of their luminosity after they leave the
  cathode and from these experiments he deduced what classical
  physics calls the decay of the luminous vibrations in the atoms,
  which corresponds in quantum physics to the limited duration of
  excited states of atoms.<br>
  <br>
  In this, and other, respects Wien's work contributed to the
  transition from Newtonian to quantum physics. As <a href=
  "../1914/index.html">Max von Laue</a> wrote of him, his "immortal
  glory" was that "he led us to the very gates of quantum
  physics".<br>
  <br>
  Wien was a member of the Academies of Sciences of Berlin,
  G&ouml;ttingen, Vienna, <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/wien-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Stockholm</a>, Christiania and Washington, and an
  Honorary member of the Physical Society of
  Frankfurt-on-Main.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 he married Luise Mehler of Aix-la-Chapelle. They had four
  children. He died in Munich on August 30, 1928.</p>
