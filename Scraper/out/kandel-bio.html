  <b>Prologue: Life in Vienna in the
  1930s</b><br>
  There was little in my early life to indicate that an interest in
  biology would become the passion of my academic career. In fact,
  there was little to suggest I would have an academic career.
  Rather, my early life was importantly shaped by my experiences in
  Vienna and I spent many years later coming to grips with the
  circumstances and place of my birth.</p>

  <p>I was born in Vienna on November 7, 1929,
  eleven years after the multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire fell
  apart following its defeat in World War I. Although Austria had
  been radically reduced in size (from 54 million to only 7 million
  inhabitants) and in political significance, its capital, the
  Vienna of my youth, was still intellectually vibrant, one of the
  great cultural centers of the world. A city of one and a half
  million people, it was home to Sigmund Freud, Karl Kraus, Robert
  Musil, Arthur Schnitzler, and for a while Arnold Schoenberg. The
  music of Gustav Mahler and of the earlier 19th Century Vienna
  school resonated throughout the city, as did the bold
  expressionist images of Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, and Egon
  Schiele. Even as it thrived culturally, however, Vienna in the
  1930s was the capital city of an oppressive, authoritarian
  political system. I was too young to appreciate its cultural
  richness, but I sensed later, from the perspective of a more
  carefree adolescence in the United States, the oppressive
  conditions in Vienna that affected my early youth.</p>

  <p>Even prior to the Anschluss in 1938,
  anti-Semitism was a chronic feature of Viennese life. Jews, who
  made up nearly 20% of the city's population, were discriminated
  against in the Civil Service and in many aspects of social life.
  Nonetheless, they were fascinated by the city in which they had
  lived for over a thousand years. My parents genuinely loved
  Vienna, and in later years I learned from them why the city
  exerted a powerful hold on them and other Jews. My parents loved
  the dialect of Vienna, its cultural sophistication, and artistic
  values. "The greatest grim irony of all was the fierce attachment
  of so many Jews to a city that through the years demonstrated its
  deep-rooted hate for them," wrote George Berkley, the American
  historian of Vienna and its Jews. This fierce attachment was
  considered by the historian Harvey Zohn to be the most tragically
  unrequited love in world history.</p>

  <p>In spite of the hostile climate, Austrian
  Jews continued to make remarkable contributions to theater,
  music, literature, science, and medicine in the period between
  the two World Wars. The Salzburg Festival was directed by Max
  Reinhardt; the Vienna Opera was conducted by Bruno Walter. Stefan
  Zweig and Franz Werfel were two of the most popular writers in
  the German language, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1981/index.html">Elias Canetti</a>, who
  later won the Nobel Prize in Literature for books describing his
  youth in Vienna, began writing these in the 1930s. Two of the
  three Austrians to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and
  Medicine in the 1930s were of Jewish origin: <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1930/index.html">Karl Landsteiner</a> was
  honored in 1930 for his discovery of blood groups and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1936/index.html">Otto Loewi</a> in 1936 for
  discovering acetylcholine, a chemical transmitter that slowed the
  heart. Of the 52 Olympic medals earned by Austrian athletes from
  the beginning of modern Olympics to 1936, 18 were won by Jewish
  Austrians. Fully half of the practicing physicians and medical
  faculty at the University of Vienna were Jewish. This, in
  fact, was the last period during which Viennese medicine still
  attracted students and patients from all over the world. They
  came to study with, or to be treated by, pioneers in diagnostics
  and therapeutic medicine, such as the pediatrician B&eacute;la
  Schick, the ear specialist Heinrich von Neumann, and the
  psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. As this listing makes clear, the
  period of my early youth has been characterized, appropriately,
  as "the final flowering of the Austrian Jewish intellectual
  activity."</p>

  <p>My parents were not born in Vienna, but
  they had spent much of their lives there, having each come to the
  city at the beginning of World War I when they were still very
  young. My mother, Charlotte Zimels, was born in 1897 in Kolomea,
  a town of about 43,000 inhabitants in Galicia, a region of the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire. (Kolomea now is part of the Ukraine and
  has been renamed Kolomyya.) Almost half the population of Kolomea
  was Jewish, and the Jewish community had a very active culture.
  My mother came from a well-educated middle-class family, and
  although she had spent only one year at the university in Vienna,
  she spoke and wrote English as well as German and Polish.</p>

  <p>My father Herman was born into a poor
  family in 1898 in Olesko, a small town of about 3,500 people near
  Lvov (Lemberg), now also part of the Ukraine. During World War I
  he was drafted into the Austria-Hungarian Army directly from high
  school. After the war he worked to support himself and never went
  back to school.</p>

  <p>My parents met in Vienna and married in
  1923, shortly after my father had established himself as the
  owner of a small toy store. My brother Lewis was born on November
  14, 1924. I was born five years later. We lived in a small
  apartment at Severingasse 8 in the 9th district, a middle-class
  neighborhood near the medical school, and not too far from
  Freud's apartment, although we had no association with either.
  Both of my parents worked in the store, and we had a full-time
  housekeeper to help out at home.</p>

  <p>I went to a school near our house. As with
  most elementary schools in Vienna, it was very traditional and
  very good, and I followed the well-trodden trail that my
  exceptionally gifted brother Lewis had blazed five years earlier
  in the same school with the very same teachers. Throughout my
  years in Vienna I felt that his was an intellectual virtuosity
  that I would never match. By the time I began reading and
  writing, he already was starting to master Greek and to play the
  piano.</p>

  <p>My fondest early memories are of family
  get-togethers and vacations. On Sunday afternoons my Aunt Minna
  (my mother's sister) and Uncle Srul would come for tea. This was
  an occasion for my father and uncle to play cards, games at which
  my father excelled and which brought out great animation and
  humor in him. We celebrated Passover in a festive way at the home
  of my grandparents Hersch and Dora Zimels, and we invariably went
  on vacation in August to Monichkirchen, a small farming village
  in the southeast portion of Lower Austria, not far from
  Vienna.</p>

  <p>It was just as we were about to depart for
  Monichkirchen in July of 1934 that the Austrian Chancellor,
  Engelbert Dollfuss, who had outlawed the Nazi Party, was
  assassinated by a band of Austrian Nazis disguised as policemen -
  the first political storm to register on my slowly maturing
  political awareness. Following the Dollfuss assassination and
  during the early years of the chancellorship of his successor,
  Kurt von Schuschnigg, the Austrian Nazi Party went further
  underground, but it continued nonetheless to gain new adherents,
  especially among teachers and other civil servants.
  Paradoxically, the Austrian drive toward authoritarianism was
  abetted by Dollfuss's own political attitudes and actions.
  Modeling himself on both Mussolini and Hitler, Dollfuss renamed
  his Christian Socialist Party the <i>Fatherland Front</i>, and
  took to wearing a modified swastika. To assure his own control of
  the government he abolished Austria's Constitution and outlawed
  not only the Nazi Party but <i>all</i> opposition parties. Thus,
  although Dollfus opposed the efforts of the Austrian National
  Socialist movement to form a Pan-German state with Germany, his
  abolition of the Constitution and of other political parties
  helped open the door for Hitler to march in.</p>

  <p>And, as I well remember, march in he did.
  Since his youth, Hitler had dreamed of the union of Austria and
  Germany. It is therefore not surprising that a key point in the
  Nazi program, from its beginning in the 1920s, was a merger of
  all German-speaking people into a Greater Germany. In the fall of
  1937 Hitler began to act on this program by raising the level of
  rhetoric and threatening to move against Austria. Schuschnigg,
  eager to assert Austria's independence, met with Hitler on
  February 12, 1938 in Berchtesgaden. Hitler showed up with two of
  his generals in tow and threatened to invade Austria unless
  Schuschnigg, lifted the legal restrictions on the Austrian Nazi
  Party and appointed three Austrian Nazis to key ministerial
  positions in the Austrian Cabinet. Schuschnigg refused, but as
  Hitler continued to intimidate him, Schuschnigg compromised and
  agreed to a legalization of the Nazi party and to granting it two
  cabinet positions. The agreement between Schuschnigg and Hitler
  so emboldened the Austrian Nazis that they began to challenge the
  Austrian government in a series of incidents that the police had
  difficulty controlling. Faced with Hitler's aggression from
  without and the Austrian Nazi rebellion from within, Schuschnigg
  took the offensive on March 9th and boldly called for a
  plebiscite on Austria's autonomy to be held four days later, on
  March 13th.</p>

  <p>This courageous move caught Hitler by
  complete surprise, an awkward surprise since it seemed almost
  certain that the vote would favor an independent Austria. Hitler
  responded by mobilizing troops and threatening to invade Austria
  unless Schuschnigg postponed the plebiscite, resigned as
  chancellor, and formed a new government with an Austrian Nazi,
  Arthur Seyss-Inquart as chancellor. Schuschnigg turned for help
  to England and Italy, two countries that had formerly supported
  Austrian independence. But on this occasion both countries failed
  him and did not respond. Abandoned by his potential allies and
  concerned about needless bloodshed, Schuschnigg resigned on the
  evening of March 11th. "Austria is yielding to force," he
  announced in an emotional farewell radio address to the nation.
  "God protect Austria." Even though Schuschnigg had resigned and
  President Miklos of Austria gave in to all the German conditions
  Hitler nonetheless invaded Austria.</p>

  <p>Hitler's triumphal march into Vienna and
  his overwhelming reception by the Viennese public made an
  indelible impression on me. My brother had just finished building
  his first short-wave radio receiver, and on the evening of March
  13th we both were listening with earphones as the broadcaster
  described the earlier crossing of the Austrian border by German
  troops on the morning of March 12th. Hitler followed later in the
  afternoon of that day, crossing the border first at Braunnau am
  Inn, his native village, and then moving into Linz, the capitol
  of Upper Austria, where people welcomed him in the marketplace as
  their native son, screaming "Heil Hitler." Of the 120,000 people
  of Linz, almost 100,000 came out to greet Hitler. In the
  background the Horst Wessel song, one of the hypnotic Nazi
  marching songs that even I found captivating, blared forth. On
  the afternoon of March 14th Hitler's entourage reached Vienna,
  where a wildly enthusiastic crowd welcomed him as the hero who
  had unified the German-speaking people.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary reception in Linz and
  Vienna caused Hitler to change his plan. He now realized the
  Austrians would not demand the status of a relatively independent
  protectorate of Germany he had planned for them. The enthusiastic
  welcome convinced him that Austria would readily accept, indeed
  would welcome, total annexation. For it seemed as if everyone,
  from the modest shopkeepers to the most elevated members of the
  academic community, now embraced Hitler. In a shocking move, even
  Theodor Cardinal Innitzer, the influential Archbischop of Vienna,
  welcomed Hitler and ordered all the Catholic churches in the city
  to fly the Nazi flag and to ring the church bells in honor of
  Hitler's arrival in Vienna. As the Cardinal personally greeted
  Hitler, he assured him of his own loyalty and that of all
  Austrian Catholics - which was most of the population of Austria.
  The Cardinal promised Hitler that Austria's Catholics would
  become "the truest sons of the great Reich into whose arms they
  had been brought back on this momentous day," provided that the
  liberties of the Church were respected and its role in the
  education of the young guaranteed.</p>

  <p>That night, and for days on end, all hell
  broke loose. Viennese mobs erupted in nationalistic fervor,
  expressed by beating up Jews and destroying their property.
  Foreign commentators, long accustomed to Nazi tactics in Germany,
  were astonished by the wanton brutality of the Austrian Nazis,
  and even German Nazis were amazed and emboldened by the
  viciousness of the attacks in Vienna.</p>

  <p>In his autobiography the German playwright
  Carl Zuckmayer, who had moved to Austria in 1936 to escape
  Hitler, described Vienna during the days following the annexation
  of Austria as a city transformed "into a nightmare painting of
  Hieronymus Bosch." It was as if:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>... "Hades had opened its gates and vomited forth the basest,
      most despicable, most horrible demons. In the course of my life
      I had seen something of untrammeled human insights of horror or
      panic. I had taken part in a dozen battles in the First World
      War, had experienced barrages, gassings, going over the top. I
      had witnessed the turmoil of the post-war era, the crushing
      uprisings, street battles, meeting hall brawls. I was present
      among the bystanders during the Hitler Putsch in 1923 in
      Munich. I saw the early period of Nazi rule in Berlin. But none
      of this was comparable to those days in Vienna. What was
      unleashed upon Vienna had nothing to do with seizure of power
      in Germany ... What was unleashed upon Vienna was a torrent of
      envy, jealousy, bitterness, blind, malignant craving for
      revenge. All better instincts were silenced ... only the torpid
      masses had been unchained ... It was the witch's Sabbath of the
      mob. All that makes for human dignity was buried."
    </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Having watched the build-up of anti-Jewish
  laws in Germany following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, my
  parents did not need much convincing to realize that the violence
  at the time of the annexation was not likely to fade away. We
  knew that we had to leave - and to leave as soon as possible. My
  mother's brother, Berman Zimels, had emigrated a decade earlier
  to New York and established himself as an accountant. He provided
  us expeditiously with affidavits that assured he would support us
  upon our arrival in the United States. Even with these affidavits
  it took about a year for my parents' Polish quota number to be
  called. When our number finally was called, we had to emigrate in
  stages because of United States immigration laws. My mother's
  parents left first in February 1939, my brother and I next in
  April 1939, and finally my parents in September 1939, only days
  before World War II broke out.</p>

  <p>During the one year that we lived under
  Nazi rule, we experienced directly Vienna's humiliating form of
  anti-Semitism. The day after Hitler marched into Vienna, every
  one of my non-Jewish classmates - the entire class with the
  exception of one girl - stopped talking and interacting with me.
  In the park where I played I was taunted and roughed up. This
  viciousness toward Jews, of which my treatment was a mild
  example, culminated in the horrors of Kristallnacht, November 8,
  1938. On the morning of November 7, 1938, a 17 year-old Jewish
  youth, who was distraught over his parent's tragic fate at the
  hands of the Nazis, shot a third secretary in the German Embassy
  in Paris, mistaking him for the German Ambassador. In retaliation
  for this single act, almost every synagogue in Germany and
  Austria was set on fire. Of all the cities under Nazi control,
  the destructiveness in Vienna on Kristallnacht was particularly
  wanton. Jews were taunted and brutally beaten, expelled from
  their businesses, and temporarily evicted from their homes so
  that both could be looted by their neighbors. My father was
  rounded up by the police together with hundreds of other Jewish
  men. He was released a few days later only because he had fought
  in the Austria-Hungarian army as a soldier in World War I. I
  remember Kristallnacht even today, more than 60 years later,
  almost as if it were yesterday. It fell two days after my ninth
  birthday, on which I was showered with toys from my father's
  shop. When we returned to our apartment a week or so after having
  been evicted, everything of value was gone, including my
  toys.</p>

  <p>My last year in Vienna was, in a way, a
  defining year, and it fostered the profound sense of gratitude I
  came to feel for the life I have led in the United States. It is
  probably futile, even for someone trained in psychoanalytic
  thinking as I am, to attempt to trace the complex interests and
  actions of my later life to a few selected experiences of my
  youth. Nevertheless I cannot help but think that the experiences
  of my last year in Vienna helped to determine my later interests
  in the mind, in how people behave, the unpredictability of
  motivation, and the persistence of memory. Over the years I have
  returned to these subjects repeatedly as my professional
  interests evolved from a youthful interest in European
  intellectual history at Harvard, where I studied the motivation
  of German intellectuals during the Nazi era, to an interest in
  psychoanalysis with its more systematic approach to mental
  processes, and finally to my interests in the biology of
  conscious and unconscious memory.</p>

  <p>My early experiences in Vienna almost
  certainly contributed to my curiosity about the contradictions
  and complexities of human behavior. How are we to understand the
  sudden release of such great viciousness in so many people? How
  could a highly educated and cultured society, a society that at
  one historical moment nourished the music of Haydn, Mozart, and
  Beethoven, in the next historical moment sink into barbarism?</p>

  <p>Clearly the answer to this question is
  complex, and many scholars of this period have attempted partial
  answers. One conclusion, troubling to an academic like myself, is
  that a society's culture is not a reliable indicator of its
  respect for human life. This rather simplistic conclusion, of
  course, raises the question: How can values within a society
  become so radically dissociated? As far as I can tell, the
  Viennese achieved this dissociation by shifting their frame of
  reference. By defining Jews in racial rather than religious
  terms, they were able to exclude Jews from the "more highly
  evolved European Aryan race," the race they believed to be
  responsible for the rise of Western civilization.</p>

  <p>My last year in Vienna was likely also an
  important factor in my more specific later interest in the
  mechanisms of memory. I am struck, as others have been, at how
  deeply these traumatic events of my childhood became burned into
  memory - and I would emphasize that my experiences were trivial
  compared to those of so many who were seriously harmed or killed.
  For me, the frightening experiences of my last year in Vienna are
  certainly the most powerful of my "flashbulb memories," the
  emotionally charged and vivid memory of significant events that
  came to fascinate me.</p>

  <p><b>Resettlement in the United
  States</b><br>
  Needless to say, arriving in the United States in April of 1939
  was like a breath of fresh air. I never actually said "free at
  last," but I felt it then and have ever since. We settled in
  Brooklyn and lived at first with my mother's parents. My
  grandfather Hersch Zimels was a religious and scholarly man who
  was somewhat unworldly. My brother said that my grandfather was
  the only man he knew who could speak seven languages but could
  not make himself understood in any one of them. My grandfather
  and I liked each other a great deal, and he readily convinced me
  that he should tutor me in Hebrew during the summer of 1939 so
  that I might be eligible for a scholarship at the Yeshiva of
  Flatbush, an excellent Hebrew parochial school that offered both
  secular and religious studies at a very high level. With his
  tutelage I entered the Yeshiva in the fall of 1939. By the time I
  graduated in 1944 I spoke Hebrew almost as well as English, had
  read through the five books of Moses, the books of Kings, the
  Prophets and the Judges in Hebrew, and also learned a smattering
  of the Talmud.</p>

  <p>After my parents arrived, my father worked
  in a toothbrush factory. Even though he was not fond of working
  in this factory, he threw himself into the work with his usual
  energy and was soon reprimanded by the union steward for
  producing toothbrushes too quickly and making other workers
  appear slow. My father was undeterred. He simply loved America -
  he often referred to it as the "goldene Medina," the golden
  state. Even while still in Vienna he had read avidly the novels
  of Karl May, an author whose books celebrated the conquest of the
  American West and the bravery of the American Indians.</p>

  <p>With time my father managed to save enough
  money to rent and outfit a modest clothing store at 411 Church
  Avenue in Brooklyn. We lived in an apartment above the store. My
  father and mother worked together and sold simple women's dresses
  and aprons, and men's shirts, ties, underwear, and pajamas. In
  this way my parents earned enough not only to support us all but
  also to send me to college and medical school. My father worked
  in that store until the week before he died at age 78 in 1976. My
  mother sold the store soon thereafter and died in 1991 at age
  94.</p>

  <p><b>Erasmus Hall High School and Harvard
  College</b><br>
  In 1944, when I graduated from the Yeshiva of Flatbush elementary
  school, it did not as yet have a high school. I went instead to
  Erasmus Hall High School, a local public high school in Brooklyn
  that was then academically very strong. Here I became interested
  in history, in writing, and in girls. I worked on the school
  newspaper and became sports editor. I also played soccer and was
  co-captain of the track team. At the urging of one of my history
  teachers, John Campagna, a Harvard alumnus, I applied to Harvard
  College and was one of two students out of my class of about
  1,400 to be admitted, both of us on scholarships! Fair Harvard
  indeed!</p>

  <p>Even though I was thrilled by my good
  fortune, I was apprehensive about leaving Erasmus, convinced that
  I would never again feel the sheer joy I had experienced there.
  It was at Erasmus that I first sensed myself emerging from behind
  the shadow of my brother Lewis. I now had distinctive interests
  of my own - jazz music, sports, American constitutional history -
  things that did not interest Lewis. At Harvard I majored in 19th
  and 20th century European history and literature and wrote my
  honors dissertation on <i>The Attitude Toward National Socialism
  of Three German Writers: Carl Zuckmayer, Hans Carossa, and Ernst
  Junger</i>. Each of these writers was then still alive and
  represented a different position on the political spectrum of
  fascism - uncompromising liberal opposition and emigration
  (Zuckmayer), resigned acceptance and internal (spiritual)
  emigration (Carossa), and intellectual support (Junger). I came
  to the rather depressing conclusion that many German artists,
  intellectuals, and academics succumbed all too eagerly and
  opportunistically to the nationalistic fervor and racist
  propaganda of National Socialism. Historical studies have found
  that Hitler did not have widespread popular support in his first
  year in office. Had intellectuals mobilized effectively and
  brought along segments of the general population, Hitler's
  government might well have been toppled.</p>

  <p>I originally thought of doing graduate work
  in European intellectual history, along the lines of my
  undergraduate dissertation. However, in the course of my studies
  at Harvard I befriended a fellow student, Anna Kris, who had also
  emigrated from Vienna with her parents, Ernst and Marianne Kris,
  both prominent psychoanalysts from Freud's circle. Anna and her
  parents were very influential in getting me interested in
  psychoanalysis. It is difficult to recapture now the
  extraordinary fascination that psychoanalysis held for young
  people in 1950. During the first half of the 20th century
  psychoanalysis provided a remarkable set of insights into the
  mind - insights about unconscious mental processes, psychic
  determinism, and perhaps most interesting, the irrationality of
  human motivation. As a result, in 1950, psychoanalysis outlined
  by far the most coherent, interesting, and nuanced view of the
  human mind than did any other school of psychology. In addition,
  Anna's parents, who represented academic psychoanalysis in its
  most intellectual and interesting form, were extraordinary people
  - intelligent, cultured, and filled with enthusiasm. Ernst Kris,
  a former curator of applied art at the Kunsthistorisches Museum
  in Vienna, had been a world class art historian before becoming a
  psychoanalyst. After taking up psychoanalysis, he focused on the
  psychology of art, an area in which he helped train among others
  the great historian Ernst Gombrich. Marianne Kris, a wonderful
  therapist, was the daughter of Oskar Rie, a well-known Viennese
  pediatrician and Freud's best friend. Marianne in turn was a
  close friend of Freud's distinguished daughter, Anna Freud.</p>

  <p>Both Ernst and Marianne Kris were extremely
  generous and encouraging to me, as they were to Anna's other
  friends. As a result of my frequent interactions with them and
  their colleagues, I was converted to their view that
  psychoanalysis offered a fascinating new approach, perhaps the
  only approach, to understanding the mind, including the
  irrational nature of motivation and unconscious and conscious
  memory. With time this began to seem much more exciting and
  interesting to me than European literature and intellectual
  history.</p>

  <p><b>Medical School at N.Y.U.</b><br>
  To become a practicing psychoanalyst, however, it was best to go
  to medical school, become a physician, and train as a
  psychiatrist - a course of study I had not previously considered.
  So in 1951, almost impulsively, I went to summer school at
  Harvard and took the required course in introductory chemistry.
  That summer in Cambridge I shared a house with Robert Goldberger,
  Henry Nunberg, James Schwartz, and Robert Spitzer, and we all
  became lifelong friends. A few months later, based on this one
  chemistry course and my overall college record, I was accepted at
  N.Y.U. Medical School, with the proviso that I
  complete the remaining course requirements before I entered
  medical school in the fall of 1952.</p>

  <p>I entered N.Y.U. Medical School dedicated
  to studying psychiatry and becoming a psychoanalyst. Although I
  stayed with this career plan through my internship and
  psychiatric residency, by my senior year in medical school I had
  become so interested in the biological basis of medical practice
  (as had everyone else in my class) that I decided I had to learn
  something about the biology of the mind. In the 1950s most
  psychoanalysts thought of the mind in nonbiological terms.
  However, several psychoanalysts - particularly two that I got to
  know personally and who had a background in neurology, Lawrence
  Kubie and Mortimer Ostow - had begun to discuss the potential
  importance of the biology of the brain for the future of
  psychoanalysis. After considerable discussion with them and with
  another biologically oriented psychoanalyst, Sydney Margolin, I
  decided to take an elective period at Columbia University with
  Harry Grundfest. At that time N.Y.U. had no one on the faculty
  who was doing basic neural science, and in 1955, Grundfest was
  the most intellectually interesting neurobiologist in the New
  York area.</p>

  <p><b>Harry Grundfest's laboratory at Columbia
  University</b><br>
  Grundfest had obtained his Ph.D. in zoology and physiology at
  Columbia
  in 1930 and went on to a post-doctoral fellowship at Columbia,
  studying with Selig Hecht, an outstanding psychophysicist
  interested in phototransduction - the transformation of light
  into neural signals. (Hecht also was the teacher of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/index.html">George Wald</a>, who won
  the Nobel Prize in 1967 for discovering the chemical structure of
  the visual pigments.) Grundfest then joined the Rockefeller
  Institute in 1935, where he remained for a decade collaborating
  with <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1944/index.html">Herbert
  Gasser</a>. In 1944, while Grundfest was in his lab, Gasser
  shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1944/index.html">Joseph Erlanger</a> for
  introducing the oscilloscope to neurophysiological studies. This
  methodology allowed accurate temporal resolution of the waveform
  and conduction velocities of the propagated action potential. In
  collaboration with Grundfest, Gasser elaborated on his discovery
  that the conduction velocity of the action potential is a
  function of the diameter of the axon. Grundfest also carried out
  reconstructions of the compound action potential from
  cross-sectional measurements of axonal diameters in mixed nerves,
  work that formed much of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1944/gasser-lecture.html">Gasser's Nobel
  Prize Lecture</a>.</p>

  <p>In my decision to work with Grundfest, I
  was strongly encouraged by a new friend, Denise Bystryn, an
  extremely attractive and interesting French woman I had just met
  and would later marry. Denise is also Jewish. Her mother helped
  her father escape from a French concentration camp, and her
  parents survived the war by hiding from the Nazis in the
  southwest of France. During a good part of that time Denise was
  separated from her parents, hidden in a Catholic convent near
  Cahors. Denise's experiences, although more difficult, paralleled
  mine in a number of ways that seemed significant to her but did
  not seem at all important to me when we first met. However, over
  the years, our shared experiences in Europe proved to be defining
  in both our lives.</p>

  <p>In 1949, Denise, her brother Jean-Claude,
  and her parents emigrated to the United States. Denise attended
  the Lyc&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;ais de New York for one year and was
  admitted at age 17 to Bryn Mawr College as a junior. On
  graduating from Bryn Mawr at age 19, she enrolled at Columbia
  University as a graduate student in sociology. When we met she
  had just started research for her Ph.D. thesis in medical
  sociology with Robert Merton. Denise's father, a gifted
  mechanical engineer who unfortunately died one year before I met
  Denise, had advised her to marry a poor intellectual because he
  would likely be sufficiently ambitious to do interesting
  scholarship. Denise believed she was following that advice (she
  certainly married someone who was poor) and always encouraged me
  to make decisions that favored my doing science.</p>

  <p>In Grundfest's lab I spent the first
  several months working on a number of projects with Dominick
  Purpura, an independent young scientist just starting out on his
  own career of cortical physiology. To my surprise I found my
  first experience in a lab really interesting, and very different
  from the classroom. Of course the research questions we were
  asking fascinated me and the discussions were penetrating and
  enjoyable. Dominick was very bright and very entertaining. (I
  have referred to him as the Woody Allen of neurobiology.) But the
  actual performance of the experiments was also pleasurable and,
  when successful, very satisfying. Nevertheless, I began to worry
  about the methods we were using to address rather sophisticated
  questions about the electrical properties of dendrites. We were
  using evoked responses that were initiated by stimulating small
  areas of cortex, thereby activating thousands of neurons, and I
  thought these methods were too indirect to give easily
  interpretable results. Grundfest and Purpura, of course, were
  also concerned and talked repeatedly about doing direct
  intracellular recordings from cortical neurons, but neither
  thought this was likely to succeed.</p>

  <p><b>An introduction to Stephen
  Kuffler</b><br>
  It was in this frame of mind that I was introduced to Stephen
  Kuffler, a Viennese trained physician turned physiologist, who
  (together with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1970/index.html">Bernard Katz</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html">John Eccles</a>)
  was to become one of my great neurobiological heroes. One evening
  Grundfest threw into my lap the September 20, 1955 issue of the
  <i>Journal of General Physiology</i>, with three of Kuffler's
  papers on excitation and inhibition in the dendrites and soma of
  isolated sensory nerve cells of the lobster and crayfish.
  Grundfest said something about Kuffler's being very good, and
  that these papers provided direct evidence for the graded
  properties of dendrites evidence that was consistent with what he
  and Purpura were seeing in cortica; neurons. I took the issue
  home and read the papers as best I could. Although I understood
  relatively little, one thing stood out immediately. Kuffler was
  studying the dendrites in a preparation in which he actually saw
  the dendrites and could record from them directly. For studying
  dendrites Kuffler used an invertebrate sensory neuron that sent
  its dendrites into skeletal muscle much like the muscle spindles
  of vertebrates. In the introduction to the three papers Kuffler
  wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The greatest advantage of the present
    preparation lies in its accessibility, since all cellular
    components can be isolated and visually observed. Further, the
    state of excitability of the structures could be controlled and
    graded by utilizing the physiological mechanisms given by the
    stretch receptor nature of the preparation...</p>

    <p>It seems of special interest that the
    sensory cell of crustacea possessed numerous anatomical
    features, which bear a striking resemblance to many central
    nervous system cells of vertebrates."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I learned from Kuffler's papers a new
  criterion for how good science is done - the importance of having
  a preparation suitable to testing the questions to be answered.
  Kuffler taught me to respect the power of invertebrate
  neurobiology.</p>

  <p>On graduating from medical school in June
  1956, I married Denise and, after a brief honeymoon in
  Tanglewood, I started an internship at Montefiore Hospital as she
  continued her thesis research at Columbia. I returned to
  Grundfest's lab, spending six weeks with Stanley Crain, who had
  pioneered the electrophysiological study of nerve cells in tissue
  culture. Stanley taught me how to make microelectrodes and how to
  obtain and interpret intracellular recordings from the crayfish
  giant axon. These experiments confirmed the insights I had gained
  from reading Kuffler's paper. From Stanley I also received my
  first insights into the universality of cellular processes.</p>

  <p>Based on my two brief periods in his
  laboratory, Grundfest offered to nominate me for a position at
  the NIH, an
  alternative to serving in the physician's draft, which provided
  medical personnel for the military during the years following the
  Korean War. On the basis of Grundfest's recommendation, I was
  accepted by Wade Marshall, Chief of the Laboratory of
  Neurophysiology at NIMH/NINCDS.</p>

  <p><b>The laboratory of neurophysiology at the
  National Institutes of Health</b><br>
  By the time I arrived in Bethesda, Wade Marshall had passed the
  peak of what had been a remarkable career. In the 1930s he was
  arguably the most promising and accomplished young scientist
  working on the brain in the United States. As a graduate student
  at the University of Chicago in Ralph Gerard's lab in 1936,
  he discovered that one could record electrical deflections in the
  somatosensory processing area of the cerebral cortex by moving
  the hairs of a cat's limb. He appreciated that one might use this
  electrical signal (the evoked response) to map the representation
  of the body surface on the brain.</p>

  <p>To study this further, he joined Phillip
  Bard, Chairman of the Department of Physiology at the Johns Hopkins
  Medical School, as a post-doctoral fellow. In 1937, Bard had
  already established himself as a major presence in American
  neurophysiology. Together with his student Clinton Woolsey, Bard
  had surgically removed the somatic sensory cortex of the monkey
  and studied its effect on the "placing reaction," a form of
  tactile behavior. Marshall joined up with Woolsey and Bard and
  together they carried out a classic series of studies in which
  they mapped sensory inputs from the body surface in the somatic
  sensory cortex and showed that a topographical representation of
  the entire body is wired into the brain. This provided the first
  systematic view of the neural representation in the brain of a
  sensory system. Today, this map is still shown in every textbook
  of neural science. Marshall next collaborated with John Talbott
  and mapped the retinal inputs in the striate cortex. Finally,
  with Harlow W. Ades, he mapped the cochlear inputs in the
  auditory cortex.</p>

  <p>With these classic studies Marshall
  revolutionized the study of the sensory representations in the
  brain and showed that the brain had systematic topographical maps
  of the sensory surface for each of the three major sensations -
  touch, vision, and hearing. These marvelous scientific
  achievements came at a price, however, leaving Marshall so
  psychologically fatigued that he collapsed and, for a number of
  years, left science altogether. When he returned, in about 1945,
  he moved on to a completely new problem: the study of spreading
  cortical depression, a propagating, reversible silencing of
  cortical electrical activity. Marshall enjoyed doing occasional
  experiments, but he had lost his scientific drive and now focused
  much of his energy and interests on administrative matters, which
  he did well. Although eccentric, moody, and somewhat
  unpredictable, he was a wonderful lab chief. In particular, he
  was supportive and generous to young scientists and gave us a
  great deal of freedom.</p>

  <p>Just before I arrived at NIH in 1957, the
  neurosurgeon William Scoville and the cognitive psychologist
  Brenda Milner had described the now-famous patient H.M. In order
  to treat intractable bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, Scoville
  had removed on both sides of H.M.'s brain the medial temporal
  lobes, including a structure deep to them called the hippocampus.
  As a result of this procedure, H.M.'s seizures were largely
  eliminated. But, while retaining all cognitive functions, H.M.
  lost the ability to put new information into long-term memory.
  These findings pinpointed the medial temporal lobe and the
  hippocampus as sites specialized for memory storage.</p>

  <p>Until the Scoville and Milner paper, the
  person most identified with attempts to localize memory was Karl
  Lashley, Professor of Psychology at Harvard and perhaps
  the dominant figure in American neuropsychology in the first half
  of the 20th century. Lashley explored the surface of the cerebral
  cortex in the rat, and systematically removed different cortical
  areas. In so doing, he failed to identify any particular brain
  region that was special to or necessary for the storage of
  memory. Based on these experiments, Lashley formulated the law of
  mass action, according to which memory is not localized to any
  specific region of the cortex but was a distributed property of
  the cortex as a whole. The extent of any memory defect, Lashley
  argued, was correlated with the size of the cortical area
  removed, not with its specific location.</p>

  <p>Since I had already begun to think about
  problems in psychiatry and psychoanalysis in biological terms,
  the cell and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory struck
  me as a wonderful problem to study. I had first become interested
  in the study of learning at Harvard, where B.F. Skinner, the
  great behaviorist, was a dominant force in the 1950s. It was
  clear to me even then that learning and memory were central to
  behavior, and thus to psychopathology and to psychotherapy.
  Nothing was known about the cellular mechanisms of learning and
  memory, and now the cellular techniques for studying them were
  just becoming available - some beginnings of which I had learned
  from Stanley Crain in Grundfest's lab.</p>

  <p>My initial ideas about how to tackle the
  biology of memory upon arrival at the NIH were confused and
  vague. Because intracellular recordings seemed to me such a
  powerful analytic tool for studying nerve cells, and because the
  hippocampus seemed particularly important for memory, I wanted to
  explore the hippocampus in cellular terms. This was made even
  more attractive for me because, as the great Spanish anatomists
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/index.html">Ram&oacute;n y
  Cajal</a> and Lorente de N&oacute; had pointed out, the cellular
  architecture of the hippocampus is remarkably conserved among
  mammals, and the main cell type, the pyramidal cell, is found in
  a discrete layer that is easy to target with microelectrodes. In
  addition, the pyramidal cells send their axons into a large fiber
  tract (the fornix), which allows the pyramidal cells to be
  identified electrophysiologically by stimulating the axons in the
  fornix and backfiring the pyramidal cells. I thought it would be
  interesting to compare the pyramidal neurons to the only other
  mammalian neurons that had been well studied at that time - the
  motor neurons of the spinal cord. I had the idea that the
  properties of the pyramidal cells themselves might reveal
  something about memory storage. I was emboldened to try this
  technically demanding study because Karl Frank was in the
  laboratory next to ours, pioneering the examination of spinal
  motor neurons with intracellular recordings in parallel with John
  Eccles. Although Frank himself thought that studying the
  hippocampus was chancy, he was not discouraging.</p>

  <p>Almost as soon as I began, my research took
  an extremely fortunate turn in the person of Alden Spencer, who
  arrived in Marshall's lab having just graduated from the University of Oregon
  Medical School. Like me, Alden was becoming interested in the
  biology of learning and memory. It therefore took little effort
  for me to convince him that we should join forces on the
  hippocampus. Although Alden had no experience with intracellular
  recordings, he had done electrophysiological research on the
  brain at the University of Oregon Medical School, where he worked
  with John Brookhardt. Among Alden's many remarkable talents, he
  had good surgical skills and a fine knowledge of the anatomical
  organization of the mammalian brain.</p>

  <p>Being both na&iuml;ve and brash, we were
  not reluctant to tackle what appeared to Frank and others to be
  technically difficult problems, namely obtaining intracellular
  recordings from cortical neurons in a pulsating brain. Alden and
  I developed a simple way of reducing pulsations in the
  hippocampus that allowed us to obtain, on occasion, high-quality
  recordings for a long enough period - up to one hour - to carry
  out an initial analysis of the electrical properties of the
  hippocampal pyramidal cells. By applying to the hippocampus the
  powerful methodologies we learned from Frank, we easily picked
  some low-lying intellectual fruit. First, we found that action
  potentials in hippocampal neurons were initiated not only at the
  axon hillock, as in motor neurons, but also at a second site,
  which we inferred to be the apical dendrites. These putative
  dendritic action potentials, which we called fast prepotentials,
  appeared to trigger the firing at the axon hillock. Second, we
  found that the hippocampal neurons, unlike motor neurons, were
  not silent in the absence of synaptic activity, but tended to
  fire spontaneously, and that this firing often took the form of
  bursts of spikes that were maintained by summation of
  depolarizing afterpotentials. Third, we found that the
  hippocampal neurons engaged a powerful recurrent inhibitory
  system that gave rise to a prolonged inhibition - several orders
  of magnitude longer than the inhibition seen in the spinal
  cord.</p>

  <p>The mere technical success of obtaining
  intracellular recordings from hippocampal neurons, and the few
  interesting questions we were able to address, caught the
  enthusiastic attention of, and drew encouragement and help from,
  our senior colleagues at the NIH - Marshall, Frank, Michael
  Fuortes, Frank's gifted colleague and the great Japanese-American
  biophysicist Ichiji Tasaki. When John Eccles visited the NIH, he
  also was generous in his comments. But even in our brashest
  moments, we both realized that ours was a typical NIH story. In
  the Intramural Program at the NIH, young inexperienced people
  were given the opportunity to try things on their own, knowing
  that wherever they turned there were experienced people to help
  out.</p>

  <p>Moreover, as Alden and I reviewed our work
  we realized that the cellular properties of hippocampal neurons
  were not sufficiently different from those of spinal neurons to
  explain the ability of the hippocampus to store memory. Thus, it
  dawned on us what in retrospect is quite obvious: that the
  neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory probably did not
  reside in the properties of the neurons themselves. Rather,
  because the signaling properties of neurons are quite alike, we
  began to think that what must matter is how neurons are
  functionally connected. The basis of learning must reside in the
  modification of interconnections by appropriate sensory signals.
  This conclusion, so clear in retrospect, emerged only gradually
  as we learned, mostly through reading and discussions with one
  another, to think more effectively about the biology of learning
  and memory.</p>

  <p>This realization led us to reappraise our
  strategy. Since the hippocampus has a large number of neurons and
  an immense number of interconnections, it was not the place to
  begin. Even though we were now quite familiar with the
  hippocampus, it would be extremely difficult to work out how
  sensory information specific to learning reached the hippocampus
  or how learned information processed by the hippocampus might
  influence motor output.</p>

  <p>Alden and I therefore became convinced that
  to make headway with the study of learning at the cellular level
  required a very different approach. Alden, a committed mammalian
  neurophysiologist, turned to the study of the spinal cord,
  particularly the modifiability of spinal reflexes, and went on to
  make important contributions in collaboration with Richard
  Thompson.</p>

  <p>However, even the spinal cord proved too
  difficult for a detailed cellular analysis, and both Alden and
  Thompson ended up leaving it.</p>

  <p><b>The search for a tractable system for
  studying learning</b><br>
  Influenced by Kuffler, Grundfest, and Crain, I yearned for a more
  radically reductionist approach to the biology of learning and
  memory. I wanted a system that would serve the cellular study of
  learning as well as the squid giant axon had served for studies
  of the action potential, or the nerve-muscle synapse of the frog
  had served for the study of synaptic transmission. I wanted to
  examine learning in an experimental animal in which a simple
  behavior was modifiable by learning. Ideally that behavior should
  be controlled by only a small number of large and accessible
  nerve cells, so that the animal's overt behavior could be related
  to events occurring in the cells that control that behavior.</p>

  <p>Such a reductionist approach has been
  traditional in biology. In neurobiology it is exemplified by the
  work on the squid giant axon by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html">Hodgkin</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html">Huxley</a>, the
  nerve-muscle synapse of the frog by Bernard Katz, and the eye of
  <i>Limulus</i> by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/index.html">Keefer Hartline</a>. When
  it came to the study of behavior, however, most investigators
  were reluctant to apply a strict reductionist strategy. In the
  1950s and 1960s it was often said that behavior was the area in
  biology in which simple animal models, particularly invertebrate
  ones, were least likely to produce fruitful results because the
  brain that really learns, the mammalian brain, especially the
  human brain, is so complex that inferences from studies of
  invertebrates would not stand up. It was thought that humans,
  because of higher-order capabilities not found in simpler
  animals, must have types of neuronal organization that are
  qualitatively different from those found in invertebrates.
  Although these arguments held some truth, they overlooked certain
  critical issues. Work by students of comparative behavior, such
  as <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html">Konrad
  Lorenz</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html">Niko
  Tinbergen</a>, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html">Karl von Frisch</a>, had
  already shown that certain behavior patterns, including
  elementary forms of learning, were common to humans and simple
  animals. From the outset I therefore believed that the mechanisms
  of memory storage were likely to be conserved in phylogeny, and
  that a cellular analysis of learning in a simple animal would
  reveal universal mechanisms that are also employed in more
  complex organisms.</p>

  <p>Not surprisingly, I was strongly
  discouraged in the early days from pursuing this strategy by some
  senior researchers in neurobiology, particularly John Eccles. His
  concern reflected, in part, the existing hierarchy of acceptable
  research questions in neurobiology. Few self-respecting
  neurophysiologists, I was told, would leave the study of learning
  in mammals to work on an invertebrate. Was I compromising my
  career? Of an even greater concern to me were the doubts
  expressed by some very knowledgeable psychologists I knew, who
  were sincerely skeptical that anything interesting about learning
  and memory could be found in a simple invertebrate animal. I had
  made up my mind, however. Since we knew nothing about the cell
  biology of learning and memory, I believed that any insight into
  the modification of behavior by experience, no matter how simple
  the animal or the task, would prove to be highly informative.</p>

  <p>After an extensive search that included
  crayfish, lobster, flies, and the nematode worm <i>Ascaris</i>, I
  settled on <i>Aplysia</i>, the giant marine snail. <i>Aplysia</i>
  offered three major technical advantages: (1) its nervous system
  has a small number of cells, (2) the cells are unusually large,
  and, as I realized with time, (3) many of the cells are invariant
  and identifiable as unique individuals. Before leaving the NIH in
  1960, I arranged with Ladislav Tauc, one of the two people in the
  world then working on <i>Aplysia</i>, to join him in September
  1962, as a postdoctoral fellow, as soon as I had completed my
  residency training. Here again, Denise's advice was decisive. The
  only two people working on <i>Aplysia</i> were French - Tauc's
  lab was in Paris, and Angelique Arvanitaki-Chalazonitis worked in
  Marseilles. So far so good! But, Denise, ever the Parisian
  chauvinist, thought that living in Marseilles would be like
  living in Albany (a small town in upstate New York). So Tauc and
  Paris it was, and that proved an excellent choice.</p>

  <p><b>Residency training in psychiatry at the
  Harvard Medical School</b><br>
  However, before I would leave for Paris I had already committed
  to a two-year residency training in psychiatry. I therefore left
  the NIH in the spring of 1960 to start my psychiatric residency
  at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center of the Harvard Medical
  School. When I arrived at Harvard, I found an unanticipated
  bonus. Steven Kuffler, whose thinking had so influenced my own,
  had been recruited one year earlier from Johns Hopkins to build
  up neurophysiology at Harvard. Kuffler brought with him several
  young post-doctoral fellows - <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1981/index.html">David Hubel</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1981/index.html">Torsten Wiesel</a>, Ed
  Furshpan, and David Potter - each of whom was extraordinarily
  gifted. In this way Kuffler succeeded, in one fell swoop, in
  setting up at Harvard the premier group of neural scientists in
  the country. I now had my first opportunity to interact with
  Kuffler and with the remarkable people he had assembled around
  him. Even though I was in fulltime residency training, Kuffler
  and his group were extremely accessible, and their generosity
  allowed me to remain intellectually engaged in neurobiology.
  Moreover, Jack Ewalt, the Professor of Psychiatry at the
  Massachusetts Mental Health Center, provided me with funds and
  space so that I even managed to do some research in my spare
  time. I obtained the first intracellular recording from
  hypothalamic neuro-endocrine cells and found that these
  hormone-releasing cells had all the electrical properties of
  normal nerve cells.</p>

  <p>During my psychiatric residency I began to
  think about simple forms of learning in preparation for work on
  <i>Aplysia</i>. I read Kimble's wonderful revision of Hilgard and
  Marquis's classical text <i>Conditioning and Learning</i>, and I
  reread Skinner's great book <i>The Behavior of Organisms</i>.
  This reading made me realize that the paradigms of simple
  learning articulated by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1904/index.html">Pavlov</a> and Thorndyke,
  describing changes in behavior in response to controlled
  stimulation, included precise protocols for stimulating
  experimental animals. It occurred to me that the paradigms they
  described - habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning,
  and operant conditioning - could readily be adapted to
  experiments with an isolated <i>Aplysia</i> ganglion using
  artificial electrical rather than natural sensory stimuli. While
  recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion, one nerve
  axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly
  electrically as a conditioned stimulus, while another pathway was
  stimulated as an unconditioned stimulus, following the exact
  protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in
  intact animals. One could then see whether synapses changed
  systematically in response to these patterns of stimulation, and,
  if so, whether the synaptic changes in any way paralleled changes
  in the overt behavior of intact animals, which classical
  psychologists had described. It thus dawned on me that in this
  way one could begin to take an initial step toward the study of
  learning in the intact animal by analyzing what I soon began to
  call <i>analogs of learning</i> - higher-order stimulus sequences
  based on patterns of stimulation used in learning experiments in
  intact behaving organisms, but applied directly to a neuronal
  system.</p>

  <p><b>Paris, Aplysia, and neural analogs of
  learning: chemical synapses prove to be remarkably
  plastic</b><br>
  Based on this idea, I wrote a successful application for an
  NINCDS postdoctoral fellowship for work to be done in Tauc's
  laboratory. And in September 1962, about a year after our son
  Paul was born, the three of us took off for Paris. Tauc proved an
  excellent person to work with; both our interests and our areas
  of competence complemented each other. He was, of course,
  completely at home with <i>Aplysia</i>, but he also had a strong
  background in physics and biophysics, which I lacked. Born in
  Czechoslovakia, Tauc had originally studied the electrical
  properties of plant cells. As a result, he had no experience with
  behavior and had up to this point thought little about the
  problems of neuronal integration that dominated thinking about
  the mammalian brain - problems that Alden and I had discussed
  incessantly. Tauc was quite enthusiastic about my approach, which
  proved even more effective than anticipated. In my cellular
  studies of analogs of habituation, sensitization, and classical
  conditioning in <i>Aplysia</i>, I found synaptic changes that
  paralleled the behavioral changes seen in experiments on intact
  animals. This encouraged us to write in our 1965 paper in the
  <i>British Journal of Physiology</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The fact that the EPSPs (excitatory postsynaptic
    potentials) can be facilitated for over half-an-hour with an
    input pattern scheme designed to simulate a behavioral
    conditioning paradigm, also suggests that the concomitant
    changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission may underlie
    certain simple forms of information storage in the intact
    animal."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>A brief return to the Harvard Medical
  School</b><br>
  Upon completing a very productive 16-month stay in Tauc's
  laboratory, I returned to Harvard in November 1963. More than a
  year and a half later, in July of 1965, our daughter Minouche was
  born, completing our family - one boy, one girl - exactly what we
  had hoped for.</p>

  <p>During this period I struggled with three
  choices that were to have a profound effect on my subsequent
  career. First, I realized that to do effective science I could
  not combine basic research and a clinical practice in
  psychoanalysis, as I had earlier hoped. I therefore decided not
  to apply to the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, a decision which
  meant that I would not attempt to become a psychoanalyst but
  devote myself full-time to science. It was my strong sense that
  one of the problems within academic psychiatry, a problem that
  has become only worse with time, is that young people take on
  much more than they can handle effectively. I concluded that I
  could not and would not do that.</p>

  <p>The second choice arose a few months later
  when Dr. Ewalt and Dr. Howard Hiatt, then chairmen of the
  Department of Medicine at the Beth Israel Hospital at Harvard,
  suggested that I take on the newly vacated chairmanship of the
  Department of Psychiatry at the Beth Israel Hospital. For a
  moment I was forced to rethink my decision to focus full time on
  science. The person who had just left that position, Grete
  Bibring, was a leading psychoanalyst who had been a colleague of
  Marianne and Ernst Kris in Vienna. Earlier in my life achieving
  this position would have represented my highest aspiration. But
  by 1965, my thinking had moved in a very different direction, and
  I decided against it with Denise's strong encouragement. (Denise
  summarized it simply: 'What?" she said, "throw your scientific
  career away?") Instead, I made my third decision. I decided to
  leave Harvard and accept an invitation to start a small
  neurophysiology group focused specifically on the neurobiology of
  behavior in the Departments of Physiology and Psychiatry at the
  New York University Medical School.</p>

  <p>Harvard was quite wonderful, and it was not
  easy to leave that intellectually heady neurobiology environment.
  My interaction with Kuffler had increased after my return from
  Paris and, until his death in 1980, Kuffler proved a marvelous
  friend and counselor. Moreover, my interactions during this
  period with members of Kuffler's group - Hubel, Wiesel, Furshpan,
  Potter, and Ed Kravitz, a biochemist who joined them later - were
  extensive and I learned much from them. Many years later, at a
  small meeting at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole
  in honor of Steve Kuffler, I was surrounded by Steve's Harvard
  entourage, some of whom were struggling with the decision of
  whether to leave Harvard for attractive positions elsewhere. I
  could not resist beginning my lecture with the remark, "I am here
  as living proof that there is life after Harvard."</p>

  <p><b>New York University and a focus on the
  behavior of Aplysia</b><br>
  The position at N.Y.U. had several great attractions that, in the
  long run, proved critical. First, it brought us back to New York
  and closer to my parents and to Denise's mother, all of whom were
  having medical problems that benefited from our being nearby.
  Second, N.Y.U. gave me the opportunity to recruit an additional
  senior neurophysiologist, and Alden Spencer agreed to move to
  N.Y.U. from the University of Oregon Medical School where he had
  returned after his stay at the NIH, and to occupy the laboratory
  next to mine. Although Alden and I never collaborated
  experimentally again, we talked daily not only about our science
  - the neurobiology of behavior - but also about almost everything
  else, until his untimely early death at age 46 from amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis in 1977, when we had already moved to Columbia
  University. During the period he was alive, no one influenced my
  thinking on matters of science as much as Alden. I still think
  about him frequently.</p>

  <p>Alden and I arrived at N.Y.U. together in
  the winter of 1965. Within a year we were joined by a biochemist,
  James H. Schwartz, whom I had first met in the summer of 1951 at
  Harvard summer school and who was now a member of the Department
  of Microbiology at N.Y.U. and was becoming interested in
  behavior. The three of us formed the nucleus of the Division of
  Neurobiology and Behavior at N.Y.U.</p>

  <p>With several important decisions behind me,
  I made a strong effort to focus on whole-animal behavior. In
  France I had found that chemical synapses are remarkably plastic;
  they could readily undergo long-lasting changes in strength. But
  I had no evidence that these analogs of learning were in fact
  behaviorally meaningful. I had no reason to believe that these
  are the sorts of changes that actually occur when an animal
  learns something. Although during my last few weeks in France I
  had begun to replicate my results by substituting natural stimuli
  for electrical stimulation of nerves, I still had not shown that
  synaptic plasticity actually occurred during behavioral learning.
  As a first step I thought it essential to show that
  <i>Aplysia</i> was capable of learning. With this in mind, I set
  about recruiting a postdoctoral fellow with a specific interest
  in behavioral learning. I was fortunate to recruit, first to
  Harvard and then to N.Y.U., Irving Kupfermann, an extremely
  critical and thoughtful student of behavior. We were later joined
  by another learning psychologist, Harold Pinsker, and together we
  set about delineating a very simple behavior that we could study:
  the gill-withdrawal reflex. We quickly found that this simple
  reflex could readily be modified by two forms of learning:
  habituation and sensitization.</p>

  <p>As we explored the two forms of learning,
  we focused on short-term memory. In 1971, we were joined by
  another experienced behavioral psychologist, Tom Carew, who
  brought a new level of energy and insight to our behavioral
  studies. He arrived as Pinsker was leaving, and soon after we
  shifted from working with restrained to unrestrained animals,
  thus opening up the study of long-term memory. Tom found that
  spaced repetition converted the memory for short-term habituation
  and sensitization to longer-lasting memories. In 1981, after
  several unsuccessful attempts, Carew, Terry Walters, Tom Abrams,
  and Robert Hawkins finally were able to define the conditions for
  reliably producing classical conditioning in <i>Aplysia</i>. This
  was a particularly exciting period; Carew, Walters, Hawkins, and
  I met regularly to discuss how to explore whether a simple
  reflex, in a simple invertebrate, could show the higher-order
  cognitive features of classical conditioning recently
  demonstrated in mammals by Leo Kamin and somewhat later by Robert
  Rescorla and Alan Wagner. Soon, Hawkins indeed was able to
  demonstrate that the gill-withdrawal reflex can undergo
  second-order conditioning, blocking, overshadowing and other
  cognitive aspects of associative learning, features that were
  surprising to uncover in such a simple behavior.</p>

  <p>We thus were able to describe a rather rich
  repertory of learning in <i>Aplysia</i>. But long before this
  inventory of the animal's behavior was complete, we returned to
  our initial concerns. What happens in the brain of an animal when
  it actually learns a task? How does it remember? We proceeded,
  first with Kupfermann and Vincent Castellucci and then with Jack
  Byrne and Hawkins, to work out most of the neural circuit of the
  gill-withdrawal reflex. We identified specific sensory neurons
  and motor cells that produced movements of the gill. Next, we
  found that the sensory neurons made direct connections to the
  motor neurons as well as indirect connections through
  interneurons, both excitatory and inhibitory. The aversive tail
  stimuli that produced sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex
  activated modulatory interneurons that acted on terminals of the
  sensory neurons. We now could turn to think about how learning
  might occur in this reflex.</p>

  <p><b>Cellular mechanisms of
  learning</b><br>
  At the end of the 19th century Ram&oacute;n y Cajal introduced the
  principle of connection specificity, according to which, during
  development, a neuron will form connections only with certain
  neurons and not with others. Kupfermann, Castellucci, and I saw
  in the circuitry of the gill-withdrawal reflex of <i>Aplysia</i>
  this remarkable regularity of connections that Cajal referred to
  and we saw, in exquisite detail, that specific identified cells
  made invariant connections to one another. But this invariant
  organization of neurons posed deep questions. How could we
  reconcile hardwired circuits in the nervous system and the
  specificity of connections with the animal's capability for
  learning? Once acquired, where or how is learned information
  retained in the nervous system?</p>

  <p>One solution was proposed by Ram&oacute;n y
  Cajal in his Croonian Lecture to the Royal Society of
  London in 1894 when he suggested that "... mental exercise
  facilitates a greater development of the protoplasmic apparatus
  and of the nervous collaterals in the part of the brain in use.
  In this way, pre-existing connections between groups of cells
  could be reinforced by multiplication of the terminal branches of
  protoplasmic appendices and nervous collaterals."</p>

  <p>This remarkably prescient idea was by no
  means generally accepted. On the contrary, different theories of
  learning at various times held the attention of neural
  scientists. Two decades after Ram&oacute;n y Cajal's proposal, the
  physiologist Alexander Forbes suggested that memory is sustained
  not by changes in synaptic strength of the sort suggested by
  Ram&oacute;n y Cajal, but by dynamic changes resulting from
  reverberating activity within a closed loop of self-exciting
  neurons. This idea was elaborated by Ram&oacute;n y Cajal's
  student, Rafael Lorente de N&oacute;, who found in his own and in
  Ram&oacute;n y Cajal's analyses of neural circuitry neurons that
  were interconnected in closed pathways and could thereby sustain
  reverberatory activity, thus providing a dynamic mechanism for
  information storage. In his influential book <i>The Organization
  of Behavior</i> (1949), D.O. Hebb proposed that a "coincident
  activity" initiated the growth of new synaptic connections as
  part of long-term memory storage. But for short-term memory, Hebb
  invoked a reverberatory circuit:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"To account for permanence, some structural change seems
    necessary, but structural growth presumably would require an
    appreciable time. If some way can be found of supposing that a
    reverberatory trace might cooperate with the structural change,
    and carry the memory until the growth change is made, we should
    be able to recognize the theoretical value of the trace, which
    is an activity only without having to ascribe all memory to it.
    The conception of a transient, unstable reverberatory trace is
    therefore useful. It is possible to suppose also some more
    permanent structural change reinforces it."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Similarly, in <i>The Mammalian Cerebral
  Cortex</i>, an influential book of 1958, B. Deslisle Burns
  challenged the relevance of synaptic plasticity to memory.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The mechanisms of synaptic facilitation which have been
    offered as candidates for an explanation of memory ... have
    proven disappointing. Before any of them can be accepted as the
    cellular changes accompanying conditioned reflex formation, one
    would have to extend considerably the scale of time on which
    they have been observed to operate. The persistent failure of
    synaptic facilitation to explain memory makes one wonder
    whether neurophysiologists have not been looking for the wrong
    kind of mechanisms."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Indeed, some scholars even minimized the
  importance of specific neuronal connections in the brain,
  advocating instead mechanisms of learning that were partially or
  even totally independent of "pre-established" conduction
  pathways. This view was held by Wolfgang Kohler and the famous
  Gestalt psychologists, and subsequently by the neurophysiologists
  Ross Adey and Frank Morrell. Thus, in 1965, Adey wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"No neuron in natural or artificial isolation from other
    neurons has been shown capable of storing information in the
    usual notion of memory. ... In particular, the possibility
    exists that extraneuronal compartments may participate
    importantly in the modulation of the wave process that
    characterize the intracellular records, and that these wave
    processes may rank at least equivalently with neuronal firing
    in the transaction of information and even more importantly in
    its deposition and recall."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Finally, there were memory macromolecular
  notions advocated by Holger Hyden, based upon his finding of
  changes in the nucleotide composition of RNA. He proposed that
  learning gave rise to a specific pattern of instructional neural
  activity that altered the stability of RNA molecules, so that one
  base can exchange for another. In this way, new RNA molecules are
  formed with new base sequences that are specific to the
  instructing pattern of neural activity induced by learning.
  Hyden's hypothesis thus implied that the patterns of stimulation
  activated by learning could introduce changes in RNA.</p>

  <p>We were now therefore in a position to test
  experimentally which, if any, of these ideas had merit. Using the
  gill-withdrawal reflex, we quickly established that memory in the
  <i>Aplysia</i> nervous system is not represented in self-exciting
  loops of neurons but in changes in synaptic strength. We found
  that all three simple forms of learning - habituation,
  sensitization, and classical conditioning - lead to changes in
  the synaptic strength of specific sensory pathways, and that
  these changes parallel the time course of the memory process.
  These findings, which had been fully anticipated by our earlier
  studies of analogs of learning, gave rise to one of the major
  themes in our thinking about the molecular mechanisms of memory
  storage. Even though the anatomical connections between neurons
  develop according to a definite plan, the strength and
  effectiveness of those connections is not fully determined
  developmentally and can be altered by experience.</p>

  <p>We therefore concluded the third of our
  1970 series of consecutive papers in Science on the cellular
  mechanisms of learning with the following comments:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"... the data indicate that habituation and dishabituation
    (sensitization) both involve a change in the functional
    effectiveness of previously existing excitatory connections.
    Thus, at least in the simple cases, it seems unnecessary to
    explain the behavioral modifications by invoking electrical and
    chemical fields or a unique statistical distribution in a
    neural aggregate. The capability for behavioral modification
    seems to be built directly into the neural architecture of the
    behavioral reflex.</p>

    <p>Finally, these studies strengthen the assumption ... that a
    prerequisite for studying behavioral modification is the
    analysis of the wiring diagram underlying the behavior. We
    have, indeed, found that once the wiring diagram of the
    behavior is known, the analysis of its modification becomes
    greatly simplified. Thus, although this analysis pertains to
    only relatively simple and short-term behavioral modifications,
    a similar approach may perhaps also be applied to more complex
    as well as longer lasting learning processes."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>A beginning molecular analysis of memory
  storage</b><br>
  Having defined a critical site of plasticity, the situation
  became ripe for a molecular analysis. Here again I could not have
  been more fortunate. As I mentioned earlier, soon after I arrived
  at N.Y.U. I ran into James Schwartz. Jimmy had attended N.Y.U.
  Medical School two years behind me, but we had not really talked
  since I left N.Y.U. in 1956. After medical school Jimmy obtained
  a Ph.D. with Fritz Lipmann at the Rockefeller
  University, studying enzyme mechanisms and protein
  translation in cell-free bacteria extracts. As he and I began to
  talk again, he mentioned that he was thinking of moving from
  <i>E. coli</i> to the brain. <i>Aplysia</i> seemed ideal for
  biochemical study of individual nerve cells, so in 1966, Schwartz
  and I joined forces to carry out biochemical studies on
  individual identified nerve cells of <i>Aplysia</i>.</p>

  <p>Jimmy soon showed that each nerve cell in
  <i>Aplysia</i> had a specific transmitter biochemistry. Cells
  that we had presumed on pharmacological grounds to be cholinergic
  did in fact synthesize and release acetylcholine. With time,
  Jimmy became interested in the molecular mechanisms of synaptic
  plasticity, and together we began to examine the role of protein
  synthesis in memory storage. We knew from the work of Louis
  Flexner and Bernard Agranoff in the mid 1960s that long-term
  memory in vertebrates required protein synthesis whereas
  short-term memory did not. In our first study together in 1971,
  we found that blocking protein synthesis for 24 hours did not
  prevent the short-term synaptic changes associated with
  habituation and sensitization. That finding made us think that
  short-term changes representing memory storage might involve
  activation of a second-messenger pathway, for example, the cyclic
  AMP (cAMP) cascade, whose actions might persist for periods
  longer than the millisecond duration of conventional synaptic
  actions.</p>

  <p>In the discussion of our 1971 paper on the
  role of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, we wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Alterations in molecular configuration would not be
    expected to persist for long periods of time, although
    molecular changes lasting for several minutes have been
    observed. ... Most likely, the biochemical mechanisms
    underlying these short-term plastic changes are composed of a
    series of sequential reactions which result in a new
    distribution of transmitter substance. Mechanisms involving
    cyclic 3',5'AMP might serve as one example of a series of
    reactions which result in transient enhancement in the activity
    of a critical enzyme system. A pathway of this kind might
    trigger the mobilization of transmitter from one component (a
    long term store) to another (an immediately releasable
    store).</p>

    <p>... If our conclusion is correct, ... rapidly synthesized
    RNA cannot immediately play a role in neuronal functions; it
    might however, be important for long-term neuronal
    processes."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Sutherland and Rall had already shown in
  brain slices that several neurotransmitters known to exist in the
  brain could increase the concentrations of cAMP by activating the
  enzyme adenylyl cyclase that converted ATP to cAMP. We
  appreciated that we had a particularly good experimental
  preparation for examining, on the cellular level, the role of
  second-messenger pathways in synaptic transmission, synaptic
  plasticity, and memory storage. In 1972, Schwartz, Howard Cedar,
  and I found that stimulation of the pathway involved in
  sensitization increased the level of cAMP in the entire abdominal
  ganglion. Schwartz and Cedar next found that the transmitter
  serotonin could also increase cAMP, providing the initial
  evidence that serotonin might activate an adenylyl cyclase in
  <i>Aplysia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Columbia University and the molecular
  analysis of short-term memory</b><br>
  It was at this time that I was invited to move from N.Y.U. to the
  Columbia University College of
  Physicians and Surgeons to become the founding director of
  the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. I was able to persuade
  James Schwartz, Alden Spencer, and Irving Kupfermann (who was by
  then an Associate Professor, having established an independent
  research program concerned with feeding and motivational state in
  <i>Aplysia</i>) to join me. This move was attractive to me for
  several reasons. Historically, Columbia has had a strong
  tradition in neurology and psychiatry, and a friend and former
  clinical teacher, Lewis Rowland, was about to assume the
  chairmanship of the Department of Neurology. In addition, I had
  my first experience in neurobiology at Columbia with Harry
  Grundfest who was now retiring and I was being recruited to
  replace him. Finally, Denise was on the Columbia faculty and our
  house in Riverdale was near Columbia, thereby greatly simplifying
  our lives.</p>

  <p>In 1974, just after arriving at Columbia,
  Castellucci and I went back to the elementary circuit of the
  gill-withdrawal reflex to determine the exact site of the
  synaptic change produced by short-term sensitization. We wanted
  to know which component of the synapse changes. Is it, as we
  suspected, based on indirect evidence, the presynaptic element of
  the synapse where chemical transmitter is released, or is it the
  postsynaptic site which contains the receptors which bind and
  respond to the transmitter? Using a quantal analysis, we found
  that the synaptic facilitation characteristic of sensitization is
  presynaptic and that inhibitors of serotonin block this
  presynaptic facilitation. Later, Hawkins and I found that tail
  stimuli that initiate sensitization activate a set of modulatory
  interneurons, the most important of which are serotonergic. The
  serotonergic and other modulatory interneurons all acted on the
  sensory neurons and on their presynaptic terminals to enhance
  transmitter release from their presynaptic terminals. We could
  now ask for the first time: Was cAMP directly involved in
  facilitation? In 1976, Marcello Brunelli could take advantage of
  the size of the <i>Aplysia</i> neurons and inject cAMP directly
  into the presynaptic sensory cell and thereby find a clear
  enhancement of synaptic transmission. This cAMP-induced
  enhancement paralleled the enhancement produced by serotonin or
  tail stimulation.</p>

  <p>I now began to interact with Paul
  Greengard, who was demonstrating that cAMP produced its actions
  in the brain through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or PKA.
  In 1980, Schwartz, Castellucci, and I collaborated with
  Greengard. We injected a purified catalytic subunit of bovine PKA
  into presynaptic sensory neurons and found that it simulated the
  actions of cAMP or serotonin. Moreover, we could block the
  actions of serotonin by injecting into the sensory neuron the
  specific peptide inhibitor of PKA, protein kinase inhibitor PKI.
  With Steven Siegelbaum we next began to define some of the
  targets of PKA and focused on one target, a novel K+ channel.
  Steve showed that this channel is closed by serotonin and by PKA
  and that this closure is achieved in a manner consistent with the
  channel being phosphorylated directly by PKA.</p>

  <p><b>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and
  the molecular analysis of long-term memory</b><br>
  Just before I arrived at Columbia, Arnold Kriegstein, an
  M.D.-Ph.D. student, succeeded in culturing embryonic
  <i>Aplysia</i> in the N.Y.U. laboratory, a quest which had
  intrigued biologists and eluded their efforts for almost a
  century. Most of us who were there will not readily forget
  Kriegstein's extraordinary in-house seminar in December, 1973
  when he first described his discovery that the red seaweed
  <i>Laurencia pacifica</i> is required to trigger metamorphosis
  from a free-swimming veliger larva to a small crawling snail, a
  discovery that allowed him to show the first pictures of the
  beautiful tiny post-metamorphic juvenile <i>Aplysia</i>. I
  remember saying to myself. "Babies are always so beautiful!"
  Kriegstein's work opened up the study of development and cell
  culture in <i>Aplysia</i>.</p>

            <p>Because we now had young animals at all stages of development, 
              we at last had the essential requirements for the generation of 
              dissociated cell culture. This was taken on by Sam Schacher and 
              Eric Proshansky. With the help of Steven Rayport (another M.D.-Ph.D. 
              student at Columbia University), Schacher soon succeeded in culturing 
              the individual sensory neurons, motor neurons, and serotonergic 
              neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. The development of the culture 
              system coincided with two other events that allowed me to begin 
              studying the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory storage. The 
              first was my encounter with <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/index.html">Richard 
              Axel</a> and my collaboration in 1979, with him and with Richard 
              Scheller, who became a joint post-doctoral fellow. The second was 
              my being recruited to become a senior investigator at the Howard 
              Hughes Medical Institute.</p>

  <p>Axel and Scheller's success in 1982 in
  cloning the gene encoding the egglaying hormone in <i>Aplysia</i>
  seeded Axel's long-term interest in neurobiology and gave me not
  only a wonderful friend but also an exposure to the methods of
  recombinant DNA and modern molecular biology. The very next year,
  in 1983, Donald Fredrickson, the newly appointed President of the
  Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute, asked Schwartz, Axel,
  and me to form the nucleus of a Howard Hughes Medical Research
  Institute at Columbia devoted to molecular neural science. The
  Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute gave us the opportunity
  to recruit from Harvard both Tom Jessell and Gary Struhl, as well
  as to keep Steven Siegelbaum at Columbia.</p>

  <p>My first goal on becoming a Highes
  Investigator was to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying
  the synaptic changes that parallel long-term memory storage. In
  1885, Herman Ebbinghaus transformed speculation about memory into
  a laboratory science by having subjects memorize lists of
  nonsense syllables. In this way Ebbinghaus generated two basic
  principles about memory storage. First, he found that the
  transition from short-term memory to long-term memory is graded;
  practice makes perfect. Second, he anticipated the existence of a
  fundamental distinction between short- and long-term memory.</p>

  <p>What, then, was the molecular basis for
  this fundamental distinction between short- and long-term memory?
  As we have seen, in the mid-1960s Flexner and Agranoff examined
  this distinction biochemically and found that inhibitors of
  protein synthesis disrupt long-term memory without adversely
  affecting learning, or short-term memory. We found that long-term
  sensitization in <i>Aplysia</i> is similarly dependent on protein
  synthesis, whereas short-term sensitization is not. These
  findings illustrated the generality of the distinction between
  short-term and long-term memory processes for both invertebrates
  and vertebrates. In each case spaced repetition of the learning
  stimulus acts to transform a transient memory into a more stable
  (long-term) form by means of a process that depends on new
  protein synthesis. But how this occurred was a mystery.</p>

  <p>We had earlier found in <i>Aplysia</i> that
  long-term sensitization involved a persistent increase in the
  strength of the same synaptic connection altered by the shortterm
  process - the connections between the sensory and motor neurons
  of the gill-withdrawal reflex. To study this process more
  effectively we turned to dissociated cell culture and found that
  we could reconstitute both short- and long-term synaptic
  facilitation in a culture consisting of only a single sensory
  neuron and a single motor neuron. We did this together with Sam
  Schacher, Philip Goelet, and Pier Giorgio Montarolo by applying
  either one or five brief spaced pulses of serotonin to the
  sensory neuron and motor neuron in the culture dish. Much like
  behavioral long-term memory, the long-term synaptic changes
  required new protein synthesis while the short-term changes did
  not. Thus, we had trapped the protein synthesis-dependent
  component of memory storage in the elementary synaptic connection
  between two identified cells. We now could address directly the
  question: Why is protein synthesis required for long-term and not
  short-term facilitation? What are the molecular steps that switch
  on long-term facilitation and, once switched on, how is it
  maintained?</p>

  <p>We next found that steps for new proteins
  are activated by a cascade of genes initiated by the
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase. With repeated application of
  serotonin, PKA translocates to the nucleus and in so doing
  activates the MAP kinase (mitogen activated protein kinase),
  another kinase often recruited for growth. Thus, one of the
  functions of repeated stimulation was to cause both kinases to
  move into the nucleus. Pramod Dash and Binyamin Hochner and later
  Cristina Alberini, Mirella Ghirardi, and Dusan Bartsch provided
  the first evidence that in the nucleus, these kinases act on a
  gene regulator called CREB-1 (the <u>c</u>AMP <u>r</u>esponse
  <u>e</u>lement <u>b</u>inding proteins) to initiate a cascade of
  gene actions. With David Glanzman and Craig Bailey, we found that
  the CREB-mediated gene cascade which triggers the synthesis of
  new protein is required for the growth of new synaptic
  connections and it is the formation of these new synapses that
  sustains the long-term change.</p>

  <p>The requirement for transcription in
  long-term facilitation explained why long-term memory requires
  the synthesis of new proteins. However, this requirement now
  posed a cell-biological puzzle: if long-term synaptic change
  relies on the activation of genes in the nucleus, that means
  there is ready communication between the nucleus and the synapse.
  If that is so, must all such long-lasting changes in the
  signaling ability of the neuron be cell-wide? Or can long-term
  synaptic changes be restricted to individual synapses.
  Experiments by Kelsey Martin, based on a beautiful new cell
  culture system she developed, revealed that individual synapses
  or groups of synapses within a cell can be modified
  independently.</p>

  <p><b>A return to the hippocampus: genetically
  modified mice and the study of complex spatial memory
  storage</b><br>
  In our studies in <i>Aplysia</i> we focused on the simplest forms
  of memory, called implicit (or procedural) memory. These memories
  are concerned with the unconscious recall of perceptual and motor
  skills and do not require a hippocampus. The hippocampus is
  involved in explicit (or declarative) memory, memory for people,
  objects, or places, memories that require conscious participation
  for recall. For years I tried to encourage people who left my lab
  to turn their attention to the hippocampus, but to no avail.
  Finally in 1990, when I reached my 60th birthday, I returned to
  the study of the hippocampus myself. I was emboldened to do so in
  great part because of the development of methods for inserting
  and for knocking out individual genes in mice. This work made it
  clear to me that mice offered a superb genetic system for
  examining the role of individual genes in synaptic modification
  on the one hand, and intact behavior - explicit memory storage -
  on the other. Mice have a well developed medial temporal lobe and
  hippocampus, and these are important for explicit memory of
  objects and space. Moreover, in 1972, Tim Bliss and Terje Lomo in
  Per Andersen's laboratory in Oslo, had discovered that
  electrically stimulating any one of the three major pathways in
  the hippocampus gives rise to a synaptic facilitation, called
  long-term potentiation or LTP. We were interested in two
  questions: (1) What are the molecular signaling pathways that are
  important for LTP? (2) Is LTP important for explicit memory
  storage? In the move to genetically modified mice, the
  contributions of Seth Grant and Mark Mayford were particularly
  influential.</p>

  <p>Grant was the driving force in our first
  studies, in which we showed a role for nonreceptor tyrosine
  kinases in long-term potentiation, and in spatial memory in the
  hippocampus. Mayford's critical thinking became important
  somewhat later, as we began to realize the limitations in the
  first generation of genetically modified mice. The limitations
  stimulated Mayford to develop regionally restricted promoters
  that limited the expression of genes to only certain regions of
  the brain, and methods for controlling the timing of gene
  expression. Those two technical advances by Mayford proved
  important in allowing us, and Susumu Tonegawa (whose laboratory
  was now also focusing on studying memory in genetically modified
  mice), to generate mice whose phenotypes were more specific and
  in whom a genetic defect could be more readily interpreted than
  in the first generation of genetically modified mice because the
  defect could be related, somewhat more directly to specific
  synaptic changes and to behavior. Over the next few years
  Mayford, Ted Abel, Mark Barad, Isabelle Mansuy, Chris Pittenger,
  Amy Chen, and Angel Barco created a number of regionally
  restricted and regulated transgenic animals that allowed us to
  examine the role of the PKA- CREB-1 and CREB-2 and the protein
  synthesis-dependent transcriptional switch within the
  hippocampus, and to find that it was quite similar in principle
  to what we had encountered in <i>Aplysia</i>. Our lab and those
  of Alcino Silva and Dan Storm found that the cAMP, PKA, and CREB
  switch were required for long-term forms of synaptic plasticity
  in the hippocampus, was also required for spatial memory.</p>

  <p><b>A molecular approach to the cognitive
  map of space in the hippocampus: steps toward a molecular biology
  of attention</b><br>
  With this background information about genes, LTP, and spatial
  memory, we now could ask a deeper question: How does an animal
  learn about extrapersonal space? Why does spatial memory go awry
  with defects in PKA signaling? What is the function of the
  transcriptional switch? To address these questions, we turned to
  studying how space is represented in the hippocampus.</p>

  <p>One of the key insights to emerge from the
  study of higher cognitive functions is that each perceptual or
  motor act has an internal or neural representation in the brain.
  These representations can be either simple or complex. The
  simplest internal representations are those evident in the
  sensory systems where the afferent fibers are arranged as
  topographic maps of the receptor surface. These are the
  representations which Wade Marshall, my former mentor at the NIH,
  had discovered in the 1930s and early 1940s. Marshall showed that
  this map is most clearly evident in the neural representation of
  <i>personal space</i>, the representation of touch. The neural
  representation of the space surrounding the body, the
  <i>extrapersonal space</i>, is far more complex. Here the
  representation is not topographical but encoded in the pattern of
  firing of cells that do not have any specific topographic
  relation to one another with respect to the receptor surface.
  Thus, adjacent cells need not encode adjacent regions of
  extrapersonal space.</p>

  <p>This representation was discovered in 1971,
  by <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/okeefe-facts.html">John O'Keefe</a> at University College London, who made the brilliant
  observation that the hippocampus has a cognitive map - a complete
  representation of extrapersonal space. O'Keefe discovered that
  all the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, the very same cells
  that are used to study long-term potentiation have, as a natural
  function in the intact animal, the ability to encode space. He
  found that when an animal moves around in a familiar environment,
  different pyramidal cells in the hippocampus fire as the animal
  traverses different regions of the environment. This tendency is
  so marked that O'Keefe referred to the pyramidal cells as <i>place cells</i>. Some place cells may fire only when the
  animal's head enters one position in a given space. Other
  pyramidal cells will fire when the animal's head enters another
  position in the same space. Thus, a mouse's brain breaks up the
  space in which it walks into many small overlapping fields, and
  each field is assigned to specific cells in the hippocampus,
  forming a spatial map of the animal's surroundings. When the
  animal enters a new environment, a new place map is formed within
  minutes.</p>

  <p>These observations have given rise to the
  idea that the hippocampus contains a map-like representation of
  the animal's current extrapersonal environment, and that the
  firing of place cells in the hippocampus signals the animal's
  moment-to-moment location within the environment. This spatial
  map is the best-understood example of a complex internal
  representation in the brain, a true cognitive map. It differs in
  several ways from the classical sensory maps found by Wade
  Marshall for touch, vision, or hearing. Unlike sensory maps, the
  map of space is not topographic, that is, neighboring cells in
  the hippocampus do not represent neighboring regions in the
  environment. Furthermore, a place cell will fire in the same
  place regardless of what the animal is looking at. Moreover, the
  firing of place cells can persist after pertinent sensory cues
  are removed and even in the dark. Thus, although the activity of
  a place cell can be modulated by sensory input, it is not
  determined by sensory input as is the case for the activity of
  neurons in a sensory system. It appears that the place cells do
  not map the current sensory input, but the location where the
  animal thinks it is in space.</p>

  <p>Place fields are formed in minutes, and
  once formed the map to which they contribute can remain stable
  for weeks. It struck me in 1995 that formation of this internal
  representation - this cognitive map of space - was a learning
  process and that synaptic plasticity related to LTP might have a
  role in stabilizing this cognitive representation.</p>

  <p>Although place cells have been studied
  since 1971, nothing was known about the cellular or molecular
  mechanisms whereby new place fields are formed, and specifically
  no one had attempted to relate the biology of place cells to the
  molecular mechanisms of LTP or hippocampal-based memory. To
  explore this problem, I was fortunate to start a collaboration
  with Robert Muller at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who
  had pioneered the systematic study of place cells. This problem
  was taken on by Cliff Kentros, a postdoctoral fellow in my lab,
  by Naveen Agnihotri, a graduate student, and by Alex Rotenberg, a
  joint student with Muller and myself. Using a combination of
  pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrated a link
  between recruitment of PKA and protein synthesis on the one hand,
  and on the other, the long-term, but <i>not</i> short-term
  stability of the hippocampal representation of space. Thus, PKA
  and protein synthesis are required for longterm memories of
  extrapersonal space because that memory is based on a learned
  internal representation of space whose long-term stability
  requires PKA and new protein synthesis.</p>

  <p>This raised a final question: Explicit
  memory in humans differs from implicit memory in requiring
  conscious attention for recall. How does conscious attention come
  to bear on explicit memory? Indeed, how can one study
  consciousness in the mouse? In the course of our work on place
  fields, Kentros, Agnihotri, Hawkins, and I found that the
  long-term stability of the place field map correlated strongly
  with the degree to which the animal was required to attend to its
  environment. This demonstrates that, rather than being an
  implicit, automatic, process, the long-term recall of a stably
  formed place cell map requires the mouse to attend to its
  environment, as would be expected for explicit memory in human
  beings. The finding that attention, the recruitment of PKA, and
  new protein synthesis are required to form and recall a stable
  map in the mouse has opened up a molecular biological approach to
  an attentional process.</p>

  <p><b>From psychoanalysis to Aplysia to the
  role of attention in the cognitive representation of
  extrapersonal space</b><br>
  During the past 10 years my career has begun to come full circle.
  From an initial interest in the complex cognitive problems of
  psychoanalysis and memory storage, my research on memory led me
  first to the mammalian hippocampus, which proved too difficult as
  a first step and forced me to take a more reductionist approach
  and study initially the simplest forms of memory in
  <i>Aplysia</i>, and then, only much later, the more complex forms
  of memory in mice. I found that despite important differences in
  detail, simple implicit and explicit memories have a similar
  short- and long-term storage form. In each form, short-term
  storage requires covalent modification of pre-existing proteins
  leading to the alteration of pre-existing synaptic connections,
  whereas long-term memory storage requires gene activation, new
  protein synthesis, and the growth of new synaptic
  connections.</p>

  <p>In the course of this work we began to
  explore how explicit memory storage for space affects the
  internal representation of space. We found that on the level of
  internal representation the storage mechanisms for explicit
  memory are similar to those in human beings in requiring
  attention. Attention is a component of conscious response,
  perhaps the great challenge of all research on mental processes.
  It thus seems likely that in future decades, the study of memory,
  perhaps even in mice, is likely to allow molecular insights into
  even the deepest problems of human behavior.</p>

  <p><b>A personal perspective</b><br>
  Although doing research on <i>Aplysia</i> and the hippocampus and
  discussing science with colleagues in my lab have given me the
  greatest intellectual satisfactions, I have loved teaching and
  have learned a great deal from lecturing to medical and graduate
  students. It was in the context of the neural science course at
  Columbia that the idea arose of doing a textbook, <i>Principles
  of Neural Science</i>. In college and medical school I was never
  a good note-taker. I always preferred sitting back, enjoying the
  lecture, and just scribbling down a few words here and there.
  When I came to Columbia to develop the neural science course, I
  was struck by how much energy students were devoting to writing
  out every single word of lectures, and I wanted to help them get
  over that. I therefore encouraged the faculty to provide a
  syllabus for each lecture, and with time I edited the syllabus,
  added figures to it and improved it. Then Jimmy Schwartz and I
  decided that the syllabus was becoming sufficiently useful that
  we might make a textbook out of it. Our textbook was the first
  attempt to bridge cell and molecular biology to neural science
  and neural science to behavior and clinical states. The response
  to the first edition was so gratifying that we made an effort to
  make the book better and more complete. With the second edition,
  not only students but also scientists began to regard our
  textbook as useful. With the help of Tom Jessell, we further
  improved the third and fourth editions. The widespread reception
  of this book, both in the United States and abroad, has been a
  source of deep satisfaction to me and to the other
  contributors.</p>

  <p>Outside of our work and our family, Denise
  and I enjoy the visual arts and classical music, especially
  opera. Our interest in both of these activities is greatly
  enriched by having within easy reach of our home the great
  museums and galleries of Manhattan as well as the Metropolitan
  Opera. We also are inveterate - I am tempted to say
  <i>addicted</i> - collectors of art and antiques. We have lived
  for 36 years in a now 150-year-old house in the Riverdale section
  of the Bronx, with wonderful views of the Hudson River and the
  Palisades. We collect French art nouveau furniture, vases, and
  lamps, an interest that originated with Denise and her mother,
  and graphic art of the Austrian and German Expressionists, an
  interest which originated with me. As I write this, I am
  beginning to suspect that our collecting may well be an attempt
  to recapture a part of our hopelessly lost youth.</p>

  <p>In the course of my career I have incurred
  many debts both personal and scientific. First and foremost I owe
  an enormous personal debt to my parents and my brother Lewis. My
  parents were able in mid-life to relocate to a foreign country -
  my father spoke not a word of English when he first arrived in
  New York - and to create a new life for themselves and their
  sons. My parents not only succeeded in establishing themselves in
  their small store in Brooklyn, but were sufficiently successful
  to support me through college and medical school. They were so
  occupied with their store that throughout their life in America
  they did not share in the cultural life of New York, which Lewis
  and I were beginning to enjoy. Despite their constant labor they
  were always extremely optimistic and supportive of us, and never
  tried to dictate decisions about my work or play. Lewis was also
  an enormous influence on me in my early years, and my interest in
  classical music and my joy in learning were importantly
  influenced by him. While a graduate student at Brown University
  writing his dissertation in linguistics and Middle High German,
  he was called to service as an intelligence officer in the Korean
  War. He and his wife, Elise, went first in 1951 to Germany and
  then in 1953 to Paris, France, where he had a position as a
  civilian in Air Force Intelligence. He so enjoyed his life in
  France, that he lost his interest in an academic life and stayed
  in France for 13 years, where he and Elise raised five children.
  He eventually returned to the United States and finished his
  career in a series of administrative positions, in the Health
  Department of the City of New York. He died in 1979, at age 54 of
  a recurrence of a cancer of the kidney, which we all thought had
  been successfully removed when it first presented 10 years
  earlier.</p>

  <p>Second, I have been privileged to enjoy a
  wonderfully supportive, endlessly interesting, and stable family
  life with Denise, my partner, best friend, and most honest critic
  for now 45 years. Throughout our life together she has
  consistently encouraged my love of research and supported my
  scientific aspirations. Denise is a professor in the Department
  of Psychiatry and in the School of Public Health at Columbia
  University, and has pioneered the study of drug abuse in
  adolescence. Her work on the epidemiology of drug abuse has
  become the basis of the current understanding of the
  developmental sequence whereby adolescents become involved in
  drugs. I am also greatly in debted to our two children, Paul and
  Minouche, for the joy they gave Denise and me while growing up
  and the satisfaction they have given us in seeing what principled
  and interesting people they have become and how thoughtful they
  are as parents to their own children. Our son Paul majored in
  economics at Haverford College and graduated from the Columbia
  Business School. He now manages a set of investment funds at
  Dreyfus-Mellon. Paul is married to Emily Kaplan, an interior
  designer; they live in Scarsdale, N.Y. and have two daughters,
  Allison (born on January 5, 1992) and Libby (born on October 14,
  1995). Our daughter Minouche went to Yale College and Harvard Law
  School. She practices public interest law in San Francisco
  specializing in women's rights and family violence. Minouche is
  married to Rick Sheinfield, also a public interest lawyer, and
  they have a son, Izak (born on November 10, 1998) and a daughter,
  Maya (born on March 12, 2001).</p>

  <p>In retrospect it seems a very long way for
  me from Vienna to Stockholm. My timely departure from Vienna made
  for a remarkably fortunate life in the United States. The freedom
  that I have experienced in America and in its academic
  institutions made Stockholm possible for me, as it has for many
  others.</p>

  <p><b>Postscripts: a Curriculum
  Vitae</b><br>
  I began my academic career at the Harvard Medical School, where
  from 1963 to 1965, I was an instructor in the Department of
  Psychiatry. In 1965, I moved to New York University as associate
  professor where, together with Alden Spencer and James Schwartz,
  we developed the first group in the country devoted to both
  cellular neurobiology and behavior. At the time I was recruited
  to N.Y.U., Denise was recruited to the Columbia University
  College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she gradually rose to
  the rank of professor.</p>

  <p>In 1974, Harry Grundfest retired and I was
  recruited to Columbia to replace him. At Columbia I was the
  founding director of the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. In
  1983, I became a University Professor at Columbia. In 1984, I
  resigned as director of the Center to become a senior
  investigator at the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Research
  Institute at Columbia.</p>

  <p>Since 1974, I have been a member of the
  National Academy of Sciences USA. Later I
  became a member of the National Science Academies of Germany and
  France, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American
  Philosophical Society, the National Institute of Medicine, and
  most recently, Germany's Orden Pour Le M&eacute;rite f&uuml;r
  Wissenschaften und K&uuml;nste. Being invited to join the Orden
  was for me a particularly great honor. The collection of scholars
  and scientists in the Orden is extraordinary; as an extra bonus
  it includes old friends such as the great German historian Fritz
  Stern, and a sterling group of biologists including <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">Max Perutz</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1995/index.html">Christiane
  N&uuml;sslein-Volhard</a>, <a href=

  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/index.html">Erwin Neher</a>, Walter
  Gehring, Charles Weissman, and Robert Weinberg.</p>

  <p>I have been awarded the Lester N. Hofheimer
  Prize for Research of the American Psychiatric Association
  (1977), the Karl Spencer Lashley Prize in Neurobiology from the
  American Philosophical Society (1981), the Dickson Prize in
  Biology and Medicine from the University of Pittsburgh (1982), the Albert
  Lasker Award (1983), the Rosenstiel Award of Brandeis University
  (1984), the Howard Crosby Warren Medal by the Society of
  Experimental Psychologists (1984), the American Association of
  Medical Colleges Award for Distinguished Research in the
  Biomedical Sciences (1985), the Gairdner International Award of
  Canada for Outstanding Achievement in Medical Science (1987), the
  National Medal of Science (1988), the J. Murray Luck Award for
  Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences
  (1988), the American College of Physicians Award in Basic Science
  (1989), the Robert J. and Claire Pasarow Foundation Award in
  Neuroscience (1989), the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for
  Distinguished Achievement in Neuroscience Research (1991), the
  Warren Triennial Prize from the Massachusetts General Hospital
  (1992), the Harvey Prize of the Technion in Haifa (1993), the
  Stevens Triennial Prize from Columbia University (1995), the Dana
  Award (1997), the Gerard Prize of the Society of Neuroscience
  (1997), the Wolf Prize of Israel (1999), and the Dr. A.H.
  Heineken Prize for Medicine from the Royal Netherlands Academy of
  Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam (2000).</p>

  <p>I have received honorary degrees from nine
  universities, including three European universities: the
  University of Vienna, Edinburgh, and Turin. Surprisingly, the first
  honorary degree I received, in 1983, was from the Jewish
  Theological Seminary in New York. I was thrilled that they would
  even know of my work. I suspect they learned of that from my
  colleague Mortimer Ostow, one of the psychoanalysts who first
  stirred my interest in relating psychoanalysis and the brain. My
  father had already died but my mother came to the graduation
  ceremony, and in his introductory remarks Gerson D. Cohen, the
  chancellor of the seminary, referred to my having received a good
  Hebrew education at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, an acknowledgement
  which filled my mother's Jewish heart with pride. As this
  recitation makes clear, I also owe a profound intellectual debt
  to my scientific teachers - Harry Grundfest, Dominick Purpura,
  Wade Marshall, and Ladislav Tauc - who tolerated my naivete and
  encouraged my brashness. I also benefited greatly from Steve
  Kuffler's sage insight and advice and from Alden Spencer's
  generous friendship. I also am indebted to the extraordinary
  collection of colleagues, fellows, and students that I have had
  the privilege of interacting and collaborating with and whose
  individual contributions I describe in more detail in my Nobel
  Lecture. Finally, I am deeply grateful to Columbia University and
  the Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute, two great
  institutions that have created open environments supportive of
  scholarship and research.</p>
