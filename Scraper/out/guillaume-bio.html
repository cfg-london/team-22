  <h1>Charles Edouard Guillaume - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="guillaume.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Charles-Edouard Guillaume</b> was born at Fleurier, in the
  Swiss-Jura, on February 15, 1861. His grandfather had left France
  for political reasons during the Revolution and established a
  watchmaking business in London. The business was carried on by
  his three sons but Charles' father, &Eacute;douard, eventually
  returned to settle in Fleurier.<br>
  <br>
  Guillaume received his early education in Neuch&acirc;tel before
  going to the Zurich Polytechnic where he obtained his doctor's
  degree. He spent a short time as an officer in the artillery
  before entering the International Bureau of Weights and Measures,
  as an assistant, in 1883. He became Associate Director in 1902
  and from 1915 until his retirement in 1936, he was Director of
  the Bureau. He remained as Honorary Director from 1936 until his
  death.<br>
  <br>
  During his brief military career, Guillaume studied mechanics and
  ballistics but his earliest investigations at the bureau were
  with thermometry. He carried out important investigations on
  corrections to mercury-in-glass thermometers and he was
  responsible for the detailed calibration of thermometers used at
  the Bureau in the establishment of the thermal expansions of the
  standards of length. He was concerned in initial work on the
  International Metre and undertook a determination of the volume
  of one kilogram of water by the contact method.<br>
  <br>
  A chance observation by Guillaume on the coefficient of expansion
  of nickel-iron alloys led to a systematic investigation of a
  whole series of alloys and the discovery of invar, an alloy with
  a very low coefficient of expansion; elinvar, for which the
  thermoelastic coefficient is practically zero, i.e. Young's
  modulus constant, over a considerable temperature range; together
  with other useful alloys. The applications of invar were quickly
  recognized and the material was used in rapid methods for the
  measurement of geodetic baselines. The alloy is widely used in
  instruments of precision, such as thermostats and pendulums of
  astronomic clocks. Guillaume's total compensating balance for
  high-grade watches and chronometers, which eliminates the
  secondary error, was perfected by an elinvar hair spring.<br>
  <br>
  Guillaume's work is recorded in many papers published by the
  Bureau and he has written, amongst other works, <i>&Eacute;tudes
  thermom&eacute;triques</i> (Studies on Thermometry, 1886),
  <i>Trait&eacute; de thermom&eacute;trie</i> (Treatise on Thermometry,
  1889), <i>Unit&eacute;s et &Eacute;talons</i> (Units and Standards,
  1894), <i>Les rayons X</i> (X-Rays, 1896), <i>Recherches sur le
  nickel et ses alliages</i> (Investigations on Nickel and its
  Alloys, 1898), <i>La vie de la mati&egrave;re</i> (The Life of
  Matter, 1899), <i>La Convention du M&egrave;tre et le Bureau
  international des Poids et Mesures</i> (Metrical Convention and
  the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, 1902), <i>Les
  applications des aciers au nickel</i> (Applications of
  Nickel-Steels, 1904), <i>Des &eacute;tats de la mati&egrave;re</i>
  (States of Matter, 1907), <i>Les r&eacute;cent progr&egrave;s du
  syst&egrave;me m&eacute;trique</i> (Recent progress in the Metric
  System, 1907, 1913). His book <i>Initiation &agrave; la
  M&eacute;canique</i> (Introduction to Mechanics) has been
  translated into several languages.<br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and
  received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the Universities of
  Geneva, Neuchatel and Paris. He was a President of the
  Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Physique and a member,
  honorary member or corresponding member of more than a dozen of
  the leading scientific academies of Europe.<br>
  <br>
  Charles-&Eacute;douard Guillaume married Mlle. A.M. Taufflieb in
  1888. They had three children. He died on May 13, 1938.</p>
