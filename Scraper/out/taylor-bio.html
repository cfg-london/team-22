  <h1>Richard E. Taylor - Biographical</h1>

  <p><img src="taylor.jpg" class="bio-img">Medicine Hat is a small
  town in Southwestern Alberta founded just over 100 years ago in a
  valley where the Canadian Pacific Railway crossed the South
  Saskatchewan River. I was born there on November 2, 1929 and
  raised in comfortable if somewhat Spartan circumstances. My
  father was the son of a Northern Irish carpenter and his Scottish
  wife who homesteaded on the Canadian prairies; my mother was an
  American, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants to the northern
  United States who moved to a farm in Alberta shortly after the
  first World War. During my early years our family of three was
  part of a large family clan headed by my Scottish grandmother. I
  attended schools named after English Generals and Royalty -
  Kitchener, Connaught, Alexandra.<br>
  <br>
  Although I read quite a bit and found mathematics easy, I was not
  an outstanding student. In high school I did reasonably well in
  mathematics and science thanks to some talented and dedicated
  teachers.<br>
  <br>
  I was nearly ten years old when World War II began. That conflict
  had a great effect on our town, and on me. In rapid succession
  the town found itself host to an R.A.F. flight training school, a
  prisoner of war camp and a military research establishment. The
  wartime glamor of the military, the sudden infusion of groups of
  sophisticated and highly-educated people, and new cultural
  opportunities (the first live symphonic music I ever heard was
  played by German prisoners of war) all transformed our town and
  widened the horizons of the young people there. I developed an
  interest in explosives and blew three fingers off my left hand
  just before hostilities ended in Europe. The atomic bomb that
  ended the war later that summer made me intensely aware of
  physicists and physics.<br>
  <br>
  Higher education was highly prized in the society of a small
  prairie town and I was expected to continue on to university.
  After some difficulties over low grades in some high school
  subjects, I was admitted to the University of Alberta in
  Edmonton. I registered in a special program emphasizing
  mathematics and physics and gradually became interested in
  experimental physics, continuing my studies towards a Masters
  degree at the same institution. My thesis research was a rather
  primitive effort to measure double <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-decay in an aging Wilson cloud chamber. Between
  sessions at the University, I spent two summers as a research
  assistant at the Defense Research Board installation near
  Medicine Hat working with Dr. E.J. Wiggins, who encouraged me to
  continue my studies either in eastern Canada or in the United
  States.<br>
  <br>
  Those were interesting years, and during this time I met, courted
  and married Rita Bonneau - a partnership which has enriched my
  life in every way. Together we decided to try California, and I
  was accepted into the graduate program at Stanford, while she
  found work teaching in a military school in order to support us
  both. The first two years at Stanford were exciting beyond
  description - the Physics Department at Stanford included
  <a href="../1952/index.html">Felix Bloch</a>, Leonard Schiff,
  <a href="../1955/index.html">Willis Lamb</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1961/index.html">Robert Hofstadter</a>, and
  W.K.H. (Pief) Panofsky who had just arrived from Berkeley. I
  found that I had to work hard to keep up with my fellow students,
  but learning physics was great fun in those surroundings. At the
  end of the second year I joined the High Energy Physics
  Laboratory where the new linear accelerator was just beginning to
  do experiments. My thesis work was accomplished there under Prof.
  Robert F. Mozley, on a rather difficult experiment producing
  polarized <font face="Symbol">g</font>-rays from the accelerator
  beam and then using those <font face="Symbol">g</font>-rays to
  study <font face="Symbol">p</font>-meson production.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 I was invited to join a group of physicists at the
  &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris who were planning
  experiments at an accelerator (similar to the linac at Stanford)
  which was under construction in Orsay. I stayed in France for
  about three years working on the experimental facilities for the
  accelerator, and then participated in some electron scattering
  experiments. My wife began a new career there as a librarian at
  the Orsay laboratory, a career which was interrupted for a while
  when our son, Ted, was born in 1960. We returned to the United
  States in 1961 but a continuing connection to French physics and
  physicists has been a significant element in my life since that
  time - including a Doctorate (Honoris Causa) very kindly
  conferred upon me in 1980 by the Universit&eacute; de
  Paris-Sud.<br>
  <br>
  Upon our return to the United States, I joined the staff of the
  Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California.
  After less than a year in Berkeley, I moved back to Stanford
  where work on the construction of Stanford Linear Accelerator
  Center (SLAC) was just beginning. At SLAC, I started working on
  the design of the experimental areas for the new accelerator. By
  1963 I had joined the group considering the requirements for
  electron scattering apparatus in the larger of two experimental
  areas. I worked closely with Pief Panofsky, and with
  collaborators from the California Institute of Technology and the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I spent the next decade
  helping to build equipment and taking part in various electron
  scattering experiments, a number of which are the subject of the
  1990 Nobel lectures. This was a period of intense activity, but
  also one of intense enjoyment for me. I was surrounded by people
  I liked and admired, and deeply involved in experiments which
  generated interest in laboratories and universities all over the
  world. I count myself extremely fortunate to have been at SLAC at
  that time.<br>
  <br>
  I became a member of the SLAC faculty in 1968. In 1971, I was
  awarded a Guggenheim fellowship and spent an interesting
  sabbatical year at CERN, where I was impressed by the great
  progress that European science had made in the decade since I had
  worked in France.<br>
  <br>
  Well before my trip to CERN, colleagues in the group at SLAC had
  become interested in testing some of the invariance properties of
  the electromagnetic interaction, a field which would absorb our
  efforts for most of the 1970s. When Charles Prescott joined the
  group in 1970, he began a serious study of ways to test parity
  conservation in the interaction between an electron and a
  nucleon. The electroweak theories of <a href=
  "../1979/index.html">Weinberg and Salam</a> predicted levels of
  nonconservation that looked extremely hard to measure. We
  attempted an experiment with the existing Yale polarized source,
  but the measurements did not reach the desired level of
  sensitivity. I was not very encouraging to my colleagues who
  wished to pursue the experiment to higher levels of accuracy.
  After the theoretical work of Veltman and van't Hooft and the
  discovery of neutral currents at CERN (during the year I was
  there) and at NAL (now Fermilab), the interest in experiments on
  parity conservation greatly intensified. In 1975 a new method for
  producing polarized electrons was discovered by a group in
  Colorado which included E.L. Garwin of SLAC. In 1978, after
  building a source for the linac based on the new method, we were
  able to demonstrate a violation of parity in close agreement with
  the electroweak predictions.<br>
  <br>
  After the parity experiments, our group presented two proposals
  for large experimental facilities at PEP, the
  <i>e</i><sup>+</sup><i>e</i><sup>-</sup> collider then being
  built at SLAC. Both those proposals were rejected. The group was
  finally successful in proposing a relatively small PEP detector,
  but I did not take part in that experiment.<br>
  <br>
  In 1981, I received an Alexander von Humboldt award which allowed me
  to spend most of the 1981-82 academic year at DESY in Hamburg. In
  1982 I returned to SLAC as Associate Director for Research, a
  post I held until 1986 when I resigned to return to research.
  Since that time I have spent quite a bit of time in Europe and I
  am presently playing a very small role in the H<sub>1</sub>
  detector preparations at HERA.</p>
