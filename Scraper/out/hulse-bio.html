  <h1>Russell A. Hulse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hulse.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born November 28,
  1950 in New York City, the son of Alan and Betty Joan Hulse. My
  parents tell me that I quickly showed an unusual level of
  curiosity about the world around me as a child, and that this
  transformed itself into an interest in science at a very early
  age. For my part, I certainly recall that science was a defining
  part of my approach to life for as far back as I can remember. My
  parents fostered and supported this interest, and I thank them
  very much for being my first and, by far, most uncritically
  supportive funding agency. I ran through a seemingly endless
  series of interests involving chemistry sets, mechanical
  engineering construction sets, biology dissection kits, butterfly
  collecting, photography, telescopes, electronics and many other
  things over the years.<br>
  <br>
  The door to a whole range of new experiences opened for me when
  my father started building a summer house on land given to us by
  my Aunt Helen in Cuddebackville, New York, about two hours
  northwest of the city. Eventually, this became a year-round house
  for my grandparents when they retired and it is where my parents
  live now that they are retired. I remember spending weekends and
  summers helping my father put in place walls, rafters, siding and
  everything else that goes into a house. Among other things, it
  produced an early familiarity with tools and a do-it-yourself
  approach which has stood me in good stead over the years. My
  parents' friends and relatives were apparently not too sure that
  I should have been given such freedom to work with power tools at
  an early age, but fortunately I came through the experience with
  all of my fingers intact. Cuddebackville was also important to me
  as a place where a city kid could see nature, and as a practical
  place to work on my bigger projects.<br>
  <br>
  My parents not only supported my interests at home but also
  suffered along with me (and, most likely, much more than me) when
  some of my first experiences with school proved to be less than
  positive. Though I had some elementary school teachers with whom
  I got along well, there were some real problems with others who
  found me and my intense interest in science difficult to
  understand and deal with.<br>
  <br>
  Entering the Bronx High School of Science in 1963 was thus very
  important to me as it was there that I found myself in a school
  environment which explicitly emphasized what I found most
  interesting in life. Yet, as in the years before and after, while
  schoolwork was an important job to be done my interests in
  science tended to be expressed most clearly by my home projects.
  My biggest home project while at Bronx Science was building an
  amateur radio telescope up at my parents' house in
  Cuddebackville. I particularly enjoyed building antennas of
  various types, relying on an amateur radio antenna design book as
  a guide. The electronics were an odd mix of old television parts,
  military surplus power supplies, receivers and the like combined
  with other components I built myself. Unfortunately, the
  telescope never did work particularly well in terms of detecting
  radio sources (a little outside technical advice probably would
  have made a big difference in there somewhere), but I did enjoy
  myself and I learned a lot in the process.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of high school, I had my first big career decision to
  make. While I had by then begun to focus more on physics and
  astronomy amongst the sciences, I also enjoyed designing and
  building electronic equipment. This lead me to consider
  electrical engineering as well but, in the end, I decided that a
  degree in physics was probably the best fit to my
  interests.<br>
  <br>
  My college choices were limited by the fact that paying for
  college would have placed an inordinate financial burden on my
  parents. Fortunately, I was admitted to Cooper Union, a
  tuition-free college in lower Manhattan. From 1966 to 1970, I
  lived at home in the Bronx with my parents and commuted to Cooper
  each day on the New York subway system. Along, with the usual
  course work, Cooper provided me with my first experience with a
  new interest, computers. Cooper had an IBM 1620 available for the
  students to use and, while there were no courses on programming
  it, there were the instruction manuals. The first project that I
  selected by way of teaching myself FORTRAN was to use the
  computer to do orbit simulations, perhaps an early omen of things
  to come.<br>
  <br>
  After receiving my bachelor's degree in physics from Cooper Union
  in 1970, I started graduate school at The University of
  Massachusetts in Amherst. While I knew that I eventually wanted
  to do my thesis research in astronomy, preferably radio
  astronomy, I once again leaned towards a broader background and
  decided to get my doctorate in physics rather than astronomy. I
  went to UMass not only because its graduate program offered this
  type of flexibility, but also because it was located not too far
  from New York in a rather beautiful part of rural western
  Massachusetts.<br>
  <br>
  The five years I spent in Amherst are some of those which I
  remember most clearly from my past. Graduate school was an
  entirely new environment, with new experiences and challenges.
  The demands were such that, for the first time, I focused almost
  exclusively on my academic career, with my other outside
  interests tempered by the demands of the moment.<br>
  <br>
  After passing my Ph.D. qualifying examinations, I turned to
  finding a thesis project. This represented at long last a
  convergence of my outside and career interests, as I finally
  started working in radio astronomy again, now as a career rather
  than as a hobby. The rest of that story is told in my Nobel
  lecture.<br>
  <br>
  After completing my Ph.D. in 1975, I had a post-doctoral
  appointment at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in
  Charlottesville, Virginia from 1975 to 1977. While I still
  enjoyed doing pulsar radio astronomy, from the moment I arrived
  at NRAO I was increasingly preoccupied with the lack of long-term
  career prospects in astronomy. While I had some confidence that I
  could find another position of some sort after NRAO, it was not
  at all clear to me when, where, and how I would be able to settle
  down with some reasonable expectation of stability in my career.
  I certainly knew of astronomers who had been obliged to roam from
  place to place for many years and the potential for such repeated
  major dislocations in my personal life was more than I could
  quite tolerate. In particular, I had the classic problem of how a
  two-career couple could stay in reasonable geographical
  proximity, since my friend, Jeanne Kuhlman, was then doing her
  graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania. I therefore
  decided to try falling back on my broader interests and my
  physics Ph.D., exercising the option which I had left myself when
  I started at UMass.<br>
  <br>
  While even with this broader view not many good career
  opportunities seemed available, I did discover from an
  advertisement in Physics Today that the Princeton University
  Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) was hiring. Not only did
  controlled fusion seem an interesting and diverse field, but the
  lab was located in Princeton, not too far from Jeanne in
  Philadelphia.<br>
  <br>
  After interviewing at PPPL, I was offered a position with the
  plasma modeling group, based on my physics and computer
  background. Starting at the lab in 1977, my first task was
  developing new computer codes modeling the behavior of impurity
  ions in the high temperature plasmas of the controlled
  thermonuclear fusion devices at PPPL. I had never really done
  computer modeling before and the art and science of computer
  modeling is one of the most valuable things which I have learned
  in the 16 years which I have now been at the lab.<br>
  <br>
  The multi-species impurity transport code which ultimately grew
  out of this initial work at PPPL is still in use to this day. It
  models the behavior of the different charge states of an impurity
  element under the combined influences of atomic and transport
  processes in the plasma. I oriented my development of this code
  very much towards its practical use by spectroscopists and other
  experimentalists in interpreting their data and one of my
  greatest satisfactions has been that this code has become widely
  used over the years both at PPPL as well as at other fusion
  laboratories. My own research with this code included determining
  transport coefficients for impurity ions by modeling
  spectroscopic observations of their behavior following their
  injection into the plasma. In connection with modeling impurity
  behavior, I also worked on investigating the atomic processes
  themselves, for example, by helping to elucidate the importance
  of charge exchange reactions between neutral hydrogen and highly
  charged ions as an important recombination process for impurities
  in fusion plasmas. In a rather different sort of contribution, I
  more recently developed a computer data format which has been
  adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a standard
  for the compilation and interchange of atomic data for fusion
  applications.<br>
  <br>
  While I am still involved in supporting this impurity transport
  modeling code at PPPL, my more active area of work in the past
  few years has been modeling the transport of electrons in the
  plasma as revealed by pellet injection experiments. The pellets
  involved here are pellets of solid hydrogen, injected at high
  velocity into the plasma. The relaxation of the plasma electron
  density profile after a pellet has deposited its mass inside the
  plasma provides an important way of observing plasma transport in
  action. For this work, I wrote an electron particle transport
  code which focused on modeling the experimentally observed
  density profile evolutions using theoretically motivated, highly
  non-linear forms for the particle diffusion coefficients.<br>
  <br>
  In another recent new direction, I have been working to establish
  a new effort at PPPL in advanced computer modeling environments.
  The objective of this research is the development of novel
  approaches to creating modular computer codes which will make it
  much easier to develop and apply computer models to an extended
  range of applications in research, industry and education. I have
  been pursuing this work in the context of cooperative research
  and development agreements with an industrial partner, taking
  advantage of this new type of collaborative arrangement recently
  made possible between government sponsored research laboratories
  and the private sector.<br>
  <br>
  By now, it is surely clear that my interest in science has never
  been so much a matter of pursuing a career per se, but rather an
  expression of my personal fascination with knowing "How the World
  Works", especially as it could be understood directly with
  hands-on experience. This central motivation has been expressed
  over the years not only in my career but also in a wide range of
  hobbies. Notable amongst these "hobbies" have always been
  interests in various areas of science beyond whatever I was
  professionally employed in at any given time. For example, I have
  most recently been considering that much of what I have found so
  interesting about both the natural and man-made world has
  involved how individual, often autonomous, elements combine to
  make a functioning whole, either by design or by
  self-organization. I have thus started to be interested in
  various aspects of the new so-called "sciences of complexity",
  especially as they can be explored using computer modeling.<br>
  <br>
  My list of more traditional hobbies and recreational activities
  has also changed over time. Many activities which I formerly
  enjoyed, such as amateur radio and woodworking, have been
  eventually dropped simply because I realized that I did not have
  enough time and energy to pursue everything I might enjoy doing.
  A current list of my activities would include nature photography,
  bird watching (and observing the beauty and drama of nature in
  general), target shooting, listening to music, canoeing,
  crosscountry skiing, and other outdoor activities.<br>
  <br>
  I do not pretend to be anything like an accomplished expert in
  all of the many things that I have ever been or am presently
  involved in doing. My most fundamental urge has always been just
  to spend time on what I found the most interesting, trying of
  course to match this up somehow with the more practical demands
  of life and a career. In this sense I have come to realize that
  at times I must not have always been the easiest person to have
  had as a student, or as an employee, and I therefore appreciate
  the efforts of those who helped me to accommodate myself to these
  practical demands, or often, who worked to help accommodate the
  practical demands to me.<br>
  <br>
  I would like to close on the thought that some of the most
  enjoyable moments of my life have always involved sharing my
  various interests with those others who understood them (and me)
  the best. Thus special thanks go to my parents, to Jeanne
  Kuhlman, and to all of the good friends that I have had over the
  years.</p>
