  <h1>Robert W. Holley - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="holley.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Robert W. Holley</b> was born in Urbana,
  Illinois, on January 28th, 1922, one of four sons of Charles and
  Viola Holley. His parents were both educators. He attended public
  schools in Illinois, California and Idaho, and graduated from
  Urbana High School in 1938. He studied chemistry at the University of Illinois
  and received his B. A. degree in 1942. Graduate work was at
  Cornell
  University, where the Ph.D. degree in organic chemistry, with
  Professor Alfred T. Blomquist, was awarded in 1947. Graduate work
  was interrupted during the war. He spent two years, 1944-1946,
  with Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1955/index.html">Vincent du Vigneaud</a> at
  Cornell
  University Medical College, where he participated in the
  first chemical synthesis of penicillin.<br>
  <br>
  After completing the Ph. D. degree, Holley spent 1947-1948 as an
  American Chemical
  Society Postdoctoral Fellow with Professor Carl M. Stevens at
  Washington State
  University. He then returned to Cornell University as
  Assistant Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Geneva Experiment
  Station in 1948. He was Associate Professor there from 1950-1957.
  During a sabbatical year, 1955-1956, he was a Guggenheim Memorial
  Fellow in the Division of Biology at the California Institute of
  Technology. In 1958, he returned to Ithaca, New York, as a
  Research Chemist at the U. S. Plant, Soil and Nutrition
  Laboratory, a U. S. Department of Agriculture Laboratory on the
  Cornell University campus. He had an appointment in the
  University throughout this period and became Professor of
  Biochemistry in 1962. He rejoined the faculty of Cornell
  University full time in 1964 as Professor of Biochemistry and
  Molecular Biology, and was Chairman of the Department from 1965
  to 1966. The following year, 1966-1967, was spent at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies
  and the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla,
  California, as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow. In
  1968, though maintaining an affiliation with Cornell University,
  he joined the permanent staff of the Salk Institute, where he is
  a Resident Fellow and an American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular
  Biology. He is also an Adjunct Professor at the University of California
  at San Diego.<br>

  Holley's training as a chemist did not alter his basic interest
  in living things. This interest has influenced his choice of
  research, which began with the organic chemistry of natural
  products. There followed a gradual drift toward more biological
  subjects, with work on amino acids and peptides, and eventually
  work on the biosynthesis of proteins. During the latter, the
  alanine transfer RNA was discovered. The following 10 years were
  spent working with this RNA, first concentrating on the isolation
  of the RNA, and then working on the determination of the
  structure of the RNA. The nucleotide sequence was completed at
  the end of 1964. It was for this work that the Nobel Prize was
  awarded. More recently, his work has been concerned with factors
  that control cell division in mammalian cells.<br>
  <br>
  Holley is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
  The American Society of Biological Chemists and the American
  Chemical Society. He received the Albert Lasker Award in Basic
  Medical Research in 1965, the Distinguished Service Award of the
  U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1965, and the U. S. Steel
  Foundation Award in Molecular Biology of the National Academy of
  Sciences in 1967.<br>
  <br>
  Holley was married to Ann Dworkin in 1945. They have one son,
  Frederick. Mrs. Holley's professional interests are concerned
  with the teaching of mathematics. The three of them especially
  enjoy the ocean and the mountains.</p>
