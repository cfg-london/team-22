  <h2>Investigations on Typhus</h2>

  <p>I am going to give you an account of how I
  arrived at the results for which I have received the Nobel Prize
  for Medicine. I shall also summarize these results.</p>

  <p>It did not seem likely that I was destined
  to undertake research on typhus. I was born, first studied
  medicine and undertook my first research work in a French
  province from which typhus had disappeared since 1814. It is true
  that I came across a few imported cases at Rouen in 1889. They
  made no particular impression on me.</p>

  <p>My arrival in Tunisia placed me immediately
  in contact with typhus. Ten days after my arrival, at the
  beginning of January 1903, I saw a few cases in natives living in
  a suburb of Tunis.</p>

  <p>In those days the disease flared up each
  winter in the rural districts of Tunisia. From these remote
  districts it spread to the doss houses, the prisons and the
  outskirts of towns. The native districts of Tunis and the prisons
  were regularly stricken. The epidemic receded in June; it drew
  back into the remote country districts and was not heard of again
  until the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Of all the problems which were open to me
  for study, typhus was the most urgent and the most unexplored. We
  knew nothing of the way in which contagion spread. The field of
  experimental study was virgin ground. We were scarcely able to
  conclude, from the results of debatable experiments, that it was
  possible to inoculate the disease from one man to another by
  means of the blood.</p>

  <p>In June of 1903 I was determined to carry
  out a preliminary study. At that time typhus was raging in a
  native prison, 80 kilometres South of Tunis, Djouggar. I
  requested the doctor in charge of this establishment to allow me
  to accompany him on his weekly visits. We made an appointment.
  The evening before I had a haemoptysis. If it had not been for
  this accident, my first contact with typhus would undoubtedly
  have been my last. My colleague, Motheau, and his servant went to
  Djouggar; they spent the night there, contracted typhus and both
  died.</p>

  <p>Most of the doctors in the Tunisian
  administration, especially those in country districts, contracted
  typhus and approximately one third of them died of it. The fact
  that I was fortunate enough to escape contagion, in spite of
  frequent, sometimes daily contacts with the disease, was because
  I soon guessed how it spread.</p>

  <p>The native hospital in Tunis was the focal
  point of my research. Often, when going to the hospital, I had to
  step over the bodies of typhus patients who were awaiting
  admission to the hospital and had fallen exhausted at the door.
  We had observed a certain phenomenon at the hospital, of which no
  one recognized the significance, and which drew my attention. In
  those days typhus patients were accommodated in the open medical
  wards. Before reaching the door of the wards they spread
  contagion. They transmitted the disease to the families that
  sheltered them, and doctors visiting them were also infected. The
  administrative staff admitting the patients, the personnel
  responsible for taking their clothes and linen, and the laundry
  staff were also contaminated. In spite of this, once admitted to
  the general ward the typhus patient did not contaminate any of
  the other patients, the nurses or the doctors.</p>

  <p>I took this observation as my guide. I
  asked myself what happened between the entrance to the hospital
  and the wards. This is what happened: the typhus patient was
  stripped of his clothes and linen, shaved and washed. The
  contagious agent was therefore something attached to his skin and
  clothing, something which soap and water could remove. It could
  only be the louse. It was the louse.</p>

  <p>Even if it had not been possible to
  reproduce the disease in animals and consequently to verify the
  hypothesis, this simple observation would have been sufficient to
  demonstrate the way in which the disease was propagated.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it was also possible to
  provide experimental proof.</p>

  <p>My first attempts to transmit typhus to
  laboratory animals, including the smaller species of monkeys, had
  failed, as had those of my predecessors, for reasons which I can
  easily supply today.</p>

  <p>I asked my teacher, E. Roux, to get me a
  chimpanzee, thinking that an anthropoid might be more susceptible
  to infection than animals of other species. The day I received
  the chimpanzee I inoculated it with the blood of a patient from
  Dr. Broc's department at the hospital in Rabta. The chimpanzee
  contracted a fever. I inoculated a macaco (<i>M. sinicus</i>)
  with blood from the chimpanzee taken during the fever, and he
  also developed a fever. I cultivated lice on the macaco, which I
  then transported to other macacos. The latter became infected and
  subsequently proved to be vaccinated against a test inoculation
  of the virus.</p>

  <p>These decisive experiments did not take
  very long. I had reproduced typhus in the chimpanzee in June,
  1909; I demonstrated the role played by the louse in August. I
  published these results in September with Charles Comte and
  Ernest Conseil. This was the yield for the year 1909. During the
  years that followed I undertook with Conseil and Alfred Conor,
  and later with Georges Blanc, a more detailed experimental study
  of the disease and the conditions of transmission.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of my research the only
  animals I knew to be susceptible to the disease were monkeys. All
  species of monkeys can be infected, provided that a sufficient
  quantity of virus is inoculated through the peritoneum. The
  monkey was well suited for preserving the virus. But the monkey
  is an expensive animal. During the first two years, therefore, I
  had to be satisfied with studying typhus during the months of its
  seasonal expansion, experimenting from man to monkey and,
  exceptionally, from one monkey to another. The discovery that I
  soon made that the guinea pig was also susceptible to infection
  made it possible for me, from the third year on, to preserve the
  virus on this animal. It was then easy for me to conduct my
  research independently of epidemics, that is, all the time. From
  the practical point of view, the susceptibility to infection of
  the guinea pig proved to be the most useful step forward. Today,
  all laboratories use this animal for preserving the virus.</p>

  <p>In man typhus is characterized by a triade
  of symptoms: fever, rash, nervous symptoms. In animals, fever is
  the only sign of infection. The fact that the virus is localized
  more particularly in the brain explains the nervous symptoms to
  be found in our species.</p>

  <p>I demonstrated the characteristics of
  experimental fever. It appears after an incubation period which
  is never less than five days. It follows the same pattern as
  natural fever in man, but is of shorter duration and less
  pronounced. There follows a period of hypothermia, clearly
  apparent in the monkey, but less obvious in the guinea pig. In
  the monkey there are minor general symptoms and subsequent loss
  of weight is usual. In the guinea pig the disease would be
  inapparent if the temperature were not noted. At the time when I
  was conducting my research there was no known method for taking
  the guinea pig's temperature. I demonstrated a technique which is
  now widely used.</p>

  <p>I have already mentioned that the virus
  could be kept indefinitely by injecting guinea pigs. For this
  purpose, brain tissue gives more constant results than blood.</p>

  <p>It can sometimes happen, especially when
  blood is used, that out of a group of guinea pigs inoculated with
  the same dose of the same product, certain of them show no signs
  of fever. At first I attributed this fact to a technical fault or
  to greater individual resistance. Repeated negative results
  precluded my continuing to accept these oversimplified
  explanations. Animals for which the virus is pathogenic present a
  whole scale of degrees of susceptibility - from the grave form,
  often fatal in adult Europeans, down to the fever, revealed only
  by the thermometer, in the guinea pig, passing through all the
  intermediate stages: typhus of the native adult, benign typhus in
  children, still more benign in monkeys. I wondered if there was
  not, below the very slight susceptibility of the guinea pig, an
  even lesser degree in which the only sign of infection was the
  virulence of the blood during the period when more susceptible
  animals showed signs of the characteristic fever. This was indeed
  the case. I was able to ascertain this fact in 1911. A little
  later I went back to study this problem with Charles Lebailly. It
  led me to the conception of what I have called <i>inapparent
  infections</i>. Apyretic typhus, without symptoms, <i>the
  inapparent typhus</i> presented by the guinea pig, is the first
  case described and the most well known.</p>

  <p>Inapparent typhus in the guinea pig may be
  a primary infection typhus, as was the case I discovered. The
  cause in this case is the inoculation of a quantity of virus
  insufficient to produce fever. Blood from a guinea pig who has
  contracted inapparent typhus will always produce pyretic typhus
  in another guinea pig if the dose inoculated is sufficient. The
  positive result of this inoculation proves in fact that the first
  guinea pig had contracted typhus, in spite of the lack of
  fever.</p>

  <p>Having ascertained inapparent typhus in
  cases of primary infection, it was then easy for me to
  demonstrate the existence of apyretic typhus in certain guinea
  pigs that had been reinoculated a fairly long time after
  contraction of a primary infection of pyretic typhus.</p>

  <p>Lebailly and I then went on to demonstrate
  that inapparent primary infection typhus, which is exceptional in
  inoculated guinea pigs, is the only form which the disease takes
  experimentally in the rat and the mouse. This curious disease,
  which presents no symptoms, which has an incubation period and a
  period when the blood is virulent, and which confers a certain
  degree of immunity, can be transmitted from one rat to another.
  On two occasions I effected twelve such transmissions. At the
  twelfth, brain tissue from the rats induced pyretic typhus in the
  guinea pig.</p>

  <p>This new concept of inapparent infections
  that I introduced to pathology is, without a doubt, the most
  important of the discoveries that I was able to make. In the
  absence of fever, experimental work on typhus must take into
  account the possible existence of inapparent forms. We shall see
  that this concept alone can explain the preservation of the virus
  in nature and the reappearance of seasonal epidemics. I applied
  this new concept to measles and certain spirochaete infections,
  and Georges Blanc has just discovered the existence of inapparent
  dengue in man, as well as in the monkey and the guinea pig.</p>

  <p>Thus my research opened a new chapter,
  subpathology, which is doubtless a vast field where almost
  everything remains to be discovered.</p>

  <p>We have known for a long time that primary
  infection of typhus confers immunity in man in almost all cases
  and that this immunity lasts a lifetime. I established that
  laboratory animals were subject to a similar immunity; but I also
  demonstrated that this was of shorter duration than was generally
  thought before the discovery of inapparent typhus in secondary
  infections. Although benign, inapparent typhus also confers a
  certain degree of immunity.</p>

  <p>Lucien Raynaud (of Algiers) and E. Legrain
  (of Bougie) had used serum from convalescent typhus patients
  empirically in treating typhus. Conseil and I established that
  this method was not effective. On the other hand, we demonstrated
  that serum from convalescent patients and from animals that had
  recovered from the disease had preventive properties as regards
  subsequent inoculation of the virus. Following these discoveries,
  we were able to institute a preventive method against typhus by
  using serum from convalescents. This method gives sure protection
  to persons in contact with typhus patients, to doctors and to
  nurses. It proved to be particularly effective, in our hands, in
  protecting persons contaminated by lice from typhus patients and
  who would otherwise certainly have contracted the disease. The
  immunity conferred by the serum is of short duration, but
  inoculation may be repeated where necessary.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of the preventive properties
  contained in serum from convalescent typhus patients led me, with
  Conseil, to use serum taken from children cured of measles to
  prevent this disease. This method spread from Tunis throughout
  the whole world and has saved thousands of lives.</p>

  <p>I was less successful in my attempts to
  effect preventive vaccination against typhus by using the virus
  and in trying to produce large quantities of serum using large
  animals.</p>

  <p>I did, certainly, succeed in vaccinating a
  number of people by injecting very small, repeated doses of
  virulent blood (with Conseil) and achieved rather better results
  with brain tissue from the guinea pig (with H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
  Sparrow). However, the method is unreliable and an element of
  danger precludes any recommendation to generalize it.</p>

  <p>Prevention of typhus by serum from
  convalescent patients presupposes the existence of such patients;
  moreover, the quantity of serum provided by a convalescent is
  very small. Although useful, therefore, this method can be
  considered only as a makeshift. If it were possible to produce
  these preventive properties in a large animal, the quantity of
  serum obtained would be unlimited and, by preserving the virus in
  guinea pigs, it would thus be possible to produce the serum as
  and when required.</p>

  <p>I had realized that repeated virulent
  inoculations of the donkey did not cause appreciable preventive
  properties to be developed in the blood of this animal, but in
  attempting to find a solution to the problem, I tried to
  ascertain whether the donkey, apparently resistant to the
  disease, could not contract inapparent typhus and I found that
  this was sometimes the case. As inapparent typhus produced no
  preventive properties, I then endeavoured to produce pyretic
  typhus in the donkey. Working first alone and later with
  H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Sparrow, I succeeded by intracerebral
  inoculation of the virus, but only in very rare cases and without
  being able to determine the conditions necessary to produce
  frequent, if not constant, results. Serum from the donkey cured
  of pyretic typhus does in fact possess preventive properties. Up
  to the present time, this is as far as we have gone in our
  research on this point.</p>

  <p>I was more successful in my study of the
  conditions in which transmission of typhus takes place. After
  clearly establishing the role of the louse, I demonstrated the
  detailed mechanism of transmission. Two factors are involved: man
  and the louse.</p>

  <p>The patient's blood is virulent, not only
  during the whole duration of the fever, but also two or three
  days before it appears and two or three days after the
  temperature has fallen. During this whole period, therefore, the
  louse can be infected by the patient. Children play an important
  part in the propagation of typhus. Conseil and I have
  demonstrated that native children, particularly very young
  children, contract a benign form of typhus, sometimes so slight
  that it can only be detected by positive results obtained from
  inoculation of blood in the monkey or guinea pig.</p>

  <p>The role of inapparent typhus in cases of
  re-infection is indubitably even more important. This alone
  explains the preservation of the virus in nature when there is no
  epidemic and the seasonal reappearance of the epidemics
  themselves. It would be impossible to understand how typhus could
  remain active if this depended on the louse continually finding
  different people to infect. And if this is self-evident in the
  case of typhus, it is even more so for measles. We have no doubt
  discovered here the most useful application of the concept of
  inapparent infections.</p>

  <p>Just as the only reservoir for the typhus
  virus in nature is provided by man, so the only vector of
  infection is the louse. The bite of the louse is not virulent
  immediately after the infecting meal. It becomes so only towards
  the 7th day following infection. On the 9th and 10th days the
  bite is invariably virulent. It is therefore a necessary
  condition that the virus should multiply within the louse for it
  to become dangerous. I have shown that this multiplication takes
  place in the digestive tract and that louse faeces become
  virulent at the same period as does the bite. This observation
  was made in 1910. Developed by further, more detailed research
  undertaken in conjunction with Georges Blanc in 1914, it provided
  a guide to those who undertook to locate the pathogenic organism
  responsible for typhus in the intestine of the louse. Edmond
  Sergent (from Algiers) was the first to describe inclusion
  bodies, later called <i>rickettsia</i>, in the intestinal cells
  and faeces of the louse. Not being attracted to purely
  morphological research, I have not myself studied these inclusion
  bodies, the significance of which is not clearly
  demonstrated.</p>

  <p>I demonstrated the more immediately
  important fact that typhus can be transmitted through louse
  faeces. By soiling the natives' skin; they are easily inoculated
  by scratching or by soiling the fingers, which are then brought
  into contact with the conjunctiva, which is an ideal means of
  entry for such an active virus.</p>

  <p>I finally demonstrated that typhus
  infection is not hereditary in the louse.</p>

  <p>These observations formed the basis of
  typhus prophylaxis. The pioneer in this field was Conseil,
  Director of the Bureau of Public Health in Tunis; in three years
  he eradicated typhus from a town where it had raged year after
  year since the beginning of history. Thanks to the endeavours of
  our medical administrators, and in particular Gobert,
  Cardaliaguet, and Henry, typhus has been eliminated from the
  mines and prisons and has retreated to remote rural districts,
  where it will remain a permanent menace until it is finally
  eradicated. From Tunisia the method has spread over the
  world.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning of the Great War
  steps were taken, on my instruction, to institute medical control
  of troops in North Africa. No native left African soil for Europe
  without having been previously deloused. This was the precaution,
  taken by all nations in similar conditions, which saved the
  armies from typhus. Although lice appeared and multiplied in the
  trenches and became a plague in themselves, for the first time in
  the history of man typhus did not go hand in hand with a long
  war.</p>

  <p>If in 1914 we had been unaware of the mode
  of transmission of typhus, and if infected lice had been imported
  into Europe, the war would not have ended by a bloody victory. It
  would have ended in an unparalleled catastrophe, the most
  terrible in human history. Soldiers at the front, reserves,
  prisoners, civilians, neutrals even, the whole of humanity would
  have collapsed. Men would have perished in millions, as
  unfortunately occurred in Russia.</p>

  <p>And this is the ultimate lesson that our
  knowledge of the mode of transmission of typhus has taught us:
  Man carries on his skin a parasite, the louse. Civilization rids
  him of it. Should man regress, should he allow himself to
  resemble a primitive beast, the louse begins to multiply again
  and treats man as he deserves, as a brute beast.</p>

  <p>This conclusion would have endeared itself
  to the warm heart of Alfred Nobel. My contribution to it makes me
  feel less unworthy of the honour which you have conferred upon me
  in his name.</p>
