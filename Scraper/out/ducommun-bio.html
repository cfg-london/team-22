  <h1>&Eacute;lie Ducommun - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ducommun.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>&Eacute;lie
  Ducommun</b> (February 19, 1833-December 7, 1906), Swiss
  journalist, eloquent lecturer, business executive, steadfast
  advocate of peace, was born in Geneva, the son of a clock maker
  whose original home was in Neuch&acirc;tel. Early in his boyhood
  he gave evidence of his capacity to make the most of his
  remarkable talent and intelligence by intense application.<br>
  <br>
  Having completed his early studies in Geneva at the age of
  seventeen, he obtained a post as tutor for a wealthy family in
  Saxony, remaining there for three years and becoming expert in
  the German language. Upon returning to Geneva, he taught in the
  public schools for two years and then in 1855 at the age of
  twenty-two, began his journalistic career with the editorship of
  a political journal, the <i>Revue de Gen&egrave;ve</i>. In one way
  or another he was connected with journalistic enterprises for the
  rest of his life. In 1865 he moved to Bern where he founded the
  radical journal, <i>Der Fortschritt</i> [Progress], which was
  also published in French under the title <i>Progr&egrave;s</i>; in
  1871-1872, he edited <i>Helv&eacute;tie</i>; beginning in 1868, he
  edited the news sheet, <i>Les &Eacute;tats-Unis d'Europe</i>,
  published by the Ligue internationale de la paix et de la
  libert&eacute; [International League for Peace and Freedom]; and
  after 1891, as head of the <a href="../1910/index.html">Permanent
  Peace Bureau</a>, he prepared or edited innumerable appeals,
  pamphlets, reports, news sheets, and the like for the peace
  societies and the international peace congresses.<br>
  <br>
  He was, indeed, a &laquo;literary&raquo; man, absorbed for the most
  part in journalism but finding time, also, to publish poetry and
  to perform his duties as official translator for the National
  Council. August Schou, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute,
  points out that Ducommun's writing often showed &laquo;striking
  acuity of thought&raquo;, citing a dialogue he wrote in 1901 in
  which he refutes the notion current in that day that a war
  between major powers would be short because of the
  destructiveness of modern weapons, and predicts, in its stead, a
  long &laquo;war of attrition with alternating advances and
  retreats, and with operations bound up with a system of trenches
  and strongpoints&raquo;<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Ducommun was also a political figure of some consequence. In Bern
  he was a member of the Grand Council for ten years; in Geneva,
  prior to his leaving in 1865, he was a member of the Grand
  Council for nine years, becoming vice-chancellor in 1857 and
  chancellor of state of Geneva in 1862.<br>
  <br>
  He was a business executive as well. For thirty years, beginning
  in 1875, he was secretary-general of the Jura-Bern-Lucerne
  railroad, or as it was later called after a merger, the
  Jura-Simplon line. This position required, according to <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy</a>, &laquo;the
  rarest qualities of exactitude, order, activity, and
  firmness&raquo;<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>. When the line
  was purchased by the state in 1903, Ducommun resigned.<br>
  <br>
  Ducommun, meanwhile, gave virtually every spare moment at his
  disposal to his work for peace, most notably after 1890 when he
  consented to organize and to direct the International Bureau of
  Peace. From the inception of the Bureau until his death, Ducommun
  devoted himself, at his own insistence without remuneration, to
  carrying out its purposes of uniting the many different peace
  societies throughout the world, preserving archives, preparing
  for the congresses, implementing their decisions, and acting as a
  clearinghouse for all kinds of information about peace and the
  activities on its behalf.<br>
  <br>
  &Eacute;lie Ducommun died at the age of seventy-three of a disease
  of the heart and lungs.</p>
