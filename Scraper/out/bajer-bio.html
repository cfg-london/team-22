  <h1>Fredrik Bajer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bajer.jpg" class="bio-img">The Danish
  pacifist, <b>Fredrik Bajer</b> (April 21, 1837-January 22, 1922),
  was born in Vester Egede, near Naestved, Denmark. The son of a
  clergyman named Alfred Beyer, he adopted the altered spelling of
  his surname in 1865.<br>
  <br>
  Bajer entered the Sor&oslash; Academy in 1848 and six years later a
  military school. In 1856 he joined the army as a lieutenant in
  the Dragoons, stationed first in Naestved and then in Holstein,
  interrupting his service for two years in 1860 to take advanced
  courses in another military school. During the 1864 war against
  Prussia and Austria, he commanded troops in northern Jutland,
  winning attention by his ability and conduct and earning
  promotion to the rank of first lieutenant. Despite his record, he
  was discharged from the army in June of 1865 during a general
  reduction of troops at the end of the war. Even before his
  dismissal, however, he had begun to think, as his autobiography
  shows, that he was more cut out for a philosophical than for a
  military way of life.<br>
  <br>
  Between the ages of twenty-eight and thirty-five, Bajer laid the
  foundations of his later career. He studied languages, mastering
  French, Norwegian, and Swedish; established himself as a teacher
  and translator in Copenhagen; supplemented his income by
  free-lance writing; spoke and wrote on the subjects which were
  thereafter to claim the major share of his attention; and entered
  politics in 1872. In that year he was elected to the Folketing,
  the Danish House of Representatives, retaining his seat there for
  the next twenty-three years.<br>
  <br>
  In politics Bajer displayed liberal tendencies, but, disliking
  party discipline, remained independent of political affiliation.
  The main causes he supported in his political life were those
  with which he had already become prominently identified:
  international peace and Danish neutrality, Scandinavian unity,
  women's rights, and education.<br>
  <br>
  In the field of education, Bajer was professionally interested in
  linguistics, particularly in orthography and phonation, but he
  was concerned with school organization as well; he was a member
  of the governing board of the Pedagogical Society and played an
  important role in the first Scandinavian conference of schoolmen
  held in G&ouml;teborg in 1870.<br>
  <br>
  Bajer was one of Denmark's leading spokesmen for women's rights
  helping to found the Dansk Kvindesamfund [Danish Women's Society]
  in 1871 and supporting legislation in the Folketing on behalf of
  equality for women, especially in economic matters.<br>
  <br>
  In 1870 Bajer started the Nordisk Fristats Samfund [Society of
  Nordic Free States], dedicated to the promotion of Nordic unity
  and cooperation, and for two years edited its weekly journal
  <i>Folkevennen</i> [Friend of the People]. Eventually, his ideas
  on Scandinavian unity became inextricably associated with his
  evolving ideas on neutrality and peace.<br>
  <br>
  Bajer was introduced to the organized peace movement of his day
  through his study of languages and became especially interested
  in the efforts of the French peace leader, <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy</a>, and the work
  of the Ligue intenationale et permanente de la paix founded in
  1867, offering his help in distributing its literature.
  Perceiving one aspect of peace in terms of neutrality, he founded
  the first Danish peace society in 1882 under the name Foreningen
  til Danmarks Neutralisering [Society for Promotion of Danish
  Neutrality], serving as its president until 1892. (Later this
  association became the Danish Peace Society, and still later the
  Danish Peace and League of Nations Society.) Using his military
  training to advantage, he cited the danger the Nordic countries
  faced in the event of a European war because of the strategic
  importance of the water routes adjacent to their borders and
  proposed that Scandinavian neutrality, modeled on that of
  Switzerland and Belgium, be internationally recognized. Between
  1883 and 1889 his proposal was adopted in principle by several
  international organizations, but later Bajer came to believe that
  neutrality should be a way of life for Denmark to pursue
  independently without relying on other states to guarantee
  it.<br>
  <br>
  Bajer rapidly became a major figure in the flourishing
  international peace movement. He participated in the European
  Peace Congress at Bern in 1884, shared the initiative with those
  who called the first Scandinavian Peace Meeting in 1885, attended
  the first regular World Peace Congress at Paris in 1889 and
  regularly represented the Danish Peace Society at the congresses
  until 1914, and also in 1889 attended the first meeting of the
  Interparliamentary
  Union held in Paris. At the second World Peace Congress in
  London in 1890, Bajer proposed the creation of a permanent
  bureau, with headquarters in Bern, to act as a focus for the
  peace movement and a clearinghouse for pacifist information. The
  proposal was approved in 1891 at the congress in Rome, and Bajer
  was named the first president of its governing board. Bajer
  founded the Danish Interparliamentary Group in 1891, acting as
  its secretary for twenty-five years, and prepared the way for the
  creation of the Scandinavian Interparliamentary Union in
  1908.<br>
  <br>
  Believing that arbitration was a mechanism which could
  satisfactorily supplant that of war in settling differences among
  nations, Bajer guided through the Danish Parliament in 1888, a
  carefully, if somewhat cautiously, worded proposal to establish
  arbitration agreements with Sweden and Norway.<br>
  <br>
  To his active participation in all these causes Bajer constantly
  added the support of his writing, publishing many articles,
  pamphlets, and books in the course of his activity.<br>
  <br>
  After 1907, Bajer's health deteriorated. In that year he resigned
  from active office on the board of the Peace Bureau to become its
  honorary president, and in 1916 from his various duties in
  connection with the Interparliamentary work. An invalid in his
  last years, he still kept informed on world events and, even
  while observing World War I, resolutely maintained his faith in
  the pacifist cause. He died in Copenhagen in 1922.</p>
