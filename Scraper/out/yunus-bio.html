<p><img src="yunus.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>&quot;Banker to the Poor&quot;</b><br>
  Professor Muhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh
in 1983, fueled by the belief that credit is a fundamental human right. His
objective was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing loans on
terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles
so they could help themselves.</p>

<p>From Dr. Yunus' personal loan of small amounts of money to destitute basketweavers
in Bangladesh in the mid-70s, the Grameen Bank has advanced
to the forefront of a burgeoning world movement toward eradicating poverty
through microlending. Replicas of the Grameen Bank model operate in
more than 100 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>Born in 1940 in the seaport city of Chittagong, Professor Yunus studied
at Dhaka University in Bangladesh, then received a Fulbright scholarship to
study economics at Vanderbilt University. He received his Ph.D. in economics
from Vanderbilt in 1969 and the following year became an assistant professor
of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. Returning to Bangladesh,
Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University.</p>

<p>From 1993 to 1995, Professor Yunus was a member of the International
Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, a post to
which he was appointed by the UN secretary general. He has served on the
Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable
Economic Development and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.</p>
