  <h1>Louis de Broglie - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="broglie.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie</b> of
  the French Academy, Permanent Secretary of the Academy of
  Sciences, and Professor at the Faculty of Sciences at Paris
  University, was born at Dieppe (Seine Inf&eacute;rieure) on 15th
  August, 1892, the son of Victor, Duc de Broglie and Pauline
  d'Armaill&eacute;. After studying at the Lyc&eacute;e Janson of
  Sailly, he passed his school-leaving certificate in 1909. He
  applied himself first to literary studies and took his degree in
  history in 1910. Then, as his liking for science prevailed, he
  studied for a science degree, which he gained in 1913. He was
  then conscripted for military service and posted to the wireless
  section of the army, where he remained for the whole of the war
  of 1914-1918. During this period he was stationed at the Eiffel
  Tower, where he devoted his spare time to the study of technical
  problems. At the end of the war Louis de Broglie resumed his
  studies of general physics. While taking an interest in the
  experimental work carried out by his elder brother, Maurice, and
  co-workers, he specialized in theoretical physics and, in
  particular, in the study of problems involving quanta. In 1924 at
  the Faculty of Sciences at Paris University he delivered a thesis
  <i>Recherches sur la Th&eacute;orie des Quanta</i> (Researches on
  the quantum theory), which gained him his doctor's degree. This
  thesis contained a series of important findings which he had
  obtained in the course of about two years. The ideas set out in
  that work, which first gave rise to astonishment owing to their
  novelty, were subsequently fully confirmed by the discovery of
  electron diffraction by crystals in 1927 by <a href=
  "../1937/index.html">Davisson</a> and Germer; they served as the
  basis for developing the general theory nowadays known by the
  name of <i>wave mechanics</i>, a theory which has utterly
  transformed our knowledge of physical phenomena on the atomic
  scale.<br>
  <br>
  After the maintaining of his thesis and while continuing to
  publish original work on the new mechanics, Louis de Broglie took
  up teaching duties. On completion of two year's free lectures at
  the Sorbonne he was appointed to teach theoretical physics at the
  Institut Henri Poincar&eacute; which had just been built in Paris.
  The purpose of that Institute is to teach and develop
  mathematical and theoretical physics. The incumbent of the chair
  of theoretical physics at the Faculty of Sciences at the
  University of Paris since 1932, Louis de Broglie runs a course on
  a different subject each year at the Institut Henri
  Poincar&eacute;, and several of these courses have been published.
  Many French and foreign students have come to work with him and a
  great deal of doctorate theses have been prepared under his
  guidance.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1930 and 1950, Louis de Broglie's work has been chiefly
  devoted to the study of the various extensions of wave mechanics:
  Dirac's electron theory, the new theory of light, the general
  theory of spin particles, applications of wave mechanics to
  nuclear physics, etc. He has published numerous notes and several
  papers on this subject, and is the author of more than
  twenty-five books on the fields of his particular
  interests.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1951, together with young colleagues, Louis de Broglie has
  resumed the study of an attempt which he made in 1927 under the
  name of the <i>theory of the double solution</i> to give a causal
  interpretation to wave mechanics in the classical terms of space
  and time, an attempt which he had then abandoned in the face of
  the almost universal adherence of physicists to the purely
  probabilistic interpretation of <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">Born</a>, <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Bohr</a>, and <a href=
  "../1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a>. Back again in this his
  former field of research, he has obtained a certain number of new
  and encouraging results which he has published in notes to
  <i>Comptes Rendus de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</i> and in
  various expositions.<br>
  <br>
  After crowning Louis de Broglie's work on two occasions, the
  Academie des Sciences awarded him in 1929 the Henri Poincar&eacute;
  medal (awarded for the first time), then in 1932, the Albert I of
  Monaco prize. In 1929 the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/broglie-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> conferred on him the
  Nobel Prize for Physics "for his discovery of the wave nature of
  electrons". In 1952 the first Kalinga Prize was awarded to him by
  UNESCO for
  his efforts to explain aspects of modern physics to the layman.
  In 1956 he received the gold medal of the French National
  Scientific Research Centre. He has made major contributions to
  the fostering of international scientific co-operation.<br>
  <br>
  Elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of the French
  Institute in 1933, Louis de Broglie has been its Permanent
  Secretary for the mathematical sciences since 1942. He has been a
  member of the Bureau des Longitudes since 1944. He holds the
  Grand Cross of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur and is an Officer of the
  Order of Leopold of Belgium. He is an honorary doctor of the
  Universities of
  Warsaw, Bucharest, Athens, Lausanne, Quebec, and Brussels, and a member of eighteen foreign academies
  in Europe, India, and the U.S.A.<br>
