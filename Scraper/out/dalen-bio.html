  <h1>Gustaf Dal&eacute;n - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dalen.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Nils Gustaf Dal&eacute;n</b> was born
  at Stenstorp in Skaraborg, Sweden on November 30, 1869, the son
  of a farmer. After his preliminary education, he entered a School
  of Agriculture to study dairy farming but he was later advised by
  Gustaf de Laval, who recognized his natural gift for mechanics,
  to seek a technical education. He prepared himself for the
  Chalmers
  Institute at Gothenburg and gained admission in 1892. He
  graduated as an engineer in 1896 and spent a year in Switzerland,
  studying under Professor Stodola at the Eidgen&ouml;ssisches
  Polytechnikum.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to Sweden, Dal&eacute;n carried out some research at
  Gothenburg and set up as a consulting engineer. He became
  Technical Chief of the Svenska Karbid- och Acetylen A.B. (Swedish
  Carbide and Acetylene, Ltd.) in 1901 and he later joined the Gas
  Accumulator Company where he became Chief Engineer in 1906. In
  1909, the company was reorganized as Svenska Aktiebolaget
  Gasaccumulator (AGA) (Swedish Gas Accumulator Ltd.) with
  Dal&eacute;n as Managing Director.<br>
  <br>
  Dal&eacute;n's inventiveness first showed in his early days on his
  father's farm when he built a threshing machine powered by an old
  spinning wheel. He contrived a device to indicate the butterfat
  content of milk and thereby made his contact with de Laval. On
  completion of his advanced education, he worked on the
  construction of a hot-air turbine and related air compressors and
  pumps. He also invented a pasteurization apparatus and a milking
  machine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1901, Dal&eacute;n's company purchased the patent rights of the
  French invention of dissolved acetylene and he began his work on
  automatic flashing beacons for lighthouses. His subsequent
  invention of the sun-valve, which causes a beacon to light
  automatically at dusk and extinguish itself at dawn, enabled
  lighthouses to function perfectly and unattended for periods of
  up to a year. His invention of cylinder filled with a porous mass
  of asbestos and diatomaceous earth for storage of acetylene
  reduced considerably the hazards in handling this material and
  its use in welding became safe. He also invented a mixer for
  providing a constant and correct balance of gas and air for use
  in the incandescent mantle and a device for removing broken
  mantles and replacing them by new ones.<br>
  <br>
  In 1912, whilst testing safety devices on cylinders of acetylene
  in an outdoor location, and when satisfactory safety precautions
  had been taken, a sudden explosion seriously injured Dal&eacute;n
  and caused the loss of his eyesight. He recovered from his other
  injuries and overcoming his great incapacity, continued his
  researches. He was awarded the contract for lighting the Panama
  Canal and later turned to the field of thermal technics to invent
  a stove, now in universal use, which maintains cooking heat for
  24 hours using only eight pounds of coal.<br>
  <br>
  Dal&eacute;n's writings were few, but he left his mark in a
  practical way by the provision of light, and therefore safety,
  for the benefit of travellers by land, sea and air.<br>
  <br>
  Amongst the many distinctions conferred upon Dal&eacute;n are
  membership of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1912/dalen-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences</a>, 1913, and the
  Academy of Science and Engineering, 1919. He was made Honorary
  Doctor of Lund
  University in 1918 and received the Morehead Medal of the
  International Acetylene Association. He took part in debates at
  the National Society of Economics and served on the Liding&ouml;
  City Council for almost twenty years.<br>
  <br>
  Dal&eacute;n married Elma Persson in 1901. They had two sons and
  two daughters. Their eldest son, Gunnar, qualified as an engineer
  and followed his father as a Director of AGA; their younger son,
  Anders, became a Doctor of Medicine; Gustaf's brother Albin, a
  famous ophthalmologist, was a Professor at the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1912/dalen-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se" target="_blank">Caroline Institute</a>.</p>

  <p>Dal&eacute;n died on December 9, 1937, in his
  villa at Liding&ouml;.</p>
