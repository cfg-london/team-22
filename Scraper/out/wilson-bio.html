  <h1>Woodrow Wilson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wilson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Thomas
  Woodrow Wilson</b> (December 28, 1856-February 3, 1924) was born
  in Staunton, Virginia, to parents of a predominantly Scottish
  heritage. Since his father was a Presbyterian minister and his
  mother the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, Woodrow was
  raised in a pious and academic household. He spent a year at
  Davidson
  College in North Carolina and three at Princeton
  University where he received a baccalaureate degree in
  1879.<br>
  <br>
  After graduating from the Law School of the University of
  Virginia<a href="#not">*</a>, he practiced law for a year in Atlanta, Georgia,
  but it was a feeble practice. He entered graduate studies at
  Johns Hopkins
  University in 1883 and three years later received the
  doctorate. In 1885 he published <i>Congressional Government</i>,
  a splendid piece of scholarship which analyzes the difficulties
  arising from the separation of the legislative and executive
  powers in the American Constitution.<br>
  <br>
  Before joining the faculty of Princeton University as a professor
  of jurisprudence and political economy, Wilson taught for three
  years at Bryn
  Mawr College and for two years at Wesleyan College.
  He was enormously successful as a lecturer and productive as a
  scholar.<br>
  <br>
  As president of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910, Wilson
  became widely known for his ideas on reforming education. In
  pursuit of his idealized intellectual life for democratically
  chosen students, he wanted to change the admission system, the
  pedagogical system, the social system, even the architectural
  layout of the campus. But Wilson was a thinker who needed to act.
  So he entered politics and as governor of the State of New Jersey
  from 1911 to 1913 distinguished himself once again as a
  reformer.<br>
  <br>
  Wilson won the presidential election of 1912 when William
  Howard Taft and <a href="../1906/index.html">Theodore
  Roosevelt</a> split the Republican vote. Upon taking office he
  set about instituting the reforms he had outlined in his book
  <i>The New Freedom</i>, including the changing of the tariff, the
  revising of the banking system, the checking of monopolies and
  fraudulent advertising, the prohibiting of unfair business
  practices, and the like.<br>
  <br>
  But the attention of this man of peace was forced to turn to war.
  In the early days of World War I, Wilson was determined to
  maintain neutrality. He protested British as well as German acts;
  he offered mediation to both sides but was rebuffed. The American
  electorate in 1916, reacting to the slogan &laquo;He kept us out
  of war&raquo;, reelected Wilson to the presidency. However, in
  1917 the issue of freedom of the seas compelled a decisive
  change. On January 31 Germany announced that &laquo;unrestricted
  submarine warfare&raquo; was already started; on March 27, after
  four American ships had been sunk, Wilson decided to ask for a
  declaration of war; on April 2 he made the formal request to
  Congress; and on April 6 the Congress granted it.<br>
  <br>
  Wilson never doubted the outcome. He mobilized a nation - its
  manpower, its industry, its commerce, its agriculture. He was
  himself the chief mover in the propaganda war. His speech to
  Congress on January 8, 1918, on the &laquo;Fourteen Points&raquo;
  was a decisive stroke in winning that war, for people everywhere
  saw in his peace aims the vision of a world in which freedom,
  justice, and peace could flourish.<br>
  <br>
  Although at the apogee of his fame when the 1919 Peace Conference
  assembled in Versailles, Wilson failed to carry his total
  conception of an ideal peace, but he did secure the adoption of
  the Covenant of the League of Nations. His major failure,
  however, was suffered at home when the Senate declined to approve
  American acceptance of the League of Nations. This stunning
  defeat resulted from his losing control of Congress after he had
  made the congressional election of 1918 virtually a vote of
  confidence, from his failure to appoint to the American peace
  delegation those who could speak for the Republican Party or for
  the Senate, from his unwillingness to compromise when some minor
  compromises might well have carried the day, from his physical
  incapacity in the days just prior to the vote.<br>
  <br>
  The cause of this physical incapacity was the strain of the
  massive effort he made to obtain the support of the American
  people for the ratification of the Covenant of the League. After
  a speech in Pueblo, Colorado, on September 25, 1919, he collapsed
  and a week later suffered a cerebral haemorrhage from the effects
  of which he never fully recovered. An invalid, he completed the
  remaining seventeen months of his term of office and lived in
  retirement for the last three years of his life.</p>
