<h1>Thomas A. Steitz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="steitz.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1940, and my family lived in an apartment
above a paint store in the downtown area until 1949. Although my father
had obtained a law degree from Marquette University in Milwaukee, he
became the administrator in charge of personnel at the Milwaukee County
Hospital. My mother grew up on a farm in Waukesha county outside of
Milwaukee and graduated from Carol College, a small college in Waukesha.
My mother devoted her time to all of the domestic chores required for raising
a family which eventually grew to five children &ndash; two younger brothers
and two younger sisters. My father's parents lived about 20 blocks away and
my mother's parents and her brother's family lived on the family farm in
Waukesha county.</p>
<p>I attended elementary school at the Elm Street School, an old brick building
  with an asphalt playground located a few blocks from our apartment. I
  did not like the school much and often got beaten up by a bunch of slightly
  older guys on my way home from school. My report card, which I brought
  home for my parents' signatures at the end of second grade, showed grades
  that were just above failure. My parents were upset and asked what I was going
  to do to change, and I said that I did not really care about the grades.
  My mother (I think) then applied the &quot;board of education&quot; to the &quot;seat of
  knowledge&quot; &ndash; my first and last spanking. This was definitely the low point of
  my academic career.</p>
<p>In the middle of my third grade school year we moved from 27th Street to a
  new house on 75th Street in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa and my life
  was transformed, academically and in all other ways. My teachers, schools and
  classmates were all marvelous in grade school, junior high and high school.
  The Roosevelt grade school playground had tennis courts and a grass playing
  field, on which a large skating rink was made every winter with a warming hut
  and outside lights added. Almost every evening in the winter I would go skating
  for hours with friends playing team skating games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visits to my grandfather's farm during the 1940s and 50s played an important
  role in my life in that period. His farm was what is referred to as a &quot;truck
  farm&quot; where he grew vegetables, mostly radishes, carrots and onions. In the
  WWII years, however, he had a cow for milk, cream and cheese and a picture
  from about 1941 shows me with my grandfather and his cow (Fig. 1). My family
  made frequent visits to the farm, which was only about a 30 minutes drive
  from Wauwatosa. A picture of my parents and their five children standing in
  front of my grandfather's green Hudson car, taken in about 1952, shows a
harvested wheat field and one of my grandmother's gardens (Fig. 2).</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my early teenage years I spent most of my summer school vacation
working in the fields on my grandfather's and uncle's farm. I worked
with many other kids, bunching radishes and weeding 20 acres of onions.
Work would start just after sunrise at about 5:00 a.m. and continue to late
afternoon every day, except Saturday. (The market was closed on Sunday.)
I received 5 cents per dozen bunches of radishes and often tied as many as
100 dozen. I used the money to buy myself a new saxophone, a bicycle and a
tennis racquet and save money for college.</p>
<p>The junior and senior high schools were about a 20 minute walk away and
  introduced me to an additional set of classmates and importantly to music,
  art and shop besides the academic courses. The shop courses in junior high
  included electricity and magnetism, where I made an electric motor from
  scratch, winding the wire coils and making all of the connections. In the
  woodworking shop I made a coffee table for the family. In the plastics shop I
  made letter openers and light stands. I do not remember what I did in metal
  working. I have found that the basic skills in working with tools and materials
  that I learned in the shop courses have proven invaluable for me in subsequent
  years, at home and in the laboratory, including constructing models of
  proteins. I think it is unfortunate that such courses have been eliminated in
  many schools today as being unnecessary or too expensive.</p>
<p>I developed a serious interest in music in junior high school, where I
  joined the band and the choir. On the first day of band practice I brought
  my father's C melody saxophone to the band leader, who told me it would
  not work in the band but lent me the school's E flat alto-saxophone. I became a very serious saxophone player and in high school played solos, duets,
  quartets as well as organizing a big band style dance band in addition to
  playing in the school band. I practiced one to two hours a day at home and
  won a number of &quot;gold&quot; medals at state contests when I was in high school.
  I seriously considered becoming a musician, but then concluded I could do
  music as a hobby if I went into science, but could not do science as a hobby
  if I went into music.</p>
<p>My grades in Longfellow Junior High School were mostly B's during my
  first two years &ndash; good but not great. Then, my younger brother Dick entered
  junior high during the middle of my second year, and he got straight A's.
  This was a wake up call for me and the competition was on. I believe I got
  mostly A's the next year. I did much better in high school, graduating 8th in a
  class of over 300. Competition can be motivating in the classroom as well as
  on the tennis court.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the students in all of my courses in high school were separated
  according to their academic ability in a particular field. Thus, the very best
  25&ndash;30 students of the 300 total were in my math, science and English classes.
  This, of course, meant that the teacher could instruct us at a much higher
  level than if the students in the classroom were a random selection from the
  whole class, and we learned from and were challenged by our fellow students.
  I particularly remember how extraordinarily good the girls were in my math
  classes &ndash; only two or three of the top ten were boys. I have never had any
  doubt that women are as good at or better than men in math, contrary to
  the impressions of a former president of Harvard. I think it is very unfortunate
  that many, if not most, high schools (like the one in my home town of
  Branford, CT) no longer separate students by ability; this does not motivate
  or properly educate the very best students.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence College</strong><br>
  My choice of what college to attend was heavily influenced by my best high
  school friend, Alex Wilde, and most importantly, by his mother. My father
  wanted me to attend Marquette University or the University of Wisconsin,
  Milwaukee, neither of which appealed to me. I had gotten to know the Wilde
  family very well, particularly Alex's mother whose father was the then Senator
  Wiley from Wisconsin. She suggested that I apply to Lawrence College where
  Alex was intending to go, and since I could not afford the tuition, that
  I should apply for a scholarship, which I did. I received a full tuition
  scholarship for four years and upon visiting Lawrence College I knew where
I wanted to go to college &ndash; an important choice.</p>
<p>My four years at Lawrence College changed my life, my view of the world
  and my professional direction. Since Lawrence is a liberal arts school, I was
  required to take many humanities courses to supplement what turned out
  to be my major in chemistry. These courses began with what was called a
  Freshman Studies course which was a broad based reading, discussion and writing course on many classical books. We learned to ask as well as answer
  questions. Importantly, we were also required to take a philosophy course,
  a scholarly based (e.g., Niebuhr, etc.) religion course, and an anthropology
  course, as well as English, History and language courses. I entered Lawrence
  with a heavy religious background and left it with an entirely different understanding
  of the origins of religious beliefs, their veracity and their roles in
  cultures. Lawrence also has a music school so that I was able to continue my
  love of music by participating in the band, orchestra and choir.</p>
<p>While I had many wonderful, inspiring teachers at Lawrence, the person
  who had by far the greatest influence in inspiring me to pursue a career in
  science, and in particular chemistry, was Professor Robert Rosenberg, or Bob
  as I can now call him (Fig. 3a). I still recall the early lectures in his introductory
  chemistry course where he introduced to us the concepts of atomic
  orbitals and bonding and how studying chemistry at the physical chemical
  atomic level allowed us to understand the properties of chemicals, such as
  their color. It was a wonderful revelation to me about how the world around
  me could be understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had several opportunities to work on research projects in laboratories outside
Lawrence. The first opportunity, which was arranged by Bob Rosenberg,
was to spend the summer between my junior and senior years doing research
in the biochemistry laboratory of Lorazo Lorand at Northwestern University.
My project was a kinetic study (determine kcat and Km) of the hydrolysis
of a variety of para-nitrophenyl ester substrate analogues by chymotrypsin,
trypsin and thrombin. After making the measurements, I started the calculations,
which seemed tedious. I then decided to write a computer program
(my first) to process the data on the university IBM 650. The process went
so quickly that I finished my summer project two weeks early and asked what
I should do next. I was told to do some organic synthesis of a new substrate
compound, which I began. While working in the hood with some organic
solvents, in the presence of a lit Bunsen burner, the solvents, not surprisingly
in retrospect, exploded (fortunately without any injury), and that ended the
organic chemistry phase of my research career.</p>
<p>The end of summer before my senior year in 1961, I was invited to
  participate in a two week conference at MIT for selected science students
  from small colleges. This unique meeting was organized and paid for by the
  American Biophysical Society in order to encourage students to consider the
  field of biophysics (of which I had never heard). Four students each from
  about two dozen top small colleges were invited to participate, all expenses
  paid. It was my first trip on an airplane and my first trip outside of Wisconsin,
  except for Chicago. The venue consisted of lectures on a broad range of
  biophysical topics by faculty, mostly, but not exclusively, from Harvard and
  MIT. I remember one of the organizers, J. Oncley, sitting in the audience
  with the most wrinkled plaid sport coat I had ever seen. Most memorable, not
  only for its exciting content, was a lecture by Alex Rich. His lecture was truly
  inspiring and in an area of research I pursued years later. He was dressed in
  a fine dark suit (not today's lecture garb) with a white shirt and tie. Another
  important lecture for me was given by Paul Doty from Harvard on biophysical
  studies of nucleic acids, which was one of the reasons for my later wanting
  to attend Harvard. Students at the conference also had a great opportunity
  to interact with each other and go out to dinner together in various parts
  of Boston and Cambridge. I particularly remember dining with three Reed
  College students, who included Don Engelman and Mark Ptashne, as well as
  a few others who subsequently became fellow graduate students at Harvard.
  This two-week meeting was possibly inspired in part by the Kennedy call to
  respond to Sputnik. It was a truly important event for influencing the career
  choices of many of us, but unfortunately was not repeated.</p>
<p>In the fall of my senior year I participated in a research program for
  selected students sponsored by the Midwestern small colleges at Argonne
  National Laboratory. I lived on the lab grounds and worked on a chemistry
  project that I neither liked nor remember. All I remember of the dull semester
  was my first opportunity to see the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet and marvel at
  the ability of the male dancers to leap across the stage. During the summer
  between Lawrence and starting studies at Harvard I worked for Dupont on another forgettable project, measuring the dynamic stretching modulus of
  various synthetic cloth materials being considered for use in making bras.
  Unfortunately, I was not invited to join the group that evaluated the final
  product being modeled.</p>
<p><strong>Harvard University</strong><br>
  I went to Harvard as a graduate student to work on biophysical studies of
  nucleic acids, but fortunately, chose a different pathway. In the spring of my
  first year in 1963, I attended three Dunham lectures given by Max Perutz (Fig. 3E) in which he presented the first atomic resolution protein crystal
  structure, that of myoglobin. He showed stereo slides, and I was stunned
  to see the atomic structure of myoglobin pop out in three dimensions over
  Max's head; this was clearly the way to understand how macromolecules carry
  out their biological functions. Shortly thereafter, while playing tennis with a
  Lipscomb graduate student (Peter Boer), I mentioned how unfortunate it
  was that no one was doing protein crystallography at Harvard. He said on
  the contrary, the &quot;Colonel&quot;, as Bill Lipscomb (Fig. 3B) was referred to by his
  students and postdocs since he was from Kentucky, had a group who were
  working on the crystal structure of bovine carboxypeptidase A (CPA). Shortly
  thereafter I made my way to the Colonel's office, a little nervous because
  I had already been turned down (fortunately) by another faculty member,
  in order to make an appointment to see him. He was standing in the office
  of his secretary, who was not there, and when I asked if I could make an
  appointment to see him, he invited me right in. After he described the CPA
  project, I excitedly asked if I could join the project, and he said yes. So, I had
  just received the wonderful opportunity to join the Colonel's army, and the
rest is history.</p>
<p>The CPA team consisted of five postdocs at that time, of whom Martha
  Ludwig was the most important for my training. I worked with her on
  structural studies of substrate and inhibitor complexes of CPA as well as with
  the whole group on the determination of the crystal structure of the apo protein.
  I remember being excited at one time when we succeeded in collecting
  5,000 reflections in one week using the Hilger-Watts linear diffractometer.
  Now, of course, we can collect 5,000,000 reflections from ribosome crystals
  of the ribosome in an hour (about a factor of 105 faster for an assembly that
  is about 80 times larger). All computer programs were written in Fortran
  for an IBM 7094 computer that had 32 K of memory, had no discs and used
  computer cards. The advantage of the latter was that we could save the
  used cards and sell them as used paper in order to support lab parties
  every few months. (I always thought we should have written a program called
  GENCARD to increase the party frequency.)</p>
<p>Because of the superb team that the Colonel assembled and his encouraging
  management style, the project moved on well. In 1966 we published
  a 6 &Aring; resolution map, including a model of the polypeptide backbone that
  I had over-optimistically built, but showing many of its structural features. Martha and I, with postdoc Flo Quiocho, published a low resolution map of
  an inhibitor complex that showed the first example of a substrate induced
  conformational change. In 1967 we obtained what I realize in retrospect was
  a superb 2.0 &Aring; resolution electron density map of the apo-CPA that allowed
  us to correctly position every residue of the polypeptide backbone, even in
  the absence of an amino acid sequence. CPA tied in 1967 with three other
  proteins, RNase A, RNase S and chymotrypsin, for being the third highresolution
  protein structure determined after myoglobin and lysozyme.</p>
<p>Unlike PIs today, the Colonel was almost never absent from the lab to
  attend meetings and present seminars. He did, however, take a sabbatical
  in England, and while he was gone, I came up with the idea of using direct
  methods to phase the F<sub>derivative</sub>-F<sub>native</sub> difference coefficients in order to
  calculate a projection difference Fourier map, which clearly showed the
  heavy atom positions. When I showed him the paper I had written on the
  work upon his return, he allowed me to publish the paper in <em>Acta Cryst</em>. without
  his being a co-author, also not a common practice among PIs today.</p>
<p>The Colonel provided me with what turned out to be a great opportunity
  that had an important impact on my future faculty job opportunities when
  he arranged for me to give a talk at the Protein Gordon Conference, which
  was chaired by Fred Richards in the summer of 1966. I talked about the
  CPA structure and the conformational change produced by substrate or
  inhibitor binding, the concept of induced fit. Dan Koshland was a participant
  and greatly appreciated this new experimental evidence for his hypothesis
  of substrate-induced conformational changes. I assume that my talk and
  opportunity to meet him partly motivated his advocating that the Berkeley
  Biochemistry Department interview me and offer me a faculty position,
  which they did, and I accepted in the late spring of 1967. Due to the reluctance
  of the Department to consider hiring a woman for a faculty position
  (Joan) in 1970, I resigned my Berkeley position after two months on the
  faculty and accepted a position at Yale offered by Fred Richards.</p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge</strong><br>
  After Harvard and before going to Berkeley I spent 3 years at the MRC laboratory
  of Molecular Biology in Cambridge from 1967 to 1970 in the group
  of David Blow. He was recommended to me by Hilary Muirhead, who was a
  postdoc with the Colonel and a former student with Max Perutz. In David's
  lab I worked with Richard Henderson on determining the structure of
chymotrypsin complexes with substrates.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology was a completely unique
  and outstanding laboratory. It inspired and trained a very large group
  of postdocs from the U.S. in molecular and structural biology who then
  returned and transformed these fields in the U.S. Perhaps the most remarkable
  and unique feature of the laboratory was the canteen located on the top
  floor which provided coffee in the morning, lunch after mid-day and tea in the afternoon. The attraction was definitely not the &quot;bangers&quot; or, the &quot;toad
  in the hole&quot; or other culinary opportunities, but sitting down with a random
  collection of lab directors, postdocs and graduate students and talking about
  science. The canteen was set up by Max and run by his wife, Gisela. When I
  first arrived, it was so small that whenever I got through the food line, there
  were only a few empty seats. Consequently, I would have to sit at a table
  that might include Max, Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner (Fig. 3E) at it
  as well as postdocs and students. Within about two months I had met nearly
  everyone in the whole laboratory. The conversations were always about science
  and about experiments, never about the movie someone saw the previous
  night. Everyone contributed suggestions and/or criticisms. Initially I
  wondered how anyone got any experiments done since they were spending
  so much time in the canteen, and then I realized that the many discussions
  reduced the number of unwise or unnecessary experiments that were done
  and enhanced the good ones.</p>
<p>There were no weekly group meetings, but there was an annual one-week
  meeting for essentially everyone in the LMB which was generally known as
  &quot;Crick week&quot;. Francis would sit in the front row and frequently ask many
  questions. On one occasion I remember Fred Sanger presenting a talk on
  his recent research and in the middle Francis jumped up and said &quot;Fred,
  if you did (this) and (this) and (this), then you would be able to find out
  (that) and (that)&quot;. Fred, without taking his hand off the chalkboard turned
  toward Francis and said, &quot;That's it, Francis, that's it; you've got it&quot;, and then
  carried on. Since Crick week included a broad range of molecular and
  structural biology topics, it was very useful that directors in the front row
  would ask questions that many of us were reluctant to ask. During one
  lecture that involved a comparison of a process that occurs both in eucaryotes
  and procaryotes, Max asked, &quot;What is a eucaryote and what is a procaryote?&quot;,
  terms that were just beginning to be used. I was glad that Max asked the
  questions, since I had no idea what the terms meant. Sydney Brenner would
  have coffee available in his lab dishwashing kitchen on Saturday morning
  about 10:30 or so and would always be there with the postdocs and students
  from the molecular biology floor directed by himself and Francis, plus
  others of us who wanted to drop by. Sydney would invariably hold forth on
  some interesting topic with lots of funny stories and &quot;one-liners&quot;.</p>
<p>I learned about all of the major research problems being pursued at the
  LMB from Crick week, the canteen, Saturday coffee and the random conversations
  in the hall, as well as the quick evening trip to the pub for &quot;last call&quot;,
  which the American postdocs did. (The Brits were mostly not there at night.)
  It was at this time that I developed my interests in trying to understand the
  structural bases of the mechanisms by which the many proteins and nucleic
  acids that are involved in &quot;Crick's Central Dogma&quot; carry out their functions:
  how DNA is copied into DNA, DNA transcribed into RNA and finally the
  RNA translated to protein.</p>
<p>Access to computing facilities was extremely limited at Cambridge. The
  LMB used the computer owned by the Cambridge University astronomy department, and we were allowed to make only two submissions a day for
  the five working days, and the morning run could not take more than two
  minutes. I would check and recheck the computer cards I was submitting to
  eliminate as many mistakes as possible, because otherwise one of 10 opportunities
  would be lost to me for the week. In retrospect, it is amazing that we
  were able to accomplish anything. Certainly, the timescale was longer.</p>
<p>At some point in my second year Brian Hartley (Fig. 3C), who was
  collaborating with David Blow on chymotrypsin studies, came up to me and
  asked what research project I planned to pursue when I left the LMB and
  went to Berkeley. I said I wanted to solve the structure of an aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetase, ultimately complexed with substrates including tRNA. This is
  the step where a specific amino acid is attached to the tRNA containing
  the correct anticodon. Brian patted me on the back and said &quot;There, there,
  my boy. That is an interesting problem, but you must work on something
  you can actually do successfully. I suggest that you study the structure of
  hexokinase&quot;. I thanked him for the advice and ran down to the library to
  find out what hexokinase was. I subsequently learned by reading papers
  from Dan Koshland (Fig. 3D) that the hexokinase reaction was his primary
  example of why some enzymes must undergo a substrate-induced fit conformational
  change. He reasoned that if the enzyme was rigid with all of its
  catalytic groups properly oriented to catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the
  six-hydroxyl group of glucose on the alpha phosphate of ATP, then why
  would water not hydrolyze ATP in the absence of glucose? The six-hydroxyl
  group is after all a water molecule with some carbons attached. He hypothesized
  that the binding of glucose must cause a conformational change in the
  enzyme that is necessary for catalysis. I consequently started growing crystals
  of hexokinase at Cambridge and spent the next 10 years studying this
  enzyme. Mentorship is always essential, and not only from your direct
  supervisor.</p>
<p>I submitted my first grant application to the NIH in 1969, I believe, in
  which I proposed to determine the structures of yeast hexokinase, of which
  I had managed to produce crystallographically suitable crystals. I had to go
  to Berkeley for a site visit by an NIH panel and was asked by a panel member
  how I was going to collect the x-ray data. I said by using a diffractometer,
  whereupon I was told that data collection with a diffractometer would not
  work because the unit cell dimensions of my hexokinase crystals were too big
  (one dimension was 200 &Aring;). This, of course, was a ridiculous comment, since
  one just moves the detector further away from the crystal, but the reviewer
  was firm and ultimately my first application was turned down. (A few decades
  later this reviewer asked me in an elevator while being escorted to my next
  faculty visit how we had solved the structure of hexokinase, and I said &quot;by
  using a diffractometer to collect data&quot;.)</p>
<p>Sometime at the end of 1969 or early 1970, Fred Richards (Fig. 4D)
  was visiting the LMB, and I had an opportunity to talk to him. Since I had
  become worried about my funding at Berkeley, I asked him whether a faculty
  position for me was possible at Yale, and he said he would look into it and get back to me. Years later I learned from Sydney Brenner, while dining with
  him at King's College, that Fred had run up to his office after talking to me
  and asked him if he could encourage another American postdoc in Sydney's
  lab to either accept or reject the offer that he had received from Yale. Sydney
  immediately called the postdoc into his office, closed the door, put a piece
  of paper on the table and told the postdoc that he would not be allowed to
  leave the room until he had written and signed a letter to Fred either accepting
  or rejecting Yale's offer. Sydney then took the letter rejecting Yale's offer
  to Fred, who left Cambridge with two faculty slots in his pocket. Fred had
  wanted to have two positions available, since there were faculty in the department
  who wanted to hire Joan, and perhaps Fred thought Yale might have an
  advantage over Berkeley if they offered both of us jobs. Indeed, that turned
  out to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Yale</strong><br>
  I arrived at Yale in the late fall of 1970 and began our structural studies of
  yeast hexokinase captured with and without the substrate glucose bound,
  a project that occupied the efforts of most of my lab during the 1970s. I
  was extremely fortunate to have Robert Fletterick join my lab to work on
  hexokinase as my first postdoc during my first year at Yale. Bob had come
  to Yale to do a postdoc with Hal Wyckoff and had a fellowship. He decided
  he wanted to switch labs, and Hal was very accommodating. Our structures
  of hexokinase with and without glucose bound showed the largest conformational
  change in a single subunit that had been observed at that time
  and clearly established that Koshland's induced fit hypothesis was correct
  for explaining the specificity of hexokinase. The pictures of our hexokinase
  structures with and without glucose bound have been published in far more
  textbooks than any other work from my lab. Brian Hartley had certainly
  made a good suggestion for what research direction I should pursue, and I
  can only wonder what I would have accomplished in the 1970s had I not had
the hallway hexokinase discussion with Hartley.</p>
<p>A very important factor in making the quality of structural biology so
  excellent at Yale beginning in the 1970s was the shared computation and
  x-ray facility, the &quot;core&quot; laboratory, and the many interactions it facilitated.
  When I arrived in 1970, Fred Richards and Hal Wyckoff, who solved the
  structure of RNase S in 1967, had a shared x-ray and computation lab that I joined
  and added some equipment. In 1975 I suggested to Fred that we should
  consider applying for an NIH program project grant, which I had just learned
  about, to support our structural biology efforts, and Fred took the lead in organizing
  five of us, the WERMS group (Wyckoff, Engelman, Richards, Moore
  and Steitz), to apply which we did successfully in 1976. The &quot;WERMS&quot; grant,
  as we referred to it, is now in year 34, but I am the only WERM left on it. In
  the late 1980s, funding from HHMI provided additional support for the core
  x-ray and computational lab, including two technical staff positions and additional
  equipment. They also provided an investigator position for me as well as additional faculty/investigator positions for the MB&amp;B department, and
  in the mid-1990s the WERMS group also included Paul Sigler, Axel Br&uuml;nger
  and Jennifer Doudna (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>This group of seven laboratories constituted the Yale Center for Structural
Biology (CSB) and Fred Richards was appointed by the Yale president to
be the first director of the CSB. The shared core computation and diffraction
laboratory was always abuzz with the activity of students, postdocs and
technical staff who interacted and helped each other solve problems. In the
mid-1990s there were six technical staff in the core lab to help users with
problems they encountered, and about 100 postdocs, students and technical
staff in the CSB laboratories. All of the seven faculty members of the CSB
in 1995 (when our work on the ribosome began) are or were in the U.S.
National Academy of Sciences. In the mid-90s, these seven labs and their
extensive and collegial interactions provided perhaps the best environment
in the world for doing structural biology in general and determining the
structure of the ribosome in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Son Jon</strong><br>
  Our son Jon was born in 1980 and met his first Nobel Prize winner, Fred
  Sanger, at the age of 4 weeks during an MRC LMB celebration on the day
  of Fred's being awarded his second Nobel Prize in chemistry. We happened
  to be in Cambridge on that day, after attending meetings in Switzerland,
  Germany and London. Jon got to go to many meetings around the world for
the next fifteen years until baseball took over his world.</p>
<p>I started playing tennis and baseball with Jon when he was in grade school
  and installed a basketball hoop on the garage for him. Every weekend in the
  summer we would go to a baseball field in our home village of Stony Creek to
  practice his throwing, catching and batting skills. That lasted until he started
  hitting the ball out of the park into the salt marsh grass. In high school he
  was quarterback on the football team, guard on the basketball team and
  pitcher on the baseball team for four years. At the end of his senior year he
  was drafted in the 44th round of the baseball draft, but wisely chose to go
  to Yale. At Yale he majored in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, and
  baseball, as did two of his classmates and teammates, Craig Breslow and Matt
  McCarthy. At the end of his junior year, Jon was drafted by the Milwaukee
  Brewers (ironically) in the third round and received a signing bonus that was
  slightly larger than my share of the 2009 Nobel Prize. After a shoulder injury
  caused him to leave baseball, he went to Yale Law School and is now working
  in consulting with McKinsey Corporation. Breslow, who worked in Joan's lab
  as an undergraduate and intended to go to medical school, had also been
  drafted by the Brewers and is now pitching for the Oakland Athletics team.</p>

<p>Jon learned to ski by coming on what we now refer to as &quot;Riboski&quot; trips.
Starting in the late 80s, a group of RNA-centric friends and their kids started
going on annual ski trips together: Tom and Carol <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1989/">Cech</a> (+2); Jim and Elsbet
Dahlberg (+2); John Abelson (+1) and Olke and Lori Uhlenbeck. Since we
sent the kids to take ski lessons while the adults skied together, Jon quickly
improved, and by the age of 12 he could ski circles around me. Perhaps my
most memorable ski trips were my two 4-day trips with Jon to Snowbird in
Utah over Thanksgiving break during his junior and senior years in high
school (Fig. 5). He would ski the double black diamond runs while I would
ski the double blue or black diamond trails and we would meet at the bottom
of the ski lift.</p>
<p><strong>The Structural Basis of Crick's Central Dogma of</strong>
  <strong>Molecular Biology</strong><br>
  Our decades' long quest to obtain a structural understanding of the mechanisms
  by which the macromolecules that carry out the process of DNA makes
  DNA makes RNA makes protein &ndash; Crick's central dogma &ndash; began with our
  establishing the structure of the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP)
  with only cAMP bound in 1981. This was the first structure of a DNA binding
  protein, a transcription activator. Our subsequent structure of CAP bound
  to DNA in 1991 showed a remarkable bending of the DNA backbone, and
  our recent structure of the unliganded CAP exhibited a very large conformational
  rearrangement of the DNA binding domains which explains how the
  binding of cAMP activates the ability of CAP to bind to DNA.</p>
<p>In the 1980s we also determined the first structure of a DNA polymerase,
  the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (whose discovery by <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/">Arthur
  Kornberg</a> led to his receiving the Nobel Prize) and its complex with a DNA
  substrate in the 3'-5' exonuclease active site. The structure of the substrate
  complex led to our discovery of the two-metal-ion mechanism of a phosphoryl
  transfer reaction and our later proposal that this mechanism is employed
  by many ribozymes, which has recently shown to be the case for several
  of them. We also published our first structure of a fragment of the site
  specific recombination enzyme, gamma delta resolvase, that lacked its sequence
  specific DNA binding domain. Perhaps the most exciting (to me) leap
  forward in the late 80s was our obtaining the structure of glutaminyl-tRNA
  synthetase complexed with tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> and ATP. This was the problem I had
  wanted to work on 20 years earlier when Brian Hartley wisely advised me that
  it was too early. Obviously, he was correct. This first structure of a synthetasetRNA
  complex showed how the synthetase recognizes the correct tRNA
  containing the glutamine anticodon and discriminates against all of the
  other tRNAs. This is the first critical step in the translation of the genetic
  code into proteins.</p>
<p>We had many exciting advances in our central dogma quest in the first
  half of the 1990s. We obtained the first structure of HIV reverse transcriptase
  complexed with a non-nucleotide inhibitor, which was then one of the few drugs used to treat patients with AIDS. We also determined the first of the
  many structures of T7 RNA polymerase that we have obtained over the last
  15 years captured in many of its functional states. This was the beginning of
  our exploring how DNA is transcribed into RNA starting with an initiation
  state with T7 RNA polymerase bound to its promoter and going on to the
  elongation and termination states. Significant progress was also made in our
  studies of DNA recombination. We obtained the first structure of an enzyme
  involved in homologous recombination, recA, and the structure of the site
  specific recombinase, gamma delta resolvase, bound to its specific DNA
  target. While this latter structure illuminated how resolvase recognizes its
  DNA target, it did not reveal how the protein brings the two DNA duplexes
  together to form a synaptic complex or how strand exchange is accomplished;
  that would take us another 10 years. We also obtained the structure of the
  first binary complex of a DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) with its duplex
  DNA substrate bound to the polymerase active site, but without the incoming
  dNTP.</p>
<p>By 1995, then, we had made significant progress on obtaining structural
  insights into the mechanisms of all of the steps of the central dogma except
  the last one &ndash; protein synthesis by the ribosome. It was at this time in the fall
  of 1995 that Nenad Ban joined by lab and said he wanted to work on the
  structure of the ribosome &ndash; the right person at the right time. As discussed in
  more detail in the <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/steitz-lecture.html">Nobel lecture</a>, we collaborated with Peter Moore and Ban
  was joined later by Poul Nissen and Jeff Hansen. Between 1995 and 2000 our
  goal of obtaining the structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit and a complex
  with a transition state intermediate was attacked successfully by the swat team
  of these three postdocs (Fig. 6). Jeff Hansen also determined the structures
  of many complexes between the <em>Haloarcula marismortui </em>50S subunit and
  antibiotics bound to the peptidyl transferase center, which formed the basis
  for our founding of Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Subsequently, substrate
  complex structures were pursued by a graduate student, Martin Schmeing, in
  the early 2000s (Fig. 6). During the 1990s our small ribosome group had daily
  conversations and regular meetings around a lunch table to discuss progress
  and ideas for moving forward. The calculation of the 2.4 &Aring; resolution electron
  density map in early 2000 and our months of building a model of the
  ribosome were the most exciting research times I had ever experienced. We
  had no idea what the ribosome structure, particularly the RNA, would look like and peering into its emerging interior was simply amazing</p>

From left to right are Poul Nissen, myself, Peggy Eatherton, Peter Moore, Nenad Ban,
Martin Schmeing and Jeff Hansen. Peter is my long time faculty colleague, friend and collaborator
on the ribosome project. Poul and Nenad are former postdocs in the lab who
were the ones primarily responsible for determining the structure of the 50S subunit. Jeff
is a former postdoc whose major contributions included the structure of antibiotic and
substrate intermediate analogue complexes with the 50S subunit. Martin is a former graduate
student whose many structures of substrate analogue complexes that were captured in
the various steps of catalysis allowed him to make a movie of peptide bond formation on
the 50S subunit. Peggy has been my administrative assistant for 25 years and has been an
enabling facilitator, memory chip and coordinator of lab personnel.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back over the development and progress of my career in
  science, I am reminded how vitally important good mentorship is in the early
  stages of one's career development and constant face-to-face conversations,
  debate and discussions with colleagues at all stages of research. Outstanding
  discoveries, insights and developments do not happen in a vacuum. Our
  research accomplishments on the structures of the large ribosomal subunit
  and its many complexes were greatly enhanced and accelerated by the
  structural biology environment at Yale in the 1990s as well as the long term
  support of risky projects by the Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute.
  As I watch increasing numbers of my faculty colleagues, students and postdocs
  communicate with each other almost exclusively by email rather than
  discussing ideas over the lunch table (as I experienced in Cambridge and the
  first decades at Yale), I wonder whether they will be as creative and have as
much fun doing science as they could with more face-to-face contact.<strong> </strong></p>
