  <h1>The Svedberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="svedberg.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Theodor (The) Svedberg</b> was
  born at Fler&auml;ng, Valbo, in the county of G&auml;vleborg,
  Sweden on August 30, 1884, as the son of Elias Svedberg, a works
  manager, and his wife, Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alstermark. He
  attended the K&ouml;ping School, the &Ouml;rebro High School and
  Gothenburg Modern School, where he passed his student examination
  in December 1903, before matriculating and beginning his lifelong
  association with Uppsala University in January 1904. He gained
  his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1905, his Master's degree in 1907
  and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Svedberg accepted a post as assistant in the Chemical Institute
  at Uppsala in 1905 and in 1907 he was given the additional
  position of lecturer in chemistry in the university. He obtained
  a special appointment in 1909 as lecturer and demonstrator of
  physical chemistry and in 1912 he was elected Professor of
  Physical Chemistry, University of Uppsala. He was made emeritus
  in 1949, since when he has been Director of the Gustaf Werner
  Institute for Nuclear Chemistry in the University.<br>
  <br>
  Svedberg's work has mainly been concerned with colloids and
  macromolecular compounds. In his doctor's thesis <i>Studien zur
  Lehre von den kolloiden L&ouml;sungen</i> (1908), now considered
  as a classic, he described a new method of producing colloid
  particles and gave convincing evidence of the validity of the
  theory founded by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> and von
  Smoluchowski on the Brownian movements, thereby providing
  definite proof of the existence of molecules. With numerous
  collaborators he has studied the physical properties of colloids,
  such as their diffusion, light absorption, and sedimentation,
  from which could be concluded that the gas laws could be applied
  to disperse systems. For the study of sedimentation he
  constructed his well-known ultracentrifuge, where large molecules
  in solution, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and high polymers
  have been investigated. In the ultracentrifuge the large
  molecules are put under the influence of centrifugal forces up to
  about 10<sup>6</sup> gravity. The findings were related to
  molecular size and shape. He showed that the molecules of certain
  pure proteins are all of one size and demonstrated the use of the
  ultracentrifuge to show the presence of contaminants. Later, he
  turned his attention to the problems of nuclear chemistry and
  radiation biology. He has also studied photographic processing,
  and assisted in photographing the famous <i>Codex argenteus</i>
  in colour, which made this source of the Gothic language
  available for research. During the Second World War he worked out
  a method for making synthetic rubber.<br>
  <br>
  Svedberg has contributed a large number of scientific papers to
  Swedish and foreign journals on colloid and high-molecular
  solutions, nuclear chemistry and radiation biology.<br>
  <br>
  Among his publications the following books should be mentioned:
  <i>Die Methoden zur Herstellung kolloider L&ouml;sungen
  anorganischer Stoffe</i> (1909), <i>Die Existenz der
  Molek&uuml;le</i> (1912), <i>Colloid Chemistry</i> (1914; sec.
  enl. ed. with <a href="../1948/index.html">A. Tiselius</a> 1928
  ), <i>The Ultracentrifuge</i> (with K.O. Pedersen 1940; also in
  German). He has written several excellent popular books in
  Swedish, namely <i>Materien</i> (1912; sec. ed. 1919; also German
  ed. 1914), <i>Arbetets dekadens</i> (1915, 1920; German ed. 1923)
  and <i>Forskning och Industri</i> (1918).<br>
  <br>
  He has been awarded the John Ericsson Medal (1942), the Berzelius
  Medal (1944), and the Medal of the Franklin Institute (1949). For
  his work on the disperse systems he received the Nobel Prize in
  1926.<br>
  <br>
  To extend his knowledge Svedberg has visited numerous
  laboratories in foreign countries and cities: Germany (1908),
  Holland and France (1912), Berlin (1913), Vienna (1916), London
  and Paris (1920), England and Denmark (1922), the United States
  and Canada (1922-1923).<br>
  <br>
  He has been awarded honorary doctor's degrees in science and
  medicine, and, amongst many other academies and learned
  societies, he is a member of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1926/svedberg-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>, the Halle
  Academy, The Chemical Society (London), the Indian Academy of
  Science, the American Philosophical Society (Philadelphia), the
  New York Academy
  of Sciences, the Royal Society (London) and the National Academy of Science (Washington).<br>
  <br>
  Svedberg has married four times: in 1909, Andrea Andreen, a
  medical graduate; in 1916, Jane Frodi; Ingrid Blomquist in 1938;
  and in 1948, Margit Hall&eacute;n, M.A. He has twelve children, six
  sons and six daughters.<br>
  <br>
  His hobbies are painting and botany.</p>
