  <h1>David Trimble - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, Oslo, December 10, 1998</p>

  <p class="smalltext">&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesties, Members of the Norwegian
  Nobel Committee, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

  <p>The Nobel Prize for peace normally goes to
  named persons. This year the persons named are John Hume and
  myself, two politicians from Northern Ireland. And I am honoured,
  as John Hume is honoured, that my name should be so singled
  out.</p>

  <p>But in one sense the singling of one or two
  persons, for a peace prize, must always seem something of an
  injustice. In Northern Ireland I could name scores of people,
  Unionist and nationalist, who deserve this prize far more than I
  do. Add to that the thousands of people who I do not know, but
  who have born witness, in their own lives, by carrying out what
  Wordsworth called, "those little nameless, unremembered acts of
  kindness and love".</p>

  <p>And since I know there are thousands of
  such heroes and heroines in Northern Ireland, how many more
  millions of peacemakers must there be in the front line of the
  fight for peace across the globe. People who stand in the front
  line for peace in all the places where there is no peace -
  Bosnia, Kosovo, Gaza, Cyprus, Rwanda, Angola.</p>

  <p>Naturally it is not possible to name each
  and everyone of those heroes and heroines who make up the huge
  host of peacemakers who, even as we speak, are at work for peace
  around the world.</p>

  <p>But even if it is not possible to name them
  we can note their presence on the peacelines around the
  world.</p>

  <p>Having said that, I am at the same time,
  anxious to allay any fears on your part that I might fail to pick
  up the medal or the cheque. The people of Northern Ireland are
  not a people to look a gift horse in the mouth. It is imperative
  that I take the medal home to Northern Ireland - if only to prove
  that I have been to Oslo.</p>

  <p>And the way politics work in Northern
  Ireland - if John Hume has a medal, it is important that I have
  one too.</p>

  <p>It is a truth universally understood that
  there is no such thing as a free lunch. That being so, John and I
  are obliged to sing for our supper. In short some expect us to
  speak as experts and hand out advice on how to make peace.</p>

  <p>Some old hands say that there are two ways
  to sing for your supper. The first and the safest course, they
  say, is to make a series of vague and visionary statements.</p>

  <p>Indeed are not vague and visionary
  statements much the same thing? The tradition from which I come,
  but by which I am not confined, produced the first vernacular
  bible in the language of the common people, and contributed much
  to the scientific language of the enlightenment. It puts a great
  price on the precise use of words, and uses them with
  circumspection, so much so that our passion for precision is
  often confused with an indifference to idealism.</p>

  <p>Not so. But I am personally and perhaps
  culturally conditioned to be sceptical of speeches which are full
  of sound and fury, idealistic in intention, but impossible of
  implementation; and I resist the kind of rhetoric which
  substitutes vapour for vision. Instinctively, I identify with the
  person who said that when he heard a politician talk of his
  vision, he recommended him to consult an optician!</p>

  <p>BUT, if you want to hear of a possible
  Northern Ireland, not a Utopia, but a normal and decent society,
  flawed as human beings are flawed, but fair as human beings are
  fair, then I hope not to disappoint you.</p>

  <p>The second suggestion is that either John
  or I, or indeed both of us, might explicate at some little
  length, like peace scientists so to speak, on any lessons learnt
  in the little laboratory of Northern Ireland as if we were
  scientists and the people were so much mice.</p>

  <p>Speaking for myself, there are two good
  reasons to reject this course. First, I am not sure that I hold
  the status of scientist in the political laboratory of Northern
  Ireland. Indeed, there have been days, particularly recently,
  when I have felt much less like the scientist and very much more
  like the mouse!</p>

  <p>Secondly, I have, in fact, some fairly
  serious reservations about the merits of using any conflict, not
  least Northern Ireland as a model for the study, never mind the
  solution, of other conflicts.</p>

  <p>In fact if anything, the opposite is
  true.</p>

  <p>Let me spell this out.</p>

  <p>I believe that a sense of the unique,
  specific and concrete circumstances of any situation is the first
  indispensable step to solving the problems posed by that
  situation.</p>

  <p>Now, I wish I could say that that insight
  was my own. But that insight into the central role of concrete
  and specific circumstance is the bedrock of the political thought
  of a man who is universally recognised as one of the most eminent
  philosophers of practical politics.</p>

  <p>I refer, of course to the eminent
  eighteenth century Irish political philosopher, and brilliant
  British Parliamentarian, Edmund Burke.</p>

  <p>He was the most powerful and prophetic
  political intellect of that century. He anticipated and welcomed
  the American revolution. He anticipated the dark side of the
  French revolution. He delved deep into the roots of that
  political violence, based on the false notion of the
  perfectibility of man, which has plagued us since the French
  revolution. He is claimed by both conservatives and liberals. He
  can be claimed by Britain and Ireland, by catholic and
  protestant, and indeed by the world. For Burke's belief in the
  rule of law and in parliamentary democracy, is not our monopoly,
  but the birthright of men and women of all countries, all colours
  and all creeds.</p>

  <p>But of course he has special significance
  for us in Ireland. Burke, the son of a protestant father and a
  catholic mother, was a man who in word and in deed honoured both
  religious traditions, recognised and respected his Irish roots
  and the British Parliamentary system which nursed him to the full
  flowering of his genius. Today as we seek to decommission not
  only arms and ammunition, but also hearts and minds, Burke
  provides us not only with a powerful role model of the pluralist
  Irishman, but also with a powerful role model for politicians
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>Burke is the best model for what might be
  called politicians of the possible. Politicians who seek to make
  a working peace, not in some perfect world, that never was, but
  in this, the flawed world, which is our only workshop.</p>

  <p>Because he is the philosopher of practical
  politics, not of visionary vapours, because his beliefs
  correspond to empirical experience, he may be a good general
  guide to the practical politics of peacemaking.</p>

  <p>I shall also be calling on two other
  philosophers, Amos Oz, the distinguished Israeli writer who has
  reached out to the Arab tradition, and George Kennan, the former
  US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who laid the cornerstone of
  post-war US foreign policy.</p>

  <p>All three, Burke, Oz and Kennan, are
  particularly acute about the problems of dealing with
  revolutionary violence - that political, religious and racial
  terrorism that comes from the pursuit of what Burke called
  abstract virtue, the urge to make men perfect against their
  will.</p>

  <p>Now these negative notes do not mean I have
  not good news at the end. I do. But, it would be a dereliction of
  duty if I only conjured up good and generous ghosts, and failed
  to specify the spectres at the feast.</p>

  <p>There are fascist forces in this world. The
  first step to their defeat is to define them. Let me now, with
  the help of Burke, Oz and Kennan, locate the dark fountain of
  fascism from which flows most of the political, religious and
  racial violence which pollutes the progressive achievements of
  humanity.</p>

  <p>Burke believed that the source of the
  pollution is the Platonic pursuit of abstract perfection, the
  passion to change other people's personal, political, religious
  or economic views by political violence. I say Platonic because
  that savage pursuit of abstract perfection starts in the Western
  world with Plato's Republic. It rises to a plateau with the
  French and Russian revolutions. It descended to new depths with
  the Nazis and is present in all the national, ethnic and
  religious conflicts current after the collapse of communism,
  itself the most determined and ruthless Platonic experiment in
  perfecting the economic system whatever the cost in human
  life.</p>

  <p>Burke challenged the Platonic
  perfectibility doctrine whose principal protagonist was Rousseau.
  Rousseau regarded man as perfect and society as corrupt. Burke
  believed man was flawed and that society was redemptive. The
  Revolution tested these theories and it was Burke's that proved
  the most progressive in terms of practical politics.</p>

  <p>He has a horror of abstract notions. In
  1781 he said, "Abstract liberty, like other mere abstractions, is
  not to be found." Seven years later he opposed the revolution
  correctly predicting that the mob would be replaced by a cabal,
  and the cabal by a dictator.</p>

  <p>At the end of Rousseau's road, Burke
  predicted, we would find not the perfectibility of man but the
  gibbet and the guillotine. And so it proved. And so it proved
  when Stalin set out to perfect the new Soviet man. So it proved
  with Mao in China and Pol Pot in Cambodia. So it will prove in
  every conflict when perfection is sought at the point of a
  gun.</p>

  <p>Amos Oz has also arrived at the same
  conclusion. Recently in a radio programme he was asked to define
  a political fanatic. He did so as follows, "A political fanatic"
  he said, "is someone who is more interested in you than in
  himself."</p>

  <p>At first that might seem as an altruist,
  but look closer and you will see the terrorist.</p>

  <p>A political fanatic is not someone who
  wants to perfect himself. No, he wants to perfect you. He wants
  to perfect you personally, to perfect you politically, to perfect
  you religiously, or racially, or geographically.</p>

  <p>He wants you to change your mind, your
  government, your borders. He may not be able to change your race,
  so he will eliminate you from the perfect equation in his mind by
  eliminating you from the earth.</p>

  <p>"The Jacobins," said Burke, "had little
  time for the imperfect."</p>

  <p>We in Northern Ireland are not free from
  taint.</p>

  <p>We have a few fanatics who dream of forcing
  the Ulster British people into a Utopian Irish state, more
  ideologically Irish than its own inhabitants actually want. We
  also have fanatics who dream of permanently suppressing northern
  nationalists in a state more supposedly British than its
  inhabitants actually want.</p>

  <p>But a few fanatics are not a fundamental
  problem. No, the problem arises if political fanatics bury
  themselves within a morally legitimate political movement. Then
  there is a double danger. The first is that we might dismiss
  legitimate claims for reform because of the barbarism of
  terrorist groups bent on revolution.</p>

  <p>In that situation experience would suggest
  that the best way forward is for democrats to carry out what the
  Irish writer, Eoghan Harris calls acts of good authority. That is
  acts addressed to their own side.</p>

  <p>Thus each reformist group has a moral
  obligation to deal with its own fanatics. The Serbian democrats
  must take on the Serbian fascists. The PLO must take on Hammas.
  In Northern Ireland, constitutional nationalists must take on
  republican dissident terrorists and constitutional Unionists must
  confront protestant terrorists.</p>

  <p>There is a second danger. Sometimes in our
  search for a solution, we go into denial about the darker side of
  the fanatic, the darker side of human nature. Not all may agree,
  but we cannot ignore the existence of evil. Particularly that
  form of political evil that wants to perfect a person, a border
  at any cost.</p>

  <p>Is has many faces. Some look suspiciously
  like the leaders of the Serbian forces wanted for massacres such
  as that at Srebenice, some like those wielding absolute power in
  Baghdad, some like those wanted for the Omagh bombing.</p>

  <p>It worries me that there is an appeasing
  strand in Western politics. Sometimes it is a hope that things
  are not as bad as all that. Sometimes it is a hope that people
  can be weaned away from terror.</p>

  <p>What we need is George Kennan&iacute;s
  hard-headed advice to the State Department in the 1960s for
  dealing with the State terrorists of his time, based on his years
  in Moscow, "Don&iacute;t act chummy with them; don&iacute;t assume a
  community of aims with them which does not really exist;
  don&iacute;t make fatuous gestures of goodwill."</p>

  <p>Let me commend on those clear words to
  those who sometimes seem to think that dealing with fascists is
  merely a game where one won&iacute;t get hurt.</p>

  <p>My philosophers are also guides as to how
  best to battle against these dark forces. Here we come again to
  Burke&iacute;s belief that politics proceeds not by some abstract
  notions or by simple appeal to the past, but by close attention
  to the concrete detail and circumstance of the current specific
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Circumstances," says Burke, "Circumstances
  give in reality to every political principle, its distinguishing
  colour, and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what
  render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to
  mankind."</p>

  <p>That is the nub of the matter. True I am
  sure of other conflicts. Previous precedents must not blind
  negotiators to the current circumstances. This first step away
  from abstraction and towards reality, should be followed by
  giving space for the possibilities for progress to develop.</p>

  <p>This is what I have tried to do: to tell
  unionists to give things a chance to develop. Given that the
  Ulster British people are coming out the experience of 25 years
  of "armed struggle" directed against them. They have given our
  appeals a generous hearing. Critics say that concessions are a
  sign of weakness. Burke, however says, "Magnanimity in politics
  is not seldom the truest wisdom; and a great empire and little
  minds go ill together." Prophetic words when we think of the
  history of the British Empire. And we are the inheritors of that
  intellectual tradition that encourages us to identify with the
  cultural alliance of the English-speaking peoples and share their
  political interests.</p>

  <p>But the realisation of peace needs more
  than magnanimity. It requires a certain political prudence, and a
  willingness at times nor to be too precise or pedantic. Burke
  says, "It is the nature of greatness not to be exact." Amos Oz
  agrees, "Inconsistency is the basis of coexistence. The heroes of
  tragedy driven by consistency and by righteousness, destroy each
  other. He who seeks total supreme justice seeks death."</p>

  <p>Again the warning not to aim for abstract
  perfection. Heaven knows, in Ulster, what I have looked for is a
  peace within the realms of the possible. We could only have
  started from where we actually were, not from where we would have
  liked to be.</p>

  <p>And we have started. And we will go on. And
  we will go on all the better if we walk, rather than run. If we
  put aside fantasy and accept the flawed nature of human
  enterprises. Sometimes we will stumble, maybe even go back a bit.
  But this need not matter if in the spirit of an old Irish proverb
  we say to ourselves, "Tomorrow is another day".</p>

  <p>In not seeking perfection beyond the power
  of flawed man we are acting nor just within the Burkean tradition
  but within the broad religious consensus. Nor is this a
  pessimistic approach. It is one that obliges us to do our
  best.</p>

  <p>Because politics is not an exact science,
  but partakes of human nature within the contingent circumstances
  of the moment, I have not pressed the paramilitaries on the
  details of decommissioning. Although I am under pressure from my
  own political community I have not insisted on precise dates
  quantities and manner of decommissioning. All I have asked for is
  a credible beginning. All I have asked for is that they say that
  the "war" is over. And that is proved by such a beginning. That
  is not too much to ask for. Nor is it too much to ask that the
  reformist party of nationalism, the SDLP, support me in this.</p>

  <p>But common sense dictates that I cannot for
  ever convince society that real peace is at hand if there is not
  a beginning to the decommissioning of weapons as an earnest of
  the decommissioning of hearts that must follow. Any further delay
  will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking
  from the clear stream of democracy, or is still drinking from the
  dark stream of fascism. It cannot for ever face both ways.</p>

  <p>Plenty of space has been given to the
  paramilitaries. Now, winter is here, and there is still no sign
  of spring.</p>

  <p>Like John Bunyan&iacute;s Pilgrim, we
  politicians have been through the Slough of Despond. We have seen
  Doubting Castle, the owner whereof was Giant Despair. I can
  certainly recall passing many times through the Valley of
  Humiliation. And all too often we have encountered, not only on
  the other side, but on our own side too, "the man who could look
  no way but downwards, with a muckrake in his hand."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, like one of Beckett&iacute;s
  characters, "I will go on, because I must go on."</p>

  <p>What we democratic politicians want in
  Northern Ireland is not some utopian society but a normal
  society. The best way to secure that normalcy is the tried and
  trusted method of parliamentary democracy. So the Northern
  Ireland Assembly is the primary institutional instrument for the
  development of a normal society in Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>Like any parliament it needs to be more
  than a cockpit for competing victimisations. Burke said it best,
  "Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and
  hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an
  agent and an advocate, against other agents and advocates; but
  Parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one
  interest, that of the whole; where not local purposes, nor local
  prejudices ought to guide, but the general good resulting from
  the general reason of the whole."</p>

  <p>Some critics complain that I lack "the
  vision thing". But vision in its pure meaning is clear sight.
  That does not mean I have no dreams. I do. But I try to have them
  at night. By day I am satisfied if I can see the furthest limit
  of what is possible. Politics can be likened to driving at night
  over unfamiliar hills and mountains. Close attention must be paid
  to what the beam can reach and the next bend.</p>

  <p>Driving by day, as I believe we are now
  doing, we should drive steadily, not recklessly, studying the
  countryside ahead, with judicious glances in the mirror. We
  should be encouraged by having come so far, and face into the
  next hill, rather than the mountain beyond. It is not that the
  mountain is not in my mind, but the hill has to be climbed
  first.</p>

  <p>There are Hills in Northern Ireland and
  there are mountains. The hills are decommissioning and policing.
  But the mountain, if we could but see it clearly, is not in front
  of us but behind us, in history. The dark shadow we seem to see
  in the distance is not really a mountain ahead, but the shadow of
  the mountain behind - a shadow from the past thrown forward into
  our future. It is a dark sludge of historical sectarianism. We
  can leave it behind us if we wish.</p>

  <p>But both communities must leave it behind,
  because both created it. Each thought it had good reason to fear
  the other. As Namier says, the irrational is not necessarily
  unreasonable. Ulster Unionists, fearful of being isolated on the
  island, built a solid house, but it was a cold house for
  catholics. And northern nationalists, although they had a roof
  over their heads, seemed to us as if they meant to burn the house
  down.</p>

  <p>None of us are entirely innocent. But
  thanks to our strong sense of civil society, thanks to our
  religious recognition that none of us are perfect, thanks to the
  thousands of people from both sides who made countless acts of
  good authority, thanks to a tradition of parliamentary democracy
  which meant that paramilitarism never displaced politics, thanks
  to all these specific, concrete circumstances we, thank god,
  stopped short of that abyss that engulfed Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia
  and Rwanda.</p>

  <p>Thank you for this prize for peace. We have
  a peace of sorts in Northern Ireland. But it is still something
  of an armed peace. It may seem strange that we receive the reward
  of a race run while the race is still not quite finished. But the
  paramilitaries are finished. But politics is not finished. It is
  the bedrock to which all societies return. Because we are the
  only agents of change who accept man as he is and not as someone
  else wants him to be. The work we do may be grubby and without
  glamour. But is has one saving grace. It is grounded on reality
  and reason. What is the nature of that reason? Let Burke answer,
  "Political reason is computing principle: adding, subtracting,
  multiplying and dividing, morally - and not metaphysically or
  mathematically - true moral denominations."</p>

  <p>There are two traditions in Northern
  Ireland. There are two main religious denominations. But there is
  only one true moral denomination. And it wants peace.</p>

  <p>I am happy and honoured to accept this
  prize on my own behalf.</p>

  <p>I am happy and honoured to accept this
  prize on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>I am happy and honoured to accept the prize
  on behalf of all the peacemakers from throughout the British
  Isles and farther afield who made the Belfast Agreement that Good
  Friday at Stormont.</p>

  <p>That agreement showed that the people of
  Northern Ireland are no petty people.</p>

  <p>They did good work that day.</p>

  <p>And tomorrow is now another day.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
