  <h2>Protozoa as Causes of Diseases</h2>

  <p>My scientific colleagues of the Caroline
  Institute having done me the very great honour of awarding me the
  Nobel Prize in Medicine this year for my work on diseases due to
  Protozoa, the regulations of the Nobel Foundation oblige me to
  give a summary of my main researches on this question.</p>

  <p>I must however go back a little in order to
  explain how I was led to concern myself with the pathogenic
  protozoa.</p>

  <p>In 1878 after having finished my course of
  instruction at the School of Military Medicine of
  Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, I was sent to Algeria and put in charge of a
  department of the hospital at Bone. A large number of my patients
  had malarial fevers and I was naturally led to study these fevers
  of which I had only seen rare and benign forms in France.</p>

  <p>Malaria which is almost unknown in the
  north of Europe is however of great importance in the south of
  the Continent particularly in Greece and Italy; these fevers in
  many of the localities become the dominant disease and the forms
  become more grave; alongside the intermittent forms, both the
  continuous forms and those called malignant appear. In the
  tropical and subtropical regions, endemic malaria takes first
  place almost everywhere among the causes of morbidity and
  mortality and it constitutes the principal obstacle to the
  acclimatization of Europeans in these regions. Algeria has become
  much less unhealthy than it was at the commencement of the French
  occupation but one still comes across regions such as the banks
  of Lake Fezzara, not far from Bone, in which endemic-epidemic
  malaria rages every year.</p>

  <p>I had the opportunity of making necropsies
  on patients dead from malignant fever and of studying the
  melanaemia, i.e. the formation of black pigment in the blood of
  patients affected by malaria. This melanaemia had been described
  by many observers, but people were still in doubt about the
  constancy of the alteration in malaria, and about the causes of
  the production of this pigment.</p>

  <p>I was struck by the special characters
  which these pigment grains presented especially in the
  capillaries of the liver and the cerebrospinal centres, and I
  tried to pursue the study of its formation in the blood of
  persons affected by malarial fever. I found in the blood,
  leucocytes more or less loaded with pigment, but in addition to
  these melaniferous leucocytes, pigmented spherical bodies of
  variable size possessing amoeboid movement, free or adherent to
  the red cells; non-pigmented corpuscles forming clear spots in
  the red cells; finally pigmented elements, crescentic in shape
  attracted my attention, and from then on I supposed they were
  parasites.</p>

  <p>In 1880 at the Military Hospital at
  Constantine, I discovered on the edges of the pigmented spherical
  bodies in the blood of a patient suffering from malaria, filiform
  elements resembling flagellae which were moving very rapidly,
  displacing the neighbouring red cells. From then on I had no more
  doubts of the parasitic nature of the elements which I had found;
  I described the principal appearances of the malarial haematozoon
  in memoranda sent to the Academy of Medicine, the Academy of
  Sciences (1880-1882) and in a monograph entitled: <i>Nature
  parasitaire des accidents de l'impaludisme, description d'un
  nouveau parasite trouv&eacute; dans le sung des malades atteints de
  fi&egrave;vre palustre</i>, Paris, 1881.</p>

  <p>These first results of my researches were
  received with much scepticism.</p>

  <p>In 1879, Klebs and Tommasi Crudeli had
  described under the name of <i>Bacillus malariae</i>, a bacillus
  found in the soil and water in malarial localities and a large
  number of Italian observers had published papers confirming the
  work of these authors.</p>

  <p>The haematozoon which I gave as the agent
  of malaria did not resemble bacteria, and was present in strange
  forms, and in short it was completely outside the circle of the
  known pathogenic microbes, and many observers not knowing how to
  classify it found it simpler to doubt its existence.</p>

  <p>In 1880, the technique of examination of
  the blood was unfortunately very imperfect, which contributed to
  the prolongation of the discussion relative to the new
  haematozoon and it was necessary to perfect this technique and
  invent new staining procedures to demonstrate its structure.</p>

  <p>Confirmatory investigations at first rare,
  became more and more numerous; at the same time endoglobular
  parasites were discovered in different animals which closely
  resembled the haematozoon of malaria. In 1889, my haematozoon had
  been found in the majority of malarial regions and it was not
  possible to doubt any more either its existence or its pathogenic
  role.</p>

  <p>Many observers before me had sought without
  success to discover the cause of malaria and I should also have
  failed if I had been content merely to examine the air, water, or
  the soil in malarial localities as had been done up till then,
  but I had taken as the basis of my investigations the
  pathological anatomy and the study in vivo of malarial blood and
  this is how I was able to reach my goal.</p>

  <p>The malarial haematozoon is a protozoon, a
  very small protozoon since it lives and develops in the red blood
  cells which in man have a diameter of only 7 microns.</p>

  <p>One can summarize the principal ways in
  which the parasite appears in human blood, as follows:<br>
  1. Small, rounded, non-pigmented elements, 1-2 microns in
  diameter, forming clear spots in the red cells. In stained
  preparations a nucleus can be detected in each of these small
  elements. Multiplication is by halving or by multiple
  division.<br>
  2. Amoeboid elements inside the red cells or adherent to their
  surface, of variable form and dimensions and containing blackish
  pigment. The largest of these elements are the size of
  leucocytes. In stained preparations a nucleus can be detected in
  each amoeboid body. The parasitized red cells change: become
  paler and increase in diameter, and finally disappear. The
  gravity and constancy of the anaemia produced by these parasites,
  which develop rapidly at the expense of the red cells, is thus
  explained. Multiplication is by multiple segmentation (rose petal
  or segmented body).<br>
  3. Crescentic-shaped bodies measuring 8-9 microns long which are
  more or less tapered at the ends; towards the middle a corona of
  grains of pigment can be seen surrounding a nucleus which can
  only be detected in heavily stained specimens.<br>
  4. Flagellae. When a preparation of malarial blood is examined
  during a feverish attack one can often see developing on the
  edges of the pigmented spherical bodies derived from the amoeboid
  or crescent-shaped bodies, very fine flagellae, 20-25 microns
  long. These flagellae move actively, displacing the neighbouring
  red cells, and end by becoming detached; and once free they lose
  themselves among the mass of red cells.</p>

  <p>The role of these flagellae was still not
  decided when the researches of Simond, Schaudinn and Siedlecki
  showed that analogous elements are found in the Coccidia and that
  they are male elements destined to fertilize the female
  elements.</p>

  <p>It has now been definitely proved that the
  haematozoon of malaria has, like the Coccidia, two forms of
  reproduction: asexual, represented by the segmented bodies, and
  sexual, the flagellae being the male elements.</p>

  <p>A large number of observers have admitted
  the existence of several species of malarial haematozoa, but for
  my part I have always defended the unity of malaria and its
  haematozoon, and the postulated species described under the names
  of parasites of tropical malaria, aestivo-autumnal fever, tertian
  or quartan fever appear to me to constitute simple varieties of
  the same haematozoon.</p>

  <p>After the discovery of the malarial
  parasite in the blood of the patients an important question still
  remained to be solved: in what state does the haematozoon exist
  outside the body and how does infection occur? The solution of
  this problem required long and laborious researches.</p>

  <p>After having vainly attempted to detect the
  parasite in the air, the water, or the soil of malarial areas and
  trying to cultivate it in the most varied media, I became
  convinced that the microbe was already present outside the human
  body in a parasitic state and very probably as a parasite of
  mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>I put forward this opinion in 1884 in my
  <i>Trait&eacute; des fi&egrave;vres palustres</i> (Treatise on
  paludal fevers) and I returned to it on several occasions.</p>

  <p>In 1894, in a report to the International
  Congress of Hygiene at Budapest on the aetiology of malaria, I
  wrote: "The failure of attempts at culture have led me to believe
  that the microbe of malaria lives outside the body in the
  parasitic state and I suspect in the mosquitoes which are
  abundant in malarial areas and which already play a very
  important role in the propagation of filariasis." This opinion on
  the role of mosquitoes was considered by most observers at this
  time as not very likely.</p>

  <p>In 1892 two Italian authors who have since
  become great supporters of infection by mosquitoes wrote:"Laveran
  supposes that mosquitoes are the intermediate hosts of the
  malarial parasite. We must object that mosquitoes do not attack
  birds and in addition, that there are many healthy localities
  where mosquitoes are abundant. Apart from these objections
  Calandruccio has observed that the parasites of malaria die in
  the intestine of the mosquitoes without further development.
  Laveran's opinion rests therefore without any foundation, and the
  hypothesis put forward by us that the parasites exist outside the
  body in the form of amides is confirmed."<sup><a href=
  "#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>King<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>
  in America had suggested in 1883 that mosquitoes played a part in
  the aetiology of malaria but he did not know of my work on the
  haematozoon of malaria and could not specify what part the
  mosquitoes played, so that in saying that the mosquito acted as a
  temporary host of the malarial parasite I had obviously got
  closer to the problem than King had been able to do. I indicated
  clearly the route that it was necessary to follow to arrive at
  the goal; to seek out what became of the parasite in the body of
  mosquitoes which had sucked malarial blood.</p>

  <p>Having left the malarial countries it was
  not possible for me to verify the hypothesis I had put forward on
  the role of mosquitoes, and it is to Dr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/index.html">Ronald Ross</a> that we owe
  the demonstration that the malarial haematozoon and the closely
  related <i>Haemamoeba malariae</i> of birds complete several
  phases of their evolution in the Culicidae and are propagated by
  these insects.</p>

  <p>R. Ross whose excellent and patient
  investigations have been very justly rewarded by being given the
  Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1902, has been very willing to
  acknowledge in many of his papers that he had been usefully
  guided by my deductions and by those of P. Manson.</p>

  <p>Today the transformations which the
  malarial parasite undergoes in mosquitoes of the genus
  <i>Anopheles</i> are well known and no further doubt is possible
  on the role these insects play in the propagation of malaria. I
  consider it is useless to insist on this as it has been very
  completely dealt with by R. Ross in a conference held here in
  1902.</p>

  <p>From 1899, my principal work on malaria has
  had as the object, the study of the Culicidae in their relation
  to malarial endemicity and of the rational prophylaxis of this
  dreadful malady.</p>

  <p>I have studied the Culicidae of France and
  of the French colonies and I have been able to show in a series
  of annotations published at the Academy of Sciences, or at the
  Academy of Medicine, and at the Society of Biology that
  <i>Anopheles</i> can be found in all the malarial localities.</p>

  <p>Dr. Battesti and I have demonstrated that
  <i>Anopheles</i> could be found in all the malarial localities of
  Corsica which had been considered free from these Culicidae.</p>

  <p>On my suggestion leagues against malaria
  have been set up in Corsica and in Algeria. These leagues have
  already rendered great service, the principal aim which they have
  to strive for being to spread among the public the new ideas
  concerning the cause, the mode of transmission, and the rational
  prophylaxis of malaria.</p>

  <p>This year I have published the second
  edition of my <i>Trait&eacute; du paludisme</i> and in the
  Introduction I have been able to write: "Malaria, the history of
  which not long ago presented such obscurities, is today one of
  the best known diseases. The study of the clinical forms and the
  pathological changes has been completed and defined; the
  haematozoon which I described in 1880 has been recognized by all
  writers as the cause of malaria; its propagation by mosquitoes
  has been demonstrated, and now we are able to fight the malady by
  specific drug treatment and rational prophylaxis."</p>

  <p>I come now to the examination of my other
  work on the intracellular haematozoa, the number of which has
  increased continually since the discovery of <i>Haemamoeba
  malariae</i>.</p>

  <p>As from 1889, I have classified the
  endoglobular haematozoa or Haemocytozoa in three genera:
  <i>Haemamoeba, Piroplasma, Haemogregarina</i>.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Haemamoeba</i>, I have
  studied the haemamoebae of birds which closely resemble <i>H.
  malariae</i> and I have described several new species in <i>Padda
  oryzivora</i>, in a titmouse, in the partridge and the
  turkey.</p>

  <p>In 1889, I studied with Nicolle <i>P.
  bigeminum</i> and <i>P. ovis</i> in the genus <i>Piroplasma</i>
  and described the forms of multiplication of these
  haematozoa.</p>

  <p>In 1901, I described <i>Piroplasma equi</i>
  and in 1903, the bacilliform piroplasma of the Bovidae from
  preparations which had been sent to me by Mr. Theiler, a
  Transvaal veterinary surgeon.</p>

  <p>In 1903 and 1904, Mesnil and I helped to
  make known, under the name of <i>Piroplasma Donovani</i>, the
  parasite of Kala-Azar discovered in India by Doctors Leishman and
  Donovan.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Haemogregarina</i>, I
  studied the endoglobular parasites of Chelonians, Bactrachians,
  Saurians, Ophidia, and fishes.</p>

  <p>I described the forms of endogenous
  multiplication of the haemogregarines of Chelonians and reported
  a series of new species.</p>

  <p>From 1897 to 1900, I published either by
  myself or with the collaboration of Mesnil, a series of notes on
  the Sporozoa, properly so-called: Coccidia and Myxosporidia, of
  which I reported several new species, Sarcosporidia and
  Gregarines.</p>

  <p>In recent years I have devoted myself to
  the study of the trypanosomes which are the cause of a large
  number of epizootics: Surra, Nagana, Dourine, Souma, etc.; the
  pathological importance of these parasites has increased
  especially since it has been shown that the grave endemic disease
  known in Equatorial Africa under the name of sleeping sickness,
  was produced by a trypanosome <i>Tr. gambiense</i>.</p>

  <p>Trypanosomes are <i>Protozoa</i>, very
  different from the endoglobular haematozoa; they live in the free
  state in the plasma and not in a state of inclusion in the red
  cells or in other anatomical elements; they belong to the class
  of Flagellidae.</p>

  <p>The body protoplasm of a trypanosome is
  generally fusiform and more or less tapered at the ends. When
  stained, two masses of chromatin can be seen: a large one towards
  the middle of the body, the nucleus; the other, small, situated
  usually near the posterior end, the centrosome. The flagella
  which starts from the centrosome and bounds the undulating
  membrane usually ends at the anterior extremity by a free portion
  which forms the flagellaproper.</p>

  <p>I have published a large number of notes
  and memoranda on the trypanosomes, and in 1904, with Mesnil a
  monograph entitled: <i>Trypanosomes et Trypanosomiases</i>.</p>

  <p>Among the original investigations carried
  out either by myself or in collaboration, I should like to
  mention: investigations on the structure of trypanosomes and of
  that of the Flagellidae in general; the agglutination of
  trypanosomes and the conditions which produce it; the
  differentiation of the trypanosomiases; the trypanosomes of rats,
  <i>Tr. Lewisi</i>, of Nagana, <i>Tr. Brucei</i>, of horses in the
  Gambia, <i>Tr. dimorphon</i>; of sleeping sickness <i>Tr.
  gambianse</i>, one affecting bovines in the Transvaal <i>Tr.
  Theileri</i>, on three new species pathogenic for equines and
  bovines of the Upper Niger, <i>Tr. Cazalboui</i>, <i>Tr.
  Pecaudi</i>, and <i>Tr. soudanense</i>; on new trypanosomes of
  birds, Chelonians, Bactracians or fishes.</p>

  <p>As far as fishes are concerned Mesnil and I
  have established the existence not only of new species but of a
  new genus, <i>Trypanoplasma</i>.</p>

  <p>Trypanoplasma have been found in the rudd,
  carp, and minnow. Their structure differs markedly from that of
  the trypanosomes as can be ascertained from well-stained
  specimens. The body protoplasm is generally crescentic; there are
  two chromatin masses, the larger one, the nucleus, on the side of
  the convexity, the other narrower, more deeply stained situated
  usually on the edge of the concavity, the centrosome. This gives
  rise to two flagellae, an anterior one which becomes free at
  once, and one which borders the undulating membrane and only
  becomes free at the posterior extremity.</p>

  <p>I have published several notes on the
  distribution of the <i>Glossinae</i> (tsetse) in Equatorial
  Africa and of other biting flies capable of propagating the
  trypanosomiases.</p>

  <p>Finally, I should mention a series of
  papers on the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases due to
  trypanosomes. In 1904, I showed that arsenious acid (in the form
  of sodium arsenite) produced excellent effects in infections due
  to <i>Tr. gambiense</i>; and in 1904 and 1905, I communicated
  several notes to the Academy of Sciences on the combined
  treatment of various trypanosomiases by arsenious acid and Trypan
  red. With this method of treatment I have had good results in
  mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys infected with <i>Tr. Evansi</i>,
  <i>Tr. gambiense</i>, <i>Tr. equiperdum</i>; unfortunately later
  investigations have shown that Trypan red is badly tolerated by
  man.</p>

  <p>With Dr. Thiroux. I undertook new
  experiments aimed at investigating whether the combination of two
  different arsenical preparations would not give better results
  than the use of arsenious acid alone or atoxyl alone. The results
  which we obtained by combining atoxyl with arsenic trisulphide or
  arsenious iodide have been very satisfactory and we hope that
  this new drug treatment may be used in human trypanosomiasis or
  sleeping sickness which is raging at the present time among the
  natives of Equatorial Africa and of which there are more and more
  cases among Europeans.</p>

  <p>To summarize: for twenty-seven years, I
  have not ceased to busy myself with the study of the parasitic
  Protozoa of man and animals and I can say, I believe without
  exaggeration, that I have taken an important part in the progress
  which has been made in this field.</p>

  <p>Before the discovery of the malarial
  haemotozoon no pathogenic endoglobular haematozoon was known;
  today the <i>Haemocytozoa</i> constitute a family, important for
  the number of genera and species and also for the role some of
  these Protozoa play in human or veterinary pathology.</p>

  <p>By directing the attention of doctors and
  veterinary surgeons to examination of the blood, study of the
  endoglobular haematozoa prepared the way for the discovery of the
  diseases due to trypanosomes which themselves also constitute a
  new and very important chapter in pathology.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of these new pathogenic
  agents has thrown a strong light on a large number of formerly
  obscure questions. The progress attained shows once more how just
  is the celebrated axiom formulated by Bacon: "Bene est scire, per
  causas scire."</p>
