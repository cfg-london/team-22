  <h1>Anatole France - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="france.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Anatole France</b>, pseudonym for
  Jacques Anatole Thibault (1844-1924), was the son of a Paris book
  dealer. He received a thorough classical education at the
  Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas, a boys' school in Paris, and for a while
  he studied at the &Eacute;cole des Chartes. For about twenty years
  he held diverse positions, but he always had enough time for his
  own writings, especially during his period as assistant librarian
  at the Senate from 1876 to 1890. His literary output is vast, and
  though he is chiefly known as a novelist and storyteller, there
  is hardly a literary genre that he did not touch upon at one time
  or another. France is a writer in the mainstream of French
  classicism. His style, modelled on Voltaire and
  F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, as well as his urbane scepticism and
  enlightened hedonism, continue the tradition of the French
  eighteenth century. This outlook on life, which appears in all
  his works, is explicitly expressed in collection of aphorisms,
  <i>Le Jardin d'&Eacute;picure</i> (1895) [<i>The Garden of
  Epicurus</i>].</p>
  
  <p>France had written several stories and novels before he achieved
  his first great success with <i>Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard</i>
  (1881). The novel received a prize from the Acad&eacute;mie
  Fran&ccedil;aise, of which France became a member in 1896.</p>
  
  <p>In 1885 he published <i>Le Livre de mon ami</i> [<i>My Friend's
  Book</i>], a kind of autobiographical novel, which he continued
  with Pierre Nozi&egrave;re (1899), <i>Le Petit Pierre</i> (1918),
  and <i>La Vie au fleur</i> (1922) [<i>The Bloom of Life</i>].
  From 1888 to 1892 France was the literary critic of the newspaper
  <i>Le Temps</i>. His reviews, inspired by the scepticism of
  Renan, but highly subjective, were collected in four volumes
  under the title <i>La Vie litt&eacute;raire</i> (1888-92) [<i>On
  Life and Letters</i>]. About this time France turned sharply
  against the naturalism of Zola. His own work of this period
  consists of historical fiction that evokes past civilizations
  with great charm and deep insight. The period of transition from
  paganism to Christianity was one of his favourites. In 1889
  appeared <i>Balthazar</i>, a fanciful version of the story of one
  of the Magi, and in 1890 <i>Tha&iuml;s</i>, the story of the
  conversion of an Alexandrian courtesan during the Christian era.
  <i>L'&Eacute;tui de nacre</i> (1892) [<i>Mother of Pearl</i>] is
  the story of a hermit and a faun, an ironic conjunction typical
  of France's art.</p>
  
  <p>In 1893 France published his most celebrated novel, <i>La
  R&ocirc;tisserie de la Reine P&eacute;dauque</i> [<i>At the Sign of
  the Reine P&eacute;dauque</i>], a vast tableau of life in
  eighteenth century France. The central figure of the novel, the
  Abb&eacute; Coignard, a complex, ironical, and lovable character,
  reappears in <i>Les Opinions de J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Coignard</i>
  (1893) and the collection of stories <i>Le Puits de Sainte
  Claire</i> (1895) [<i>The Well of Saint Claire</i>]. With the
  tragic love story, <i>Le Lys rouge</i> (1894) [<i>The Red
  Lily</i>], France returned to a contemporary subject and in the
  following years wrote <i>Histoire contemporaine</i> (1896-1901),
  a group of prose works, not really novels, that have their unity
  in the character of Professor Bergeret, one of France's most
  famous creations.</p>
  
  <p>In his later years France became increasingly interested in
  social questions. He protested the verdict in the Dreyfus case
  and developed some sympathies for socialism. Among his last
  important works were a biography of Joan of Arc (1908), <i>Les
  Dieux ont soif</i> (1912) [<i>The Gods are Athirst</i>], and
  <i>La R&eacute;volte des anges</i> (1914) [<i>The Revolt of the
  Angels</i>]. The collected works of Anatole France were published
  in twenty-five volumes between 1925 and 1935.</p>
