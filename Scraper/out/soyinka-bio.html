  <h1>Wole Soyinka - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="soyinka.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Wole Soyinka</b> was born on 13 July 1934 at Abeokuta, 
              near Ibadan in western Nigeria. After preparatory university studies 
              in 1954 at Government College in Ibadan, he continued at the University of Leeds, where, later, in 1973, he took his 
              doctorate. During the six years spent in England, he was a dramaturgist 
              at the Royal Court Theatre in London 1958-1959. In 1960, he was 
              awarded a Rockefeller bursary and returned to Nigeria to study African 
              drama. At the same time, he taught drama and literature at various 
              universities in Ibadan, Lagos, and Ife, where, since 1975, he has 
              been professor of comparative literature. In 1960, he founded the 
              theatre group, "The 1960 Masks" and in 1964, the "Orisun Theatre 
              Company", in which he has produced his own plays and taken part 
              as actor. He has periodically been visiting professor at the universities 
              of Cambridge, 
              Sheffield, 
              and Yale.<br>

  During the civil war in Nigeria, Soyinka appealed in an article
  for cease-fire. For this he was arrested in 1967, accused of
  conspiring with the Biafra rebels, and was held as a political
  prisoner for 22 months until 1969. Soyinka has published about
  20 works: drama, novels and poetry. He writes in English and his
  literary language is marked by great scope and richness of
  words.<br>
  <br>
  As dramatist, Soyinka has been influenced by, among others, the
  Irish writer, J.M. Synge, but links up with the traditional
  popular African theatre with its combination of dance, music, and
  action. He bases his writing on the mythology of his own
  tribe-the Yoruba-with Ogun, the god of iron and war, at the
  centre. He wrote his first plays during his time in London,
  <i>The Swamp Dwellers</i> and <i>The Lion and the Jewel</i> (a
  light comedy), which were performed at Ibadan in 1958 and 1959
  and were published in 1963. Later, satirical comedies are <i>The
  Trial of Brother Jero</i> (performed in 1960, publ. 1963) with
  its sequel, <i>Jero's Metamorphosis</i> (performed 1974, publ.
  1973), <i>A Dance of the Forests</i> (performed 1960, publ.1963),
  <i>Kongi's Harvest</i> (performed 1965, publ. 1967) and <i>Madmen
  and Specialists</i> (performed 1970, publ. 1971). Among Soyinka's
  serious philosophic plays are (apart from "<i>The Swamp
  Dwellers</i>") <i>The Strong Breed</i> (performed 1966, publ.
  1963), <i>The Road</i> ( 1965) and <i>Death and the King's
  Horseman</i> (performed 1976, publ. 1975). In <i>The Bacchae of
  Euripides</i> (1973), he has rewritten the Bacchae for the
  African stage and in <i>Opera Wonyosi</i> (performed 1977, publ.
  1981), bases himself on John Gay's <i>Beggar's Opera</i> and
  Brecht's <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>. Soyinka's latest dramatic
  works are <i>A Play of Giants</i> (1984) and <i>Requiem for a
  Futurologist</i> (1985).<br>
  <br>
  Soyinka has written two novels, <i>The Interpreters</i> (1965),
  narratively, a complicated work which has been compared to
  Joyce's and <a href="../1949/index.html">Faulkner's</a>, in which
  six Nigerian intellectuals discuss and interpret their African
  experiences, and <i>Season of Anomy</i> (1973) which is based on
  the writer's thoughts during his imprisonment and confronts the
  Orpheus and Euridice myth with the mythology of the Yoruba.
  Purely autobiographical are <i>The Man Died: Prison Notes</i>
  (1972) and the account of his childhood, <i>Ak&eacute;</i> ( 1981),
  in which the parents' warmth and interest in their son are
  prominent. Literary essays are collected in, among others,
  <i>Myth, Literature and the African World</i> (1975).<br>
  <br>
  Soyinka's poems, which show a close connection to his plays, are
  collected in <i>Idanre, and Other Poems</i> (1967), <i>Poems from
  Prison</i> (1969), <i>A Shuttle in the Crypt</i> (1972) the long
  poem <i>Ogun Abibiman</i> (1976) and <i>Mandela's Earth and Other
  Poems</i> (1988).</p>
