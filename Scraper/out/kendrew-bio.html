  <h1>John C. Kendrew - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kendrew.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>John Cowdery Kendrew</b> was born on
  24th March, 1917, in Oxford. His father, Wilfrid George Kendrew,
  was Reader in Climatology in the University of Oxford; his mother, Evelyn May
  Graham (Sandberg) Kendrew, was an art historian, for many years
  resident in Florence, Italy, where she published works on the
  Italian Primitives under the <i>nom de plume</i> Evelyn Sandberg
  Vavals.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford (1923-1930) and
  Clifton College,
  Bristol (1930-1936), and went to Trinity College,
  Cambridge in 1936 as a Major Scholar. He graduated in
  Chemistry in 1939, and spent the first few months of the war
  doing research on reaction kinetics in the Department of Physical
  Chemistry at Cambridge under the supervision of Dr. E.A.
  Moelwyn-Hughes. He then became a member of the Air Ministry
  Research Establishment (later Telecommunication Research
  Establishment) and worked on radar. In 1940 he joined the staff
  of Sir Robert Watson-Watt (Scientific Adviser to the Air
  Ministry) and for the rest of the war was engaged in operational
  research at Royal Air Force headquarters, successively in Coastal
  Command, Middle East, and South East Asia (where he was
  Scientific Adviser to the Allied Air Commander-in-Chief); he held
  the honorary rank of Wing Commander R.A.F.<br>
  <br>
  During the war years his interests became more biological, and
  largely owing to the influence of J.D. Bernal and <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">L. Pauling</a> he decided to work on the
  structure of proteins. He returned to Cambridge in 1946 and, in
  the Cavendish Laboratory, began a collaboration with Max Perutz,
  under the direction of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html">Sir Lawrence Bragg</a>. He
  took his Ph.D. degree in 1949 and his Sc.D. in I962. He and
  Perutz were the first two members of the Medical Research Council
  Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory, which has now achieved separate
  existence as the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular
  Biology; he was Deputy Director of the former, and is now Deputy
  Chairman of the latter, and Director of its Division of
  Structural Studies.<br>
  <br>
  He became a Fellow of Peterhouse in 1947, Reader at the
  Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution in London in
  1954, Fellow of the Royal Society in 1960, and an honorary member of the
  American Society of Biological Chemists in 1962. Since 1960 he
  has been (part-time) Deputy to the Chief Scientific Adviser,
  Ministry of Defence. He is Founder and Editor-in-Chief of the
  <i>Journal of Molecular Biology</i>, and Honorary Secretary of
  the British Biophysical Society. In 1962, he was made Companion
  of the British Empire.<br>
  <br>
  His research has been in the field of protein structure, and has
  mostly centred on the X-ray analysis of myoglobin. This project
  culminated in the production of a three-dimensional model of
  myoglobin at 6&Aring; resolution in 1957, and an almost complete
  structure in 1960.<br>
  <br>
  Kendrew is unmarried. His recreations are music, history of art
  (following his mother's footsteps particularly Italian art), and
  travelling in Italy.</p>
