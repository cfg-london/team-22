  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1982</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>The Latin American Nuclear-Weapon Free Zone</h2>

  <p>In seems advisable to point out from the
  outset that the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone has the
  privilege of being the only one in existence which covers densely
  inhabited territories. Outside it only in Antarctica, the Outer
  Space and the sea bed are similar prohibitions in force, based on
  treaties concluded in 1959, 1967 and 1971, respectively.</p>

  <p>The official title of the treaty which
  established the Latin American zone and defined its statute is
  the &quot;Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
  America&quot;, but it is usually referred to as the &quot;Treaty of
  Tlatelolco&quot;, employing the Aztec name for the district of the
  Mexican capital where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico
  is located and where the treaty itself was opened to signature
  almost sixteen years ago, on February 14, 1967.</p>

  <p>The modest purpose of this lecture is to
  provide a synoptic view both of the genesis and the provisions of
  the treaty.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>I. Genesis of the Treaty of
  Tlatelolco</i><br>
  <br>
  The first international document in the history of the events
  directly related to the genesis of the Treaty of Tlatelolco was
  the Joint Declaration of 29 April 1963. In this declaration the
  Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico
  announced that their governments were willing to sign a Latin
  American multilateral agreement by which they would undertake not
  &quot;to manufacture, store, or test nuclear weapons or devices for
  launching nuclear weapons&quot;.</p>

  <p>Seven months later, the United Nations
  General Assembly, taking as a basis a draft resolution submitted
  by eleven Latin American countries (the five previously
  mentioned, plus Costa Rica, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Panama
  and Uruguay), approved on 27 November 1963 resolution 1911
  (XVIII). In this resolution <i>inter alia</i> the General
  Assembly welcomed the initiative of the five Presidents for the
  military denuclearization of Latin America; expressed the hope
  that the States of the region would initiate studies &quot;concerning
  the measures that should be agreed upon with a view to achieving
  the aims&quot; of the Joint Declaration, and requested the
  Secretary-General of the United Nations to extend to the States
  of Latin America, at their request, &quot;such technical facilities as
  they may require in order to achieve the aims set forth in the
  present resolution&quot;.</p>

  <p>Almost one year elapsed between the
  adoption of this General Assembly resolution and the next step
  worth mentioning in a review of the antecedents of the treaty.
  This interval was not wasted, however. The Mexican Government put
  it to good use with active diplomatic consultations which
  resulted in the convening of a Latin American conference known as
  the &quot;Preliminary Session on the Denuclearization of Latin
  America&quot; (or REUPRAL, its Spanish acronym). Meeting in Mexico
  City from 23 to 27 November 1964, REUPRAL adopted a measure which
  was later to prove decisive for the success of the Latin American
  enterprise - the creation of an <i>ad hoc</i> organ, the
  &quot;Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin
  America&quot; (known also by its Spanish acronym, COPREDAL). The
  Preparatory Commission was specifically instructed (in the same
  resolution whereby it was established) &quot;to prepare a preliminary
  draft of a multilateral treaty for the denuclearization of Latin
  America, and to this end, to conduct any prior studies and take
  any prior steps that it deems necessary&quot;.<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>*</sup></a></p>

  <p>COPREDAL had its first session in Mexico
  City from 15 to 22 March 1965. In this session, the Commission
  adopted its rules of procedure and set up four subsidiary organs:
  a Coordination Committee and three working groups. Subsequently
  the Commission would create another subsidiary organ - the
  &quot;Negotiating Committee&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Preparatory Commission held a total of
  four sessions, the last of which took place just under two years
  after its creation, from 31 January to 14 February 1967. Contrary
  to what has generally happened with other disarmament treaties
  and conventions, the draft articles for the future treaty dealing
  with verification, inspection, and control were the first to be
  completed at the second session of the Commission (23 August-2
  September 1965). At that time a full declaration of principles
  was also drafted to serve as a basis for the Preamble of the
  draft treaty.</p>

  <p>During its third session, COPREDAL received
  from its Coordinating Committee a working paper which contained
  the complete text of a preliminary draft for the treaty that the
  Commission had received the mandate to prepare. This draft,
  together with other proposals submitted by member states,
  provided the basis for the deliberations of the session. Their
  result was the unanimous approval of a document entitled
  &quot;Proposals for the Preparation of the Treaty for the
  Denuclearization of Latin America&quot; which played as prominent a
  role in the history of the treaty as that of the Dumbarton Oaks
  proposals in the history of the United Nations<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>1</sup></a> These &quot;Proposals&quot; included all
  provisions which might prove necessary for the treaty as a whole,
  although in some cases COPREDAL, not having been able to find
  solutions satisfactory to all, had been obliged to present to the
  Governments two parallel alternatives.</p>

  <p>From those few pending questions which the
  Commission would be called upon to solve at its fourth session,
  the most important one was the entry into force of the treaty.
  This issue provoked what was probably the greatest discussion in
  COPREDAL's proceedings. Because of this problem and due to the
  positive precedent established by COPREDAL's solution to the
  problem, it is worth examining the proceedings in somewhat
  greater detail.</p>

  <p>When the Preparatory Commission considered
  this subject in April 1966, two distinct views became apparent.
  According to the first view, the treaty should come into force,
  between states which would ratify it, on the date of deposit of
  their respective instruments of ratification, in keeping with
  standard practice. The representative Latin American body to be
  established by the treaty should begin to function as soon as
  eleven instruments of ratification were deposited, as this number
  constituted a majority of the twenty-one members of the
  Preparatory Commission. Those states supporting the alternative
  view argued that the treaty, although signed and ratified by all
  member states of the Preparatory Commission, should enter into
  force only upon completion of four requirements, essentially
  those defined in Article 28 of the treaty. These four
  requirements may be summarized as follows: the signature and
  ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco and its Additional
  Protocols I and II by all states to which they were opened, and
  the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements concerning
  the application of the Safeguards System of the International
  Atomic Energy Agency by each party to the treaty.</p>

  <p>As a result of these differing views
  COPREDAL was obliged to present, in its proposals, two parallel
  texts. These texts stated respectively the provisions that the
  treaty would contain, according to whether one accepted the first
  or the second thesis. To solve the problem, the Coordinating
  Committee, in its report of 28 December 1966, suggested the
  adoption of a conciliatory formula, which could receive the
  approval of all member states of the Commission without detriment
  to their respective positions on the alternative texts. It was
  this formula, with some modifications, which was finally adopted
  and incorporated into Article 28 of the treaty. In keeping with
  it, the treaty would go into effect for all states that had
  ratified it upon completion of the four requirements specified in
  paragraph 1 of Article 28. That notwithstanding, the second
  paragraph of the Article states:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;All signatory states shall have the imprescriptible right
    to waive, wholly or in part, the requirements laid down in the
    preceding paragraph. They may do so by means of a declaration
    which shall be annexed to their respective instrument of
    ratification and which may be formulated at the time of deposit
    of the instrument or subsequently. For those states which
    exercise this right, this Treaty shall enter into force upon
    deposit of the declaration, or as soon as those requirements
    have been met which have not been expressly waived&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Moreover, the third paragraph of the same
  Article stipulates:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;As soon as this Treaty has entered into force in accordance
    with the provisions of paragraph 2 for eleven states, the
    Depositary Government shall convene a preliminary meeting of
    those states in order that the Agency may be set up and
    commence its work&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As one can see, an eclectic system was
  adopted, which, while respecting the viewpoints of all signatory
  states, prevented nonetheless any particular state from
  precluding the enactment of the treaty for those which would
  voluntarily wish to accept the statute of military
  denuclearization defined therein.</p>

  <p>The Treaty of Tlatelolco has thus
  contributed effectively to dispel the myth that for the
  establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone it would be an
  essential requirement that all states of the region concerned
  should become, from the very outset, parties to the treaty
  establishing the zone. The system adopted in the Latin American
  instrument proves that, although no state can obligate another to
  join such a zone, neither can one prevent others wishing to do so
  from adhering to a regime of total absence of nuclear weapons
  within their own territories.</p>

  <p>Once the question of the entry into force
  of the treaty had been settled, at the fourth session of
  COPREDAL, the Preparatory Commission proceeded to settle, without
  major difficulties, the few other pending problems. On 12
  February 1967, the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
  in Latin America was unanimously approved and two days later, at
  the solemn closing ceremony of the Commission's proceedings, it
  was opened to signature and subscribed to by the representatives
  of fourteen of its twenty-one members. As of August 1982, fifteen
  years later, the number of signatory states stands at
  twenty-five, of which twenty-two are already parties to the
  treaty.</p>

  <p>Additional Protocol I which is open to the
  four States - United Kingdom, Netherlands, United States, and
  France - which are internationally responsible for territories
  lying within the limits of the geographical zone established in
  the treaty, has been signed by all those states and ratified by
  the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States. With
  regard to France it seems that the ratification process is at
  present well advanced. The five nuclear weapon states - the
  United Kingdom, the United States, France, China and the Soviet
  Union - are already parties to Additional Protocol II which is
  destined for them.</p>

  <p>As provided for in paragraph 3 of Article
  28 previously quoted, as soon as the treaty entered into force
  for eleven states, the Depositary Government convened a
  &quot;preliminary meeting&quot; of those states in order to set up the
  Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
  known by its Spanish acronym OPANAL. This preliminary meeting
  (REOPANAL) took place in late June 1969 and carried out
  successfully all the preparatory work necessary for the first
  session of the General Conference of OPANAL. The latter was
  inaugurated on 2 September 1969 in the presence of U Thant, the
  then Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Sigvard Eklund,
  the Director-General of the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/index.html">International
  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a>. After seven working days the General Conference gave its
  approval to a series of basic juridical and administrative
  documents which provided the foundations for the Latin American
  Agency created by the treaty. To date the General Conference has
  held seven regular sessions and two special sessions in
  accordance with the provisions of Article 9.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>II. Analytical Summary of the Treaty of
  Tlatelolco</i><br>
  <br>
  As a complement to the above brief survey of the preparatory work
  leading to the conclusion of the Tlatelolco Treaty, the following
  paragraphs are intended to give a general idea of its contents
  and to carry out a brief analytical summary of some of its main
  provisions.</p>

  <p>The treaty comprises a preamble, thirty-one
  articles, one transitional article and two additional
  protocols.</p>

  <p>The preamble defines the fundamental aims
  pursued by the states which drafted the treaty by stating their
  conviction that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The military denuclearization of Latin
    America - being understood to mean the undertaking entered into
    internationally in this Treaty to keep their territories
    forever free from nuclear weapons - will constitute a measure
    which will spare their peoples from the squandering of their
    limited resources on nuclear armaments and will protect them
    against possible nuclear attacks on their territories, and will
    also constitute a significant contribution towards preventing
    the proliferation of nuclear weapons and a powerful factor for
    general and complete disarmament&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is also worth noting that the Final
  Document approved by the first special session of the UN General
  Assembly devoted to disarmament, which met May-June 1978,
  contains several declaratory statements of a striking similarity
  to those included in the sixteen-year-old preamble of the Treaty
  of Tlatelolco. The Latin American states, for instance, declared
  themselves convinced:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;That the incalculable destructive power
    of nuclear weapons has made it imperative that the legal
    prohibition of war should be strictly observed in practice if
    the survival of civilization and of mankind itself is to be
    assured,<br>
    <br>
    That nuclear weapons, whose terrible effects are suffered,
    indiscriminately and inexorably, by military forces and
    civilian population alike, constitute, through the persistence
    of the radioactivity they release, an attack on the integrity
    of the human species and ultimately may even render the whole
    earth uninhabitable&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The United Nations, for its part, has
  proclaimed:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Mankind today is confronted with an unprecedented threat of
    self-extinction arising from the massive and competitive
    accumulation of the most destructive weapons ever produced.
    Existing arsenals of nuclear weapons alone are more than
    sufficient to destroy all life on earth ...<br>
    <br>
    Unless its avenues are closed, the continued arms race means a
    growing threat to international peace and security and even to
    the very survival of mankind ...<br>
    <br>
    Removing the threat of a world war - a nuclear war - is the
    most acute and urgent task of the present day. Mankind is
    confronted with a choice: we must halt the arms race and
    proceed to disarmament or face annihilation&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As to the articles of the treaty, their
  contents may be described briefly as follows:</p>

  <p>Article 1 defines the obligations of the
  parties. The following four articles (2-5) provide definitions of
  some terms employed in the treaty: contracting parties,
  territory, zone of application and nuclear weapons. Article 6
  deals with the &quot;meeting of signatories&quot;, while Articles 7-11
  establish the structure and procedures of the &quot;Agency for the
  Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America&quot; (OPANAL) created
  by the treaty, and state the functions and powers of its
  principal organs: the General Conference, the Council and the
  Secretariat. The five succeeding articles (12-16) and paragraphs
  2 and 3 of Article 18 describe the functioning of the &quot;control
  system&quot;, also established by the treaty. Article 17 contains
  general provisions on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and
  Article 18 deals with peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>

  <p>Article 19 examines the relations of OPANAL
  with other international organizations, whereas Article 20
  outlines the measures that the General Conference shall take in
  cases of serious violations of the treaty, such measures mainly
  involving simultaneous transmission of reports to the Security
  Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. Article
  21 safeguards the rights and obligations of the parties under the
  Charter of the United Nations and, in the case of states members
  of the Organization of American States, under existing regional
  treaties. Article 23 makes it binding for the contracting parties
  to notify the Secretariat of OPANAL of any international
  agreement concluded by any of them on matters with which the
  treaty is concerned.</p>

  <p>The settlement of controversies concerning
  the interpretation or application of the treaty is covered by
  Article 24. Articles 22, 25-27 and 29-31 contain what is
  generally known as &quot;final clauses&quot; dealing with questions such as
  privileges and immunities, signature, ratification and deposit,
  reservations (which the treaty does not admit), amendments,
  duration and denunciation, and authentic texts and registration.
  The transitional article specifies that &quot;denunciation of the
  declaration referred to in Article 28, paragraph 2, shall be
  subject to the same procedures as the denunciation&quot; of the
  treaty, except that it will take effect on the date of delivery
  of the respective notification and not three months later as
  provided in Article 30, paragraph 2, for denunciation of the
  treaty. In paragraph 2 of Article 26, the Government of Mexico is
  designated the &quot;Depositary Government&quot; of the treaty whereas
  Article 7, paragraph 4, stipulates that the headquarters of
  OPANAL &quot;shall be in Mexico City&quot;. Finally, Article 28 reflects in
  its text the compromise formula which, as already explained,
  overcame the most serious obstacle which confronted COPREDAL: the
  entry into force of the treaty.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Additional Protocols</i> to the
  treaty have identical preambles. Their texts recall UN Resolution
  1911 (XVIII) and state the conviction that the treaty &quot;represents
  an important step towards ensuring the non-proliferation of
  nuclear weapons&quot;. The texts also point out that the treaty &quot;is
  not an end in itself but, rather, a means of achieving general
  and complete disarmament at a later stage&quot;, and finally express
  the desire to contribute &quot;towards ending the armaments race&quot;. The
  operative parts of the protocols are naturally different from one
  another, although they have identical duration (the same as that
  of the treaty) and entry into force for the states which ratify
  each Protocol (the date of the deposit of the respective
  instruments of ratification).</p>

  <p>Under Article 1 of <i>Additional Protocol
  I,</i> those extra-continental states which, <i>de jure or
  defacto,</i> are internationally responsible for territories
  lying within the limits of the geographical zone established by
  the treaty would, upon becoming parties to the protocol, agree
  &quot;to undertake to apply the statute of denuclearization in respect
  to warlike purposes as defined in Articles 1, 3, 5 and 13 of the
  Treaty&quot; to such territories.</p>

  <p>One aspect which should be borne in mind is
  that this protocol does not give those states the right to
  participate in the General Conference or in the Council of the
  Latin American Agency. But neither does it impose on those states
  any of the obligations relating to the system of control
  established in Article 14 (providing for semi-annual reports), in
  Article 15 (providing for special reports), and in Article 16
  (providing for special inspections). In addition, the prohibition
  of reservations included in the treaty's Article 27 is not
  applicable to the protocol. Thus, in the protocol the necessary
  balance has been preserved between rights and obligations:
  although the rights are less extensive, the obligations are also
  fewer.</p>

  <p>With regard to <i>Additional Protocol
  II,</i> the obligations assumed by the nuclear powers parties to
  the protocol are stated in its Articles 1 through 3 in the
  following terms:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Respecting &quot;in all its express aims and provisions&quot; the
    &quot;statute of denuclearization of Latin America in respect of
    warlike purposes, as defined, delimited and set forth&quot; in the
    Treaty of Tlatelolco.<br>
    <br>
    Not contributing &quot;in anyway to the performance of acts
    involving a violation of the obligations of Article 1 of the
    Treaty in the territories to which the Treaty applies&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Not using or threatening to use &quot;nuclear weapons against the
    contracting parties of the Treaty&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i>III. Conclusions</i><br>
  <br>
  The importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones has been emphasized
  several times by the United Nations. The General Assembly in its
  Resolution 3472 B (XXX) of 11 December 1975 stated that
  &quot;nuclear-weapon-free zones constitute one of the most effective
  means for preventing the proliferation, both horizontal and
  vertical, of nuclear weapons and for contributing to the
  elimination of the danger of a nuclear holocaust&quot;.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, on 30 June 1978 the General
  Assembly, in the Program of Action adopted by consensus as its
  first special session devoted to disarmament, stressed the
  significance of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as
  a disarmament measure.</p>

  <p>The weight which the international
  community attaches to the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone
  was manifest from the very moment the Treaty of Tlatelolco was
  presented to the General Assembly. In its Resolution 2286 (XXII)
  of 5 December 1967, the General Assembly welcomed it &quot;with
  particular satisfaction&quot; and declared that it &quot;constitutes an
  event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the
  proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international
  peace and security&quot;. Such weight has been once again evidenced
  when, in the general debate of the first special disarmament
  Assembly, no less than forty-five States had supportive comments
  for the treaty.</p>

  <p>The Treaty of Tlatelolco has shown the
  crucial importance of <i>ad hoc</i> preparatory efforts, such as
  those carried out for two years by COPREDAL, in attaining the
  desired goal. Furthermore, the Latin American nuclear-weapon free
  zone which is now nearing completion has become in several
  respects an example which, notwithstanding the different
  characteristics of each region, is rich in inspiration. It
  provides profitable lessons for all states wishing to contribute
  to the broadening of the areas of the world from which those
  terrible instruments of mass destruction that are the nuclear
  weapons would be forever proscribed, process which, as
  unanimously declared by the General Assembly in 1978, &quot;should be
  encouraged with the ultimate objective of achieving a world
  entirely free of nuclear weapons&quot;.</p>
