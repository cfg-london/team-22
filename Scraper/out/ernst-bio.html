  <h1>Richard R. Ernst - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ernst.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born 1933 in Winterthur,
  Switzerland, where our ancestors resided at least since the 15th
  century. We lived in a home built in 1898 by my grandfather, a
  merchant. My father, Robert Ernst, was teaching as an architect
  at the technical high school of our city. I had the great luck to
  grow up, together with two sisters, in a town that combined in a
  unique way artistic and industrious activities. Invaluable art
  collections and a small but first rank symphony orchestra carry
  the fame of Winterthur far across the borders of Switzerland. On
  the other hand, industries producing heavy machinery, like Diesel
  motors and railway engines, provided the commercial basis of
  prosperity.<br>
  <br>
  I soon became interested in both sides. Playing the violoncello
  brought me into numerous chamber and church music ensembles, and
  stimulated my interest in musical composition that I tried
  extensively while in high school. At the age of 13, I found in
  the attic a case filled with chemicals, remainders of an uncle
  who died in 1923 and was, as a metallurgical engineer, interested
  in chemistry and photography. I became almost immediately
  fascinated by the possibilities of trying out all conceivable
  reactions with them, some leading to explosions, others to
  unbearable poisoning of the air in our house, frightening my
  parents. However, I survived and started to read all chemistry
  books that I could get a hand on, first some 19th century books
  from our home library that did not provide much reliable
  information, and then I emptied the rather extensive city
  library. Soon, I knew that I would become a chemist, rather than
  a composer. I wanted to understand the secrets behind my chemical
  experiments and behind the processes in nature.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, after finishing high school, I started with high
  expectations and enthusiasm to study chemistry at the famous
  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH-Z). I was
  rapidly disappointed by the state of chemistry in the early
  fifties as it was taught at ETH-Z; we students had to memorize
  incountable facts that even the professors did not understand. A
  good memory not impeccable logic was on demand. The physical
  chemistry lectures did not reveal much insight either, they were
  limited just to classical thermodynamics. Thus, I had to
  continue, similar as in high school, to gain some decent chemical
  knowledge by reading. A book from which I learned a lot at that
  time was "Theoretical Chemistry" by S. Glasstone. It revealed to
  me the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, spectroscopy,
  statistical mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics, subjects
  that were never even mentioned in lectures, except in a voluntary
  and very excellent lecture course given by the young enthusiastic
  Professor Hans H. G&uuml;nthard who had studied chemistry and
  physics in parallel.<br>
  <br>
  It was clear to me, after my diploma as a "Diplomierter Ingenieur
  Chemiker" and some extensive military service, I had to start a
  PhD thesis in the laboratory of Professor G&uuml;nthard.
  Fortunately, he accepted me and associated me with a young most
  brilliant scientist Hans Primas, who never went through any
  formal studies but nevertheless acquired rapidly whatever he
  needed for his work that was then concerned with high resolution
  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a field in its infancy at that
  time. Much of his and also my time was spent on designing and
  building advanced electronic equipment for improved NMR
  spectrometers. In parallel, we developed the theoretical
  background for the experiments we had in mind as well as for the
  optimum performance of the instruments. Signal-to-noise ratio
  calculations and optimizations were daily routine as NMR suffers
  from a disappointingly low sensitivity that severely limits its
  applications. Hans Primas developed and analyzed field modulation
  techniques, constructed a field frequency lock system, and
  contributed a new design of shaped pole caps for the
  electromagnet that was supposed to deliver an extremely
  homogeneous magnetic field. These developments led to two types
  of spectrometers that were adopted by Tr&uuml;b-T&auml;uber, a
  Swiss electronics company, and sold all over Europe. Later in
  1965, Tr&uuml;b-T&auml;uber was dissolved, and the NMR
  spectroscopy section led to the foundation of Spectrospin AG that
  is, together with Bruker Analytische Messtechnik, nowadays the
  world leading producer of NMR spectrometers.<br>
  <br>
  My own work dealt with the construction of high sensitivity radio
  frequency preamplifiers and in particular high sensitivity probe
  assemblies, initially for a 25 MHz, later for a 75 MHz proton
  resonance spectrometer. On the theoretical side, I was concerned
  with stochastic resonance. The goal set by Hans Primas was the
  usage of random noise for the excitation of nuclear magnetic
  resonance, following the famous concepts of Norbert Wiener for
  the stochastic testing of non-linear systems. The theoretical
  treatment was based on a Volterra functional expansion using
  orthogonal stochastic polynomials. I tried in particular to
  design a scheme of homonuclear broadband decoupling to simplify
  proton resonance spectra. By applying a stochastic sequence with
  a shaped power spectral density that has a hole at the
  observation frequency, all extraneous protons should be decoupled
  without perturbing the observed proton spin. The theoretical
  difficulties were mainly concerned with the computation of the
  response to nonwhite noise. Experiments were not attempted at
  that time, we did not believe in the usefulness of the concept
  anyway, and I finished my thesis in 1962 with a feeling like an
  artist balancing on a high rope without any interested
  spectators.<br>
  <br>
  I thus decided to leave the university forever and tried to find
  an industrial job in the United States. Among numerous offers, I
  decided for Varian Associates in Palo Alto where famous
  scientists, like Weston A. Anderson, Ray Freeman, Jim Hyde,
  Martin Packard, and Harry Weaver, were working along similar lines as we in Z&uuml;rich but with a clear
  commercial goal in mind. This attracted my interest, hoping to
  find some motivation for my own work. And indeed, I was extremely
  lucky. Weston Anderson was on his way to invent Fourier transform
  spectroscopy in order to improve the sensitivity of NMR by
  parallel data acquisition. After his involvement in the
  development of a cute mechanical device, the "wheel of fortune",
  to generate and detect several frequencies in parallel, he
  proposed to me in 1964 to try a pulse excitation experiment that
  indeed led to Fourier transform (FT) NMR as we know it today. The
  first successful experiments were done in summer 1964 while
  Weston Anderson was abroad on an extensive business trip. In this
  work I could take advantage in an optimum way of my knowledge in
  system theory gained during my studies with Primas and
  G&uuml;nthard. The response to our invention was however meager.
  The paper that described our achievements was rejected twice by
  the Journal of Chemical Physics to be finally accepted and
  published in the Review of Scientific Instruments. Varian also
  resisted to build a spectrometer that incorporated the novel
  Fourier transform concept. It took many years before in the
  competitive company Bruker Analytische Messtechnik Tony Keller
  and his coworkers demonstrated in 1969 for the first time a
  commercial FT NMR spectrometer to the great amazement of Varian
  that had the patent rights on the invention.<br>
  <br>
  Still at Varian, I was further extending my earlier work on
  stochastic resonance with the introduction of heteronuclear
  broadband decoupling by noise irradiation, the "noise decoupling"
  that led to a rapid development in carbon-13 spectroscopy. It has
  been replaced later by the much more efficient multiple pulse
  schemes of Malcolm H. Levitt and Ray Freeman using composite
  pulses.<br>
  <br>
  Of major importance for the success of more advanced experiments
  and measurement techniques in NMR was the availability of small
  laboratory computers that could be hooked up directly to the
  spectrometer. During my last years at Varian (1966-68), we
  developed numerous computer applications in spectroscopy for
  automated experiments and improved data processing.<br>
  <br>
  In 1968 I returned, after an extensive trip through Asia, to
  Switzerland. A brief visit to Nepal started my insatiable love
  for Asian art. My main interest is directed towards Tibetan
  scroll paintings, the so-called thangkas, a unique and most
  exciting form of religious art with its own strict rules and
  nevertheless incorporating an incredible exuberance of
  creativity.<br>
  <br>
  Back in Switzerland, I had a chance to take over the lead of the
  NMR research group at the Laboratorium f&uuml;r Physikalische
  Chemie of ETH-Z after Professor Primas turned his interests more
  towards theoretical chemistry. Despite an initial lack of
  suitable instrumentation, I continued to work on methodological
  improvements of time-domain NMR with repetitive pulse experiments
  and Fourier double resonance. In addition, we performed the first
  pulsed time-domain chemically-induced dynamic nuclear
  polarization (CIDNP) experiments. We developed at that time also
  stochastic resonance as an alternative to pulse FT spectroscopy
  employing binary pseudo-random noise sequences for broadband
  excitation, correlating input and output noise. Similar work was
  done simultaneously by Prof. Reinhold Kaiser at the University of
  New Brunswick.<br>
  <br>
  The next fortunate event occurred in 1971 when my first graduate
  student, Thomas Baumann, visited the Ampere Summer School in
  Basko Polje, Yugoslavia, where Professor Jean Jeener proposed a
  simple two-pulse sequence that produces, after two-dimensional
  Fourier transformation, a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum. In the
  course of time, we recognized the importance and universality of
  his proposal. In my group, Enrico Bartholdi performed at first
  some analytical calculations to explore the features of 2D
  experiments. Finally in the summer of 1974, we tried our first
  experiments in desperate need of results to be presented at the
  VIth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological
  Systems, Kandersteg, 1974.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, it occurred to me that the 2D spectroscopy
  principle could also be applied to NMR imaging, previously
  proposed by <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/index.html">Paul
  Lauterbur</a>. This led then to the invention of Fourier imaging
  on which the at present most frequently used spin-warp imaging
  technique relies. First experiments were done by Anil Kumar and
  Dieter Welti.<br>
  <br>
  From then on, the development of multi-dimensional spectroscopy
  went very fast, inside and outside of our research group. Prof.
  John S. Waugh extended it for applications to solid state
  resonance, and the research group of Prof. Ray Freeman,
  particularly Geoffrey Bodenhausen, contributed some of the first
  heteronuclear experiments. We started 1976 an intense
  collaboration, lasting for 10 years, with Professor Kurt
  W&uuml;thrich of ETH-Z to develop applications of 2D spectroscopy
  in molecular biology. He and his research group have been
  responsible for most essential innovations that enabled the
  determination of the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules
  in solution.<br>
  <br>
  During the following years, a large number of ingenious
  coworkers, in particular Geoffrey Bodenhausen, Lukas
  Braunschweiler, Christian Griesinger, Anil Kumar, Malcolm H.
  Levitt, Slobodan Macura, Luciano M&uuml;ller, Ole W.
  S&oslash;rensen, and Alexander Wokaun, contributed numerous
  modifications of the basic 2D spectroscopy concept, such as
  relay-type coherence transfer, multiple quantum filtering,
  multiple quantum spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy,
  exclusive correlation spectroscopy, accordion spectroscopy, spy
  experiments, three-dimensional spectroscopy, and many more. In
  parallel, numerous other research groups contributed an even
  larger number of innovative methods.<br>
  <br>
  Besides these activities in high resolution NMR, we always had a
  research program in solid state NMR going aiming at
  methodological developments, such as improved 2D spectroscopy
  techniques and spin diffusion, and applications to particular
  systems such as one-dimensional organic conductors, polymer
  blends, and dynamics in hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acids in
  collaboration with Thomas Baumann, Pablo Caravatti, Federico
  Graf, Max Linder, Beat H. Meier, Rolf Meyer, Thierry Schaffhauser,
  Armin St&ouml;ckli, and Dieter Suter.<br>
  <br>
  More recently, I had also the pleasure to closely collaborate
  with Prof. Arthur Schweiger, an extremely innovative EPR
  spectroscopist, in the development of pulsed EPR and ENDOR
  techniques. This turned out to be a specially challenging field
  due to the inherent experimental difficulties and the many ways
  to overcome the problems.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years, more and more of my time has become absorbed by
  administrative work for the research council of ETH-Z of which I
  am presently the president. I recognized that teaching and
  research institutions vitally depend on the involvement of active
  scientists also in management functions.<br>
  <br>
  Looking back, I realize that I have been favored extraordinarily
  by external circumstances, the proper place at the proper time in
  terms of my PhD thesis, my first employment in the USA, hearing
  about Jean Jeener's idea, and in particular having had incredibly
  brilliant coworkers. At last, I am extremely grateful for the
  encouragement and for the occasional readjustment of my standards
  of value by my wife Magdalena who stayed with me so far for more
  than 28 years despite all the problems of being married to a
  selfish work-addict with an unpredictable temper. Magdalena has,
  without much input from my side, educated our three children:
  Anna Magdalena (kindergarten teacher), Katharina Elisabeth
  (elementary school teacher), and Hans-Martin Walter (still in
  high school). I am not surprised that they show no intention to
  follow in my footsteps, although if I had a second chance myself,
  I would certainly try to repeat my present career.</p>
