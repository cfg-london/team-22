  <h1>Louis J. Ignarro - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ignarro.jpg" class="bio-img"> The first two decades of my life were
  spent in the New York City area, where the families of both my
  parents had settled in the 1920s after immigrating from Italy. My
  father had been a ship builder in Naples but my mother was still
  a young child when she came from Sicily. They met for the first
  time in Brooklyn, New York in the 1930s, were married, and then
  moved to the nearby coastal city of Long Beach. I was born on May
  31, 1941 in Brooklyn and my brother, Angelo, followed on January
  10, 1944. My father worked as a carpenter, whereas my mother
  elected to bring up her two sons at home.<br>
  <br>
  Long Beach was a beautiful town, about 25 miles east of New York
  City located on the south shore of Long Island. We had a lovely
  home within walking distance of the beach along the Atlantic
  ocean. I can still recall walking to the beach and going for a
  swim nearly every day in the summer. My greatest joy each morning
  was building gigantic sand castles using dripping sand wetted by
  the incoming tide. All my friends believed and predicted that I
  would grow up to become an architect or engineer. This view was
  reinforced by my eagerness even as a young child to disassemble
  anything I could find and put it back together again. The joy of
  discovering that I could actually get the object to function
  again was quite rewarding and satisfying. But my greatest joy
  came when I was 8 years old. To my surprise and delight, mother
  and father finally responded favorably to my relentless request
  to have a chemistry set, and bought me one. I can recall vividly
  following every step of every experiment and becoming overjoyed
  at the success of each one. This was much more fun than building
  sand castles on the beach. My inquisitiveness drove me to the
  library to study more applied aspects of chemistry. Soon after
  completing dozens of additional experiments and going through
  several larger chemistry sets, I realized that what I really
  wanted to accomplish was to build a bomb and to send up a rocket.
  After about one year of experiments, I finally achieved those
  goals, albeit at the expense of numerous horrified reactions from
  the neighbors.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in chemistry remained strong at Central Grade School
  and Long Beach High School, which led me to apply to Columbia
  University in New York City to study chemistry and pharmacy.
  I was especially pleased when I learned that I had been accepted
  to the freshman class at Columbia. I wanted to attend a
  university that was within commuting distance of home because I
  did not want to leave my family and friends in Long Beach. During
  my high school years I had developed a great interest in playing
  ball and racing cars, and I did not want that to come to an end,
  at least not just yet. My favorite sport was one-on-one
  stickball, the New York City sport of sports, where a "bouncy"
  rubber ball is thrown by the opponent pitcher against a brick or
  cement wall on which is drawn a "strike zone". The batter uses a
  stick conveniently detached from a suitable broom or mop to hit
  the fast pitched ball. When I was not playing stickball I was
  building and racing cars at the West Hampton Drag Raceway. I
  guess I could never get away from taking things apart and putting
  them back together again. Indeed, I spent many long hours
  thinking about whether I should study chemistry or open up my own
  drag racing shop out on Long Island. Well, chemistry it was. I
  took dozens of chemistry courses, but a course in pharmacology,
  although poorly taught, really caught my attention. I studied the
  subject well beyond the course requirements and tried to hang
  around the pharmacology laboratories as often as I could. The
  result of this was my application to graduate school in
  pharmacology upon graduation from Columbia University in
  1962.<br>
  <br>
  I was delighted to be admitted to the pharmacology program at the
  University of
  Minnesota in Minneapolis, which was considered to be one of
  the best departments of pharmacology in the nation at that time.
  Actually, I had applied to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where the
  department was located when I first applied. But for one reason
  or another, the entire department was relocated from Madison to
  Minneapolis just after I had been accepted in Madison. A bit
  confused, I reported to Minneapolis in September of 1962 to study
  pharmacology. At first, things were difficult for me because I
  had left my family, friends, stickball, racing cars and the beach
  behind. And then things got even worse when I experienced my
  first winter season of -40&deg;F with winds of 30 mph. But I
  survived my first winter and went on to enjoy the upper midwest
  and the "Big Ten" college football games.<br>
  <br>
  My studies in graduate school involved developing a better
  understanding of why and how neurons of the sympathetic nervous
  system innervate the heart and produce and release
  norepinephrine. I spent three of the most intense years of my
  life in the laboratory, where I was determined to unravel every
  bit of information possible within the time frame allotted to me
  to satisfy the research requirements for the PhD degree in
  pharmacology. My research was different from most in that it
  required, in addition to pharmacology, a great deal of knowledge
  in several other distinct disciplines such as physiology,
  biochemistry and anatomy. My major, of course, was pharmacology
  and I selected cardiovascular physiology as my minor. But that
  was insufficient, so I took several additional courses in
  biochemistry and anatomy. The most demanding course I took was
  enzymology, taught by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1997/index.html">Paul Boyer</a>, who was
  awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year (1997). I have not
  stopped using enzymology in my research since taking that course.
  My research turned out to be acceptable to my committee, chaired
  by the late Frederick E. Shideman, MD, PhD, who was also Chairman
  of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Minnesota.
  He decided that I should write four separate manuscripts on my
  thesis research and that we should submit them to the Journal of
  Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. The editors of the
  journal accepted all four papers and published them back-to-back
  in one issue of the journal, a feat never again repeated either
  by the journal or by me.<br>
  <br>
  After Minneapolis, I accepted a postdoctoral position at the
  National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Chemical
  Pharmacology in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. My
  mentor was Elwood Titus, a brilliant scientist who was able to
  mix chemistry and pharmacology with the greatest of ease. I tried
  to learn as much as I could from him in two years. Perhaps I
  tried a bit too hard. For example, he asked me to study the
  chemistry of beta adrenergic receptors and I decided that I was
  going to isolate, characterize and elucidate the chemical
  structure not only of beta but also of alpha adrenergic
  receptors, all in two years. Having published four consecutive
  papers in a distinguished journal on my first try, I thought that
  my research career was going to be a breeze. The N.I.H. proved to
  me that this was not going to be the case, and it was not. My
  work resulted in only one publication, but the agony of
  frustration caused me to mature quickly. The atmosphere of the
  N.I.H. was highly conducive to learning science and I had the
  opportunity to discuss my work and research in general with
  Bernard Brodie, Jim Gillette, <a href="../1970/index.html">Julius
  Axelrod</a> and other distinguished scientists.<br>
  <br>
  My first real job after my research training was with the drug
  industry. Geigy Pharmaceuticals recruited me in 1968 with an
  attractive package including the responsibility of heading the
  biochemical and antiinflammatory program. Although this was an
  entirely new research topic for me, I accepted the position
  because of the enormous responsibility that would suddenly be
  mine. The work was quite satisfying in that I became a part of a
  larger group whose efforts led to the development and marketing
  of a new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (diclofenac). About
  half way through my career at Geigy, my daughter, Heather, was
  born. I recall that day vividly (January 10, 1970) because I had
  to rush my wife to the nearby hospital in the midst of a snow
  storm. But all turned out well and I found myself devoting a
  great deal of time to something other than my own research. With
  the birth of Heather came a move from a small apartment in
  Hartsdale to a much larger unit in Irvington on the Hudson. This
  was a lovely neighborhood in which to raise a child.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to my work on drug development, Geigy allowed me the
  freedom to pursue basic research in biochemical pharmacology,
  which led to my interest in studying the relatively new cyclic
  nucleotide, cyclic GMP. Although I enjoyed my work at Geigy
  Pharmaceuticals, when the company merged with Ciba
  Pharmaceuticals I decided to try my hand at academic research and
  teaching. In January of 1973, I accepted the position of
  Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University
  School of Medicine in New Orleans. I chose to go to Tulane
  because I wanted to continue my research on cyclic GMP, and there
  was a young pharmacologist at Tulane with the same interest. We
  moved to New Orleans, where we bought our first home in
  Terrytown, an attractive nearby suburb.<br>
  <br>
  My interest and motivation in studying the possible physiological
  significance of cyclic GMP grew and grew during my first two
  years at Tulane. Thanks to my own laboratory and those of other
  interested collaborators, we made many significant contributions
  to the field of cyclic GMP and cyclic nucleotide research in
  general. My early work with cyclic GMP involved leukocytes and
  the heart, but this eventually led to an interest in blood
  vessels. I recall reading an interesting paper by <a href=
  "index.html">Ferid Murad</a>'s group in 1977, in which nitric
  oxide and various nitro compounds were shown to activate the
  cytosolic form of guanylate cyclase and to elevate cyclic GMP
  levels in various tissues. Nitroglycerin was one of those nitro
  compounds that Ferid had studied and speculated might release
  nitric oxide which then activated guanylate cyclase. It occurred
  to me that nitric oxide might account for the vascular smooth
  muscle relaxing action of nitroglycerin and that cyclic GMP might
  be the second messenger responsible for mediating the
  vasorelaxant effect of nitric oxide. In 1979 we published the
  first account of the capacity of nitric oxide to relax vascular
  smooth muscle. We purchased a small cylinder of nitric oxide gas,
  made a dilution in nitrogen (nitric oxide is very unstable in the
  presence of oxygen), and injected a fine stream of gas bubbles
  into an organ bath in which was mounted a strip of bovine
  coronary artery precontracted by addition of phenylephrine. The
  result was a rapid and profound relaxation of the coronary artery
  strip. This vasorelaxant effect of nitric oxide was blocked by
  addition of hemoglobin, which promotes oxidation of nitric oxide,
  and methylene blue, which had been known to inhibit guanylate
  cyclase. And so we knew right away that nitric oxide was probably
  responsible for the vasorelaxant effect of nitroglycerin and that
  cyclic GMP was the likely ultimate mediator of relaxation, just
  as Ferid Murad had predicted.<br>
  <br>
  We wondered whether the platelet antiaggregatory action of
  certain nitrovasodilators could also be attributed to nitric
  oxide and cyclic GMP. A relatively straightforward experiment was
  conducted with human platelet-rich plasma, in which we examined
  the influence of added nitric oxide on ADP-induced platelet
  aggregation. The results were dramatic. Nitric oxide potently
  inhibited platelet aggregation and actually reversed aggregation
  once it had occurred. This effect was mediated by cyclic GMP.
  Thus, at least two biological actions of nitric oxide were clear
  from these early studies. Nitric oxide is a vasorelaxant and
  inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and both effects are mediated
  by cyclic GMP.<br>
  <br>
  The next step was to elucidate the mechanism by which
  nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide by vascular smooth
  muscle. After reading nearly every paper in the field of organic
  nitrate esters and their vasodilator effects, I was motivated by
  the work of Phil Needleman, who showed that the vasodilator
  action of nitroglycerin and other organic nitrate esters was
  dependent somehow on the presence of thiols. A long and tedious
  series of experiments in my laboratory led to the discovery that
  thiols were required for the activation of guanylate cyclase by
  nitroglycerin and related nitrovasodilators. Interaction between
  thiols and nitro compounds led to the formation of intermediate
  S-nitrosothiols, which were chemically unstable and decomposed to
  liberate nitric oxide gas. Depletion of tissue thiols resulted in
  diminished vasorelaxation by nitroglycerin because nitric oxide
  could no longer be generated. Moreover, tolerance to the
  vasodilator action of nitroglycerin appeared to be due to thiol
  depletion, which could be reversed by adding back thiols in order
  to generate more nitric oxide. This work was published in 1981 in
  the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.<br>
  <br>
  Having elucidated the mechanism of action of nitroglycerin as a
  vasodilator, the next step was to understand how nitric oxide
  activates guanylate cyclase. An elegant series of experiments was
  published in the late 1970s by Patricia Craven and Fred
  DeRubertis, showing that activation of guanylate cyclase by
  nitric oxide might require the presence of heme. This made sense
  to me because heme iron had long been known to have a high
  binding affinity for nitric oxide. Suppose guanylate cyclase had
  a heme prosthetic group that bound nitric oxide and somehow
  became activated to generate more cyclic GMP from GTP? In 1981 we
  set out to purify and characterize guanylate cyclase from bovine
  lung. A young biochemically trained postdoctoral fellow from
  Yale
  University, Mike Wolin, joined my laboratory to tackle this
  project. After an incredibly long and tedious series of
  experiments, each often lasting for 96 consecutive hours, we
  found the heme in purified guanylate cyclase. Subsequent
  experiments revealed that the presence of enzyme-bound heme was
  an absolute requirement for guanylate cyclase activation by
  nitric oxide. We went on to propose that nitric oxide reacts with
  heme iron to alter the configuration of the catalytic binding
  site for GTP and promote the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP and
  pyrophosphate. In conducting these experiments, we discovered
  that the non-nitric oxide containing substance, protoporphyrin
  IX, activated heme-deficient guanylate cyclase by kinetic
  mechanisms that were indistinguishable from the mechanism by
  which nitric oxide activates heme-containing guanylate
  cyclase.<br>
  <br>
  Although the above observations were exciting, they were also
  puzzling because it was unclear why mammalian cells were so
  sensitive to nitric oxide. Why do we have receptors for nitric
  oxide, an air pollutant and a metabolite of nitroglycerin? Was it
  possible that our own cells actually produced nitric oxide or
  nitroglycerin but we were unaware of it? In 1983, my laboratory
  set out to determine whether or not mammalian cells can produce
  either nitric oxide or a nitro compound that could be metabolized
  to nitric oxide. A separate project in the laboratory was to
  study endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and to attempt to
  identify the mysterious "EDRF" (endothelium derived relaxing
  factor) discovered three years earlier by <a href=
  "index.html">Robert Furchgott</a>. Both research projects came
  together in 1984 when we suddenly realized that EDRF and nitric
  oxide possessed similar pharmacological and biochemical
  properties. EDRF and nitric oxide were both chemically unstable
  and both activated guanylate cyclase and elevated tissue levels
  of cyclic GMP. The cyclic GMP elevating and vasorelaxant effects
  of both EDRF and nitric oxide were inhibited by addition of
  methylene blue to organ chambers. These findings, reported in
  1984, prompted me to ascertain whether EDRF, like nitric oxide,
  required bound heme on guanylate cyclase in order to activate the
  enzyme and stimulate cyclic GMP formation. I can recall vividly
  the positive results of the first experiment, and I knew we had
  it. EDRF must be nitric oxide. I first reported these findings in
  the summer of 1986 at a vascular conference held at the Mayo
  Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Unexpectedly, at least to me, my
  colleague Robert Furchgott presented his own evidence that EDRF
  might be nitric oxide. I presented additional evidence a few
  months later at the fall American Heart Association meeting in
  Dallas and at the spring FASEB meeting in Washington, DC in 1987.
  So now it was clear why nitric oxide is such a potent
  vasorelaxant. This small lipophilic chemical is produced by
  vascular endothelial cells and functions to decrease vascular
  smooth muscle tone and to inhibit platelet aggregation.<br>
  <br>
  The frenzy and excitement of these times in the mid-1980s was
  stalled at times by my divorce and my decision to leave Tulane
  University and begin a new personal life and academic career at
  UCLA School
  of Medicine. I moved to Los Angeles in May of 1985 and bought
  a small home in Encino, just 12 miles from the UCLA campus. My
  daughter, Heather, joined me in 1988 and attended California State
  University at Northridge. As a result of witnessing her dad's
  commitment to many long hours of research and teaching, Heather
  chose to major in radio, film and television. At first, her
  decision to shy away from a career in science concerned me, but
  then I realized how talented she was and how successful she would
  become.<br>
  <br>
  The discovery that EDRF was nitric oxide led to an avalanche of
  studies that created an exciting new field in biological
  research. New physiological and pathophysiological roles for
  nitric oxide were being discovered on a weekly basis. In record
  time, several prominent laboratories elucidated the biochemical
  mechanisms involved in the synthesis of nitric oxide by various
  cell types. While studying the relaxant effects of nitric oxide
  on vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle from corpus cavernosum
  erectile tissue, we realized that the naturally occurring
  physiological neurotransmitter involved in the erectile response
  in mammals was unknown. John Garthwaite had just reported that
  nitric oxide was a neuro transmitter in the brain, and we
  wondered whether or not nitric oxide could be the
  neurotransmitter in the so called nonadrenergic noncholinergic
  neurons that were known to innervate the corpus cavernosum smooth
  muscle. After all, nitric oxide released from such nerves would
  be expected to diffuse into the nearby vascular and nonvascular
  smooth muscle and cause relaxation. Such an effect could account
  for the marked relaxation of both vascular and nonvascular smooth
  muscle that accompanies the erectile response and allows for the
  engorgement of blood in the sinusoidal or trabecular network of
  blood vessels in the corpus cavernosum. The first carefully
  designed experiment was successful. Electrical stimulation of
  strips of rabbit corpus cavernosum caused a transient but marked
  smooth muscle relaxation that was prevented by addition of a
  nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and enhanced by addition of a
  cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Addition of authentic
  nitric oxide to organ chambers mimicked the effects of electrical
  stimulation. A subsequent experiment revealed that electrical
  stimulation results in the production of nitric oxide in the
  corpus cavernosum. Further studies using human tissue showed that
  patients with impotence suffer from an impaired nitric oxide
  cyclic GMP pathway in the erectile tissue, and this work laid the
  foundation for the development by others of a drug that proved to
  be effective for the treatment of impotency in humans. Sildenafil
  (Viagra<sup>R</sup>) promotes the erectile response by inhibiting
  a specific isoform of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase and allowing
  cyclic GMP to accumulate when guanylate cyclase is activated by
  nitric oxide released from the nerves innervating the erectile
  tissue.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1994, I met Sharon Elizabeth Williams, a lovely
  and charming medical student here at UCLA. Sharon had been a
  nurse anesthetist for several years and then decided to obtain an
  M.D. degree in order to practice anesthesiology at a more
  professional level. After graduating from UCLA, Sharon moved to
  the east coast to begin her internship and residency at Johns Hopkins
  University. Shortly after her move, we started dating by long
  distance and were married in July of 1997. A year later, in the
  spring of 1998, Sharon transferred back to UCLA to continue her
  residency in anesthesiology. Finally, we were together. During
  the week we reside in an apartment adjacent to the UCLA campus in
  Westwood and we spend our weekends in my home in Malibu.<br>
  <br>
  As a result of my work during the past decade, many investigators
  jumped in to extend our findings. This led to the development of
  close collaborations with numerous laboratories and the formation
  of close and genuine friendships in many different parts of the
  world. I treasure these friendships even more than the awards I
  have received for my research accomplishments. I also realize
  that these accomplishments would not have been possible without
  the interest, hard work, and commitment on the part of my
  technical assistants, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
  medical fellows, visiting scientists, research collaborators at
  home, and collaborators at other institutions.<br>
  <br>
  Another rewarding development has been my discovery that I also
  have a real knack for and love of teaching what I know to medical
  and graduate students. I have consequently made teaching a
  regular part of my schedule since I came to UCLA and I cherish
  the Golden Apple teaching awards I have won from my classes. I
  trust that I have helped guide at least some of these young
  people toward careers that will be a blessing to them and to
  humanity. In my own case, the combination of biomedical research
  and teaching continues to provide me with an exciting and useful
  life, and I am exceedingly grateful.</p>
