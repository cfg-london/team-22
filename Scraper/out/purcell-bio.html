  <h1>E. M. Purcell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="purcell.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Edward Mills Purcell</b> was born in
  Taylorville, Illinois, U.S.A., on August 30, 1912. His parents,
  Edward A. Purcell and Mary Elizabeth Mills, were both natives of
  Illinois. He was educated in the public schools in Taylorville
  and in Mattoon, Illinois, and in 1929 entered Purdue University in
  Indiana. He graduated from Purdue in electrical engineering in
  1933.<br>
  <br>
  His interest had already turned to physics, and through the
  kindness of Professor K. Lark-Horovitz he was enabled, while an
  undergraduate, to take part in experimental research in electron
  diffraction. As an Exchange Student of the Institute of
  International Education, he spent one year at the Technische
  Hochschule, Karlsruhe, Germany, where he studied under
  Professor W. Weizel. He returned to the United States in 1934 to
  enter Harvard
  University, where he received the Ph.D. degree in 1938. After
  serving two years as instructor in physics at Harvard, he joined
  the Radiation Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was
  organized in 1940 for military research and development of
  microwave radar. He became Head of the Fundamental Developments
  Group in the Radiation Laboratory, which was concerned with the
  exploration of new frequency bands and the development of new
  microwave techniques. This experience turned out to be very
  valuable. Perhaps equally influential in his subsequent
  scientific work was the association at this time with a number of
  physicists, among them <a href="../1944/index.html">I.I.
  Rabi</a>, with a continuing interest in the study of molecular
  and nuclear properties by radio methods.<br>
  <br>
  The discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance absorption was made
  just after the end of the War, and at about that time Purcell
  returned to Harvard as Associate Professor of Physics. He became
  Professor of Physics in 1949; his present title is Gerhard Gade
  University Professor. He has continued to work in the field of
  nuclear magnetism, with particular interest in relaxation
  phenomena, related problems of molecular structure, measurement
  of atomic constants, and nuclear magnetic behaviour at low
  temperatures. He has made some contribution to the subject of
  radioastronomy.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the National Academy of
  Sciences, of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the
  President's Science Advisory Committee under President Eisenhower
  from 1957-1960 and under President Kennedy as from 1960.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937, Purcell married Beth C. Busser. They have two sons,
  Dennis and Frank.</p>
