  <p><br>May I be permitted, I ask you, to speak in the 
              name of luminosity and transparency. The space I have lived in and 
              where I have been able to fulfill myself is defined by these two 
              states. States that I have also perceived as being identified in 
              me with the need to express myself.<br>
              <br>
              It is good, it is right that a contribution be made to art, from 
              that which is assigned to each individual by his personal experience 
              and the virtues of his language. Even more so, since the times are 
              dismal and we should have the widest possible view of things.<br>
              <br>
              I am not speaking of the common and natural capacity of perceiving 
              objects in all their detail, but of the power of the metaphor to 
              only retain their essence, and to bring them to such a state of 
              purity that their metaphysical significance appears like a revelation.<br>
              <br>
              I am thinking here of the manner in which the sculptors of the Cycladic 
              period used their material, to the point of carrying it beyond itself. 
              I am also thinking of the Byzantine icon painters, who succeeded, 
              only by using pure color, to suggest the "divine".<br>
              <br>
              It is just such an intervention in the real, both penetrating and 
              metamorphosing, which has always been, it seems to me, the lofty 
              vocation of poetry. Not limiting itself to what is, but stretching 
              itself to what can be. It is true that this step has not always 
              been received with respect. Perhaps the collective neuroses did 
              not permit it. Or perhaps because utilitarianism did not authorize 
              men to keep their eyes open as much as was necessary.<br>
              <br>
              Beauty, Light, it happens that people regard them as obsolete, as 
              insignificant. And yet! The inner step required by the approach 
              of the Angel's form is, in my opinion, infinitely more painful than 
              the other, which gives birth to Demons of all kinds.<br>
              <br>
              Certainly, there is an enigma. Certainly, there is a mystery. But 
              the mystery is not a stage piece turning to account the play of 
              light and shadow only to impress us.<br>
              <br>
              It is what continues to be a mystery, even in bright light. It is 
              only then that it acquires that refulgence that captivates and which 
              we call Beauty. Beauty that is an open path - the only one perhaps 
              - towards that unknown part of ourselves, towards that which surpasses 
              us. There, this could be yet another definition of poetry: the art 
              of approaching that which surpasses us.<br>
              <br>
              Innumerable secret signs, with which the universe is studded and 
              which constitute so many syllables of an unknown language, urge 
              us to compose words, and with words, phrases whose deciphering puts 
              us at the threshold of the deepest truth.<br>
              <br>
              In the final analysis, where is truth? In the erosion and death 
              we see around us, or in this propensity to believe that the world 
              is indestructible and eternal? I know, it is wise to avoid redundancies. 
              The cosmogonic theories that have succeeded each other through the 
              years have not missed using and abusing them. They have clashed 
              among themselves, they have had their moment of glory, then they 
              have been erased.<br>
              <br>
              But the essential has remained. It remains.<br>
              <br>
              The poetry that raises itself when rationalism has laid down its 
              arms, takes its relieving troops to advance into the forbidden zone, 
              thus proving that it is still the less consumed by erosion. It assures, 
              in the purity of its form, the safeguard of those given facts through 
              which life becomes a viable task. Without it and its vigilance, 
              these given facts would be lost in the obscurity of consciousness, 
              just as algae become indistinct in the ocean depths.<br>
              <br>
              That is why we have a great need of transparency. To clearly perceive 
              the knots of this thread running throughout the centuries and aiding 
              us to remain upright on this earth.<br>
              <br>
              These knots, these ties, we see them distinctly, from Heraclitus 
              to Plato and from Plato to Jesus. Having reached us in various forms 
              they tell us the same thing: that it is in the inside of this world 
              that the other world is contained, that it is with the elements 
              of this world that the other world is recombined, the hereafter, 
              that second reality situated above the one where we live unnaturally. 
              It is a question of a reality to which we have a total right, and 
              only our incapacity makes us unworthy of it.<br>
              <br>
              It is not a coincidence that in healthy times, Beauty is identified 
              with Good, and Good with the Sun. To the extent that consciousness 
              purifies itself and is filled with light, its dark portions retract 
              and disappear, leaving empty spaces - just as in the laws of physics 
              - are filled by the elements of the opposite import. Thus what results 
              of this rests on the two aspects, I mean the "here" and the "hereafter". 
              Did not Heraclitus speak of a harmony of opposed tensions?<br>
              <br>
              It is of no importance whether it is Apollo or Venus, Christ or 
              the Virgin who incarnate and personalize the need we have to see 
              materialized what we experience as an intuition. What is important 
              is the breath of immortality that penetrates us at that moment. 
              In my humble opinion, Poetry should, beyond all doctrinal argumentation, 
              permit this breath.<br>
              <br>
              Here I must refer to H&ouml;lderlin, that great poet who looked 
              at the gods of Olympus and Christ in the same manner. The stability 
              he gave a kind of vision continues to be inestimable. And the extent 
              of what he has revealed for us is immense. I would even say it is 
              terrifying. It is what incites us to cry out - at a time when the 
              pain now submerging us was just beginning - : "What good are poets 
              in a time of poverty". Wozu Dichter in d&uuml;rftiger Zeit?<br>
              <br>
              For mankind, times were always d&uuml;rftig, unfortunately. But 
              poetry has never, on the other hand, missed its vocation. These 
              are two facts that will never cease to accompany our earthly destiny, 
              the first serving as the counter-weight to the other. How could 
              it be otherwise? It is through the Sun that the night and the stars 
              are perceptible to us. Yet let us note, with the ancient sage, that 
              if it passes its bounds the Sun becomes &quot;<img src="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1979/grekisk2.gif" alt="Text in Greek" width="36" height="13">&quot;. 
              For life to be possible, we have to keep a correct distance to the 
              allegorical Sun, just as our planet does from the natural Sun. We 
              formerly erred through ignorance. We go wrong today through the 
              extent of our knowledge. In saying this I do not wish to join the 
              long list of censors of our technological civilization. Wisdom as 
              old as the country from which I come has taught me to accept evolution, 
              to digest progress "with its bark and its pits".<br>
              <br>
              But then, what becomes of Poetry? What does it represent in such 
              a society? This is what I reply: poetry is the only place where 
              the power of numbers proves to be nothing. Your decision this year 
              to honor, in my person, the poetry of a small country, reveals the 
              relationship of harmony linking it to the concept of gratuitous 
              art, the only concept that opposes nowadays the all-powerful position 
              acquired by the quantitative esteem of values.<br>
              <br>
              Referring to personal circumstances would be a breach of good manners. 
              Praising my home, still more unsuitable. Nevertheless it is sometimes 
              indispensable, to the extent that such interferences assist in seeing 
              a certain state of things more clearly. This is the case today.<br>
              <br>
              Dear friends, it has been granted to me to write in a language that 
              is spoken only by a few million people. But a language spoken without 
              interruption, with very few differences, throughout more than two 
              thousand five hundred years. This apparently surprising spatial-temporal 
              distance is found in the cultural dimensions of my country. Its 
              spatial area is one of the smallest; but its temporal extension 
              is infinite. If I remind you of this, it is certainly not to derive 
              some kind of pride from it, but to show the difficulties a poet 
              faces when he must make use, to name the things dearest to him, 
              of the same words as did Sappho, for example, or Pindar, while being 
              deprived of the audience they had and which then extended to all 
              of human civilization.<br>
              <br>
              If language were not such a simple means of communication there 
              would not be any problem. But it happens, at times, that it is also 
              an instrument of "magic". In addition, in the course of centuries, 
              language acquires a certain way of being. It becomes a lofty speech. 
              And this way of being entails obligations.<br>
              <br>
              Let us not forget either that in each of these twenty-five centuries 
              and without any interruption, poetry has been written in Greek. 
              It is this collection of given facts which makes the great weight 
              of tradition that this instrument lifts. Modern Greek poetry gives 
              an expressive image of this.<br>
              <br>
              The sphere formed by this poetry shows, one could say, two poles: 
              at one of these poles is Dionysios Solomos, who, before Mallarm&eacute; 
              appeared in European literature, managed to formulate, with the 
              greatest rigor and coherency, the concept of pure poetry: to submit 
              sentiment to intelligence, ennoble expression, mobilize all the 
              possibilities of the linguistic instrument by orienting oneself 
              to the miracle. At the other pole is Cavafy, who like <a href="../1948/index.html">T. 
              S. Eliot</a> reaches, by eliminating all form of turgidity, the 
              extreme limit of concision and the most rigorously exact expression.<br>
              <br>
              Between these two poles, and more or less close to one or the other, 
              our other great poets move: Kostis Palamas, Angelos Sikelianos, 
              Nikos Kazantzakis, <a href=
  "../1963/index.html">George Seferis</a>.<br>
              <br>
              Such is, rapidly and schematically drawn, the picture of neo-Hellenic 
              poetic discourse.<br>
              <br>
              We who have followed have had to take over the lofty precept which 
              has been bequeathed to us and adapt it to contemporary sensibility. 
              Beyond the limits of technique, we have had to reach a synthesis, 
              which, on the one hand, assimilated the elements of Greek tradition 
              and, on the other, the social and psychological requirements of 
              our time.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, we had to grasp today's European-Greek in all its 
              truth and turn that truth to account. I do not speak of successes, 
              I speak of intentions, efforts. Orientations have their significance 
              in the investigation of literary history.<br>
              <br>
              But how can creation develop freely in these directions when the 
              conditions of life, in our time, annihilate the creator? And how 
              can a cultural community be created when the diversity of languages 
              raises an unsurpassable obstacle? We know you and you know us through 
              the 20 or 30 per cent that remains of a work after translation. 
              This holds even more true for all those of us who, prolonging the 
              furrow traced by Solomos, expect a miracle from discourse and that 
              a spark flies from between two words with the right sound and in 
              the right position.<br>
              <br>
              No. We remain mute, incommunicable.<br>
              <br>
              We are suffering from the absence of a common language. And the 
              consequences of this absence can be seen - I do not believe I am 
              exaggerating - even in the political and social reality of our common 
              homeland, Europe.<br>
              <br>
              We say - and make the observation each day - that we live in a moral 
              chaos. And this at a moment when - as never before - the allocation 
              of that which concerns our material existence is done in the most 
              systematic manner, in an almost military order, with implacable 
              controls. This contradiction is significant. Of two parts of the 
              body, when one is hypertrophic, the other atrophies. A praise-worthy 
              tendency, encouraging the peoples of Europe to unite, is confronted 
              today with the impossibility of harmonization of the atrophied and 
              hypertrophic parts of our civilization. Our values do not constitute 
              a common language.<br>
              <br>
              For the poet - this may appear paradoxical but it is true - the 
              only common language he still can use is his sensations. The manner 
              in which two bodies are attracted to each other and unite has not 
              changed for millennia. In addition, it has not given rise to any 
              conflict, contrary to the scores of ideologies that have bloodied 
              our societies and have left us with empty hands.<br>
              <br>
              When I speak of sensations, I do not mean those, immediately perceptible, 
              on the first or second level. I mean those which carry us to the 
              extreme edge of ourselves. I also mean the "analogies of sensations" 
              that are formed in our spirits.<br>
              <br>
              For all art speaks through analogy. A line, straight or curved, 
              a sound, sharp or low-pitched, translate a certain optical or acoustic 
              contact. We all write good or bad poems to the extent that we live 
              or reason according to the good or bad meaning of the term. An image 
              of the sea, as we find it in Homer, comes to us intact. Rimbaud 
              will say "a sea mixed with sun". Except he will add: "that is eternity." 
              A young girl holding a myrtle branch in Archilochus survives in 
              a painting by Matisse. And thus the Mediterranean idea of purity 
              is made more tangible to us. In any case, is the image of a virgin 
              in Byzantine iconography so different from that of her secular sisters? 
              Very little is needed for the light of this world to be transformed 
              into supernatural clarity, and inversely. One sensation inherited 
              from the Ancients and another bequeathed by the Middle Ages give 
              birth to a third, one that resembles them both, as a child does 
              its parents. Can poetry survive such a path? Can sensations, at 
              the end of this incessant purification process, reach a state of 
              sanctity? They will return then, as analogies, to graft themselves 
              on the material world and to act on it.<br>
              <br>
              It is not enough to put our dreams into verse. It is too little. 
              It is not enough to politicize our speech. It is too much. The material 
              world is really only an accumulation of materials. It is for us 
              to show ourselves to be good or bad architects, to build Paradise 
              or Hell. This is what poetry never ceases affirming to us - and 
              particularly in these d&uuml;rftiger times - just this: that in 
              spite of everything our destiny lies in our hands.<br>
              <br>
              I have often tried to speak of solar metaphysics. I will not try 
              today to analyse how art is implicated in such a conception. I will 
              keep to one single and simple fact: the language of the Greeks, 
              like a magic instrument, has - as a reality or a symbol - intimate 
              relations with the Sun. And that Sun does not only inspire a certain 
              attitude of life, and hence the primeval sense to the poem. It penetrates 
              the composition, the structure, and - to use a current terminology 
              - the nucleus from which is composed the cell we call the poem.<br>
              <br>
              It would be a mistake to believe that it is a question of a return 
              to the notion of pure form. The sense of form, as the West has bequeathed 
              it to us, is a constant attainment, represented by three or four 
              models. Three or four moulds, one could say, where it was suitable 
              to pour the most anomalous material at any price. Today that is 
              no longer conceivable. I was one of the first in Greece to break 
              those ties.<br>
              <br>
              What interested me, obscurely at the beginning, then more and more 
              consciously, was the edification of that material according to an 
              architectural model that varied each time. To understand this there 
              is no need to refer to the wisdom of the Ancients who conceived 
              the Parthenons. It is enough to evoke the humble builders of our 
              houses and of our chapels in the Cyclades, finding on each occasion 
              the best solution. Their solutions. Practical and beautiful at the 
              same time, so that in seeing them Le Corbusier could only admire 
              and bow.<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps it is this instinct that woke in me when, for the first 
              time, I had to face a great composition like "Axion Esti." I understood 
              then that without giving the work the proportions and perspective 
              of an edifice, it would never reach the solidity I wished.<br>
              <br>
              I followed the example of Pindar or of the Byzantine Romanos Melodos 
              who, in each of their odes or canticles, invented a new mode for 
              each occasion. I saw that the determined repetition, at intervals, 
              of certain elements of versification effectively gave to my work 
              that multifaceted and symmetrical substance which was my plan.<br>
              <br>
              But then is it not true that the poem, thus surrounded by elements 
              that gravitate around it, is transformed into a little Sun? This 
              perfect correspondence, which I thus find obtained with the intended 
              contents, is, I believe, the poet's most lofty ideal.<br>
              <br>
              To hold the Sun in one's hands without being burned, to transmit 
              it like a torch to those following, is a painful act but, I believe, 
              a blessed one. We have need of it. One day the dogmas that hold 
              men in chains will be dissolved before a consciousness so inundated 
              with light that it will be one with the Sun, and it will arrive 
              on those ideal shores of human dignity and liberty.</p>
