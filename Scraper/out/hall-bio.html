  <h1>John L. Hall - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="hall.jpg" class="bio-img">John Lewis Hall (known by many as Jan) was born on August 21,
 1934 in Denver, Colorado. His father (John Ernest Hall) was trained
 as an electrical engineer and worked for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
 on many hydroelectric projects here and overseas. His mother, Rae
 (Long) Hall was an elementary school teacher and singer. Jan's
 interests in electricity and radio were supported by parental interest,
 but his research on black-powder rockets was gradually replaced
 by social activities such as scouts and a church youth group. After
 completing public schooling in Denver, he received a Westinghouse
 Scholarship to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon
 University ) and earned a B.S. (1956), M.S. (1958) and Ph.D. (1961)
 in Physics from the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He did his
 thesis work with Professor Robert T. Schumacher using a self-made
 electron microwave spin resonance spectrometer to study the hyperfine
 spectrum of interstitial hydrogen atoms in CaF<sub>2</sub> crystals. While
 considering various postgraduate opportunities, he chanced on a
 call for applications to be a National Research Council Fellow
 at the (then) National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C.
 Toward the end of that postdoc year, he was invited to join others
 from NBS to start a new research group at the University of Colorado
 Boulder campus. Since 1962, he has been responsible for a number
 of major innovations and developments in laser technology at JILA
 (formerly called the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics),
 operated by the University of Colorado and the National Institute
 of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
         
         
 <p>He has authored more than 230 articles in refereed journals,
 and holds ten U.S. patents. He is a member of the National Academy
 of Sciences, and is a Fellow of the Optical Society of America
 and the American Physical Society. He is also a Senior Fellow Emeritus
 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and a Fellow
 Adjoint of JILA. He has trained numerous graduate students and
 post docs in the Physics Department at the University of Colorado
, Boulder. He retired from NIST in November, 2004, but is still
 active in JILA and his consulting company (Hall Stable Lasers,
 LLC). His electronics hobbies and electro-optical systems design
 provide satisfying outlets for him, often leading to specialized
 instruments and other technical innovations, and occasional patents.</p>
         
 <p>His JILA work has been recognized through a number of awards
 from NIST, the Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Office of
 Personnel Management. He has been awarded many professional, peer-generated
 honors by the Optical Society and the American Physical Society.
 In 2004, he received the IEEE Rabi Award and became a member of
 the French L&eacute;gion d'Honneur. In 2005, he shared the
 Nobel Prize in Physics with T.W. H&auml;nsch and Roy Glauber for &quot;contributions
 to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including
 the optical frequency comb technique.&quot;</p>
         
 <p>Also a graduate of Carnegie Mellon, his wife, Lindy, (the former
 Marilyn Robinson) holds a Bachelor's degree from the Margaret
 Morrison Carnegie College (1957), and a Master's degree from
 Carnegie Library School (1959). She taught 7th grade English in
 a Boulder junior high for 17 years, followed by 5 years as media
 specialist there. She remains active as a consultant in curriculum
 development. They have three children, two in Colorado: Carey,
 who teaches in a middle school of the Jefferson County School District,
 and Jon, who specializes in automotive computer and engine troubleshooting.
 Thomas is a field engineer for a computer company near Boston.
 With his wife Margaret, and their two daughters (aged six and eight)
 and son (now two and a half), they often accept visiting grandparents
 at their home in Quincy, MA. A favorite gathering place for all
 is their mountain cabin at Marble, Colorado, in the mountains
 west of Aspen, which was built by the family during the 1980's.
 Jan is very proud of having done the electrical wiring and plumbing
 entirely by himself, and receiving no red flags or violation notices
 from the State inspectors.</p>
         
 <p>&quot;I am truly fortunate to have somehow always been in the
 right place at the right time, to capitalize on technical advances
 that made increasingly precise laser measurements and applications
 possible. I have worked with amazing colleagues and students, whose
 enthusiasm and vision made for excellent physics, great fun and
 the building of important programs. It was a great 45 years and
 I have really loved it. But nowadays Lindy and I often discuss
 my in-process transition on to personal plans and activities, leaving
 the next dazzling science to my younger friends.&quot;</p>
