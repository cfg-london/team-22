  <h1>Val Fitch - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fitch.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born the youngest of three
  children, on a cattle ranch in Cherry County, Nebraska, not far
  from the South Dakota border, on March 10, 1923. This is a very
  sparsely populated part of the United States and remote from any
  center of population. It seems incredible by modern standards
  that by the age of 20 my father, Fred Fitch, had acquired a ranch
  of more than 4 square miles and had persuaded a local school
  teacher, Frances Logsdon, to marry and join him in living there.
  They moved to the ranch just 20 years after the battle of Wounded
  Knee, which occurred about 40 miles northwest. I mention this
  because our living close to their reservation made the Sioux
  Indians very much a part of our environment. My father, while not
  fluent, spoke their language. They recognized his friendly
  interest on their behalf by making him an honorary chief.<br>
  <br>
  Not long after my birth my father was badly injured when a horse
  he was riding fell with him. He subsequently had to give up the
  physically strenuous activity associated with running a ranch and
  raising cattle. The family moved to Gordon, Nebraska, a town
  about 25 miles away, where my father entered the insurance
  business. All of my formal schooling through high school was in
  the public schools of Gordon. During this period my parents
  retained ownership of the ranch but the operation was largely
  left to others. E.B. White has defined farming as 10% agriculture
  and 90% fixing something that has gotten broken. My memories of
  ranching are primarily not the romantic ones of rounding up and
  branding cattle but rather of oiling windmills and fixing
  fences.<br>
  <br>
  Probably the most significant occurrence in my education came
  when, as a soldier in the U.S. Army in WWII, I was sent to Los
  Alamos, New Mexico, to work on the Manhattan Project. The work I did there
     under the direction of Ernest Titterton, a member of the
     British Mission, was highly stimulating. The laboratory was
     small and even as a technician garbed in a military fatigue
     uniform I had the opportunity to meet and see at work many of
     the great figures in physics: <a href=
     "../1938/index.html">Fermi</a>, <a href=
     "../1975/index.html">Bohr</a>, <a href=
     "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/index.html">Chadwick</a>, <a href=
     "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1944/index.html">Rabi</a>, Tolman. I have
     recorded some of the experiences from those days in a chapter
     in <i>All in Our Time</i>, a book edited by Jane Wilson and
     published by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. I spent 3
     years at Los Alamos and in that period learned well the
     techniques of experimental physics. I observed that the most
     accomplished experimentalists were also the ones who knew most
     about electronics and electronic techniques were the first I
     learned. But mainly I learned, in approaching the measurement
     of new phenomena, not just to consider using existing
     apparatus but to allow the mind to wander freely and invent
     new ways of doing the job.<br>
  <br>
  Robert Bacher, the leader of the physics division in which I
  worked, offered me a graduate assistantship at Cornell after the
  war but I still had to finish the work for an undergraduate
  degree. This I did at McGill University. And then another opportunity for
  graduate work came from Columbia and I ended up there working
  with <a href="../1975/index.html">Jim Rainwater</a> for my Ph.D.
  thesis. One day in his of fice, which he shared at the time with
  Aage Bohr, he handed me a preprint of a paper by John Wheeler
  devoted to &micro;-mesic atoms. This paper emphasized, in the case
  of the heavier nuclei, the extreme sensitivity of the Is level to
  the size of the nucleus. Even though the radiation from these
  atoms had never been observed, these atomic systems might be a
  good thesis topic. At this same time a convergence of technical
  developments took place. The Columbia Nevis cyclotron was just
  coming into operation. The beams of (pi)-measons from the
  cyclotron contained an admixture of &micro;-measons which came
  frome the decay of the (pi)'s and which could be separated by
  range. Sodium iodide with thallium activation had just been shown
  by <a href="../1961/index.html">Hofstadter</a> to be an excellent
  scintillation counter and energy spectrometer for gamma rays. And
  there were new phototubes just being produced by RCA which were
  suitable matches to sodium iodide crystals to convert the
  scintillations to electrical signals. The other essential
  ingredient to make a gamma-ray spectrometer was a multichannel
  pulse height analyzer which, utilizing my Los Alamos experience,
  I designed and built with the aid of a technician. The net result
  of all the effort for my thesis was the pioneering work on
  &micro;-mesic atoms. It is of interest to note that we came very
  close to missing the observation of the gamma-rays completely.
  Wheeler had calculated the 2p-1s transition energy in Pb, using
  the then accepted nuclear radius 1.4 A<sup>1/3</sup> fermi, to be
  around 4.5 MeV. Correspondingly, we had set our spectrometer to
  look in that energy region. After several frustrating days,
  Rainwater suggested we broaden the range and then the peak
  appeared - not at 4.5 MeV but at 6 MeV! The nucleus was
  substantially smaller than had been deduced from other effects.
  Shortly afterwards Hofstadter got the same results from his
  electron scattering experiments. While the &micro;-mesic atom
  measurements give the rms radius of the nucleus with extreme
  accuracy the electron scattering results have the advantage of
  yielding many moments to the charge distribution. Now the best
  information is obtained by combining the results from both
  &micro;-mesic atoms and electron scattering.<br>
  <br>
  Subsequently, in making precise gamma-ray measurements to obtain
  a better mass value for the &micro;-meson, we found that
  substantial corrections for the vacuum polarization were required
  to get agreement with independent mass determinations. While the
  vacuum polarization is about 2% of the Lamb shift in hydrogen it
  is the very dominant electrodynamic correction in &micro;-mesic
  atoms.<br>
  <br>
  My interest then shifted to the strange particles and K mesons
  but I had learned from my work at Columbia the
  delights of unexpected results and the challenge they present in
  understanding nature. I took a position at Princeton where, most
  often working with a few graduate students, I spent the next 20
  years studying K-mesons. The ultimate in unexpected results was
  that which was recognized by the Nobel Foundation in 1980, the
  discovery of CP-violation.<br>
  <br>
  At any one time there is a natural tendency among physicists to
  believe that we already know the essential ingredients of a
  comprehensive theory. But each time a new frontier of observation
  is broached we inevitably discover new phenomena which force us
  to modify substantially our previous conceptions. I believe this
  process to be unending, that the delights and challenges of
  unexpected discovery will continue always.<br>
  <br>
  It is highly improbable, a priori, to begin life on a cattle
  ranch and then appear in Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize in
  physics. But it is much less improbable to me when I reflect on
  the good fortune I have had in the ambiance provided by my
  parents, my family, my teachers, colleagues and students. I have
  two sons from my marriage to Elise Cunningham who died in 1972.
  In 1976 I married Daisy Harper who brought with her three
  stepchildren into my life.</p>
