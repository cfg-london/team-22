  <h1>Otto Hahn - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hahn.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Otto Hahn</b> was born on 8th March,
  1879, at Frankfurt-on-Main. He attended the secondary high school
  there until he matriculated.<br>
  <br>
  From 1897 Hahn studied chemistry at Marburg and
  Munich, taking his doctorate examination in 1901 at
  Marburg and submitting to Professor Theodor Zincke a thesis on
  organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  He obtained a post as assistant in the Chemical Institute at
  Marburg, staying there two years, after which he worked under
  <a href="../1904/index.html">Sir William Ramsay</a> at University College,
  London, from the autumn of 1904 to the following summer. His
  work here was rewarded by the discovery of a new radioactive
  substance, radiothorium, while working on the preparation of pure
  radium salts.<br>
  <br>
  From the autumn of 1905 to the summer of the following year Hahn
  was at the Physical Institute of McGill University, Montreal (Canada) working
  under Professor <a href="../1908/index.html">Ernest
  Rutherford.</a> Here he discovered radioactinium and conducted
  investigations with Rutherford on alpha-rays of radiothorium and
  radioactinium.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to Europe Hahn moved to Berlin, to the Chemical
  Institute (<a href="../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a>) of the
  University and there he qualified as a university lecturer in the
  spring of 1907, which year also saw his discovery of
  mesothorium.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of 1907, Dr. Lise Meitner came to Berlin from Vienna
  and then began more than thirty years' collaboration. Their joint
  work embraced: investigations on beta-rays, their absorbability,
  magnetic spectra, etc.; use of the radioactive recoil, discovered
  shortly before by Hahn, to obtain new radioactive transformation
  products.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1914 and 1918 Hahn's work was interrupted by his service
  in the First World War, but he resumed his research with
  Professor Meitner in 1918, and discovered protactinium, the
  long-lived mother substance of the actinium series. Hahn's own
  particular sphere was chemistry and he further discovered uranium
  Z, the first case of a nuclear isomerism of radioactive kinds of
  atoms. Using radioactive methods he investigated the absorption
  and precipitation of the smallest quantities of substances,
  normal and abnormal formation of crystals, etc. Hahn used the
  emanation method to test substances superficially rich or poor,
  and he elaborated the strontium method to determine the age of
  geological periods.<br>
  <br>
  Following the discovery of artificial radioactivity by <a href=
  "../1935/index.html">M and Mme. Joliot-Curie</a> and the use of
  neutrons by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Fermi</a> for atomic nuclear
  processes, Hahn again collaborated with Professor Meitner and
  afterwards with Dr. Strassmann on the processes of irradiating
  uranium and thorium with neutrons.<br>
  <br>
  Hahn and Prof. Meitner had also worked together on the discovery
  of an artificially active uranium isotope, which represents the
  basic substance of the elements neptunium and plutonium, first
  revealed later in America.<br>
  <br>
  Hahn's work has won recognition in many learned circles. In 1912
  he became scientific member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
  Chemistry and has been Director of this Institute since 1928.
  1933 saw his appointment as Visiting Professor at Cornell University,
  Ithaca, New York. From 1st April, 1946, he has officiated as
  President of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and from 28th February,
  1948, has served as President of the Max Planck Society in
  Western Germany, being created Honorary President of the same
  Society in May, 1960.<br>
  <br>
  His most spectacular discovery came at the end of 1938. While
  working jointly with Dr. Strassmann, Hahn discovered the fission
  of uranium and thorium in medium heavy atomic nuclei and his
  first work on these subjects appeared on 6th January and 10th
  February, 1939, in <i>Naturwissenschaften</i>. Since that time
  and until 1944 Hahn continued investigation on the proof and
  separation of many elements and kinds of atoms which arise
  through fission.<br>
  <br>
  Hahn has been granted membership of the Academies of Berlin,
  G&ouml;ttingen, Munich, Halle, Stockholm, Vienna, Boston, Madrid,
  Helsinki, Lisbon, Mainz, Rome (Vatican), Allahabad, Copenhagen,
  and the Indian Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  In 1913 Hahn married Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Junghans and they had
  one son, Hanno, born in 1922, killed by accident in 1960.</p>
