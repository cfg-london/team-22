  <h1>Arthur Henderson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="henderson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Arthur Henderson</b> (September 13, 1863-October 20,
  1935) was born in Glasgow, the son of David Henderson, a manual
  worker. When his father died in 1872, leaving the family in
  poverty, Arthur left school to work in a photographer's shop.
  Upon his mother's remarriage the family moved to
  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where Arthur returned to school for three
  years. Aged twelve, he became an apprentice at the Robert
  Stephenson and Sons' General Foundry Works. The dinner hour in
  the foundry, with its lively discussions, became his classroom
  and the newspapers his textbooks. Having joined the Ironfounders'
  Union at the age of eighteen when he achieved journeyman status,
  he was elected within a short time secretary of the Newcastle
  lodge and for the remainder of his life held office continuously
  in his union at the local, district, or national level.<br>
  <br>
  In the course of his work in the Methodist church, which he had
  joined as a young man, Henderson met Eleanor Watson and married
  her in 1888. They had a daughter and three sons. The eldest of
  the three sons, all of whom served in the armed forces in World
  War I, was killed in action; the other two became the father's
  colleagues in the House of Commons in the last decade or so of
  his life.<br>
  <br>
  The skill in speaking that he developed at the meetings of the
  Tyneside Debating Society and in his work as a lay preacher,
  helped to launch him on a political career begun with his
  election to the post of town councillor in 1892. In the same year
  he was chosen by his union to be their district delegate, a
  full-time salaried position. In 1896 he moved his family to
  Darlington; there, he was elected to the Durham County Council
  and in 1903 became the first Labor mayor of Darlington.<br>
  <br>
  From 1900 to the close of his life Henderson put his talent for
  organizing at the disposal of Labor. He attended the London
  conference which set up the Labor Representation Committee in
  1900, won election to Parliament in 1903 under the sponsorship of
  that committee, chaired the conference in 1906 which formed the
  Labor Party, acted as its secretary from 1911 to 1934, served
  several times as the chairman of the party's executive committee,
  in 1918 took the lead in revising the party's constitution so as
  to open its membership to those who by conviction, not
  necessarily vocation, wanted to join the party, and created a
  political machinery which made the party a power in the political
  life of the nation.<br>
  <br>
  Henderson himself was almost continuously in Parliament after
  1903, yet his electoral career was scarcely a smooth one, for in
  ten tries at the polls in general elections he lost five and won
  five but regained a seat after each of the losses by winning
  by-elections. Henderson was chairman of the parliamentary Labor
  Party, chief whip three times, president of the Board of
  Education (1915-1916) and paymaster-general (1916) in Asquith's
  government, and in Lloyd George's government a minister without
  portfolio, acting primarily as an adviser on labor
  questions.<br>
  <br>
  As World War I drew to a close, Henderson's thinking took on an
  international dimension. In 1917 he went to Russia as an official
  observer for the British government; in 1918 he broke with Lloyd
  George over his refusal to send delegates to a proposed
  international conference of socialists, a conference which, as it
  turned out, was never convened. In the same year he initiated the
  call for a conference at Bern, with delegates from the defeated
  and neutral nations joining those of the victorious, to formulate
  recommendations to send to Versailles where the representatives
  of the Allies were assembling to draw up the terms of the peace.
  In 1923 he was chairman of the Labor and Socialist International
  at Hamburg. In 1924 he was home secretary in MacDonald's cabinet,
  but spent most of his energy on two international problems: the
  implementation of the Dawes Plan for German reparations and the
  drafting of the Geneva Protocol on the ultimate settlement of
  international disputes by arbitration.<br>
  <br>
  With this background, he was, therefore, quite prepared to accept
  the office of foreign secretary when MacDonald offered it to him
  in 1929 upon forming his second government. In his two years in
  office he brought about Britain's resumption of diplomatic
  relations with Russia, severed since 1917, maneuvered acceptance
  of the Young Plan for German reparations by the creditor nations
  and Germany, arranged with <a href=
  "../1926/index.html">Briand</a> for the evacuation of French
  troops from the Rhineland prior to the date stipulated in the
  Versailles Treaty, furthered the cause of Egyptian independence,
  actually achieved in 1936, and attended the entire sessions of
  the Tenth and Eleventh Assemblies of the League of Nations.<br>
  <br>
  Henderson became the embodiment of the League's disarmament
  effort. In January, 1931, he prodded the Council into completing
  preparations for the calling of a Disarmament Conference; in May
  of that year, he was unanimously approved as president of the
  conference; on February 2, 1932, he presided over the opening
  session. Despite his determined and persistent work, the
  conference failed. The world was stricken with an economic
  depression; Germany, under Hitler, withdrew from the conference
  in October, 1933; Henderson was barely able to hold the
  conference together in 1934, but even as late as December of that
  year at the Nobel ceremonies in Oslo, he optimistically insisted
  that the conference was still very much alive. The failure of the
  conference foreshadowed World War II, but his biographer, Mary A.
  Hamilton, states<sup><a href="#not_1">1</a></sup>, &laquo;If any
  man is clear of responsibility, it is Arthur
  Henderson.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  Henderson was a strong man. His powerful physical presence was
  the outer counterpart of his inner moral integrity. He had the
  qualities, Clement Attlee remarked in his eulogy on Henderson in
  the House of Commons<sup><a href="#not_2">2</a></sup>, needed
  &laquo;in a working ironworker to rise to preside over the
  Assembly of the nations&raquo;.</p>
