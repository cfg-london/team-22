              Must Earn a Living</b><br>
             
              About 1900 my parents came to the United States as children from 
              what was then the Polish area of Russia. As Jews, their families 
              left Russia to escape the poverty and the antisemitism. My parents 
              grew up in poor areas of New York City, my father Oscar Perl in 
              the East Side district of Manhattan and my mother Fay Rosenthal 
              in the Brownsville district of Brooklyn. Their educations ended 
              with high school - my father going to work as a clerk and then salesman 
              in a company dealing in printing and stationary, and my mother working 
              as a secretary and then bookkeeper in a firm of wool merchants.<br>
              <br>
              My parents were determined to move into the middle class. By the 
              time my sister, Lila Perl, and I were born in the 1920's, my father 
              had established a printing and advertising company called Allied 
              Printing. For many years, Allied Printing was a precarious business. 
              I remember conversations at the dinner table about the problem of 
              meeting the upcoming Friday payroll. However, Allied Printing brought 
              the four of us into the middle class and kept us in the middle class 
              thru the Depression of the 1930's. We lived in the better neighborhoods 
              of the borough of Brooklyn, not the fanciest neighborhoods, but 
              quite good neighborhoods, and so we went to quite good schools.<br>
              <br>
              These schools and the attitude of my parents towards these schools 
              were important in preparing me for the work of an experimental scientist. 
              Going to school and working for good marks, indeed working for very 
              good marks, was a serious business. My parents regarded school teachers 
              as higher beings, as did many immigrants. School principals were 
              gods to be worshiped but never seen by children or parents. Parents 
              never visited the school to talk about the curriculum or to meet 
              with their child's teacher. A parent being called to the school 
              because their child had misbehaved was as serious as a parent being 
              called to the police station because their child had robbed a bank. 
              The remoteness of my parents from the schools, so unfashionable 
              today, was often painful for me, but I learned early to deal with 
              an outside and sometimes hard world. Good training for research 
              work! The experimenter dealing with nature faces an outside and 
              often hard world. Natures' curriculum cannot be changed.<br>
              <br>
              The curricula were unsophisticated, with a great deal of time wasted 
              on penmanship and geography in the early grades and repetitions 
              of the trivial history of New York City in higher grades. But there 
              were also serious courses. In my high school, two foreign languages 
              had to be studied, four years of English was required, and that 
              meant mostly grammar and composition. I was able to take four years 
              of mathematics and a year of physics. Whatever the course, whether 
              the course was boring or interesting to me, whether I was talented 
              in mathematics or not talented in languages, my parents expected 
              A's. This was good training for research, because large parts of 
              experimental work are sometimes boring or involve the use of skills 
              in which one is not particularly gifted.<br>
              <br>
              For example, I am not a good craftsman. Until recently when I could 
              use computer-based drafting programs, my drawings always looked 
              messy, with uneven lines and ragged lettering. I could never get 
              an "A" in drafting in college. Yet drawing the apparatus to be built 
              for my experiments has always been a crucial part of my experimental 
              work.<br>
              <br>
              There was compensation for the unsophisticated curriculum; with 
              good marks one could "skip" school years. The normal progression 
              was to begin the eight years of elementary school at six years of 
              age, and then to take four years of high school, leading to graduation 
              at eighteen. But classrooms were crowded, and there were no worries 
              about the proper social level of a student; a good student could 
              skip a year or more in elementary school. I was sixteen when I graduated 
              from James Madison High School in Brooklyn in 1942. My sister, who 
              is now a well known writer in the United States, moved through school 
              even faster - she graduated at fifteen and one-half.<br>
              <br>
              Along with my parents insistence, soon internalized, that I do very 
              well in school, went my love of reading and my love of mechanics. 
              I read everything: fiction, history, science, mathematics, biography, 
              travel. There were two free public libraries within walking distance 
              of my home; I remember taking six books home from every visit, the 
              limit set by the library. This reading had only partial approval 
              from my parents. They wanted me to play more sports because they 
              were acutely sensitive to their children being one hundred percent 
              American, and they believed that all Americans played sports and 
              loved sports. They felt that too much reading interfered with my 
              going outside to play sport. I loved rainy days when I did not have 
              to go outside, and to the present I still feel very content on a 
              rainy day.<br>
              <br>
              Two books are burned in my memory, Lancelot Hogben's Mathematics 
              for the Millions and his Science for the Citizen. I borrowed them 
              from the library again and again. I made summaries of them. I could 
              not understand Hogben's introduction to calculus so I copied that 
              section completely. I don't know why it never occurred to me or 
              my parents to buy the books. We could have well-afforded them, but 
              somehow buying books was a waste of money. Naturally, I have compensated 
              in my adult years by owning very large numbers of books.<br>
              <br>
              Another thing we could have afforded was to buy me an Erector construction 
              set. The Erector construction set was the United States equivalent 
              of Meccano or M&auml;rklin construction sets in England and Europe. 
              But the cousin I played with every Saturday had an Erector set, 
              and one Erector set per extended family was considered quite enough. 
              He also had electric trains. I loved to build with the Erector set, 
              I loved to build toys and models out of wood, I loved to draw mechanical 
              devices, even those I could not build. I loved to read the magazines, 
              <i>Popular Mechanics</i> and <i>Popular Science</i>. I loved all 
              things mechanical; cars, trucks, derricks trains, and steam ships. 
              I was in love with mechanics, and I still am.<br>
              <br>
              Before leaving this subject I must mention that since I never owned 
              an Erector set as a child, I have compensated in my adult years 
              by collecting old European, English, and American construction sets; 
              and even by devising and starting prototype production of a modern 
              wooden construction set called BIG-NUT.<br>
              <br>
              I was also interested in chemistry, but my parents were not willing 
              to buy me a chemistry set. I had some chemicals but when I bought 
              sulfuric acid and nitric acid, my father confiscated the acids on 
              the grounds of safety. As every child knows, chemistry with nothing 
              stronger than vinegar soon becomes dull. Strangely for a person 
              who became a physicist, I was not interested in amateur radio or 
              in building radios. I don't know why. This was the 1930's when vacuum 
              tubes and variable condensers made radio building quite mechanical.<br>
              <br>
              In spite of very good school marks, a love of books (particularly 
              in science and mathematics), and a great love of mechanics, I never 
              thought of becoming a scientist. That was because as the children 
              of immigrants, my sister and I were taught that we must use our 
              education to "earn a good living" In fact, we didn't have to be 
              taught that. It was obvious to us. Our home life was physically 
              comfortable, and in some ways emotionally supportive, but it was 
              also rigid and stifling. We knew that we had to earn our own livings 
              to escape from home and Brooklyn. A good living in the Jewish middle 
              class meant that a girl should become a teacher or nurse; a boy 
              should become a doctor, dentist, lawyer, or accountant. I did not 
              think about going into business because the difficulties of the 
              Depression years did not make business a good way to earn a living.<br>
              <br>
              Although I won the physics medal when I graduated from high school, 
              I did not think of becoming a physicist or any kind of scientist. 
              My parents and I knew about a few scientists, certainly Pasteur, 
              and perhaps Einstein, but we did not know that it was possible for 
              a man to earn a living as a scientist.</p>

            <p><b>Engineering Studies, the War, a Practicing 
              Engineer, and What You are Interested in is called Physics</b><br>
              We did know that a man could earn a living as engineer. And so in 
              choosing a profession for me, my parents and I took into account 
              my love of mechanics, and science and mathematics. We put aside 
              my becoming a doctor, dentist, lawyer, or accountant in favor of 
              my becoming an engineer. This was an unusual choice for a Jewish 
              boy in the early 1940's because there was still plenty of antisemitism 
              in engineering companies. I enrolled in the Polytechnic Institute 
              of Brooklyn, now Polytechnic University, and began 
              studying chemical engineering.<br>
  <br>
  There were several reasons for choosing chemical engineering.
  Chemistry was a very exciting field in the late 1930's and early
  1940's. Chemistry was bringing to our lives synthetic materials
  such as nylon. The slogan of the radio program, <i>Dupont's
  Cavalcade of America</i>, was "Better things for better living
  through chemistry". Furthermore, Allied Printing had prospered
  through my father's hard work, and through the inclusion of a few
  chemical companies among his customers. He became friends with
  buyers in several of these companies, and they told him about the
  expansion of their companies. There would always be a good job in
  chemical engineering.<br>
  <br>
  One of the first courses I took in college was general physics,
  using the textbook by Hausman and Slack. The course was all about
  pulleys and thermometers; physics seemed a dead field compared to
  chemistry. So, just as I was blind to the fascination of physics
  in high school, I was once again blind to its fascination in
  college. I ignored physics, and continued studying chemistry and
  chemical engineering.<br>
  <br>
  My studies were interrupted by the war. I wanted to join the
  United States Army, but I was not yet eighteen and my parents
  would not give me permission. However, they agreed to me joining
  the United States Merchant Marine, I was allowed to leave college
  and become an engineering cadet in the program at the Kings Point
  Merchant Marine Academy. The training ship was wonderful - it had
  a main reciprocating steam engine, and direct steam driven pumps
  and auxiliary machinery; a paradise of mechanics. But when I went
  to sea for six months as part of the training, I was on a Victory
  ship with a sealed turbine and electrically driven auxiliary
  machinery. Very boring. Therefore, when the war ended with the
  atom bomb, I left the merchant marine and went to work for my
  father while waiting to return to college. I knew so little about
  physics that I didn't know even vaguely why the bomb was so
  powerful.<br>
  <br>
  I didn't get right back to college. The draft was still in force
  in the United States. I was drafted, and spent a pleasant year at
  an army installation in Washington, DC, doing very little.
  Finally, I returned to the Polytechnic Institute and received a
  summa cum laude bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering in
  1948.<br>
  <br>
  The skills and knowledge I acquired at the Polytechnic Institute
  have been crucial in all my experimental work: the use of
  strength of materials principles in equipment design, machine
  shop practice, engineering drawing, practical fluid mechanics,
  inorganic and organic chemistry, chemical laboratory techniques,
  manufacturing processes, metallurgy, basic concepts in mechanical
  engineering, basic concepts in electrical engineering,
  dimensional analysis, speed and power in mental arithmetic,
  numerical estimation (crucial when depending on a slide rule for
  calculations), and much more.<br>
  <br>
  Upon graduation, I joined the General Electric Company. After a
  year in an advanced engineering training program, I settled in
  Schenectady, New York, working as a Chemical Engineer in the
  Electron Tube Division. I worked in an engineering office in the
  electron tube production factory. Our job was to troubleshoot
  production problems, to improve production processes, and
  occasionally to do a little development work. We were not a fancy
  R&amp;D office. I worked on speeding-up the production of
  television picture tubes, and then on problems of grid emission
  in industrial power tubes. These tasks led to a turning point in
  my life.<br>
  <br>
  I had to learn a little about how electron vacuum tubes worked,
  so I took a few courses in Union College in Schenectady
  specifically, atomic physics and advanced calculus. I got to know
  a wonderful physics professor, Vladimir Rojansky. One day he said
  to me "Martin, what you are interested in is called physics not
  chemistry!" At the age of 23, I finally decided to begin the
  study of physics.</p>

            <p><b>Graduate Study in Physics, I.I. Rabi, and 
              Learning the Physicist's Trade</b><br>
              I entered the physics doctoral program in Columbia University in the 
              autumn of 1950. Looking back, it seems amazing that I was admitted. 
              True, I had a summa cum laude bachelor degree, but I had taken only 
              two courses in physics: one year of elementary physics and a half-year 
              of atomic physics. There were several reasons I could do this 1950; 
              it could not have been done today. First, graduate study in physics 
              was primitive in 1950, compared to today's standards. We did not 
              study quantum mechanics until the second year, the first year was 
              devoted completely to classical physics. The most advanced quantum 
              mechanics we ever studied was a little bit in Heitler, and we were 
              not expected to be able to do calculations in quantum electrodynamics.<br>
  <br>
  Second, there was no thought of advising or course guidance by
  the Columbia Physics Department faculty - students were on their
  own. I was arrogant about my ability to learn anything fast. By
  the time I realized I was in trouble, but the time I realized
  that many of my fellow students were smarter than me and better
  trained then me, it was too late to quit. I had explained the
  return to school to my astonished parents by telling them that
  physics was what Einstein did. They thought if Einstein, why not
  Martin; I could not quit. I survived the Columbia Physics
  Department, never the best student, but an ambitious and
  hard-working student. I was married and had one child. I had to
  get my Ph.D and once more earn a living.<br>
  <br>
  Just as the Polytechnic Institute was crucial in my learning how
  to do engineering; just as Union College and Vladimir Rojansky
  were crucial in my choosing physics; so Columbia University and
  my thesis advisor, <a href="../1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a>,
  were crucial in my learning how to do experimental physics. I
  undertook for my doctoral research the problem of using the
  atomic beam resonance method to measure the quadrupole moment of
  the sodium nucleus. This measurement had to be made using an
  excited atomic state, and Rabi had found a way to do this.<br>
  <br>
  As is well known, Rabi was not a "hands-on" experimenter. He
  never used tools or manipulated the apparatus. I learned
  experimental techniques from older graduate students and by
  occasionally going to ask for help or advice from Rabi's
  colleague, Polykarp Kusch. I hated to go to Kusch, because it was
  always an unpleasant experience. He had a loud voice which he
  deliberately made louder so that the entire floor of students
  could hear about the stupid question asked by a graduate
  student.<br>
  <br>
  Thus as in the course work, I was on my own in learning the
  experimenter's trade. I learned quickly, as I tell my graduate
  students now, there are no answers in the back of the book when
  the equipment doesn't work or the measurements look
  strange.<br>
  <br>
  I learned things more precious than experimental techniques from
  Rabi. I learned the deep importance of choosing one's own
  research problems. Rabi once told me that he would worry when
  talking to Leo Szilard that Szilard would propose some idea to
  Rabi. This was because Rabi wouldn't carry out an idea suggested
  by someone else, even though he had already been thinking about
  that same idea.<br>
  <br>
  I learned from Rabi the importance of getting the right answer
  and checking it thoroughly. When I finished my measurement of the
  quadrupole moment, I was eager to publish and to get on with
  earning a living. But Rabi had heard that a similar measurement
  had been made by an optical resonance method in France. He wrote
  to the French physicists to see if they had a similar answer. He
  didn't telephone or cable; he calmly wrote. I waited nervously.
  Six or eight weeks later he received the answer that they had a
  similar answer; then, I was allowed to publish. It is far better
  to be delayed, it is better to be second in publishing a result,
  than to publish first with the wrong answer.<br>
  <br>
  It was Rabi who always emphasized the importance of working on a
  fundamental problem, and it was Rabi who sent me into elementary
  particle physics. It would have been natural for me to continue
  in atomic physics, but he preached particle physics to me -
  particularly when his colleagues in atomic physics were in the
  room. I think that most of that public preaching may have been
  Rabi's way of deliberately irritating his colleagues.</p>

            <p><b>Michigan, Bubble Chambers, and On my Own 
              with L.W. Jones</b><br>
              When I received my Ph.D. in 1955, I had job offers from the Physics 
              Departments at Yale, the University of Illinois, and the University of Michigan. At that 
              time, the first two Physics Departments had better reputations in 
              elementary particle physics, and so I deliberately went to Michigan. 
              I followed a two-part theorem that I always pass on to my graduate 
              students and post doctoral research associates. Part 1: don't choose 
              the most powerful experimental group or department - choose the 
              group or department where you will have the most freedom. Part 2: 
              there is an advantage in working in a small or new group - then 
              you will get the credit for what you accomplish.<br>
  <br>
  At Michigan I first worked in bubble chamber physics with
  <a href="../1960/index.html">Donald Glaser</a>. But I wanted to
  be on my own. When the Russians flew SPUTNIK in 1957, I saw the
  opportunity, and jointly with my colleague, Lawrence W. Jones, we
  wrote to Washington for research money. We began our own research
  program, using first the now-forgotten luminescent chamber and
  then spark chambers. This brings me to the story I tell in my
  Nobel lecture on the discovery of the tau lepton.</p>

            <p><b>It was Good Fortune ...</b><br>
              Looking back to to my early years in Brooklyn, at the Polytechnic 
              Institute, and at the General Electric Company, I am astonished 
              to be writing a biographical note as a Nobel Laureate. I have tried 
              to tell how it happened, yet I realize that I have left out the 
              most crucial element: good fortune. It was good fortune to be a 
              child during the Depression years and a youth during the war years. 
              I lived in a country united by the belief that hard work and perseverance 
              could get one through great difficulties. I saw right triumph. The 
              progression of my career coincided with the growth of universities 
              and the tremendous expansion in federal support for basic research, 
              Academic jobs were relatively easy to get and hold, research funds 
              were relatively easy to get. All good fortune. Of course, my ultimate 
              good fortune was that the tau existed.<br>
  <br>
  Life is much harder for the young women and men who are in
  science in present times. But they are smarter and better trained
  than I was at their ages; they know more and have better
  equipment. I wish them good fortune.</p>
