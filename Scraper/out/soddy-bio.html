  <h1>Frederick Soddy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="soddy.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Frederick Soddy</b>, the son of Benjamin Soddy, 
              a London merchant, was born at Eastbourne, Sussex, England, on September 
              2, 1877. He was educated at Eastbourne College and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.<br>
              <br>
              In 1895 he obtained a scholarship at Merton College, Oxford, from which University he 
              graduated in 1898 with first class honours in chemistry. After two 
              years of research at Oxford he went to Canada and from 1900 to 1902 
              was Demonstrator in the Chemistry Department of McGill University, Montreal. Here he worked with Professor <a href="../1908/index.html">Sir 
              Ernest Rutherford</a> on problems of radioactivity. Together they 
              published a series of papers on radioactivity and concluded that 
              it was a phenomenon involving atomic disintegration with the formation 
              of new kinds of matter. They also investigated the gaseous emanation 
              of radium.<br>
              <br>
              Leaving Canada, Soddy then worked with <a href=
  "../1904/index.html">Sir William Ramsay</a> at University College, London where 
              he continued the study of radium emanation. Here, Soddy and Ramsay 
              were able to demonstrate, by spectroscopic means, that the element 
              helium was produced in the radioactive decay of a sample of radium 
              bromide and that helium was evolved in the decay of emanation.<br>
              <br>
              From 1904 to 1914 Soddy was lecturer in physical chemistry and radioactivity 
              in the University of Glasgow. Here he did much practical chemical work 
              on radioactive materials. During this period he evolved the so-called 
              "Displacement Law", namely that emission of an alpha-particle from 
              an element causes that element to move back two places in the Periodic 
              Table. His peak was reached in 1913 with his formulation of the 
              concept of isotopes, which stated that certain elements exist in 
              two or more forms which have different atomic weights but which 
              are indistinguishable chemically.<br>
              <br>
              In 1914 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the University of Aberdeen, but plans 
              for research were hampered by the war. In 1919 he became Dr. Lees 
              Professor of Chemistry at Oxford University, a post he held until 
              1937 when he retired, on the death of his wife.<br>
              <br>
             After his period at Glasgow he did no further work in radioactivity. His interest changed to economic, social and political theories which gained no general acceptance at the time, and to unusual mathematical and mechanical problems.<br>
              <br>
              His books include <i>Radioactivity</i> (1904), <i>The Interpretation 
              of Radium</i> (1909), <i>The Chemistry of the Radioactive Elements</i> 
              (1912-1914), <i>Matter and Energy</i> (1912), <i>Science and Life</i> 
              (1920), <i>The Interpretation of the Atom</i> (1932), <i>The Story 
              of Atomic Energy</i> (1949), and <i>Atomic Transmutation</i> (1953)<i>.</i><br>
              <br>
              Soddy was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1910 and Oxford 
              awarded him an honorary degree. He was awarded the Albert Medal 
              in 1951.<br>
              <br>
              He was a man of strong principles and obstinate views, friendly 
              with students and prickly with colleagues.<br>
              <br>
              ln 1908, he married Winifred Beilby. He died on September 22, 1956 
              at Brighton.</p>
