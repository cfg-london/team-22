  <h1>F. Sherwood Rowland - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rowland.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on June 28, 1927, the second
  of three sons, in the small central Ohio town of Delaware, the
  home of Ohio Wesleyan University. My father and mother had moved
  there the previous year when he took the position of Professor of
  Mathematics and Chairman of the Department at Ohio Wesleyan. All
  of my elementary and high school education was received in the
  Delaware public schools from an excellent set of teachers. The
  Delaware school system then believed in accelerated promotion, so
  that I entered first grade at age 5 and skipped the fourth grade
  entirely, with the result that I entered high school at 12 and
  graduated a few weeks before my sixteenth birthday. The college
  preparatory curriculum was strong on Latin, English, History,
  Science and Mathematics. The academic side of high school was
  easy for me, and I enjoyed it. In several summers of my early
  teens, the high school science teacher entrusted to me during his
  two week vacations the operation of the local volunteer weather
  station, an auxiliary part of the U.S. weather service-maximum
  and minimum temperatures and total precipitation. This was my
  first exposure to systematic experimentation and data
  collection.<br>
  <br>
  Our home was filled with books, and all of us were avid readers.
  My reading at that time ran toward naval history, which was
  complemented with realistic scale-models and simulated naval
  battles using an elaborate mathematical system for rating each
  warship and the effects of combat on them. During my sophomore
  year in high school, my math teacher, who also coached tennis and
  basketball, encouraged me to take up tennis - which led me onto
  the varsity tennis team for my junior and senior years, and into
  a full decade of intense athletic competition. As a senior, I
  played on the varsity basketball team.<br>
  <br>
  After graduation from high school in 1943, almost all of my male
  classmates immediately entered the military services. However,
  because I was still well under the compulsory draft age of 18, I
  enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan and attended the university year-round
  for the next two years. During these war years, only 30 or 40
  civilian males were on campus, plus about 200 naval officer
  trainees and 1,000 women. With so few men available, I played on
  the University basketball and baseball teams, and wrote much of
  the sports page for the University newspaper.<br>
  <br>
  My accelerated academic schedule made me eligible for my final
  year of university in June, 1945, as I approached my 18th
  birthday. However, with the fighting in the Pacific and the
  continuing military draft, I enlisted in a Navy program to train
  radar operators. The Pacific war ended while I was still in basic
  training near Chicago, and I served the next year in several
  midwestern Naval Separation Centers, as the 10,000,000 Americans
  who had preceded me into the military were returned to civilian
  life. A major amount of this Navy time was devoted to competitive
  athletics for the Navy base teams, and I emerged after 14 months
  as a non commissioned officer with a rating of Specialist
  (Athletics) 3rd class. My first real opportunity to see the rest
  of the United States came when I was transferred to San Pedro,
  California for discharge from the Navy.<br>
  <br>
  I then hitchhiked 2000 miles back to Ohio, traveling through
  Yosemite and Yellowstone Park on the way.<br>
  <br>
  This year away from the academic life convinced me that at age
  19, there was little reason for me to seek a quick finish to my
  undergraduate education. I therefore arranged my schedule to take
  two more years rather than one to graduate, and continued to play
  basketball on the university team. My coursework at Ohio Wesleyan
  emphasized science within a liberal arts curriculum, with more or
  less equal amounts of chemistry, physics and mathematics, and
  majors in all three fields. As had been the case in high school,
  I really enjoyed the academic side of university life.<br>
  <br>
  I do not honestly remember when the decision that I would go to
  graduate school was made. My father had studied for his Ph.D.,
  and all of us took it for granted that I would, too. Furthermore,
  both my parents had firm convictions that the University of
  Chicago, which each had attended, was not just the best choice
  for graduate work, but the only choice. So I applied to the
  Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago for Fall
  1948, and was duly admitted. All service veterans were entitled
  to a certain number of months (27 in my case) of paid university
  education, and I had not used any of these credits during my
  undergraduate years at Ohio Wesleyan because faculty children did
  not pay tuition, and I lived at home. I therefore didn't apply
  for any of the teaching assistantships or academic fellowships,
  and was quite surprised after arriving in Chicago to find that
  many of my fellow students were being paid by the University to
  attend graduate school. In subsequent years, I was supported by
  an Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) national fellowship.<br>
  <br>
  At that time, the Chemistry Department of the University of
  Chicago had a policy of immediately assigning each new graduate
  student to a temporary faculty adviser prior to the choice of an
  individual research topic. My randomly assigned mentor was
  <a href="../1960/index.html">Willard F. Libby</a>, who had just
  finished developing the Carbon-14 Dating technique for which he
  received the 1960 Nobel Prize. Bill Libby (although I never
  called him anything but "Professor Libby" until I was more than
  40 years old) was a charismatic, brusque (on first meeting, "I
  see you made all A's in undergraduate school. We're here to find
  out if you are any damn good!") dynamo, with a very wide range of
  fertile ideas for scientific research. I settled automatically
  and happily into his research group, and became a radiochemist
  working on the chemistry of radioactive atoms. Almost everything
  I learned about how to be a research scientist came from
  listening to and observing Bill Libby.<br>
  <br>
  The first nuclear reactor had been built by Enrico Fermi in 1942
  under the football stands at the University of Chicago, and the
  post-war university had managed to capture many of the leading
  scientists from the Manhattan Project into the Physics and
  Chemistry departments. My impression at the time (and now in
  retrospect 45 years later) was that this was an unbelievably
  exciting time in the physical sciences at the University of
  Chicago. My physical chemistry course was taught by <a href=
  "../1934/index.html">Harold Urey</a> for two quarters and in the
  third quarter by Edward Teller; inorganic chemistry was given by
  <a href="../1983/index.html">Henry Taube</a>; radiochemistry by
  Libby. I also attended courses on Nuclear Physics given by
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1963/index.html">Maria Goeppert
  Mayer</a> and by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Fermi</a>. (The chemistry
  student grapevine said, "Go to any lecture that Fermi gives on
  any subject"). Urey and Fermi already had been awarded Nobel
  Prizes, and Libby, Mayer and Taube were to receive theirs in the
  future.<br>
  <br>
  My thesis concerned the chemical state of cyclotron-produced
  radioactive bromine atoms. The nuclear process not only creates a
  radioactive atom, but breaks it loose from all of its chemical
  bonds. These highly energetic atoms exist only in very, very low
  concentration, but can subsequently be traced by their eventual
  radioactive decay. Bill Libby gave his graduate students an
  unusual amount of leeway in how they chose to use their time, and
  was a superb research superviser - supporting, encouraging, but
  never letting one forget that intensive critical thought,
  together with unrelenting hard work on experiments, underlay all
  progress in our research.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in competitive athletics also continued unabated in
  graduate school. Because of the atypical structure of its
  undergraduate college system, the University of Chicago, unlike
  almost all other American universities, permitted graduate
  students to compete in intercollegiate athletics. During my first
  graduate year, I played both basketball and baseball for the
  University teams. I continued to play baseball for the University
  during the spring for two more years, and spent both of those
  summers playing semi-professional baseball for a Canadian team in
  Oshawa, Ontario. Each winter I also played for several basketball
  teams around the city of Chicago.<br>
  <br>
  Without a doubt, however, the major extracurricular event of
  those four years at the University of Chicago was meeting and
  then marrying on June 7, 1952, Joan Lundberg, also a graduate of
  the University. We have now shared more than 43 years of married
  life - and shared is really the descriptive word. I finished my
  Ph. D. thesis in August of 1952, and we went off to Princeton
  University in September of that year for my new position of
  Instructor in the Chemistry Department. Our daughter Ingrid was
  born in Princeton in the summer of 1953, and our son Jeffrey in
  Huntington, Long Island, in the summer of 1955.<br>
  <br>
  In each of the years from 1953-55, I spent the summer in the
  Chemistry Department of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. An
  early experiment there of putting a powdered mixture of the sugar
  glucose and lithium carbonate into the neutron flux of the
  Brookhaven nuclear reactor resulted in a one-step synthesis of
  radioactive tritium-labeled glucose, an article in
  <i>Science</i>, and a new sub-field of tritium "hot atom"
  chemistry. The A.E.C. also expressed considerable interest in
  this tracer chemistry, and offered support for continuation of
  the research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956, I moved to an Assistant Professorship at the University
  of Kansas, which had just completed a new chemistry building
  including special facilities for radiochemistry. Contract support
  from the A.E.C. was already approved, and in place when I arrived
  that summer. Several excellent graduate students interested in
  radiochemistry joined my research group that summer, and were
  shortly joined by others and by a series of postdoctoral research
  associates, including many from Europe and Japan. This research
  group was very productive for the next eight years, chiefly
  investigating the chemical reactions of energetic tritium atoms
  and I moved through the ranks to a full Professorship. Both
  Ingrid and Jeff grew up knowing the members of the group -
  meeting everyone at our regular home seminars, and from an early
  age occasionally visiting the laboratory. During these Kansas
  years, too, the everyday routine was that the entire family came
  home for lunch. Later on in California, Ingrid and Jeff each
  worked regularly (but unpaid) drafting slide and journal
  illustrations for the chemistry department, and thereby
  continuing to know the members of my research group.<br>
  <br>
  The Irvine campus of the University of California was scheduled
  to open for students in September, 1965, and I went there in
  August, 1964, as Professor of Chemistry and the first Chairman of
  the Chemistry Department. The A.E.C. support turned out to be
  truly long-term, surviving this transfer, and then the
  transformations of the A.E.C. into the Energy Research and
  Development Administration and then into the Department of
  Energy. That basic contract finally terminated in 1994, by which
  time NASA was furnishing the major support for our continuing
  research.<br>
  <br>
  "Hot atom" chemistry continued to play a major role in our
  research efforts at the University of California Irvine. However,
  I have deliberately followed a policy of trying to instill some
  freshness into our research efforts by every few years extending
  our work into some new, challenging aspect of chemistry - first,
  radioactive tracer photochemistry, using tritium and carbon-14;
  then chlorine and fluorine chemistry using the radioactive
  isotopes <sup>38</sup>Cl and <sup>18</sup>F<br>
  <br>
  When I decided in 1970 to retire from the Chemistry department
  chairmanship, I once again sought some new avenue of chemistry
  for our investigation. Because the state of the environment had
  become a significant topic for discussion both by the general
  public and within our family, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria,
  for an International Atomic Energy Agency meeting on the
  environmental applications of radioactivity. Afterward on the
  train to Vienna, I shared a compartment with an A.E.C. program
  officer also coming from the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/index.html">IAEA</a> meeting. He learned in our
  conversation that I was personally interested in atmospheric
  science because of my early association and admiration for the
  <sup>14</sup>C work of Bill Libby, and further that my research
  had then been supported by the A.E.C. for the previous 14 years.
  I in turn learned that one of his A.E.C. responsibilities was the
  organization of a series of Chemistry-Meteorology Workshops, with
  the intention of encouraging more cross-fertilization between
  these two scientific fields.<br>
  <br>
  In due course, I was invited to the second of these workshops in
  January, 1972, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where I heard a
  presentation about recent measurements by the English scientist,
  Jim Lovelock, of the atmospheric concentrations of a trace
  species, the man-made chlorofluorocarbon CCl<sup>3</sup>F, on the
  cruise of the <i>Shackleton</i> to Antarctica. His shipboard
  observations showed its presence in both the northern and
  southern hemispheres, although in quite low concentration. One of
  the special advantages cited for this molecule was that it would
  be an excellent tracer for air mass movements because its
  chemical inertness would prevent its early removal from the
  atmosphere.<br>
  <br>
  As a chemical kineticist and photochemist, I knew that such a
  molecule could not remain inert in the atmosphere forever, if
  only because solar photochemistry at high altitudes would break
  it down. However, many other possible chemical fates could be
  imagined, and I wondered whether any of these might occur. In
  early 1973, my regular yearly proposal was submitted to the
  A.E.C. and was duly approved and funded by them. In addition to
  the continuation of several radiochemistry experiments, I also
  included in the proposal a new direction - asking the question:
  what would eventually happen to the chlorofluorocarbon compounds
  in the atmosphere?<br>
  <br>
  Later that year, Mario Molina, who had just completed his Ph. D.
  work as a laser chemist at the University of California Berkeley,
  joined my research group as a postdoctoral research associate.
  Offered his choice among several areas for our collaborative
  research, Mario chose the one furthest from his previous
  experience and from my own experience as well, and we began
  studying the atmospheric fate of the chlorofluorocarbon
  molecules.<br>
  <br>
  Within three months, Mario and I realized that this was not just
  a scientific question, challenging and interesting to us, but a
  potentially grave environmental problem involving substantial
  depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. A major part of both
  of our careers since has been spent on the continuing threads of
  this original problem.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1973, the work of my research group has progressively
  involved more atmospheric chemistry and less radiochemistry until
  now our only important use of radioisotopes is directed toward
  problems associated with atmospheric chemistry. This research
  work has been conducted at the University of California Irvine by
  a strong, hard-working group of postdoctoral and graduate student
  research associates, together with some able technical
  specialists.<br>
  <br>
  The chlorofluorocarbon-ozone problem became a highly visible
  public concern in late 1974, and brought with it many new
  scientific experiments, and also legislative hearings, extensive
  media coverage, and a much heavier travel schedule for me. This
  change came after both Ingrid and Jeff had moved away from home
  for their own university educations, leaving Joan free to
  accompany me in these travels. She has attended-and sat through
  with perceptive interest - countless scientific meetings since
  1975. She quickly became quite conversant with the general
  scientific aspects of ozone depletion, and has been a
  knowledgeable and trusted confidante through all of the last two
  decades of ozone research. Ingrid and Jeff, too, have maintained
  close contact and support during those often controversial
  years.<br>
  <br>
  In many ways, the understanding of atmospheric chemistry is still
  in an early stage. The necessary instrumental precision and
  sensitivity for dealing with chemical species in such low
  concentrations has only been progressively available over the
  last two decades, and of course the trace composition of the
  atmosphere is highly variable around the world. The research
  group has been heavily involved in a series of regional and
  global experiments, often since 1988 as participants in
  comprehensive aircraft-based atmospheric field research. Some of
  this research involves challenging and interesting scientific
  puzzles, and some can also be described as directed toward global
  environmental problems. As with the ozone depletion capability of
  the chlorofluorocarbons, one does not always know until well into
  the work whether it belongs to the second category as well as the
  first. We continue to find fascination in the chemistry of the
  atmosphere.</p>
