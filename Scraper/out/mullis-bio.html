  <h1>Kary B. Mullis - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mullis.jpg" class="bio-img">My father Cecil Banks Mullis and mother,
  formerly Bernice Alberta Barker grew up in rural North Carolina
  in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. My dad's family had
  a general store, which I never saw. My grandparents on his side
  had already died before I started noticing things. My mother's
  parents were close to me all during my childhood, and her father
  Albert stopped by to see me in a non-substantial form on his way
  out of this world in 1986. I was living in California. "Pop" died
  at 92 and wondering what was happening to me out in California,
  stopped by Kensington for a couple days. My house afforded a view
  of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. His visit was an odd
  experience. Not at all frightening. I have cultivated the curious
  things in life and found this one pleasant. "Pop" and I sat in
  the evenings in my kitchen and I told him about the contemporary
  California world while we drank beer. I drank his for him as it
  appeared that although he was very much there for me, he was not
  there at all for the beer. Many of my friends when I told them of
  this thought it fanciful. (I think it more likely than much of
  our math today and at least half of our physics, both of which I
  like).<br>
  <br>
  Until I was five my immediate family lived near my grandfather's
  farm where my mother had grown up, and with the exception of a
  few modern conveniences, had not changed a lot over the
  years.<br>
  <br>
  My grandfather milked several cows twice a day and supplied the
  neighbours with dairy products. He liked to go visiting around
  the county on Saturdays and he also enjoyed the neighbours when
  they came by once a week with their empty milk jars. He walked
  them out to their cars and hung over the driver's side window
  until they drove off. The road was two tire tracks on well mown
  grass between barbed wire fences, cows off to the right, alfalfa
  or sometimes corn to the left.<br>
  <br>
  I remember mostly the summers. My mother and aunts presided out
  on the big screened back porch shelling peas, stringing beans,
  peeling apples, pears, and peaches. The peaches were peeled with
  a special machine that had a hand crank and left a spiraling
  groove on what was left of the peach. The peels went to the pigs.
  Everything else went into steaming Mason jars which would go down
  into the earthen floored cellar. Down there in the dark, and it
  was always a little moist, were spiders in abundance and
  magnificent biodiversity. My brothers, and my cousins, and I
  ventured into the cellar once in a while to inspect the sweet
  potatoes and the hibernating jars. No one wanted to stay there
  alone ever, and mostly we played in the woods, the swamp, the
  orchards, the barn, the granary, which had wasps, and the
  woodshed, which also had wasps and, like the barn, allegedly,
  snakes.<br>
  <br>
  We tortured the cows. We sliced apples and slipped them onto the
  electric fence that contained them in the newer parts of the
  pasture. Cows like apples and they kept trying. We watched the
  chickens pecking at the black mud around their chicken house. We
  heard the squeal of young pigs being castrated by my grandfather
  and the veterinarian, but we weren't allowed to watch. We heard
  stories from our moms about balls of fire during thunder storms
  streaming up the drain pipe that led down to the chicken yard and
  dancing out of the sink onto the grey floor of the back porch.
  All the scorched marks had been sanded and painted over by the
  time we heard about it, and sadly it never happened while we were
  there. But there were thunderstorms. Rain would come down from a
  cloudburst in the summer afternoons and the woods would explode
  with thunder. Our moms would keep us inside and out of the draft
  from any windows. We... wanted to see those fireballs.<br>
  <br>
  We could play in the attic. Even in the day there was not enough
  light to keep us calm in the attic, and there were animal-skin
  coats and unfamiliar garments that lurked in the closets. There
  was a horrible picture of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1906/index.html">Teddy Roosevelt</a> killing a
  bear. Very bloody. And there were black widow spiders waiting for
  us always, down in their funnel shaped webs in all the dark
  corners. It was a thrilling place during a thunderstorm and, like
  the hay loft of the barn, a place where my pre-adolescent
  sexuality concerning my cousin Judy, who was one month my senior,
  would come a little more sharply into focus. We were only nine or
  ten, but it was there already with it's pressing curiosity. We
  sometimes kissed. My techniques have improved, but not the
  thrill.<br>
  <br>
  When my great-grandmother died she was almost a hundred and we
  were glad to see her go because every time she would come over to
  my grandmother's house, she would try to kiss all of us. She
  looked almost a hundred and, heartless, cruel, mindless little
  children that we were, she repulsed us. She grabbed us anyway and
  kissed us until she was through. They put her body in a metal
  casket with gauzy curtains and left it in the living room near
  the grandfather's clock, which announced the hours with a number
  of resonant bongs and marked the half-hours with a single
  chilling tone. Her body was there for three days until the
  service on Sunday at Mt Zion Baptist Church. We dared each other
  to go in and look at her. The adults were unaffected and took
  their regular meals right in the next room. We found it difficult
  to sleep. The clock seemed more alive than usual.<br>
  <br>
  My great-grandmother, as I learned from Judy much later, when we
  were adults, had been an unusual woman in Saw Mills, North
  Carolina. She lived just a bit on the wild side. She gave birth
  to my grandmother out of wedlock following an affair with a
  railroad man named Stowe. We never heard much about him. "Nanny",
  as we called our great-grandmother, was tolerated by the
  community because she was the only person for miles around who
  knew the rudiments of medicine. She provided medical care to
  livestock, for which she had been trained, but also to people for
  whom she was the only alternative on her side of the Catawba
  River. She also ran the post office in Granite Falls. She was the
  first postmistress anyone had heard about, and rural North
  Carolinians at the time were not in the mood for new customs, but
  they accepted what they couldn't avoid. And granite does
  fall.<br>
  <br>
  When my grandfather, "Pop", James Albert Barker, son of Cary
  Barker from Cary, N.C. decided to marry Nanny's illegitimate
  daughter, Princess Escoe Miller, his father gave him a piece of
  land to farm and tolerated his choice of bride. My given name
  derives from Cary with a slight change of spelling that my mother
  thought practical so as to keep my initialed name from being the
  same as my Dad's, C.B. Mullis. She probably never imagined that I
  would be living far away before it ever mattered.<br>
  <br>
  The rest of my life has passed quite suddenly. Around ten or
  twelve I fell into the inevitable logarithms of time. It seems to
  go faster and faster. I wonder now why we have to have Christmas
  so often.<br>
  <br>
  I went to high school in Columbia. I met my first wife, Richards,
  whom I married while I was working on a B.S. in chemistry at
  Georgia
  Tech. She bore Louise and I studied. I learned most of the
  useful technical things, math, physics, chemistry, that I now
  use, during those four years. I did little else, except to play
  with Louise and change her diapers at night. We moved to
  Berkeley, California in 1966. I did my Ph.D. in biochemistry
  under J.B. Neilands and there I learned the rest, the
  non-technical things. After that, it happened so quickly that
  it's hard to really talk about in the wake of my grandparents'
  farm.<br>
  <br>
  Except for Cynthia and our boys.<br>
  <br>
  I met Cynthia while I was in Kansas for three years. She's the
  very special daughter of an old grain trading family and a
  pathologist, David Gibson. Cynthia encouraged me to write and
  brought Christopher and Jeremy into the world. I left her, some
  say foolishly, when we were living in California in about
  1981.<br>
  <br>
  I was working for Cetus, making oligonucleotides. They were heady
  times. Biotechnology was in flower and one spring night while the
  California buckeyes were also in flower I came across the
  polymerase chain reaction. I was driving with Jennifer Barnett to
  a cabin I had been building in northern California. She and I had
  worked and lived together for two years. She was an inspiration
  to me during that time as only a woman with brains, in the bloom
  of her womanhood, can be. That morning she had no idea what had
  just happened. I had an inkling. It was the first day of the rest
  of my life.<br>
  <br>
  From there it's a single sentence. I worked as a consultant, got
  the Nobel Prize, and have now turned to writing. It is 1994.</p>
