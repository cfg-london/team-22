  <h1>George H. Hitchings - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hitchings.jpg" class="bio-img">My forebears all came from the United
  Kingdom. On my father's side, they migrated from London and
  County Derry in Northern Ireland to Londonderry, New Hampshire.
  When the American Revolution came, they, as loyalists, moved on
  to Canada. My father, grandfather and great-grandfather were born
  in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. In 1865, my grandfather, Andrew
  Hitchings, moved his family to Eureka, California. Andrew was a
  skilled craftsman in the building of wooden ships, and my father,
  George Herbert Hitchings, Sr., followed in his footsteps,
  eventually becoming a marine architect and master builder.<br>
  <br>
  On my mother's side, Scottish and English prevailed. The first
  American was one Thomas Littlejohn from near Edinburgh, who came
  to the New World about 1735. His descendants, including Shaws,
  Eldridges and Thomases, moved about in the Maritime Provinces and
  New England. My maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were
  descendants of the Matthews family that emigrated twenty-four
  strong from near Glasgow to Prince Edward Island about 1800. My
  grandfather, Peter Matthews, married Sara Elizabeth Eldridge, and
  my mother, Lillian Matthews, was born in Maine. In 1875, my
  grandfather moved his family across the United States. He, too,
  was a shipbuilder and settled in Eureka.<br>
  <br>
  My mother and father met and were married in Eureka, and my two
  sisters were born there. About 1897, Peter Matthews established a
  shipyard in Hoquiam, Washington, to build lumber carriers for the
  E.K. Wood Lumber Company. The company built several schooners a
  year. When Peter Matthews died, my father succeeded to the
  management, which then became Hitchings and Joyce. Later, my
  father was master builder and supervisor in Bellingham,
  Washington, and Coos Bay, Oregon, and between times he engaged in
  marine architecture. He worked in the period between sail and
  steam and was especially noted for the design of the transition
  vessel, the steam schooner, which had a wooden hull and was steam
  propelled.<br>
  <br>
  I was born in Hoquiam in 1905. Family wanderings put me in grade
  school in Berkeley and San Diego, California, as well as in
  Bellingham and Seattle, Washington. I enjoyed a warm and loving
  home environment. A high standard of ethics prevailed in our
  family, together with a thirst for knowledge and an urge to
  teach. In their schooling, my mother and father were limited to
  what was available in Eureka, but they were avid readers,
  especially my father. It is clear to me in retrospect that he
  would have been a scientist had opportunities been more easily
  attainable.<br>
  <br>
  My father died after a prolonged illness when I was twelve years
  old. The deep impression made by this event turned my thoughts
  toward medicine. This objective shaped my selection of courses in
  high school and expressed itself when I was salutatorian at my
  class graduation. I chose the life of Pasteur as the subject for
  my oration. The blending of Pasteur's basic research and
  practical results remained a goal throughout my career.<br>
  <br>
  My experiences at Franklin High School in Seattle were notable
  for another reason. We had a most heterogeneous population, one
  that blended upper class and minorities including blacks,
  Filipinos, Japanese, Chinese and first generation Catanians. As a
  result I lost any self-consciousness I felt in dealing with
  people from different cultures and backgrounds.<br>
  <br>
  I entered the University of Washington as a premedical student in
  1923. The enthusiasm of faculty and students in the Chemistry
  Department was very infectious, however, and by the end of the
  first year I had become a chemistry major. I earned top grades,
  election to Phi Beta Kappa in my junior year, and a degree <i>cum
  laude</i> in 1927.<br>
  <br>
  I stayed on to earn a master's degree in 1928 with a thesis based
  on work carried out during the summer of 1927 at the Puget Sound
  Biological Station at Friday Harbor, Washington. This institution
  later became a branch of the Oceanographic Laboratories of the
  University of Washington, largely created and directed by Thomas
  C. Thompson, who had been my mentor for my master's thesis.
  Thompson taught analytical chemistry and was notable for the keen
  wit and humorous twists that made his teaching memorable. Perhaps
  the most useful lessons I learned from him have to do with the
  mathematics of the precision of measurement.<br>
  <br>
  For further graduate work I was offered fellowships at the Mayo
  Foundation and at Harvard. I chose Harvard, and after
  one year as a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at
  Cambridge, I was accepted as a Teaching Fellow in the Department
  of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School. I had intended to
  work with Otto Folin, but it was his habit to assign first-year
  Fellows to Cyrus Fiske for a year. By the end of the year, I was
  caught up in the Fiske-Subbarow program, and Folin very
  generously allowed me to continue there. After the discovery of
  phosphocreatine, this group had detected and isolated adenosine
  triphosphate. My assignment was to prepare for physiological
  studies by developing analytic methods (on a scale then viewed as
  'micro' - 1 mg or less) for the purine bases. These methods
  constituted my dissertation and several early publications.<br>
  <br>
  I earned my Ph.D. in 1933, a year memorable for another great
  event in my life - my marriage to Beverly Reimer. Her forebears
  were German, Austrian (Pennsylvania Dutch), Scottish and English.
  Her father, Azariah Reimer, was a Methodist-Episcopal minister
  who was pastor of a number of parishes in the Greater Boston area
  and superintendent of the city missionary society. Beverly had
  experience with many races and cultures and grew up having
  friends among all.<br>
  <br>
  Beverly was highly artistic and intelligent. She was very
  accurate in her intuitive appraisals of people, almost always
  empathic, almost never disparaging. As she said, "The same
  quality is often exhibited in a person's most liked and most
  disliked behavior." Beverly expressed her talents in painting,
  jewelry making, writing and teaching. As my research career
  progressed, we traveled together and raised two children -
  Laramie Ruth and Thomas Eldridge.<br>
  <br>
  Our marriage and my career began in the middle of the Great
  Depression. I experienced a nine-year period of impermanence,
  both financial and intellectual. I held temporary appointments at
  the C.P. Huntington Laboratories of Harvard in cancer research,
  at The Harvard School of Public Health in nutrition research, and
  at Western Reserve
  University, Department of Medicine, in electrolyte
  research.<br>
  <br>
  My career really began in 1942 when I joined the Wellcome
  Research Laboratories in Tuckahoe, New York, as head and sole
  member of the Biochemistry Department. Support was limited, but I
  was free to develop my own program of research.<br>
  <br>
  Elvira Falco was the first permanent member of my staff; <a href=
  "index.html">Gertrude Elion</a> joined in 1944, and Peter Russell
  in 1947. Additional help was added here and there, but our
  numbers were always small. Russell came from <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1957/index.html">Alex Todd's</a> laboratory
  at Cambridge University and brought not only competence in
  organic chemistry but a sense of the workings of medicinal
  chemistry as well. Elion took part in most of the projects
  dealing with purines, and Falco participated in everything from
  bacteriology and animal feeding to organic chemistry. For several
  years our group was housed in one large laboratory. Under the
  leadership of Falco, a constant flow of banter developed covering
  a wide range of subjects and degrees of seriousness. We never had
  any obstacles to interpersonal communication.<br>
  <br>
  In the mid-1940s we began a project that seemed like a digression
  at times, but one that had a notable reprise some 40 years later.
  This was the antiviral work carried out in collaboration with
  Randall L. Thompson, then at Western Reserve. It focused
  principally on vaccinia virus, and it produced some active
  compounds. It also convinced us that effective curative
  chemotherapy of viral infections would have to be applied early
  in the multiplication cycle.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947, we began to send compounds to the Sloan Kettering
  Institute to be screened for activity. Among the first few
  compounds we submitted was 2,6-diaminopurine, which proved active
  and later produced several notable remissions in acute
  leukemia.<br>
  <br>
  The association with Sloan Kettering was a major impetus for our
  growth. The director, C.P. Rhoads, offered us financial support
  to enable us to increase our search for antitumor agents. This
  rather unusual circumstance resulted from Rhoads' realization
  that our compounds were of special interest, both intrinsically
  and because they were accompanied by a package of biological
  information. The external financial help allowed us to expand to
  about 15 persons. The arrangement continued for a number of
  years. By that time Burroughs Wellcome Co. was able to furnish
  our support completely. The arrangement with Sloan Kettering was
  productive and very satisfying for the contacts it provided,
  especially with C.P. Rhoads, C.C. Stock, J.H. Burchenal, F.
  Philips, D. Hutchison and others.<br>
  <br>
  In 1948, we began to divide responsibilities with respect to
  developing purine and pyrimidine analogs. In 1947, Falco had
  synthesized <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine, and it
  was apparent at once that we had a new kind of antifolic acid in
  hand. This line was pursued vigorously by Falco and Russell, and
  within a short time yielded a very exciting line of investigation
  - the end of which is not yet in sight.<br>
  <br>
  The decision to refer the "thiation" of hypoxanthine to Elion was
  based on her developing expertise in the field of purine
  metabolism. Elion participated in much of the subsequent work
  with the compound and the agents that followed, including
  azathioprine and allopurinol.<br>
  <br>
  It was always stimulating to work with Elion. She is intelligent,
  hard working and ambitious. She became my first assistant, and as
  I was promoted she succeeded to the position just left. She
  became head of the Department of Experimental Therapy, a large
  segment of the Chemotherapy Division. There she elucidated the
  mode of action of acyclovir, a study which is described as a
  major part of her Nobel address.<br>
  <br>
  In 1967, I was offered the position of Vice President in Charge
  of Research of Burroughs Wellcome Co. It was not a post I had
  sought, but my experience had suggested that a scientist was much
  better able to support the interests of working scientists than
  were administrators who got science second hand. I owe much to
  D.W. Adamson, Wellcome's Group Research and Development Director,
  for his support and encouragement.<br>
  <br>
  By 1968, Burroughs Wellcome Co. had outgrown its facilities at
  Tuckahoe, and we were plunged into a new set of administrative
  problems by the decision to move the company to a new site. In
  the end we chose North Carolina and, acceding to my strong
  representations, selected a site in the new Research Triangle
  Park. The move provided <i>Lebensraum</i>, a good environment and
  excellent relationships with the three local universities - Duke,
  the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North
  Carolina State. The move to North Carolina was a monumental
  undertaking, but the company soon took root and today has grown
  fourfold.<br>
  <br>
  I left my position as Vice President with its heavy
  administrative duties to become Scientist Emeritus in 1976. This
  allowed more time for my own research and for travel. By 1971,
  Beverly was handicapped by strange afflictions classed as
  "collagen disease" that required close monitoring and constant
  medication. She exhibited remarkable courage and continued to be
  a joy as a companion. During our last 10 years together we
  traveled nearly 400,000 miles, much of it on lecture tours.
  Beverly's disease ended in her death in December 1985.<br>
  <br>
  For the past 20 years I have pursued my growing interests in
  philanthropy. I became Director of The Burroughs Wellcome Fund in
  1968 and its President in 1971. The Fund is a nonprofit
  foundation dedicated to the support of biomedical research. The
  Fund is supported solely by Burroughs Wellcome Co. and is a
  relatively small foundation. We have focused The Fund's resources
  on underfunded areas of medical research with competitive grants
  in fields including clinical pharmacology and innovative methods
  in drug design. It has been very rewarding to guide this
  enterprise and see it grow.<br>
  <br>
  In 1983, I founded what is now the Greater Triangle Community
  Foundation. It has been remarkably successful in fulfilling needs
  in the Triangle area. I am designated as Founder and Director for
  Life.<br>
  <br>
  I have been involved also with a number of volunteer civic
  activities. These were undertaken partly to provide for activity
  in the retirement that has not yet come. They include United Way
  (Director and Vice President), American Red Cross (Director and
  Committee Chairman), Foundation for Better Health of Durham
  (Director, President and Chairman), N.C. Board of Science and
  Technology, Carolina Consulting Scientists and Engineers
  (Director); Royal Society of Medicine Foundation (Director); The
  Life Sciences Research Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Somehow these activities have found a place in my scientific
  career with no more cliffficulty than my former administrative
  duties. Today I devote one-third of my time to philanthropy and
  two-thirds to science.<br>
  <br>
  I am vitally interested in current developments in innovative
  methods in drug design, and I look back with pride at our
  contributions to this field. Our research was untargeted, and the
  line of inquiry we had begun in the 1940s yielded new drug
  therapies for malaria (pyrimethamine), leukemia (6-mercaptopurine
  and thioguanine), gout (allopurinol), organ transplantation
  (azathioprine) and bacterial infections (cotrimoxazole
  (trimethoprimA). The new knowledge contributed by our studies
  pointed the way for investigations that led to major antiviral
  drugs for herpes infections (acyclovir) and AIDS
  (zidovudine).<br>
  <br>
  My greatest satisfaction has come from knowing that our efforts
  helped to save lives and relieve suffering. When I was baptised,
  my father held me up and dedicated my life to the service of
  mankind. I am very proud that, in some measure, I have been able
  to fulfill his hopes.</p>
