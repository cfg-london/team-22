  <h2>A Physicist's Renewed Look at Biology &#8211;<br>
  Twenty Years Later</h2>

  <p><b>Physics and Biology</b><br>
  At the very beginnings of science the striking dissimilarities
  between the behavior of living and nonliving things became
  obvious. Two tendencies can be discerned in the attempts to
  arrive at a unified view of our world. One tendency is to use the
  living organism as the model system. This tendency is exemplified
  by Aristotle. For him, the son of a physician and the keen
  observer of many forms of life, it was obvious that things
  develop according to plans. Every animal and plant is generated
  in some definite way, runs through a cycle of development in
  which it unfolds its inherent plan, and succumbs to death and
  decay. For Aristotle, this very obvious feature of the world
  which surrounds us is <i>the</i> model for understanding our
  (sublunar) world. Astronomy is the exception and offers the
  contrast of an eternal periodic system subject to neither
  generation nor decay.</p>

  <p>With the ascendance in the Renaissance of
  the science of physics in our modern sense of the word there
  seemed to develop at first a peculiar break between the living
  and the nonliving parts of the world. Life seemed to have unique
  properties quite irreducible to the world of physics and
  chemistry: 'motion generated from within', 'chemistry of a very
  distinct kind', 'replication', 'development', 'consciousness' -
  each of these aspects of life turned into elements that became
  more and more foreign to the physicist to the extent that many
  physicists even today look upon biology as something outside
  their domain.</p>

  <p>A partial reversal of this bizarre
  partition of the world into the living and the nonliving came
  with the many proofs that living forms are not, in fact,
  constant, but over the long range have evolved and that the
  family tree of this evolution can be traced. The interpretation
  of evolution in terms of natural selection, especially after the
  latter had been put into clearer perspective with the
  establishment of the science of genetics, suggested a unified
  view of life, but still left uncertain the connection of life
  with the nonliving world. The insights of chemistry and its first
  inroads into biochemistry made it clear that the break between
  the nonliving world and the living world might not be
  absolute.</p>

  <p>Molecular genetics, our latest wonder, has
  taught us to spell out the connectivity of the tree of life in
  such palpable detail that we may say in plain words, "This riddle
  of life has been solved". The ideas of information storage, of
  the replication of the stored information and of its programmed
  readout have become commonplace and have filtered down into the
  popular magazines and grade school textbooks. The marvel that the
  mechanical and chemical machinery underlying all these affairs
  can in fact be worked out is keeping a host of scientists very
  happy and very busy. With one exception I feel that there is no
  need to go into the historical aspects of these developments
  since they have been very adequately treated in the book
  "<i>Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology</i>" (ref.
  <a href="#footnote4">4</a>).</p>

  <p>The exception is due to the fact that the
  contribution to this book by N.W. Timofeeff-Ressovsky, although
  written, for technical reasons could not be included in the book.
  I hope very much that the time will not be far off when this
  omission can be rectified. At this moment I would like to
  describe briefly to what I refer. During the years 1932-1937,
  while I was assistant to Professor Lise Meimer in Berlin, a small
  group of theoretical physicists held informal private meetings,
  at first devoted to theoretical physics but soon turning to
  biology. Our principal teacher in the latter area was the
  geneticist, Timofeeff-Ressovsky, who together with the physicist,
  K.G. Zimmer, at that time was doing by far the best work in the
  area of quantitative mutation research. A few years earlier H.J.
  Muller had discovered that ionizing radiations produce mutations
  and the work of the Berlin group showed very clearly that these
  mutations were caused either by single pairs of ions or by small
  clusters of them. Discussions of these findings within our little
  group strengthened the notion that genes had a kind of stability
  similar to that of the molecules of chemistry. From the hindsight
  of our present knowledge one might consider this a trivial
  statement: what else could genes be but molecules? However, in
  the mid-thirties, this was not a trivial statement. Genes at that
  time were algebraic units of the combinatorial science of
  genetics and it was anything but clear that these units were
  molecules analyzable in terms of structural chemistry. They could
  have turned out to be submicroscopic steady state systems, or
  they could have turned out to be something unanalyzable in terms
  of chemistry, as first suggested by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a><a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> and discussed by me in a lecture
  twenty years ago [reprinted in Cairns <i>et al.</i>, 1966<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>]. It is true that our hope at that
  time to get at the chemical nature of the gene by means of
  radiation genetics never materialized. The road to success
  effectively bypassed radiation genetics. Nevertheless, radiation
  genetics has been through all these decades and is now more than
  ever a field of great importance, most recently and depressingly
  so because of the possibilities of large-scale military
  applications entailing exposure to ionizing radiations.</p>

  <p>To illustrate our state of mind at that
  time I will append to this lecture<a href="#footnote*">*</a> a
  memorandum on the "Riddle of Life", written to clarify my own
  thinking in the fall of 1937, just before leaving Germany to go
  to the United States. I found this note a few years ago among my
  papers. This memorandum would appear to be a summary of
  discussions at a little meeting in Copenhagen, arranged by Niels
  Bohr, to which Timofeeff-Ressovsky, H.J. Muller and I had
  travelled from Berlin. These discussions occurred very much under
  the impact of the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/index.html">W.M. Stanley</a> findings
  reporting the crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><b>Neurobiology</b><br>
  While molecular genetics has taught us the proper way to
  reconcile the characteristics of the living world, generation,
  development towards a goal, and decay, with the contrasting
  incorruptibility and planlessness of the physical world, it has
  not resolved our uncertainty about the proper way to relate this
  language to the notions of 'consciousness', 'mind', 'cognition',
  'logical thought', 'truth' - all these notions, too, elements of
  our 'world'.</p>

  <p>What is language? How does a child come to
  associate 'meaning' with a 'word'? The ability to form
  abstractions is undoubtedly inherent in our brain, this marvel of
  a computer. The study of the brain's connectivity, the study of
  the development of this network in the growing animal, the study
  of its function and potencies - all of these studies are aspects
  of the neurobiology of the next decade and they are very
  appealing ones to many of my colleagues and to many of the new
  generation of graduate students.</p>

  <p><b>Transducer Physiology</b><br>
  I have two reservations concerning neurobiology. The first
  reservation is that we are not yet ready to tackle it in a
  decisive way. I believe that there is a widespread
  underestimation of the things we do not know and do not
  understand about cell biology and cell-cell interaction. It
  simply is not enough to know that nerve fibers conduct, that
  synapses are inhibitory or excitatory, chemical or electrical,
  that sensory inputs can be transduced, that they result in trains
  of spikes which measure intensities of stimuli or the time
  derivatives of these intensities, that all kinds of
  accommodations occur, etc., etc. I believe that we need a much
  more basic and detailed understanding of these stimulus response
  systems, be the stimulus an outside one or a presynaptic
  signal.</p>

  <p>Sensory physiology in a broad sense
  contains hidden as its kernel an as yet totally undeveloped but
  absolutely central science: transducer physiology, the study of
  the conversion of the outside signal to its first 'interesting'
  output. I use the word 'interesting' advisedly because I wish to
  exclude from the area of study I intend to delimit, for instance,
  the primary photochemical reactions of the visual systems. I look
  upon the primary photochemical processes as something
  'uninteresting' because they concern the conversion of a light
  stimulus into what might be called an olfactory stimulus. A light
  quantum, in order to be effective as a sensory stimulant,
  naturally must, in the first instance, create within the cell a
  primary photoproduct which carries the business further. In thus
  excluding the photochemistry of the visual process from
  transducer physiology proper I am excluding the beautiful work on
  the photochemistry of rhodopsin for which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/index.html">Georg Wald</a> received the
  Nobel Prize two years ago. Transducer physiology proper comes
  after this first step, where we are dealing with devices of the
  cell unparalleled in anything the physicists have produced so far
  with respect to sensitivity, adaptability and miniaturization.
  Which biological material will turn out to be the most suitable
  for bringing us decisive insights in this field? For a number of
  years I have studied an organelle of the fungus
  <i>Phycomyces</i>, the sporangiophore, in the belief that in the
  field of transducer physiology, as in genetics, essential
  progress will require the use of a suitable microorganism. I need
  not detail this work here since it has very recently been
  critically reviewed by a group effort of those involved in this
  work<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Let me say here only
  that this organelle is exquisitely sensitive to light, to
  gravity, to stretch, and to a stimulus which we believe to be
  olfactory, and illustrate it with a few slides. Others have
  proposed and demonstrated the suitability of other systems:
  chemotaxis of bacteria<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>;
  olfaction in insects<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>;
  mechanosensitivity of motoriccilia<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>.We may hope that each of these
  systems, as well as the lipid-bilayer systems, which can be made
  to simulate most of the astounding feats of living
  membranes<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, will contribute
  to the great discoveries in cell physiology which, in my opinion,
  are prerequisite for a truly successful venture into
  neurobiology.</p>

  <p><b>Body and Soul</b><br>
  My second reservation regarding the hopes of neurobiology is more
  disturbing to me and also more nebulous; the eagerness with which
  we plunge into neurobiology overlooks an essential limitation -
  the <i>a priori</i> aspect of the concept of truth. It is well
  understood that a computer can be constructed so as to operate
  with certain axioms and formalized rules of logic, deriving in
  this way any number of 'proved declarative sentences'. We may
  call these sentences true if we have faith in the axioms and the
  rules of logic and we may be tempted to consider the logical sum
  of provable sentences as the computer's definition of truth.
  However, our friends, the logicians, have made it clear to us
  long ago that in any but the simplest languages we must
  distinguish between an 'object language' and a 'metalanguage'.
  The word 'truth', and thus all discussion of truth, must be
  excluded from the object language if the language is to be kept
  free of antinomies. There then follows the strange result that
  there must be sentences that are true but not probablea. Thus the
  notion of truth, if it is to be meaningful at all, must be
  distinct and prior to the system of provable sentences, and thus
  distinct from and prior to the computer which should be looked
  upon as the embodiment of the system of probable sentences.</p>

  <p>Thus, even if we learn to speak about
  consciousness as an emergent property of nerve nets, even if we
  learn to understand the processes that lead to abstraction,
  reasoning and language, still any such development presupposes a
  notion of truth that is prior to all these efforts and that
  cannot be conceived as an emergent property of it, an emergent
  property of a biological evolution. Our conviction of the truth
  of the sentence, "The number of prime numbers is infinite", must
  be independent of nerve nets and of evolution, if truth is to be
  a meaningful word at all.</p>

  <p><b>Artist versus Scientist</b><br>
  Twenty years ago the Connecticut Academy of the Arts and Sciences
  had a jubilee meeting and on that occasion invited a poet, a
  composer, and two scientists to 'create' and to 'perform'. It was
  a very fine affair. Hindemith, conducting a composition for
  trumpet and percussion, and Wallace Stevens, reading a set of
  poems entitled "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven", were enjoyed
  by everybody, perhaps most by the scientists. In contrast, the
  scientists' performances were attended by scientists only. To my
  feeling this irreciprocity was fitting, although perhaps not
  intended by the organizers. It is quite rare that scientists are
  asked to meet with artists and are challenged to match the
  others' creativeness. Such an experience may well humble the
  scientist. The medium in which he works does not lend itself to
  the delight of the listener's ear. When he designs his
  experiments or executes them with devoted attention to the
  details he may say to himself. "This is my composition; the
  pipette is my clarinet". And the orchestra may include
  instruments of the most subtle design. To others, however, his
  music is as silent as the music of the spheres. He may say to
  himself, "My story is an everlasting possession, not a prize
  composition which is heard and forgotten", but he fools only
  himself. The books of the great scientists are gathering dust on
  the shelves of learned libraries. And rightly so. The scientist
  addresses an infinitesimal audience of fellow composers. His
  message is not devoid of universality but its universality is
  disembodied and anonymous. While the artist's communication is
  linked forever with its original form, that of the scientist is
  modified, amplified, fused with the ideas and results of others
  and melts into the stream of knowledge and ideas which forms our
  culture. The scientist has in common with the artist only this:
  that he can find no better retreat from the world than his work
  and also no stronger link with the world than his work.</p>

  <p>The Nobel ceremonies are of a nature
  similar to the one I referred to. Here too scientists are brought
  together with a writer. Again the scientists can look back on a
  life during which their work addressed a diminutive audience
  while the writer, in the present instance <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1969/index.html">Samuel Beckett</a>, has
  had the deepest impact on men in all walks of life. We find,
  however, a strange inversion when we come to talking about our
  work. While the scientists seem elated to the point of
  garrulousness at the chance of talking about themselves and their
  work, Samuel Beckett, for good and valid reasons, finds it
  necessary to maintain a total silence with respect to himself,
  his work, and his critics. Even though I was more thrilled by the
  award of the Nobel Prize to him than about the award to me and
  momentarily looked forward with intense anticipation to hearing
  his lecture, I now realize that he is acting in accordance with
  the rules laid down by the old witch at the end of a marionette
  play entitled "The Revenge of Truth"<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>"The truth, my children, is that we are all
  of us acting in a marionette comedy. What is more important than
  anything else in a marionette comedy is keeping the ideas of the
  author clear. This is the real happiness in life and now that I
  have at last come into a marionette play, I will never go out of
  it again. But you, my fellow actors, keep the ideas of the author
  clear. Aye, drive them to the utmost consequences."</p>

  <p><a name="appendix" id=
  "appendix"></a><b>Appendix</b></p>

  <p><i>Preliminary write-up on the topic
  "Riddle of Life" (Berlin, August 1937)</i></p>

  <p>We inquire into the relevance of the recent
  results of virus research for a general assessment of the
  phenomena peculiar to life.</p>

  <p>These recent results all agree in showing a
  remarkable uniformity in the behavior of individuals belonging to
  one species of virus in preparations employing physical or
  chemical treatments mild enough not to impair infective
  specificity. Such a collection of individuals migrates with
  uniform velocity in the electrophoresis apparatus. It
  crystallizes uniformly from solutions such that the specific
  infectivity is not altered by recrystallization, not even under
  conditions of extremely fractionated recrystallization.
  Elementary analysis gives reproducible results, such as might be
  expected for proteins, with perhaps the peculiarity that the
  phosphorus and sulfur contents appear to be abnormally small.</p>

  <p>These results force us to the view that the
  viruses are things whose atomic constitution is as well defined
  as that of the large molecules of organic chemistry. True, with
  these latter we also cannot speak of unique spatial
  configurations, since most of the chemical bonds involve free
  rotation around the bond. We cannot even decide unambiguously
  which atoms do or do not belong to the molecule, since the degree
  of hydration and of dissociation depends not only on external
  conditions, but even when these are fixed, fluctuates
  statistically from molecule to molecule. Nevertheless, there can
  be no doubt that such large molecules constitute a legitimate
  generalization of the standard concept of the chemical molecule.
  The similarity between virus and molecule is particularly
  apparent from the fact that virus crystals can be stored
  indefinitely without losing either their physico-chemical or
  infectious properties.</p>

  <p>Therefore we will view viruses as
  molecules.</p>

  <p>If we now turn to that property of a virus
  which defines it as a living organism, namely, its ability to
  multiply within living plants, then we will ask ourselves first
  whether this accomplishment is that of the host, as a living
  organism, or whether the host is merely the provider and
  protector of the virus, offering it suitable nutrients under
  suitable physical and chemical conditions. In other words, we are
  asking whether we should view the injection of a virus as a
  stimulus which modifies the metabolism of the host in such a way
  as to produce the foreign virus protein instead of its own normal
  protein, or whether we should view the replication as an
  essentially autonomous accomplishment of the virus and the host
  as a nutrient medium which might be replaced by a suitably
  offered synthetic medium.</p>

  <p>Now it appears to me, that upon close
  analysis the first view can be completely excluded. If we
  consider that the replication of the virus requires the accurate
  synthesis of an enormously complicated molecule which is unknown
  to the host, though not as to general type, yet in all the
  details of its pattern and therefore of the synthetic steps
  involved, and if we consider further what extraordinary
  production an organism puts on to perform in an orderly way the
  most minute oxidation or synthesis in all those cases that do not
  involve the copying of a particular pattern - setting aside
  serology, which is a thing by itself - then it seems impossible
  to assume that the enzyme-system for the host could be modified
  in such a far-reaching way by the injection of a virus. There can
  be no doubt that the replication of a virus must take place with
  the most direct participation of the original pattern and even
  without the participation of any enzymes specifically produced
  for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Therefore we will look on virus replication
  as an autonomous accomplishment of the virus, for the general
  discussion of which we can ignore the host.</p>

  <p>We next ask whether we should view virus
  replication as a particularly pure case of replication or whether
  it is, from the point of view of genetics, a complex phenomenon.
  Here we must first point out that with higher animals and plants
  which reproduce bisexually replication is certainly a very
  complex phenomenon. This has been shown in a thousand details by
  genetics, based on Mendel's laws and on modern cytology, and must
  be so, in order to arrive at any kind of order for the infinitely
  varied details of inheritance. Specifically, the close
  cytological analysis of the details of meiosis (reduction
  division) has shown that it is a specialization of the simpler
  mitotic division. It can easily be shown that the teleological
  point of this specialization lies in the possibility of trying
  out new hereditary factors in ever-new combinations with genes
  already present, and thus to increase enormously the diversity of
  the genotypes present at any one time, in spite of low mutation
  rates.</p>

  <p>However, even the simpler mitotic cell
  division cannot be viewed as a pure case. If we look first at
  somatic divisions of higher animals and plants, then we find here
  that an originally simple process has been modified in the most
  various ways to adapt it to diverse purposes of form and
  function, such that one cannot speak of an undifferentiated
  replication. The ability to differentiate is certainly a highly
  important step in the transition from the protists to the
  multicellular organisms, but it can probably be related in a
  natural way to the general property of protists that they can
  adapt themselves to their environment and change phenotypically
  without changing genotypically. This phenotypic variability
  implies that with simple algae like Chlorella we can speak of
  simple replication only so long as the physical conditions are
  kept constant. If they are not kept constant, then, strictly
  speaking, we can only talk of a replication of the genomes which
  are embedded in a more or less well-nourished, more or less
  mistreated, specific protoplasma, and which, in extreme cases,
  may even replicate without cell division.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt, further, that the
  replication of the genome in its turn is a highly complex affair,
  susceptible to perturbation in its details without impairing the
  replication of pieces of chromosomes or of genes. Certainly the
  crucial element in cell replication lies in the coordination of
  the replication of a whole set of genes with the division of the
  cell. With equal certainty this coordination is not a primitive
  phenomenon. Rather, it requires that particular modification of a
  simple replication system which accomplishes constancy of supply
  of its own nutrient. By this modification it initiates the chain
  of development which until now has been subsumed under the title
  'life'.</p>

  <p>In view of what has been said, we want to
  look upon the replication of viruses as a particular form of a
  primitive replication of genes, the segregation of which from the
  nourishment supplied by the host should in principle be possible.
  In this sense, one should view replication not as complementary
  to atomic physics but as a particular trick of organic
  chemistry.</p>

  <p>Such a view would mean a great
  simplification of the question of the origin of the many highly
  complicated and specific molecules found in every organism in
  varying quantities and indispensable for carrying out its most
  elementary metabolism. One would assume that these, too, can
  replicate autonomously and that their replication is tied only
  loosely to the replication of the cell. It is clear that such a
  view in connection with the usual arguments of the theory of
  natural selection would let us understand the enormous variety
  and complexity of these molecules, which from a purely chemical
  point of view appears so exaggerated.</p>
