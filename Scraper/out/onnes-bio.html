  <h1>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="onnes.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</b> was born
  on September 21, 1853, at Groningen, The Netherlands. His father,
  Harm Kamerlingh Onnes, was the owner of a brickworks near
  Groningen; his mother was Anna Gerdina Coers of Arnhem, the
  daughter of an architect.<br>
  <br>
  After spending the allotted time at the "Hoogere Burgerschool" in
  his native town (secondary school without classical languages),
  the director of which was the later Professor of Chemistry at
  Leyden J.M. van Bemmelen, he received supplementary teaching in
  Greek and Latin. In 1870 he entered the University of Groningen,
  obtained his "candidaats" degree (approx. B.Sc.) the following
  year, and then went to Heidelberg as a student of Bunsen and
  Kirchhoff from October 1871 until April 1873. Thereafter he
  returned to Groningen, where he passed his "doctoraal"
  examination (approx. M.Sc.) in 1878 and obtained the doctor's
  degree in 1879 with a remarkable thesis <i>Nieuwe bewijzen voor
  de aswenteling der aarde</i> (New proofs of the rotation of the
  earth).<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile in 1878 he had become assistant at the Polytechnicum at
  Delft, working under Bosscha, in whose place he also lectured in
  1881 and 1882, the year in which he was appointed Professor of
  Experimental Physics and Meteorology at Leyden
  University, in succession to P.L. Rijke.<br>
  <br>
  Kamerlingh Onnes' talents for solving scientific problems was
  already apparent in 1871, when at the age of 18 he was awarded a
  Gold Medal for a competition sponsored by the Natural Sciences
  Faculty of the University of Utrecht, followed the next year by a
  Silver Medal for a similar event at the University of Groningen.
  When working with Kirchhoff he also won the "Seminarpreis",
  entitling him to occupy one of the two existing assistantships
  under Kirchhoff.<br>
  <br>
  In his doctor's thesis theoretical as well as experimental proof
  was given that Foucault's well-known pendulum experiment should
  be considered as a special case of a large group of phenomena
  which in a much simpler fashion can be used to prove the
  rotational movement of the earth. In 1881 he published a paper
  <i>Algemeene theorie der vloeistoffen</i> (General theory of
  liquids), which dealt with the kinetic theory of the liquid
  state, approaching Van der Waals' law of corresponding states
  from a mechanistic point of view. This work can be considered as
  the beginning of his life-long investigations into the properties
  of matter at low temperatures. In his inaugural address <i>De
  beteekenis van het quantitatief onderzoek in de natnurkunde</i>
  (The importance of quantitative research in physics) he arrived
  at his well-known motto "Door meten tot weten" (Knowledge through
  measurement), an appreciation of the value of measurements which
  concerned him throughout his scientific career.<br>
  <br>
  After his appointment to the Physics Chair at Leyden, Kamerlingh
  Onnes reorganized the Physical Laboratory (now known as the
  Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory) in a way to suit
  his own programme. His researches were mainly based on the
  theories of his two great compatriots <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/index.html">J.D. van der Waals</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">H.A. Lorentz</a>. In
  particular he had in mind the establishment of a cryogenic
  laboratory which would enable him to verify Van der Waals' law of
  corresponding states over a large range of temperatures. His
  efforts to reach extremely low temperatures culminated in the
  liquefaction of helium in 1908. Bringing the temperature of the
  helium down to 0,9&deg;K, he reached the nearest approach to
  absolute zero then achieved, thus justifying the saying that the
  coldest spot on earth was situated at Leyden. It was on account
  of these low-temperature studies that he was awarded the Nobel
  Prize. Later, his pupils W.H. Keesom and W.J. de Haas ( Lorentz'
  son-in-law) conducted experiments in the same laboratory which
  led them still closer to absolute zero.<br>
  <br>
  Other investigations in his laboratory which gradually gained in
  importance and international fame, included thermodynamics, the
  radioactivity law, and observations on optical, magnetic and
  electrical phenomena, such as the study of fluorescence and
  phosphorescence, the magnetic rotation of the polarization plane,
  absorption spectra of crystals in the magnetic field; also the
  Hall effect, dielectric constants, and especially the resistance
  of metals. A momentous discovery (1911) was that of the
  <i>superconductivity</i> of pure metals such as mercury, tin and
  lead at very low temperatures, and following from this the
  observation of <i>persisting currents.</i><br>
  <br>
  The results of Kamerlingh Onnes' investigations were published in
  the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences of
  Amsterdam</i> and also in the <i>Communications from the Physical
  Laboratory at Leyden</i>. Many foreign scientists came to Leyden
  to work in his laboratory for shorter or longer periods. The
  laboratory gained additional fame throughout the world through
  the training school for instrument-makers and glass-blowers
  housed in it, founded by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1901.<br>
  <br>
  At the early age of 30, Kamerlingh Onnes was appointed a member
  of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam. He was one of the
  founders of the Association (now Institut) International du
  Froid. He was a Commander in the Order of the Netherlands Lion,
  the Order of Orange-Nassau of the Netherlands, the Order of St.
  Olaf of Norway, and the Order of Polonia Restituta of Poland. He
  held an honorary doctorate of the University of Berlin, and was
  awarded the Matteucci Medal, the Rumford Medal, the Baumgarten
  Preis and the Franklin Medal. He was Member of the Society of
  Friends of Science in Moscow, and of the Academies of Sciences in
  Copenhagen, Uppsala, Turin, Vienna, G&ouml;ttingen and Halle;
  Foreign Associate of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences of Paris;
  Foreign Member of the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome and the Royal
  Society of London; and Honorary Member of the Physical Society of
  Stockholm, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Helv&eacute;tique des Sciences
  Naturelles, the Royal Institution of London, the Sociedad
  Espa&ntilde;ola da F&iacute;sica y Qumica of Madrid, and the Franklin
  Institute of Philadelphia.<br>
  <br>
  Outside his scientific work, Kamerlingh Onnes' favourite
  recreations were his family life and helpfulness to those who
  needed it. Although his work was his hobby, he was far from being
  a pompous scholar. A man of great personal charm and
  philanthropic humanity, he was very active during and after the
  First World War in smoothing out political differences between
  scientists and in succouring starving children in countries
  suffering from food shortage. In 1887 he married Maria Adriana
  Wilhelmina Elisabeth Bijleveld, who was a great help to him in
  these activities and who created a home widely known for its
  hospitality. They had one son, Albert, who became a high-ranking
  civil servant at The Hague.<br>
  <br>
  Kamerlingh Onnes' health had always been somewhat delicate, and,
  after a short illness, he died at Leyden on February 21,
  1926.</p>
