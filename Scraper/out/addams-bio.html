  <h1>Jane Addams - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="addams.jpg" class="bio-img">(Laura)
  <b>Jane Addams</b> (September 6, 1860-May 21, 1935) won worldwide
  recognition in the first third of the twentieth century as a
  pioneer social worker in America, as a feminist, and as an
  internationalist.<br>
  <br>
  She was born in Cedarville, Illinois, the eighth of nine
  children. Her father was a prosperous miller and local political
  leader who served for sixteen years as a state senator and fought
  as an officer in the Civil War; he was a friend of Abraham
  Lincoln whose letters to him began &laquo;My Dear Double D-'ed
  Addams&raquo;. Because of a congenital spinal defect, Jane was not physically
  vigorous when young nor truly robust even later in life, but her spinal difficulty
  was remedied by surgery.<br>
  <br>
  In 1881 Jane Addams was graduated from the Rockford Female
  Seminary, the valedictorian of a class of seventeen, but was
  granted the bachelor's degree only after the school became
  accredited the next year as Rockford College for Women. In the
  course of the next six years she began the study of medicine but
  left it because of poor health, was hospitalized intermittently,
  traveled and studied in Europe for twenty-one months, and then
  spent almost two years in reading and writing and in considering
  what her future objectives should be. At the age of twenty-seven,
  during a second tour to Europe with her friend Ellen G. Starr,
  she visited a settlement house, Toynbee Hall, in London's East
  End. This visit helped to finalize the idea then current in her
  mind, that of opening a similar house in an underprivileged area
  of Chicago. In 1889 she and Miss Starr leased a large home built
  by Charles Hull at the corner of Halsted and Polk Streets. The
  two friends moved in, their purpose, as expressed later, being
  &laquo;to provide a center for a higher civic and social life; to
  institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises
  and to investigate and improve the conditions in the industrial
  districts of Chicago&raquo;<sup><a href=
  "#not_1">1</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  Miss Addams and Miss Starr made speeches about the needs of the
  neighborhood, raised money, convinced young women of well-to-do
  families to help, took care of children, nursed the sick,
  listened to outpourings from troubled people. By its second year
  of existence, Hull-House was host to two thousand people
  every week. There were kindergarten classes in the morning, club
  meetings for older children in the afternoon, and for adults in
  the evening more clubs or courses in what became virtually a
  night school. The first facility added to Hull-House was an art
  gallery, the second a public kitchen; then came a coffee house, a
  gymnasium, a swimming pool, a cooperative boarding club for
  girls, a book bindery, an art studio, a music school, a drama
  group, a circulating library, an employment bureau, a labor
  museum.<br>
  <br>
  As her reputation grew, Miss Addams was drawn into larger fields
  of civic responsibility. In 1905 she was appointed to Chicago's
  Board of Education and subsequently made chairman of the School
  Management Committee; in 1908 she participated in the founding of
  the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy and in the next
  year became the first woman president of the National Conference
  of Charities and Corrections. In her own area of Chicago she led
  investigations on midwifery, narcotics consumption, milk
  supplies, and sanitary conditions, even going so far as to accept
  the official post of garbage inspector of the Nineteenth Ward, at
  an annual salary of a thousand dollars. In 1910 she received the
  first honorary degree ever awarded to a woman by Yale University.<br>
  <br>
  Jane Addams was an ardent feminist
  by philosophy. In those days before women's suffrage she believed
  that women should make their voices heard in legislation and
  therefore should have the right to vote, but more
  comprehensively, she thought that women should generate
  aspirations and search out opportunities to realize them.<br>
  <br>
  For her own aspiration to rid the world of war, Jane Addams
  created opportunities or seized those offered to her to advance
  the cause. In 1906 she gave a course of lectures at the
  University of Wisconsin summer session which she published the
  next year as a book, <i>Newer Ideals of Peace</i>. She spoke for
  peace in 1913 at a ceremony commemorating the building of the
  Peace Palace at The Hague and in the next two years, as a
  lecturer sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, spoke against America's
  entry into the First World War. In January, 1915, she accepted
  the chairmanship of the Women's Peace Party, an American
  organization, and four months later the presidency of the
  International Congress of Women convened at The Hague largely
  upon the initiative of Dr. Aletta Jacobs, a Dutch suffragist
  leader of many and varied talents. When this congress later
  founded the organization called the Women's International
  League for Peace and Freedom, Jane Addams served as president
  until 1929, as presiding officer of its six international
  conferences in those years, and as honorary president for the
  remainder of her life.<br>
  <br>
  Publicly opposed to America's entry into the war, Miss Addams was
  attacked in the press and expelled from the Daughters of the
  American Revolution, but she found an outlet for her humanitarian
  impulses as an assistant to Herbert Hoover in providing relief supplies of food
  to the women and children of the enemy nations, the story of
  which she told in her book <i>Peace and Bread in Time of War</i>
  (1922).<br>
  <br>
  After sustaining a heart attack in 1926, Miss Addams never fully
  regained her health. Indeed, she was being admitted to a
  Baltimore hospital on the very day, December 10, 1931, that the
  Nobel Peace Prize was being awarded to her in Oslo. She died in
  1935 three days after an operation revealed unsuspected cancer.
  The funeral service was held in the courtyard of Hull-House.</p>
