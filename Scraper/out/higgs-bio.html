 <h1>Peter Higgs - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="higgs.jpg" alt="Peter Higgs" class="bio-img">Peter Higgs was born on 29 May 1929 in the Elswick district of Newcastle 
upon Tyne, UK. He graduated with First Class Honours in Physics from 
King's College, University of London, in 1950. A year later, he was awarded an 
MSc and started research, initially under the supervision of Charles Coulson 
and, subsequently, Christopher Longuet-Higgins. In 1954, he was awarded a 
PhD for a thesis entitled ‘Some Problems in the Theory of Molecular Vibrations', 
work which signalled the start of his life-long interest in the application of the 
ideas of symmetry to physical systems.
</p>
<p>In 1954, Peter Higgs moved to the University of Edinburgh for his second 
year as a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Senior Student, and remained for a further year as a Senior Research Fellow. He returned to London 
in 1956 to take up an ICI Research Fellowship, spending a year at University 
College and a little over a year at Imperial College, before taking up an appointment as Temporary Lecturer in Mathematics at University College. In October 
1960 Peter Higgs returned to Edinburgh, taking up a lectureship in Mathematical Physics at the Tait Institute. He was promoted to Reader in 1970, became a 
Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1974 and was promoted to a Personal Chair of Theoretical Physics in 1980. He was elected Fellow of the Royal 
Society in 1983 and Fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1991. He retired in 1996, 
becoming Professor Emeritus at the University of Edinburgh. He was awarded 
Fellowship of the University of Swansea in 2008, Honorary Membership of the 
Saltire Society and Fellowships of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts and the 
Science Museum London in 2013.

<p>Peter Higgs' contribution to physics has been recognised by numerous academic honours: the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society (1981, shared with Tom 
Kibble), the Rutherford Medal of the Institute of Physics (1984, also shared with 
Tom Kibble), the Saltire Society & Royal Bank of Scotland Scottish Science 
Award (1990), the Royal Society of Edinburgh James Scott Prize Lectureship 
(1993), the Paul Dirac Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics (1997), and 
the High Energy and Particle Physics Prize of the European Physical Society 
(1997, shared with Robert Brout and François Englert), the Royal Medal of the 
Royal Society of Edinburgh (2000), the Wolf Prize in Physics (2004, shared with 
Robert Brout and François Englert), the Stockholm Academy of Sciences Oskar 
Klein Memorial Lecture and Medal (2009) and the American Physical Society 
J. J. Sakurai Prize (2010), shared with Robert Brout, François Englert, Gerry 
Guralnik, Carl Hagen and Tom Kibble. He received a unique personal Higgs 
medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 October 2012 and the 2013 
Nonino Prize ‘Man of Our Time'. He shared the award of the 2013 Edinburgh International Science Festival Edinburgh Medal with CERN and the 2013 Prince 
of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research with François Englert 
and CERN.</p>
<p>He has received honorary degrees from the Universities of Bristol (1997), 
Edinburgh (1998), Glasgow (2002), King's College London (2009), University 
College London (2010), Cambridge (2012), Heriot-Watt (2012), Manchester, 
(2013), Durham (2013), La Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avantzi di 
Trieste (2013), St. Andrews (2014) and the Université Libre de Bruxelles (2014).</p>
<p>In 2011 he was awarded the Edinburgh Award for his outstanding contribution to the city. In the 2013 New Year Honours List he was appointed a Companion of Honour. In 2013 he was granted the Freedom of the City of Bristol. In 
2014 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle, his birthplace and 
the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh.</p>
