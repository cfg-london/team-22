  <h1>Alan Heeger - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="heeger.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on a bitter cold morning
  (20&ordm; F below zero) in Sioux City (Iowa) on January 22, 1936.
  I was told that when my father went out in the cold that morning
  to go to the hospital to visit his wife and newborn first son,
  his car would not start. Despite advice to the contrary, he
  walked to the hospital; his ears were frostbitten on the way.</p>

  <p>The Heeger family came to Sioux City (Iowa)
  from Russia as Jewish immigrants in 1904 when my father was a
  small boy (age 4). My mother was born in Omaha (Nebraska); she
  was a first generation child of Jewish immigrants. My mother and
  father were married in the midst of the Great Depression.</p>

  <p>My early years were spent in Akron (Iowa),
  a small midwestern town of 1000 people, approximately 35 miles
  from Sioux City. I went to elementary school in Akron. My
  brother, Gerald, was born in Akron. My father was the manager
  and, subsequently the owner, of a general store that served the
  local farming community. I have a strong memory of the day I was
  told that my father had a weak heart and that he had to go to the
  hospital. He died when I was nine years old on the same day that
  Franklin Roosevelt died; it was his 45th birthday.</p>

  <p>After my father's death, we moved to Omaha,
  so my mother could be closer to her family. She raised us as a
  single parent in a house that we shared with her sister and her
  sister's children.</p>

  <p>One of my earliest memories (long before my
  father died), is of my mother telling me of the importance of
  getting a university education. When she graduated from high
  school, she received a scholarship to go on to university but
  went to work instead; she was needed by her parents to help
  support the family. It was always clear to me that it was my
  responsibility to go to university; prior to my generation no one
  on either side of my family had an education that went beyond
  high school. I and my brother were the first in our family to
  receive the PhD degree.</p>

  <p>My high school years were fun and
  frustrating, typical of the teen years. The most important
  accomplishment was meeting my wife, Ruth. I have loved her for
  nearly fifty years, and she remains my best friend.</p>

  <p>I was always a good student, but I do not
  remember science being especially easy. On the contrary, I recall
  that in high school, physics was somewhat mysterious. I was
  impatient to get on with my education, to get on with more
  important things, and therefore completed high school one year
  early.</p>

  <p>My undergraduate years at the University of
  Nebraska were a special time in my life; the combination of
  partying and intellectual awakening that is what the
  undergraduate years are supposed to be. I went to the University
  with the goal of becoming an engineer; I had no concept that one
  could pursue science as a career. After one semester, I was
  convinced that engineering was not for me, and I completed my
  undergraduate studies with a dual major in Physics and
  Mathematics. The highlight was a course (in my senior year) in
  Modern Physics taught by Theodore Jorgensen. Professor Jorgensen
  introduced me to quantum physics and twentieth century science. I
  was honored by the University of Nebraska in 1998 with a Doctor
  of Science (h.c.) and had the pleasure of giving a Physics
  colloquium at that time. Ted Jorgensen came to the lecture; he
  was 92 and working hard on revising his book on the Physics of
  Golf.</p>

  <p>Again, I was impatient to get on with "real
  physics". I started the path toward my PhD in Physics at UC Berkeley while
  working part time for Lockheed Space and Missile Division in Palo
  Alto, CA. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I would wake up early
  and drive the Bayshore Freeway to Berkeley to attend classes.
  After sitting in class all morning, I had lunch and then got back
  on the freeway to return to work in Palo Alto. Naturally, after
  such a morning I fell asleep at the wheel almost every trip.
  Thus, it was not a terribly difficult decision; Ruth and I moved
  into student housing at Berkeley, and I started research on a
  full time basis.</p>

  <p>When I started at Berkeley, my goal was to
  do a theoretical thesis under Charles Kittel. Thus, when the
  decision was made to go for my degree on a full-time basis, I
  went first to Kittel and asked if I could work for him. Kittel
  had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he met Landau, and
  he told me that Landau required that a prospective student had to
  pass a rigorous examination before he would agree to take the
  student into his research group. Kittel indicated that I should
  take the PhD qualifier and come back to him after I had done so.
  When I came back to discuss my future with him, Kittel told me
  that he would take me on. He said, however, that although I could
  do a thesis under his direction in solid state theory, he did not
  think I would be a first-rate theorist. He recommended instead
  that I consider working with someone who does experimental work
  in close interaction with theory. This was perhaps the best
  advice that anyone ever gave me - and I followed his advice. I
  joined the research group of Alan Portis.</p>

  <p>I remember with clarity my first day in the
  laboratory. I was doing "original research"; at last I was
  involved with real physics. After only one day of carrying out
  magnetic measurements on an insulating antiferromagnet,
  KMnF<sub>3</sub>, I wrote a theory of antiferroelectric
  antiferromagnets and presented it to Portis with great pride. He
  was patient with me then and again a few days later when I
  apologized and told him my theory was nonsense. Through my
  interactions with Portis (I recall spending many hours talking
  with him in his office), I learned how to think about physics;
  more important, I began to learn about good taste in the choice
  of problems.</p>

  <p>After completing my degree, I went directly
  to join the Physics Department at the University of
  Pennsylvania where I remained for over twenty years. It was
  an exciting period for condensed matter physics at PENN. Eli
  Burstein had made major progress in building the solid state
  group; he convinced Robert Schrieffer to come to Penn, and he and
  Schrieffer attracted an outstanding group of young people.
  Beginning with my experimental studies of magnetic impurities in
  metals and the Kondo Effect, I learned many-body physics from
  Schrieffer.</p>

  <p>Anthony Garito introduced me to
  tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ); I brought him into my research
  group for post-doctoral research. We worked together from 1970
  through 1975 on the metal-physics of TTF-TCNQ and on the
  discovery of the Peierls instability in quasi-one-dimensional
  <font face="Symbol">p</font>-stacked molecular crystals. Although
  the direct observation of the incommensurate Peierls distortion
  with wave number q = 2k<sub>F</sub> proved that we were on the
  right track, this was a time of controversy and stress.</p>

  <p>In 1975, the first papers on the novel
  metallic polymer, poly(sulfur-nitride), (SN)<sub>x</sub> appeared
  in the literature. I was intrigued by this unusual quasi-1d metal
  and wanted to get into the game. I learned that Alan MacDiarmid,
  a professor in the Chemistry Department at PENN, had a background
  in sulfurnitride chemistry, and I made an appointment to see him
  with the goal of convincing him to collaborate with me and to
  synthesize (SN)<sub>x</sub>. I recall that we met late in the
  afternoon of an autumn day. After quite a long discussion during
  which I made little progress toward my goal, I realized that
  while I was saying " (SN)<sub>x</sub>", he was hearing "
  (Sn)<sub>x</sub>". Needless to say, he was not impressed with my
  enthusiasm for (Sn)<sub>x</sub> being a metal; any chemist knew
  that tin was a metal!</p>

  <p>Once MacDiarmid and I got past this initial
  language problem, a true collaboration began. We realized that it
  was a long reach across the Chemistry-Physics boundary, and we
  were determined to learn from one another. Although we
  collaborated during the week, we typically met on Saturday
  mornings with no agenda; just to try to learn from one another.
  At that time, I was fascinated with the metal-insulator
  transition as envisioned by Mott. I recall that I tried to convey
  my interest in this problem to MacDiarmid by asking him to
  consider a linear chain of hydrogen atoms as a model system. He
  balked right away; a linear chain of hydrogen atoms did not
  exist. After discussion, we focused in on the abstraction of a
  chain of <font face="Symbol">p</font>-bonded -CH- units as an
  example of a system that would have one unpaired electron per
  repeat unit. Shortly thereafter, MacDiarmid went to Japan for a
  visit. MacDiarmid is a very visual person. He loved the golden
  color of films and crystals of (SN)<sub>x</sub>, and he showed
  samples and photos of this golden material during his lectures.
  After one such lecture, a Japanese scientist came up to him
  during the coffee break and told MacDiarmid that he, too, had
  some shiny films. Thus, MacDiarmid was introduced to Hideki
  Shirakawa and to polyacteylene.</p>

  <p>When MacDiarmid returned from Japan, he
  told me with great excitement about (CH)<sub>x</sub>. With the
  help of a small addition to an ONR grant from the Program
  Officer, Kenneth Wynne, we were able to bring Hideki Shirakawa to
  PENN as a Visiting Scientist. The initial discovery of the
  remarkable increase in electrical conductivity of
  (CH)<sub>x</sub> and the identification of that increase as
  resulting from a transition from insulator (semiconductor) to
  metal followed in a very short time.</p>

  <p>The soliton in polyacetylene was born with
  the observation of an electron spin resonance (esr) signal in the
  pure material where there should not have been one. Building on
  the earlier work by Michael Rice on phase-solitons, I realized
  that if one drew a domain wall between the two identical forms
  with opposite bond alternation, one would have an unpaired spin
  and postulated that the origin of the esr signal might be a
  bond-alternation domain wall. Curt Fincher, then a graduate
  student in my research group, had recently discovered the
  doping-enhanced infrared vibrational modes which became a
  signature of the doping. In a luncheon seminar before the solid
  state group at PENN, I argued that these doping-induced IR modes
  might arise from the enhanced electric field at IR frequencies
  that would result if a charged bond-alternation domain wall were
  to move back and forth driven by the external field of the
  incident IR radiation. Schrieffer listened closely and made some
  comments about "kinks" at the end of my talk. A few days later he
  showed me how the mid-gap state would arise from the formation of
  such a bond-alternation domain wall and how that mid-gap state
  would have a reversed spin/charge relation relative to that of
  fermions. Wu-Pei Su then worked this out in detail, and the SSH
  papers were written.</p>

  <p>I was drawn to Santa Barbara by the
  promise of a singular opportunity to build a special Physics
  Department, by the promise of continuing my close collaboration
  with Bob Schrieffer, by the opportunity to work with Fred Wudl,
  and - frankly - by the lure of this beautiful place. Wudl, then a
  synthetic chemist at Bell Laboratories, and I were recruited to
  UC Santa Barbara together and enjoyed a close and productive
  collaboration over a period of 15 years.</p>

  <p>Daniel Moses and I have worked together for
  twenty years, initially at PENN and then at UCSB. Dan dragged me
  into ultra-fast pulsed laser spectroscopy and into fast-transient
  photoconductivity as probes of the excited states of
  semiconducting polymers. Dan continues in his efforts to resolve
  the remaining fundamental scientific issues in the field of
  semiconducting polymers with creativity and with
  determination.</p>

  <p>In 1986, in the process of building the
  Macromolecular division of our newly formed Materials Department,
  we convinced Paul Smith to leave DuPont Central Research and come
  to UCSB. Whereas I and Alan MacDiarmid and most of the early
  players in the conducting polymer field were amateurs in the
  field of polymer science, Paul was a professional. He quickly
  hammered into my head the importance of making conducting
  polymers processible, and he had the annoying habit of asking me
  embarrassing questions such as "What is the intrinsic electrical
  conductivity of a conducting polymer?". Anything I know about the
  processing and mechanical properties of polymers, I learned from
  Paul.</p>

  <p>In 1990, Paul Smith and I decided that
  conducting polymers as materials had developed to a level of
  maturity that commercial products were possible. With this as a
  goal, we founded UNLAX Corporation. Fortunately, on a trip to
  China in 1986, I met Yong Cao and immediately realized that he
  was a remarkable scientist. I was able to bring him to Santa
  Barbara in 1987. Initially, he worked with Paul and with me at
  UCSB. When we founded UNIAX, Yong Cao was the first employee. His
  creativity, determination and scientific strength were critical
  to our scientific progress and to the success of UNIAX. During
  the 1990's, UNIAX played a leading role in developing the science
  and technology of conducting polymers with many important
  contributions.</p>

  <p>The twenty-five years since the discovery
  of conducting polymers have taken me on a great ride; always on
  the frontier and always with the challenge of exciting
  discoveries. In 1990, the discovery of polymer LEDs by Richard
  Friend and colleagues at Cambridge gave the field a boost with the promise of
  important technology and with the excitement of an entirely new
  set of phenomena to study. In 1992, while doing post-doctoral
  research in my group at UCSB, Serdar Saricifici discovered
  ultrafast photo-induced electron transfer from semiconducting
  polymers to acceptors such as C<sub>60</sub>. This discovery
  resulted in the development of polymer photodetectors and
  photovoltaic cells that offer promise for use in a variety of
  applications. In 1996, the discovery of amplified spontaneous
  emission and lasing (simultaneously by our group, by Richard
  Friend's group at Cambridge and by Valy Vardeny's group at Utah)
  opened yet another potentially important direction. And it goes
  on.</p>

  <p>None of this could have been accomplished
  without the hard work, dedication and creativity of the students
  and post-docs with whom I have had the pleasure of working over
  the past forty years. I thank them all.</p>

  <p>I have enjoyed the life of a scientist
  while sharing both the exciting days and the disappointments with
  Ruth. She has filled my life with love and surrounded me with
  beauty. She has also gallantly put up with my eccentricities for
  more than forty years. We have succeeded in starting an academic
  dynasty; our two sons, Peter and David are both academics. Peter
  is a professor and medical doctor who is doing research on
  immunology at Case Western Reserve University. David is a
  professor and neuroscientist at Stanford
  University where he studies human vision. I have had the
  great pleasure of collaborating and publishing articles (as
  co-author) with both of my sons. Now I am looking forward to the
  emergence of my four grandchildren, Brett, Jordan, Julia and
  Alice, as the next generation of the Heeger family. Of all the
  congratulations that I have received as a result of the Nobel
  Prize, I took greatest pleasure from their pride in their
  grandfather.</p>
