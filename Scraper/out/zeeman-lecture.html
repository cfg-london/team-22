  <h2>Light Radiation in a Magnetic Field</h2>

  <p>As Professor Lorentz told you last
  December, immediately after hearing of the great and very
  honourable distinction awarded to us, we set to work to see how
  best to co-ordinate our two lectures. To my great regret I was
  unable to be present here for Professor Lorentz's lecture, but he
  was able to report to you on present electron theory from his
  viewpoint, only briefly touching on the experimental
  investigations which have occupied me in recent years. I hope
  that you will allow me therefore to emphasize these experimental
  investigations. Two fields of physics, light and magnetism, are
  combined in the subject of today's lecture, whose history dates
  only from the days of Michael Faraday. The wonderful discovery of
  the connection between light and magnetism, which he made in
  1845, was the reward for an investigation carried out with
  indefatigable patience and tenacity. Today we call this
  connection the magnetic rotation of the polarization plane.
  Faraday succeeded in showing that the plane in which light
  oscillations take place, is rotated as soon as light passes
  through special magnetizable bodies along the lines of force.
  Faraday himself called his discovery the magnetization of light
  and the illumination of magnetic lines of force. His contempories
  did not understand this name, which perhaps corresponded more to
  what he was searching for than to what he found. Throughout his
  life his hopes, desires and yearnings led him to make repeated
  investigations into the connection between light, magnetism, and
  electricity.</p>

  <p>The last experiment recorded in Faraday's
  laboratory notebook and ostensibly the last in his life, gives an
  indication of the extent to which his spirit was still occupied
  with the boundary region of possible phenomena.</p>

  <p>It was on March 12, 1862, in the laboratory
  of the Royal Institution that Faraday carried out this
  experiment. The notes in his notebook, although not quite clear,
  leave no doubt that he was attempting to demonstrate by means of
  a spectroscope that magnetism has a direct effect on a light
  source. The result was however absolutely negative, and Faraday
  writes in his notebook "not the slightest effect demonstrable
  either with polarized or unpolarized light".</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because of this observation
  that Maxwell, at a meeting of the British Association in
  Liverpool on September 15, 1870, said of the light-radiating
  particles in a flame "that no force in nature can alter even very
  slightly either their mass or their period of oscillation", a
  statement which, coming from the mouth of the founder of the
  electromagnetic light theory and spoken with such intensity, must
  really surprise present-day physicists.</p>

  <p>It was not simply out of a spirit of
  contradiction that I exposed a light source to magnetic forces.
  The idea came to me during an investigation of the effect
  discovered by Kerr on light reflected by magnetic mirrors.</p>

  <p>When it is a question of splitting up the
  light of a luminous gas into very fine detail, the simple glass
  prism of Newton and Frauenhofer is of no use, and the physicist
  has recourse to the excellent aid which we owe to Rowland: the
  concave grating. Most physics institutes possess this polished
  metal mirror with a very large number of grooves, say 50,000 over
  a width of 10 cm scratched on by means of a diamond. A beam of
  compound light is no longer reflected by the lined surface in the
  ordinary way; instead each special kind of light follows its own
  path.</p>

  <p>Of course the light source must be very
  restricted for the large number of beams corresponding to the
  various kinds of light to appear separately. This is ensured by
  placing the light source behind an opaque screen with a linear
  slit. The spectral image produced can be observed, and from the
  location and intensity of the linear-slit images we can determine
  how the different kinds of light in the light being studied are
  distributed on the basis of the period of oscillation and
  intensity. A further main advantage of Rowland's grating is that
  it is now no longer scratched on plane surfaces, but on spherical
  concave surfaces with a radius of say 3 metres, so that real
  images are produced of luminous lines without the need for the
  insertion of lenses. Moreover, photography has made it possible
  to fix these images and now provides us with a permanent record
  of each observed spectrum, which can be measured out at any
  time.</p>

  <p>When we study the well-known Bunsen sodium
  flame by means of Rowland's grating, we see a spectrum consisting
  mainly of two separate sharp yellow lines, which in our grating
  lie about I mm from each other. We see that sodium radiation
  consists of two kinds of light, the periods of oscillation of
  which differ only very slightly (1 in 1000) from each other. We
  confined our attention exclusively to one of these two lines.</p>

  <p>I must ask you now to go with me into the
  Physics Institute of Leiden University. In August, 1896, I
  exposed the sodium flame to large magnetic forces by placing it
  between the poles of a strong electromagnet. Again I studied the
  radiation of the flame by means of Rowland's mirror, the
  observations being made in the direction perpendicular to the
  lines of force. Each line, which in the absence of the effect of
  the magnetic forces was very sharply defined, was now broadened.
  This indicated that not only the original oscillations, but also
  others with greater and again others with smaller periods of
  oscillation were being radiated by the flame. The change was
  however very small. In an easily produced magnetic field it
  corresponded to a thirtieth of the distance between the two
  sodium lines, say two tenths of an Angstrom, a unit of measure
  whose name will always recall to physicists the meritorious work
  done by the father of my esteemed colleague.</p>

  <p>Had we really succeeded therefore in
  altering the period of vibration, which Maxwell, as I have just
  noted, held to be impossible? Or were there some disturbing
  circumstances from one or more factors which distorted the
  result? Several of such might be mentioned.</p>

  <p>We doubted the result. We studied the light
  source in the direction of the magnetic force, we perforated the
  poles of the magnet; but even in the direction of the magnetic
  lines of force we found that our result was confirmed. We also
  studied the reverse phenomenon, the absorption of light in sodium
  vapour, and this too satisfied our expectations. We then asked,
  do different substances behave in different ways? What happens
  when the magnetic force is raised to the maximum attainable
  values? How do different lines of the same substance behave? But
  before these questions could be answered, theory took over.</p>

  <p>I was in fact able to verify experimentally
  some conclusions which followed from the theory of optical and
  electrical phenomena of my esteemed teacher and friend Professor
  Lorentz. This theory assumes that all bodies contain small
  electrically charged mass particles, "electrons", and that all
  electrical and optical processes are based on the position and
  motion of these "electrons". Light oscillations result from the
  vibration of the "electrons". On the basis of Lorentz's theory, if
  we limit ourselves to a single spectral line, it suffices to
  assume that each atom (or molecule) contains a single moving
  electron.</p>

  <p>Now if this electron is displaced from its
  equilibrium position, a force that is directly proportional to
  the displacement restores it like a pendulum to its position of
  rest. In this model the electrons are represented by the red
  balls and the direction of the magnetic force by the arrows. Now
  all oscillatory movements of such an electron can be conceived of
  as being split up into force, and two circular oscillations
  perpendicular to this direction rotating in opposite directions.
  In the absence of a magnetic field the period of all these
  oscillations is the same. But as soon as the electron is exposed
  to the effect of a magnetic field, its motion changes. According
  to well-known electrodynamic laws, an electron moving in a
  magnetic field is acted upon by a force which runs perpendicular
  to the direction of motion of the electron and to the direction
  of the magnetic field, and whose magnitude is easily determined.
  Here the rectilinear oscillation is not changed by the magnetic
  field, the period remains the same; on the other hand the two
  circular oscillations are subjected to new forces which, running
  parallel with the radius, either increase or decrease the
  original central force. In the first case the period of
  oscillation is reduced, in the second it is increased.</p>

  <p>Now it is easy to determine the light
  motion to which this type of motion of the electrons will
  lead.</p>

  <p>Let us consider first what happens in a
  direction running <i>perpendicular to the lines of force</i>. To
  the three electron motions there correspond three electrical
  oscillations, or in terms of the electromagnetic light theory
  three light oscillations of different periods. Thus the light
  source will emit <i>three</i>-colour light instead of the
  original <i>one</i>-colour light. Therefore, instead of the
  single non-polarized spectral line we shall see three separate
  lines when we place the light source in a magnetic field. The
  different directions of oscillation of the electrons affect the
  polarization state of the emitted light. The light of the middle
  component oscillates in parallel with, and that of the outer
  components perpendicular to the lines of force.</p>

  <p>I will presently show you as an
  illustration a line which actually displays this behaviour
  postulated by Prof. Lorentz's theory.</p>

  <p>But let us first consider the rays which
  run <i>parallel with the lines of force</i>. For this purpose I
  will rotate the model so that the arrow points in your direction.
  The opposite circular oscillations of the electrons excite two
  circularly polarized rays rotating in opposite directions, one
  having a longer and the other a shorter period of oscillation
  than the original spectral line. The original spectral line
  splits up under the action of the magnetic field into two
  components which are circularly polarized in opposite directions.
  The light source emits <i>two</i>-colour light.</p>

  <p>I would now like to project for you two
  enlargements of photographs taken with the aid of Rowland's
  grating.<a href="#footnote">*</a> The lines are cadmium lines. In
  the first half of the picture you can see the unchanged line, and
  in the second rectilinear oscillations occurring in the direction
  of the magnetic lines of half the line changed by magnetic
  forces, the so-called triplet, which we see in the direction
  perpendicular to the lines of force.</p>

  <p>Secondly I will project for you a cadmium
  line observed in the direction of the lines of force. The first
  half of the picture shows the unchanged line, and the second half
  the double line or doublet produced by the magnetic forces.</p>

  <p>You see how beautifully the consequences
  following from Prof. Lorentz's theory were confirmed by
  observation in these cases. I should point out, however, that at
  first some difficulty was experienced in observing the phenomena
  predicted by the theory, owing to the extreme smallness of the
  variations in the period of oscillation.</p>

  <p>I have just said that the change was
  extremely small; but it could be said that it was unexpectedly
  large. The magnetic cleavage of the spectral lines is dependent
  on the size of the charge of the electron, or, more accurately,
  on the ratio between the mass and the charge of the electron. Let
  us see what the observations teach us. When Prof. Lorentz
  published his theory in 1895, no data were available from which
  to estimate the ratio between the mass and the charge of the
  light-exciting particles, and in this theory the ratio was left
  undefined. We can now calculate this ratio from the magnitude of
  the magnetic splitting of the spectral lines: it is
  10<sup>7</sup> c.g.s. units per gram, a colossal number even for
  the physicist, since it is 1,000 times as great as the similar
  number which was known from electrolysis phenomena in the case of
  hydrogen atoms. This makes it most probable for the physicist
  that in the luminous particles only ca. 1/1000th of the atom
  oscillates, and that the main mass of the atom remains virtually
  stationary. The oscillating electrons and the electrolysis ions
  were found to be not identical with each other; if they had been,
  the splitting of the spectral lines would have been only one
  thousandth of that observed, and then I should not have had the
  honour of addressing you in Stockholm today.</p>

  <p>A further question must also be answered
  here and now, namely, are the oscillating particles positively or
  negatively charged?</p>

  <p>We observed the doublet in the direction of
  the magnetic lines of force and studied the sign of the
  polarization. Then I suddenly resolved the problem: the
  oscillating electrons are <i>negatively</i> charged. We now know
  that cathode rays, which can occur in tubes filled with highly
  rarefied gases, are negative particles with the same high
  charge/mass ratio. We can conclude that that which vibrates in
  the light source is the same as that which travels in cathode
  rays.</p>

  <p>We can hardly avoid recalling the two
  titles of Faraday's basic work: "Magnetization of light",
  "Illumination of lines of force" They appear to us to be almost
  prophesies, because we have now seen that light can in fact be
  magnetized, and according to Prof. Arrhenius's theory we have in
  nature itself, in the northern lights, an example of illumination
  of the magnetic lines of force of the Earth by the electrons
  escaping from the sun.</p>

  <p>Nature gives us all, including Prof.
  Lorentz, surprises. It was very quickly found that there are many
  exceptions to the rule of splitting of the lines only into
  triplets. The French physicist Cornu was perhaps the first to
  observe that, contrary to the elementary theory, in some cases
  splitting into four lines, a quadruplet, occurs. In other cases
  splitting into five, six or even nine lines can be observed. In
  the line-rich spectrum of iron we find a whole selection of
  different forms. Very soon a number of physicists were working in
  the extended field; I need only name Becquerel, Cotton,
  Michelson, Preston, Righi, Runge, and Paschen. If I had more time
  at my disposal, I would gladly deal in greater detail with the
  work of the last-mentioned investigators. For the present,
  however, I must confine myself to projecting a cadmium line for
  you, which is split up into four lines, and negatives of a
  mercury line which has split up into nine components, and for
  which I am grateful to Prof. Runge. But despite this very
  complicated splitting-up, even when larger aids are used, the
  division into three groups of oscillations, two perpendicular to
  and one parallel with the lines of force, assumed in Lorentz's
  elementary theory, remains valid, as this photograph of the nonet
  shows.</p>

  <p>It was natural that, soon after I had
  succeeded in splitting up lines, I should also study how the
  different lines behave in this respect. I was soon able to show
  by investigating the zinc lines that there are great differences
  in the splitting-up of different lines of a substance.
  Particularly great differences were found in lines belonging to
  different series, the discovery of which we owe to the lucid
  investigations of your countryman Prof. Rydberg, and in
  particular Professors Kayser and Runge.</p>

  <p>I found very great differences in the lines
  of the different series, and it appeared that the splitting-up,
  contrary to the postulations of the elementary theory, expressed
  in the scale of oscillation frequencies, is <i>not</i> the same
  for all lines in the same magnetic field. We can conclude from
  this on the basis of Lorentz's theory that the charge/mass ratio
  is not the same for all electrons.</p>

  <p>I would now like to talk about three
  separate phenomena, first a phenomenon which I have not been able
  to observe, secondly phenomena which I have hardly been able to
  verify, and thirdly a surprising phenomenon.</p>

  <p>All the results which have been discussed
  so far have related to line spectra; but in the case of many
  bodies we also know of the existence of band spectra. Here a
  difference is found : the band spectrum displayed by iodine
  vapour or bromine vapour as an absorption medium at low
  temperatures, remains unchanged in a magnetic field; I personally
  have been unable to bring about any change in the extremely
  accurate images which Prof. Hasselberg has given us of the
  absorption spectra of bromine and iodine vapour, even with the
  strongest magnetic fields.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Prof. Voigt in
  G&ouml;ttingen for a comprehensive theory of magneto-optical
  phenomena. The triplet you have seen today was absolutely
  symmetrical, as postulated in the elementary theory. Now on the
  basis of his theory Prof. Voigt was able to predict that as a
  result of the action of <i>weak</i> magnetic forces asymmetry
  should occur. According to him, the two external components
  should have different light intensities and be at different
  distances from the centre line. In the case of iron, zinc, and
  cadmium lines I was able to observe both asymmetries; because of
  their extreme smallness, however, I cannot demonstrate the
  phenomena in the projector.</p>

  <p>However, another phenomenon, which will
  give you some idea of the scope of Voigt's theory, is more
  striking. In this phenomenon Faraday's magnetic rotation of the
  polarization plane and the magnetic splitting of the spectral
  lines, are intimately connected with each other.</p>

  <p>The rotation of the polarization plane is
  extraordinarily small in all gases, thus also in sodium vapour.
  As Macaluso and Corbino found, it is only in the case of those
  colours which lie close to an absorption band of the vapour that
  the rotation is very great, of the order of 180&deg;, and the
  rotation takes place in the <i>positive</i> direction, the
  direction of the current exciting the magnet.</p>

  <p>What about the rotation inside the
  absorption band?</p>

  <p>Prof. Voigt was able to predict that in the
  case of highly rarefied vapours the rotation must be negative in
  the zone between the two components of the doublet, i.e. opposite
  in direction to that outside the band, and also very great. I had
  the pleasure of confirming this theoretical finding in
  experiments on sodium vapour. Provided that the vapour is highly
  rarefied, the rotation in very strong fields between the lines of
  the doublet can rise to -400&deg;.</p>

  <p>To give you some idea of the distribution
  of the rotations, I will show you two negatives connected with
  this investigation.</p>

  <p>The magnetic field is <i>not</i> set
  up.</p>

  <p>The two dark vertical lines are the
  absorption lines of sodium vapour, the well-known D-lines. The
  reason why they are so broad is that the vapour was very dense.
  The horizontal bands are interference bands, which were produced
  by means of a special device. They indicate the points where the
  direction of oscillation is the same. The directions of
  oscillation in each of the successive bands differ by
  180&deg;.</p>

  <p>Now as soon as the magnetic field is set up
  we get the image now being projected. On each side of each of the
  D-lines the bands bend <i>upwards</i>, the more so the smaller
  the distance, because the rotation in the vicinity of the bands
  grows very rapidly and reaches almost 180&deg; in the immediate
  neighbourhood of the bands. Within the bands a blurred band only
  is visible.</p>

  <p>The phenomenon becomes far clearer once the
  vapour is highly rarefied. The bands bounding the components
  <i>rise</i> as before. At the same time, however, the inner band
  becomes detached; it has <i>fallen</i>, the rotation is negative.
  In our third image the rotation in the case of one of the D-lines
  is about -90&deg;, in the other everything is more blurred, the
  rotation is about -180&deg;.</p>

  <p>Summarizing briefly the results of the
  tests described in the light of Lorentz's theory, it can be
  stated that firm support has been found for the assertion that
  electricity occurs at thousands of points where we at most
  conjectured that it was present. Innumerable electrical particles
  oscillate in every flame and light source. We can in fact assume
  that every heat source is filled with electrons which will
  continue to oscillate ceaselessly and indefinitely.</p>

  <p>All these electrons leave their impression
  on the emitted rays. We can hope that experimental study of the
  radiation phenomena, which are exposed to various influences, but
  in particular to the effect of magnetism, will provide us with
  useful data concerning a new field, that of atomistic astronomy,
  as Lodge called it, populated with atoms and electrons instead of
  planets and worlds.</p>

  <p>I count myself fortunate to be able to
  contribute to this work; and the great interest which the Royal
  Swedish Academy of Sciences has shown in my work and the
  recognition that it has paid to my past successes, convince me
  that I am not on the wrong track.</p>
