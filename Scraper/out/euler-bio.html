  <h1>Ulf von Euler - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="euler.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ulf S. von Euler</b> was born in
  Stockholm on February 7th, 1905, as the second son of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/index.html">Hans von Euler-Chelpin</a>
  and Astrid Cleve. His father was born in Augsburg, Germany, as
  the only son of general Rigas von Euler-Chelpin. Hans von
  Euler-Chelpin received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1929.
  Ulf's mother was the daughter of Per Teodor Cleve, who was
  Professor of Chemistry in Uppsala, and the discoverer of the
  elements thulium and holmium. Astrid Cleve received her Ph. D. in
  botany and later devoted most of her scientific activities to
  diatomes and to geology and obtained the title of professor in
  1955.<br>
  <br>
  After school years in Stockholm and in Karlstad, Ulf von Euler
  entered the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1970/euler-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Karolinska Institute</a> as a medical student in 1922.
  The scientific atmosphere at home and the regular opportunities
  to meet scientists - <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html">Svante Arrhenius</a>
  (Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903) was his godfather - had, no
  doubt, a great part in his growing interest in research. This was
  facilitated but never enforced upon him by his parents. After a
  period of study with Robin F&aring;hraeus (a pioneer in blood
  sedimentation and rheology) von Euler began some research work on
  his own and he was much encouraged by a prize given for a study
  on vasoconstrictor properties of fever blood.<br>
  <br>
  From 1926 he worked as assistant in G. Liljestrand's Department
  of Pharmacology, where he produced his thesis in 1930, followed
  by an appointment as Assistant Professor in Pharmacology in the
  same year.<br>
  <br>
  Aided by the continuous support of Liljestrand, von Euler had the
  good fortune of obtaining a Rockefeller Fellowship for studies
  abroad (1930-1931) with <a href="../1936/index.html">H. H.
  Dale</a> in London, I. de Burgh Daly in Birmingham, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1938/index.html">C. Heymans</a> in Ghent and
  G. Embden in Frankfurt. This period of diversified studies in
  Physiology and Pharmacology provided an invaluable basis for
  further research. Having had the good luck of discovering an
  active biological factor in intestinal extracts (&laquo;Substance
  P&raquo;), further developed with J. H. Gaddum in Dale's
  laboratory, von Euler's interest, soon after his return home,
  turned in that direction and led subsequently to the findings of
  prostaglandin and vesiglandin (1935), piperidine (1942) and
  noradrenaline (1946).<br>
  <br>
  In <a href="../1922/index.html">A. V. Hill</a>'s laboratory in
  London, von Euler obtained some insight into problems and
  methodology of biophysics (1934). Expert teaching in the subjects
  of neuromuscular transmission was given by G. L. Brown in London
  (1938). Various aspects of endocrinology and experimental renal
  hypertension were later studied with E. Braun-Men&eacute;ndez in
  <a href="../1947/index.html">B. A. Houssay</a>'s laboratory in
  Buenos Aires in 1946-1947.<br>
  <br>
  After a period from 1930 to 1939 as Assistant Professor, von
  Euler was appointed Professor of Physiology at the Karolinska
  Institute, a post which he has held until 1971. Conditions for
  work were improved by the transfer from the old site of the
  Karolinska Institute to modern laboratories in the new premises
  just outside Stockholm. Experimental work was greatly facilitated
  by generous support from the Medical Research Council (after 1950) but also from
  private funds and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as from
  research funds in the United States of America.<br>
  <br>
  After the identification of noradrenaline as the adrenergic
  neurotransmitter in 1946, most of von Euler's research work has
  been devoted to this subject. Its distribution in nerves and
  organs, its excretion during various physiological and
  pathological conditions and its quantitation have been studied in
  his laboratory. The finding that the transmitter was stored in
  subcellular particles (with his late colleague N-&Aring;. Hillarp)
  gave a new direction to the research, and problems concerning
  uptake, storage and release from nerve granules as well as the
  neurotransmission process have been the main research subject
  since 1958. A large number of students, research assistants and
  research associates have taken part in these studies.<br>
  <br>
  During the years 1953 to 1960 Ulf von Euler was a Member of the
  <a href="http://www.nobelprizemedicine.org/?page_id=326" target="_blank">Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine</a>
  and from 1961 to 1965 he served as Secretary of the Committee. In
  1965 Professor von Euler was appointed Chairman of the Board of
  the Nobel Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  From 1965 to 1971 he served as Vice-President of the
  International Union of Physiological Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Professor von Euler was awarded the Gairdner Prize (Canada) in
  1961, the Jahre Prize (Norway) 1965, the Stouffer Prize (U.S.A.)
  in 1967, Carl Ludwig Medaille (Germany) 1953, Schmiedeberg
  Plaquette (Germany) 1969, La Madonnina (Italy) 1970.<br>
