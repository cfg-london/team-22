  <h2>The Irish Dramatic Movement</h2>

  <p>I have chosen as my theme the Irish
  Dramatic Movement because when I remember the great honour that
  you have conferred upon me, I cannot forget many known and
  unknown persons. Perhaps the English committees would never have
  sent you my name if I had written no plays, no dramatic
  criticism, if my Iyric poetry had not a quality of speech
  practised upon the stage, perhaps even - though this could be no
  portion of their deliberate thought - if it were not in some
  degree the symbol of a movement. I wish to tell the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1923/yeats-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Royal Academy
  of Sweden</a> of the labours, triumphs, and troubles of my fellow
  workers.<br>
  <br>
  The modern literature of Ireland, and indeed all that stir of
  thought which prepared for the Anglo-Irish War, began when
  Parnell fell from power in 1891. A disillusioned and embittered
  Ireland turned away from parliamentary politics; an event was
  conceived and the race began, as I think, to be troubled by that
  event's long gestation. Dr. Hyde founded the Gaelic League, which
  was for many years to substitute for political argument a Gaelic
  grammar, and for political meetings village gatherings, where
  songs were sung and stories told in the Gaelic language.
  Meanwhile I had begun a movement in English, in the language in
  which modern Ireland thinks and does its business; founded
  certain societies where clerks, working men, men of all classes,
  could study those Irish poets, novelists, and historians who had
  written in English, and as much of Gaelic literature as had been
  translated into English. But the great mass of our people,
  accustomed to interminable political speeches, read little, and
  so from the very start we felt that we must have a theatre of our
  own. The theatres of Dublin had nothing about them that we could
  call our own. They were empty buildings hired by the English
  travelling companies and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players.
  When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was
  romantic and poetical, for the nationalism we had called up -
  like that every generation had called up in moments of
  discouragement - was romantic and poetical. It was not, however,
  until I met in 1896 Lady Gregory, a member of an old Galway
  family, who had spent her life between two Galway houses, the
  house where she was born and the house into which she was
  married, that such a theatre became possible. All about her lived
  a peasantry who told stories in a form of English which has much
  of its syntax from Gaelic, much of its vocabulary from Tudor
  English, but it was very slowly that we discovered in that speech
  of theirs our most powerful dramatic instrument, not indeed until
  she began to write. Though my plays were written without dialect
  and in English blank verse, I think she was attracted to our
  movement because their subject matter differed but little from
  the subject matter of the country stories. Her own house has been
  protected by her presence, but the house where she was born was
  burned down by incendiaries some few months ago; and there has
  been like disorder over the greater part of Ireland. A trumpery
  dispute about an acre of land can rouse our people to monstrous
  savagery, and if in their war with the English auxiliary police
  they were shown no mercy they showed none: murder answered
  murder. Yet ignorance and violence can remember the noblest
  beauty. I have in Galway a little old tower, and when I climb to
  the top of it I can see at no great distance a green field where
  stood once the thatched cottage of a famous country beauty, the
  mistress of a small local landed proprietor. I have spoken to old
  men and women who remembered her, though all are dead now, and
  they spoke of her as the old men upon the wall of Troy spoke of
  Helen; nor did man and woman differ in their praise. One old
  woman, of whose youth the neighbors cherished a scandalous tale,
  said of her, &laquo;I tremble all over when I think of her&raquo;;
  and there was another old woman on the neighbouring mountain who
  said, &laquo;The sun and the moon never shone on anybody so
  handsome, and her skin was so white that it looked blue, and she
  had two little blushes on her cheeks.&raquo; And there were men
  that told of the crowds that gathered to look at her upon a fair
  day, and of a man &laquo;who got his death swimming a river&raquo;,
  that he might look at her. It was a song written by the Gaelic
  poet Raftery that brought her such great fame and the cottagers
  still sing it, though there are not so many to sing it as when I
  was young:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">O star of light and O sun in harvest,<br>
    O amber hair, O my share of the world,<br>
    It is Mary Hynes, the calm and easy woman,<br>
    Has beauty in her body and in her mind.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It seemed as if the ancient world lay all
  about us with its freedom of imagination, its delight in good
  stories, in man's force and woman's beauty, and that all we had
  to do was to make the town think as the country felt; yet we soon
  discovered that the town could only think town thought.<br>
  <br>
  In the country you are alone with your own violence, your own
  heaviness, and with the common tragedy of life, and if you have
  any artistic capacity you desire beautiful emotion; and, certain
  that the seasons will be the same always, care not how fantastic
  its expression.<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the town,
  where everybody crowds upon you, it is your neighbour not
  yourself that you hate and, if you are not to embitter his life
  and your own life, perhaps even if you are not to murder him in
  some kind of revolutionary frenzy, somebody must teach reality
  and justice. You will hate that teacher for a while, calling his
  books and plays ugly, misdirected, morbid or something of that
  kind, but you must agree with him in the end. We were to find
  ourselves in a quarrel with public opinion that compelled us
  against our own will and the will of our players to become always
  more realistic, substituting dialect for verse, common speech for
  dialect.<br>
  <br>
  I had told Lady Gregory that I saw no likelihood of getting money
  for a theatre and so must put away that hope, and she promised to
  find the money among her friends. Her neighbour, Mr. Edward
  Martyn, paid for our first performances; and our first players
  came from England; but presently we began our real work with a
  little company of Irish amateurs.<a href=
  "#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Somebody had asked me at a lecture,
  &laquo;Where will you get your actors?&raquo; and I said, &laquo;I
  will go into some crowded room and put the name of everybody in
  it on a piece of paper and put all those pieces of paper into a
  hat and draw the first twelve.&raquo; I have often wondered at
  that prophecy, for though it was spoken probably to confound and
  confuse a questioner, it was very nearly fulfilled. Our two best
  men actors were not indeed chosen by chance, for one was a
  stage-struck solicitor's clerk and the other a working man who
  had toured Ireland in a theatrical company managed by a negro. I
  doubt if he had learned much in it, for its methods were rough
  and noisy, the negro whitening his face when he played a white
  man, and, so strong is stage convention, blackening it when he
  played a black man. If a player had to open a letter on the stage
  I have no doubt that he struck it with the flat of his hand, as I
  have seen players do in my youth, a gesture that lost its meaning
  generations ago when blotting paper was substituted for sand. We
  got our women, however, from a little political society which
  described its object as educating the children of the poor, which
  meant, according to its enemies, teaching them a catechism that
  began with this question, &laquo;What is the origin of
  evil?&raquo;, and the answer, &laquo;England&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  And they came to us for patriotic reasons and acted from
  precisely the same impulse that had made them teach, and yet two
  of them proved players of genius: Miss Allgood and Miss
  &laquo;Maire O Neill&nbsp;&raquo;. They were sisters, one all
  simplicity, her mind shaped by folk song and folk stories; the
  other sophisticated, lyrical, and subtle. I do not know what
  their thoughts were as that strange new power awoke within them,
  but I think they must have suffered from a bad conscience, a
  feeling that the old patriotic impulse had gone, that they had
  given themselves up to vanity or ambition. Yet I think it was
  that first misunderstanding of themselves that made their
  peculiar genius possible, for had they come to us with theatrical
  ambitions they would have imitated some well known English player
  and sighed for well-known English plays. Nor would they have
  found their genius if we had not remained for a long time obscure
  like the bird within its shell, playing in little halls,
  generally in some shabby, out-of-the-way street. We could
  experiment and wait, with nothing to fear but political
  misunderstanding. We had little money and at first needed little,
  twenty-five pounds given by Lady Gregory and twenty pounds by
  myself and a few pounds picked up here and there. And our
  theatrical organization was preposterous, players and authors all
  sat together and settled by vote what play should be performed
  and who should play it. It took a series of disturbances, weeks
  of argument, during which no performance could be given, before
  Lady Gregory and John Synge and I were put in control. And our
  relations with the public were even more disturbed. One play was
  violently attacked by the patriotic press because it described a
  married peasant woman who had a lover, and when we published the
  old Aran folk tale upon which it was founded, the press said the
  story had been copied from some decadent author of Pagan Rome.
  Presently Lady Gregory wrote her first comedy. My verse plays
  were not long enough to fill an evening and so she wrote a little
  play on a country love story in the dialect of her neighbourhood.
  A countryman returns from America with a hundred pounds and
  discovers his old sweetheart married to a bankrupt farmer. He
  plays cards with the farmer and, by cheating against himself,
  gives him the hundred pounds. The company refused to perform that
  play because they said to admit an emigrant's return with a
  hundred pounds would encourage emigration. We produced evidence
  of returned emigrants with much larger sums but were told that
  only made the matter worse. Then after this interminable argument
  had worn us all out, Lady Gregory agreed to reduce the sum to
  twenty and the actors gave way. That little play was sentimental
  and conventional, but her next discovered her genius. She, too,
  had desired to serve, and that genius must have seemed miraculous
  to herself. She was in middle life and had written nothing but a
  volume of political memoirs and had no interest in the
  theatre.<br>
  <br>
  Nobody reading today her <i>Seven Short Plays</i> can understand
  why one of them, now an Irish classic, <i>The Rising of the
  Moon</i>, could not be performed for two years because of
  political hostility. A policeman discovers an escaped Fenian
  prisoner and lets him free, because the prisoner has aroused with
  some old songs the half forgotten patriotism of his youth. The
  players would not perform it because they said it was an
  unpatriotic act to admit that a policeman was capable of
  patriotism. One well known leader of the mob wrote to me,
  &laquo;How can the Dublin mob be expected to fight the police if
  it looks upon them as capable of patriotism?&raquo; When performed
  at last the play was received with enthusiasm, but only to get us
  into new trouble. The chief Unionist Dublin newspaper denounced
  it for slandering his Majesty's forces, and Dublin Castle, the
  centre of English Government in Ireland, denied to us privileges
  which we had shared with the other Dublin theatres, of buying for
  stage purposes the cast off clothes of the police. Castle and
  Press alike knew that the police had frequently let off political
  prisoners but &laquo;that only made the matter worse&raquo;. Every
  political party had the same desire to substitute for life, which
  never does the same thing twice, a bundle of reliable principles
  and assertions.<a href="#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Nor did
  religious orthodoxy like us any better than political; my
  <i>Countess Cathleen</i> was denounced by Cardinal Logue as an
  heretical play, and when I wrote that we would like to perform
  &laquo;foreign masterpieces&nbsp;&raquo;, a Nationalist newspaper
  declared that &laquo;a foreign masterpiece is a very dangerous
  thing&nbsp;&raquo;. The little halls where we performed could hold a
  couple of hundred people at the utmost and our audience was often
  not more than twenty or thirty, and we performed but two or three
  times a month and during our periods of quarrelling not even
  that. But there was no lack of leading articles, we were from the
  first a recognised public danger. Two events brought us victory,
  a friend gave us a theatre, and we found a strange man of genius,
  John Synge. After a particularly angry leading article I had come
  in front of the curtain and appealed to the hundred people of the
  audience for their support. When I came down from the stage an
  old friend, Miss Horniman, from whom I had been expecting a
  contribution of twenty pounds, said, &laquo;I will find you a
  theatre.&raquo; She found and altered for our purpose what is now
  the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and gave us a small subsidy for a few
  years.<br>
  <br>
  I had met John Synge in Paris in 1896. Somebody had said,
  &laquo;There is an Irishman living on the top floor of your hotel;
  I will introduce you.&raquo; I was very poor, but he was much
  poorer. He belonged to a very old Irish family and though a
  simple, courteous man, remembered it and was haughty and lonely.
  With just enough to keep him from starvation, and not always from
  half starvation, he had wandered about Europe travelling third
  class or upon foot, playing his fiddle to poor men on the road or
  in their cottages. He was the man that we needed because he was
  the only man I have ever known incapable of a political thought
  or of a humanitarian purpose. He could walk the roadside all day
  with some poor man without any desire to do him good, or for any
  reason except that he liked him. He was to do for Ireland, though
  more by his influence on other dramatists than by his direct
  influence, what Robert Burns did for Scotland. When Scotland
  thought herself gloomy and religious, Providence restored her
  imaginative spontaneity by raising up Robert Burns to commend
  drink and the devil. I did not, however, see what was to come
  when I advised John Synge to go to a wild island off the Galway
  coast and study its life because that life &laquo;had never been
  expressed in literature&raquo;. He had learned Gaelic at College,
  and I told him that, as I would have told it to any young man who
  had learned Gaelic and wanted to write. When he found that wild
  island he became happy for the first time, escaping as he said
  &laquo;from the nullity of the rich and the squalor of the
  poor&raquo;. He had bad health, he could not stand the island
  hardship long, but he would go to and fro between there and
  Dublin.<br>
  <br>
  Burns himself could not have more shocked a gathering of Scotch
  clergy than did he our players. Some of the women got about him
  and begged him to write a play about the rebellion of '98, and
  pointed out very truthfully that a play on such a patriotic theme
  would be a great success. He returned at the end of a fortnight
  with a scenario upon which he had toiled in his laborious way.
  Two women take refuge in a cave, a Protestant woman and a
  Catholic, and carry on an interminable argument about the merits
  of their respective religions. The Catholic woman denounces Henry
  VIII and Queen Elizabeth, and the Protestant woman the
  Inquisition and the Pope. They argue in low voices because one is
  afraid of being ravished by the rebels and the other by the loyal
  soldiers. But at last either the Protestant or the Catholic says
  that she prefers any fate to remaining any longer in such wicked
  company and climbs out. The play was neither written nor
  performed, and neither then nor at any later time could I
  discover whether Synge understood the shock that he was giving.
  He certainly did not foresee in any way the trouble that his
  greatest play brought on us all.<br>
  <br>
  When I had landed from a fishing yawl on the middle of the island
  of Aran, a few months before my first meeting with Synge, a
  little group of islanders, who had gathered to watch a stranger's
  arrival, brought me to &laquo;the oldest man upon the
  island.&raquo;He spoke but two sentences, speaking them very
  slowly, &laquo;If any gentleman has done a crime we'll hide him.
  There was a gentleman that killed his father and I had him in my
  house three months till he got away to America. It was a play
  founded on that old man's story Synge brought back with him. A
  young man arrives at a little public house and tells the
  publican's daughter that he has murdered his father. He so tells
  it that he has all her sympathy, and every time he retells it,
  with new exaggerations and additions, he wins the sympathy of
  somebody or other, for it is the countryman's habit to be against
  the law. The countryman thinks the more terrible the crime the
  greater must the provocation have been. The young man himself
  under the excitement of his own story becomes gay, energetic, and
  lucky. He prospers in love and comes in first at the local races
  and bankrupts the roulette table afterwards. Then the father
  arrives with his head bandaged but very lively, and the people
  turn upon the impostor. To win back their esteem he takes up a
  spade to kill his father in earnest, but horrified at the threat
  of what had sounded so well in the story, they bind him to hand
  over to the police. The father releases him and father and son
  walk off together, the son, still buoyed up by his imagination,
  announcing that he will be master henceforth. Picturesque,
  poetical, fantastical, a masterpiece of style and of music, the
  supreme work of our dialect theatre, it roused the populace to
  fury. We played it under police protection, seventy police in the
  theatre the last night, and five hundred, some newspaper said,
  keeping order in the streets outside. It is never played before
  any Irish audience for the first time without something or other
  being flung at the players. In New York a currant cake and a
  watch were flung, the owner of the watch claiming it at the stage
  door afterwards. The Dublin audience has, however, long since
  accepted the play. It has noticed, I think, that everyone upon
  the stage is somehow lovable and companionable, and that Synge
  described, through an exaggerated symbolism, a reality which he
  loved precisely because he loved all reality. So far from being,
  as they had thought, a politician working in the interests of
  England, he was so little a politician that the world merely
  amused him and touched his pity. Yet when Synge died in 1910
  opinion had hardly changed, we were playing to an almost empty
  theatre and were continually denounced in the Press. Our victory
  was won by those who had learned from him courage and sincerity
  but belonged to a different school. Synge's work, the work of
  Lady Gregory, my own <i>Cathleen ni Houlihan</i>, and my <i>Hour
  glass</i> in its prose form, are characteristic of our first
  ambition. They bring the imagination and speech of the country,
  all that poetical tradition descended from the middle ages, to
  the people of the town. Those who learned from Synge had often
  little knowledge of the country and always little interest in its
  dialect. Their plays are frequently attacks upon obvious abuses,
  the bribery at the appointment of a dispensary Doctor, the
  attempts of some local politician to remain friends with all
  parties. Indeed the young Ministers and party politicians of the
  Free State have had, I think, some of their education from our
  plays. Then, too, there are many comedies which are not political
  satires, though they are concerned with the life of the politic
  ridden people of the town. Of these Mr. Lennox Robinson's are the
  best known; his <i>Whiteheaded Boy</i> has been played in England
  and America. Of late it has seemed as if this school were coming
  to an end, for the old plots are repeated with slight variations
  and the characterization grows mechanical. It is too soon yet to
  say what will come to us from the melodrama and tragedy of the
  last four years, but if we can pay our players and keep our
  theatre open, something will come.<a href=
  "#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a> We are burdened with debt, for we have
  come through war and civil war and audiences grow thin when there
  is firing in the streets. We have, however, survived so much that
  I believe in our luck, and think that I have a right to say I end
  my lecture in the middle or even perhaps at the beginning of the
  story. But certainly I have said enough to make you understand
  why, when I received from the hands of your King the great honour
  your Academy has conferred upon me, I felt that a young man's
  ghost should have stood upon one side of me and at the other a
  living woman in her vigorous old age. I have seen little in this
  last week that would not have been memorable and exciting to
  Synge and to Lady Gregory, for Sweden has achieved more than we
  have hoped for our own country. I think most of all perhaps of
  that splendid spectacle of your court, a family beloved and able
  that has gathered about it not the rank only but the intellect of
  its country. No like spectacle will in Ireland show its work of
  discipline and of taste, though it might satisfy a need of the
  race no institution created by English or American democracy can
  satisfy.</p><br>

  <h4>Notes</h4>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not-1" id="not-1"></a>* Yeats
  maintained that his lecture was written down from memory. It
  seems therefore appropriate to incorporate here certain
  improvements he made in a version published the in <i>The Bounty
  of Sweden</i> (The Cuala Press, Dublin, I925).<br>
  <br>
  <a name="not_1" id="not_1"></a>1. I was in my Galway
  house during the first months of civil war, the railway bridges
  blown up and the roads blocked with stones and trees. For the
  first week there were no newspapers, no reliable news, we did not
  know who had won nor who had lost, and even after newspapers
  came, one never knew what was happening on the other side of the
  hill or of the line of trees. Ford cars passed the house from
  time to time with coffins' standing upon end between the seats,
  and sometimes at night we heard an explosion, and once by day saw
  the smoke made by the burning of a great neighbouring house. Men
  must have lived so through many tumultuous centuries. One felt an
  overmastering desire not to grow unhappy or embittered, not to
  lose all sense of the beauty of nature. A stare (our West of
  Ireland name for a starling) had built in a hole beside my window
  and I made these verses out of the feeling of the moment:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">The bees build in the crevices<br>
    Of loosening masonry, and there<br>
    The mother birds bring grubs and fies.<br>
    My wall is loosening, honey bees<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br>
    <br>
    We are closed in, and the key turned<br>
    On our uncertainty; somewhere<br>
    A man is killed, or a house is burned,<br>
    Yet no clear fact to be discerned:<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="smalltext">That is only the beginning but it runs on in
  the same mood. Presently a strange thing happened; I began to
  smell honey in places where honey could not be, at the end of a
  stone passage or at some windy turn of the road and it came
  always with certain thoughts. When I got back to Dublin I was
  with angry people, who argued over everything or were eager to
  know the exact facts. They were in the mood that makes realistic
  drama.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="not_2" id="not_2"></a>2. Our first
  performances were paid for by Mr. Edward Martyn, a Galway
  landowner with a house, part fourteenth century, part that
  pretentious modern Gothic once dear to Irish Catholic families.
  He had a great hall adorned with repeating patterns by that
  dreary decorator Crace, where he played Palestrina upon an organ,
  and a study with pictures of the poets in poor stained glass,
  where he read Ibsen and the Fathers of the Church and nothing
  else. A sensible friendly man with intelligence, strength of
  purpose, and a charming manner, he shrank from women like a
  medieval monk and between him and all experience came one
  overwhelming terror &laquo;If I do such and such a thing or read
  such and such a book I may lose my soul.&raquo; My <i>Countess
  Cathleen</i> and a play of his own were our first performances.
  My play's heroine, having sold her soul to the devil, gets it
  back again because &laquo;God only sees the motive not the
  deed,&raquo; and her motive is to save starving people from
  selling their souls for their bodies' sake. When all our
  announcements had been made Martyn withdrew his support because a
  priest told him that the play was heretical. I got two priests to
  say that it was not and he was satisfied, for we have democratic
  ideals. He withdrew permanently, however, after a few months,
  foreseeing further peril to his soul. He died a couple of months
  ago and with him died a family founded in the twelfth century. An
  unhappy, childless, laborious, unfinished man, typical of an
  Ireland that is passing away.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="not_3" id="not_3"></a>3. Josef Strzygowski in
  his <i>Origin of Christian Church Art</i> (a translation of a
  series of lectures, delivered in Upsala in 1919) says that art
  &laquo;flourishes less at courts than anywhere else in the world.
  For at the seat of power everything is subordinated to politics;
  the forces willing to accept this fact are always welcome; those
  which are not willing must either emigrate or remain aloof&raquo;.
  The danger to art and literature comes today from the tyranny and
  persuasions of revolutionary societies and forms of political and
  religious propaganda. The persuasion has corrupted much modern
  English literature; and during the twenty years that led up to
  our national revolution the tyranny wasted the greater part of
  the energy of Irish dramatists and poets. They had to remain
  perpetually on the watch to defend their creation; and the more
  natural the creation the more difficult the defence.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="not_4" id="not_4"></a>4. Since I gave my
  lecture we have produced <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> by Mr.
  O'Casey, the greatest success we have had for years. In this
  play, which draws its characters and scenes from the Dublin
  slums, a mind, not unlike that of Dostoevsky, looks upon the
  violence and tragedy of civil war. There is assassination, sudden
  poverty, and the humour of drunkards and the philosophy of
  wastrels, and there is little but the out-worn theme of
  seduction, and perhaps a phrase or two of mechanical humour, to
  show that its author has not finished his artistic education. He
  is a working bricklayer who was taken out to be shot by English
  soldiers in mistake for somebody else, but escaped in a moment of
  confusion. He knows thoroughly the life which he describes.</p>
