  <h1>Werner Arber - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="arber.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born on
  June 3rd, 1929 in Gr&auml;nichen in the Canton of Aargau,
  Switzerland, where I went to the public schools until the age of
  16. I then entered the gymnasium at the Kantonsschule Aarau where
  I got a B-type maturity in 1949. From 1949 to 1953 I studied
  towards the diploma in Natural Sciences at the Swiss
  Polytechnical School in Zurich. It is in the last year of this
  study that I made my first contacts with fundamental research,
  when working on the isolation and characterisation of a new
  isomer of Cl<sup>34</sup>, with a halflife of 1.5 seconds.<br>
  <br>
  On the recommendation of my professor in experimental physics,
  Paul Scherrer, I took an assistantship for electron microscopy at
  the Biophysics Laboratory at the University of
  Geneva in November 1953. This laboratory was animated by
  Eduard Kellenberger and it had two prototype electron microscopes
  requiring much attention. In spite of spending many hours to keep
  the microscope "Arthur" in reasonable working condition, I had
  enough time not only to help developing preparation techniques
  for biological specimens in view of their observation in the
  electron microscope, but also to become familiar with fundamental
  questions of bacteriophage physiology and genetics, which at that
  time was still a relatively new and unknown field. My first
  contribution to our journal club concerned <a href=
  "../1962/index.html">Watson</a> and <a href=
  "../1962/index.html">Crick's</a> papers on the structure of
  DNA.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1950's the Biophysics Laboratory at the University of
  Geneva was lucky enough to receive each summer for several months
  the visit of Jean Weigle. He was the former professor of
  experimental physics at the University of Geneva. After having
  suffered a heart attack, he had left Geneva to become a
  researcher at the Department of Biology of the California Institute of
  Technology in Pasadena. There, he had been converted to a
  biologist under the influence of <a href="../1969/index.html">Max
  Delbr&uuml;ck</a> and had chosen to study bacteriophage lambda.
  This is why the first electron micrographs of phage lambda were
  made in Geneva. Stimulated by Jean Weigle we soon turned our
  interests also to other properties of lambda, and the study of
  defective lambda prophage mutants became the topic of my doctoral
  thesis.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1956, we learned about experiments made by Larry
  Morse and Esther and <a href="../1958/index.html">Joshua
  Lederberg</a> on the lambda-mediated transduction (gene transfer
  from one bacterial strain to another by a bacteriophage serving
  as vector) of bacterial determinants for galactose fermentation.
  Since these investigators had encountered defective lysogenic
  strains among their transductants, we felt that such strains
  should be included in the collection of lambda prophage mutants
  under study in our laboratory. Very rapidly, thanks to the
  stimulating help by Jean Weigle and Grete Kellenberger, this
  turned out to be extremely fruitful. We could indeed show that
  lambda-mediated transduction is based on the formation of
  substitution mutants, which had replaced a part of the phage
  genes by genes from the bacterial chromosome. This made the
  so-called lambda-gal phage derivatives so defective that they
  were not able any longer to propagate as a virus. In fact, one of
  the at first sight rather frustrating observation was that
  lysates of lambda-gal, which indeed could still cause the
  infected host cell to lyse as does wild type phage lambda, did
  not contain any structural components of lambda (phage particles,
  heads or tails) discernible in the electron microscope. This was
  the end of my career as an electron microscopist and in chosing
  genetic and physiological approaches I became a molecular
  geneticist.<br>
  <br>
  After my Ph. D. exam in the summer of 1958 I had the chance to
  receive an offer to work at the University of Southern California in Los
  Angeles with Joe Bertani, a former collaborator of Jean Weigle.
  Several years before, Bertani had isolated and characterised
  another bacteriophage of <i>E. coli,</i> P1. Phage P1 rapidly had
  become a very welcome tool of bacterial geneticists, since it
  gives general transduction, i.e. any particular region of the
  host chromosome gets at some low frequency wrapped into P1 phage
  particles if P1 multiplies in a cell, and this enables the
  geneticists to carry out linkage studies of bacterial genes.
  While working as a research associate with Bertani, I received P1
  at first hand which enabled me to study phage Pl-mediated
  transduction of monomeric and dimeric lambda prophage genomes as
  well as of the fertility plasmid F.<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, my Ph. D. thesis on lambda-gal, although written
  in French, had been read, or, what is perhaps more essential,
  understood in its conclusions by many leading microbial
  geneticists.<br>
  <br>
  This may be the reason why I received offers to spend additional
  postdoctoral time in several excellent laboratories. On the other
  hand, I had remained in close contact with Eduard Kellenberger,
  and he urged me to come back to Geneva in order to lead an
  investigation on radiation effects on microorganisms. As a
  compromise, I decided to return to Geneva at the beginning of
  1960, but only after having spent several very fruitful weeks at
  each of the laboratories of Gunther Stent in Berkeley, Joshua
  Lederberg in Stanford and <a href="../1969/index.html">Salvador
  Luria</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
  Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 1950's, a special credit had been voted for by
  the Swiss Parliament for research in atomic energy, including
  radiation effects on living organisms. Eduard Kellenberger felt
  that important contributions to the latter questions could be
  expected from studies with microorganisms, and he had therefore
  submitted a research proposal which found approval by the
  granting agency, the Swiss National Science Foundation. The project could
  bring insight into the nature of radiation damage to genetic
  material and its repair mechanisms, as well as of the stimulation
  of genetic recombination by radiation. These topics had already
  engaged the attention of Jean Weigle and Grete Kellenberger for a
  number of years.<br>
  <br>
  One of the first experiments after my return to Geneva was to
  render <i>E. coli</i> B and its radiation resistant strain B/r
  sensitive to phage lambda. The first step to accomplish this was
  easy thanks to a hint received from Esther Lederberg to look for
  cotransduction of the Ma1<sup>+</sup> and lambda<sup>S</sup>
  characters. However, the strains thus obtained still did not
  allow an efficient propagation of lambda. Very rapidly I realized
  that this was due to host-controlled modification, a phenomenon
  described for lambda and <i>E. coli</i> strains seven years
  earlier by Joe Bertani and Jean Weigle. However, I was not
  satisfied to know how to overcome this barrier. I was also
  anxious to know how the restriction of phage growth and the
  adaptation of lambda to the new host strain worked. When I
  started investigations on the mechanisms of host-controlled
  modification, I did not of course imagine that this sidetrack
  would keep my interest for many years. Otherwise I might not have
  felt justified to engage in this work because of its lack of
  direct relevance to radiation research. However, a lucky
  coincidence rapidly dissipated these concerns. At the same time,
  Grete Kellenberger had looked at the fate of DNA from irradiated
  phage lambda upon infection of host bacteria: part of it was
  rapidly degraded after injection into the host. And so was the
  DNA from unirradiated phage lambda used to measure adsorption and
  DNA injection into restrictive bacterial strains! This phenomenon
  became the topic of Daisy Dussoix's doctoral thesis, who very
  carefully not only studied the DNA degradation of phage that was
  not properly modified, but who also tried to detect parallels
  between the fate of unmodified DNA in restrictive conditions and
  of irradiated DNA in normal host cells.<br>
  <br>
  Within about one year of study, it had become clear that
  strain-specific restriction and modification directly affected
  the DNA, without however causing mutations. It soon also became
  obvious that restriction and modification were properties of the
  bacterial strains and acted not only on infecting bacteriophage
  DNA, but also on cellular DNA as manifested in conjugation
  experiments. These findings were reported by myself and Daisy
  Dussoix for the first time to the scientific community during the
  First International Biophysics Congress held in Stockholm in the
  summer of 1961. In a more extended version I presented them in
  1962 to the Science Faculty of the University of Geneva as my
  work of habilitation as privatdocent. This work earned me in the
  same year the Plantamour-Pr&eacute;vost prize of the University of
  Geneva.<br>
  <br>
  At a time before the Swiss Universities received direct financial
  help from the federal government, the Swiss National Science
  Foundation awarded "personal grants" to qualified researchers to
  allow them to guide projects of fundamental research at a Swiss
  University. I was lucky to benefit from such a support form 1965
  to 1970. These years were devoted to hard work to consolidate the
  preliminary data and the concepts resulting from them, and to
  extend the acquired notions, in particular with regard to the
  mechanisms of modification by nucleotide methylation, with regard
  to the genetic control of restriction and modification and with
  regard to the enzymology and molecular mechanisms of these
  reactions.<br>
  <br>
  This work would not have been possible without a very fruitful
  help by a large number of collaborators in my own laboratory and
  of colleagues working on related topics in their own
  laboratories. I was extremely lucky to receive in my laboratory
  in the basement of the Physics Institute of the University of
  Geneva a number of first class graduate students, postdoctoral
  fellows and senior scientists. It is virtually impossible to list
  them all in this context, but my warmest collective thanks go to
  all of them. In 1964 Bill Wood laid out a solid basis for the
  genetics of the restiction and modification systems <i>Eco</i>K
  and <i>Eco</i>B. Later, Stuart
  Linn, profiting from his fruitful contacts with Bob Yuan and
  Matt
  Meselson, who worked in the USA on the enzymology of
  <i>Eco</i>K restriction, set the basis for in vitro studies with
  <i>Eco</i>B restriction and modification activities. These
  studies culminated in the final proof that modification in <i>E.
  coli</i> B and K is brought about by nucleotide methylation. This
  concept had found its first experimental evidence during my two
  months' visit in 1963 with Gunther Stent at the University of
  California in Berkeley. Several years later Urs K&uuml;hnlein, a
  Ph. D student, and John Smith, working for various lengths of
  time with us, succeeded in careful in vivo and in vitro
  measurements on methylation to validate and extend the earlier
  conclusions. Their experiments also brought important conclusions
  with regard to the concept of the sites of recognition on the DNA
  for the restriction and modification enzymes.<br>
  <br>
  As an illustration that my work has not always been easy and
  accompanied by success, I would like to refer to my long,
  fruitless and thus largely unpublished attempts to find
  experimental evidence for the diversification of restriction and
  modification systems in the course of evolution. Systems
  <i>Eco</i>K and <i>Eco</i>B form a closely related family as
  judged from genetic and functional studies. Another family is
  formed by restriction and modification systems <i>Eco</i>P1 and
  <i>Eco</i>P15. One could expect that mutations affecting the part
  of the enzymes responsible for recognition of the specificity
  site on the DNA might result in new members of the family,
  recognizing new specificity sites on DNA. We have in vain spent
  much time in search for such evolutionary changes both after
  mutagenization and after recombination between two members of the
  same family of the above mentioned systems. That the basic idea
  for this search was good was recently shown by Len Bullas,
  Charles Colson and Aline van Pel (J. Gen. Microbiol. 95, 166-
  172, 1976) who encountered such a new system in their work with
  <i>Salmonella</i> recombinants.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965 I was promoted extraordinary professor for molecular
  genetics at the University of Geneva. Not only did I always enjoy
  a continued contact with the students, but I also considered
  teaching as a welcome obligation to keep my scientific interests
  wide. Although we had a few excellent students in our
  laboratories, the teaching of molecular genetics at the
  University of Geneva in the 1960's suffered a bit from a lack of
  interest by the young generation. This might have been related to
  a more general lack of public interest for this field, which was
  perhaps due to the economic structure of the city of Geneva and
  its environments. These, at that time perhaps more subconscious
  concerns, might have helped me to accept in 1968 an offer for a
  professorship at the University of Basel, since I felt that more general
  interest would be given to molecular genetics in this city with a
  long tradition of biomedical research at its industries.<br>
  <br>
  I started my new appointment at the University of Basel in
  October 1971 after having spent one year as a visiting Miller
  Research Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology of the
  University of California in Berkeley. In Basel, I was one of the
  first persons to work in the newly constructed Biozentrum, which houses several University
  Departments, in particular those of Biophysics, Biochemistry,
  Microbiology, Structural Biology, Cell Biology and Pharmacology.
  This diversity within the same house largely contributes to
  fruitful collaborative projects and it helps to keep horizons
  broad both in research and teaching. Additional contributions to
  this goal come from contacts with other nearby University
  Institutes as well as with the private research Institutions in
  the city.<br>
  <br>
  Since my coming to Basel, I devoted relatively little of my time
  to further studies on restriction and modification mechanisms.
  Not that I have lost my interest in them. On the contrary, I was
  fortunate to be able to set up a junior group which under the
  leadership of Bob Yuan and more recently of Tom Bickle, became
  rapidly quite independent, and it continues to be very successful
  in its investigations on the more detailed aspects of the
  molecular mechanisms of restriction and modification. This
  allowed me to turn my main interests back to other mechanisms
  affecting either positively or negatively the exchange of genetic
  material. For a number of years Nick Gschwind, a Ph. D. student,
  and Dorothea Scandella, a postdoctoral fellow, explored two other
  mechanisms found in some <i>E. coli</i> strains or mutants and
  affecting more specifically than restriction and modification
  systems particular steps in the propagation of bacteriophage
  lambda.<br>
  <br>
  For the last several years I have turned my principal interests
  to the intriguing activities of insertion elements and
  transposons, which by their actions on genetic rearrangements,
  seem to be the main driving forces of evolution in
  microorganisms. Because of their independence on extended
  nucleotide homologies these forces bring about exchange of
  largely unrelated genetic materials. Our postdoctoral workers
  Katsutoshi Mise, Shigeru Iida and J&uuml;rg Meyer brought
  important contributions to the understanding of these phenomena,
  mainly by the use of the bacteriophage P1 genome as a natural
  vector of transposable elements. But general knowledge on this to
  my mind extremely important field is still very scarce and
  deserves continued attention.<br>
  <br>
  Solid notions on naturally occurring genetic exchange between
  organisms that are not directly related will also form a good
  basis for a scientific evaluation of conjectural risks of in
  vitro recombinant DNA research. Since this research largely makes
  use of restriction enzymes, although it in no way fully depends
  on them, I consider it a personal obligation to contribute to the
  best of my abilities to the solution of questions which arose in
  the scientific and public debate on this research in the last few
  years. I see two ways to reach this goal. The first is scientific
  and tends as just stated to better understand what nature does in
  its nonhomologous genetic exchange. The second is rather
  political and it consists in actions to stimulate continued
  awareness of responsibility to work with a maximum of care in all
  scientific investigations, which should, however, be allowed to
  be done under optimal academic freedom.<br>
  <br>
  A curriculum vitae would be incomplete without reference to my
  private life. I am fortunate to have found a continued support
  and steady encouragement by my family, in particular by my
  parents, and, since we became married in 1966, by my wife
  Antonia. In response to their interest and understanding for my
  scientific activities, I have tried to give them my personal
  affection needed for a harmonious life. Our two daughters Silvia
  and Caroline were born in 1968 and in 1974, respectively. When
  Silvia learned that I had been honored by the Nobelprize she not
  only wanted to know what this is, but also why I was chosen as a
  Laureate. After explaining her in simple terms the basic concepts
  of the mechanisms of restriction enzymes, she, after some
  reflection, reexpressed this message in her own terms by a tale,
  which in the meantime has found wide diffusion around the world.
  It might thus be justified to finish this curriculum vitae by its
  reproduction:<br>
  <br>
  <i>"The tale of the king and his servants</i><br>
  <br>
  When I come to the laboratory of my father, I usually see some
  plates lying on the tables. These plates contain colonies of
  bacteria. These colonies remind me of a city with many
  inhabitants. In each bacterium there is a king. He is very long,
  but skinny. The king has many servants. These are thick and
  short, almost like balls. My father calls the king DNA, and the
  servants enzymes. The king is like a book, in which everything is
  noted on the work to be done by the servants. For us human beings
  these instructions of the king are a mystery.<br>
  <br>
  My father has discovered a servant who serves as a pair of
  scissors. If a foreign king invades a bacterium, this servant can
  cut him in small fragments, but he does not do any harm to his
  own king.<br>
  <br>
  Clever people use the servant with the scissors to find out the
  secrets of the kings. To do so, they collect many servants with
  scissors and put them onto a king, so that the king is cut into
  pieces. With the resulting little pieces it is much easier to
  investigate the secrets. For this reason my father received the
  Nobel Prize for the discovery of the servant with the
  scissors".</p>
