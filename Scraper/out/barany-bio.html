  <h1>Robert B&aacute;r&aacute;ny - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="barany.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Robert
  B&aacute;r&aacute;ny</b> was born on April 22, 1876, in Vienna. His
  father was the manager of a farm estate and his mother, Maria
  Hock, was the daughter of a well-known Prague scientist, and it
  was her intellectucal influence that was most pronounced in the
  family. Robert was the eldest of six children. When he was quite
  young he contracted tuberculosis of the bones, which resulted in
  permanent stiffness of his kneejoint. It is thought that this
  illness first led him to take an interest in medicine. The
  disability, however, did not prevent him from playing tennis and
  walking in the mountains, right through his life. He was always
  top of the form - in the primary school, the grammar school, and
  was among the best of his year even at the university.<br>
  <br>
  After completing his medical studies at Vienna University
  in 1900, B&aacute;r&aacute;ny attended the lectures of Professor C.
  von Noorden in Frankfurt am Main for one year, and then studied
  at the psychiatric-neurological clinic of Professor Kracpelin in
  Freiburg i.Br. It was there that his interest in neurological
  problems was first awakened. On his return to Vienna he became
  the pupil of Professor Gussenbauer, the surgeon, and finally, in
  1903, accepted a post as demonstrator at the Otological Clinic
  under Professor Politzer. He followed up the theories of
  Flourens, Purkinje, Mach, Breuer and others, and clarified the
  physiology and pathology of human vestibular apparatus. He was
  awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in this field in 1914. The
  news of this award reached B&aacute;r&aacute;ny in a Russian
  prisoner-of-war camp; he had been attached to the Austrian army
  as a civilian surgeon and had tended soldiers with head injuries,
  which fact had enabled him to continue his neurological studies
  on the correlation of the vestibular apparatus, the cerebellum
  and the muscular apparatus. Following the personal intervention
  of Prince Carl of Sweden on behalf of the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1917/index.html">Red Cross</a>, he was released
  from the prisoner-of-war camp in 1916 and was presented with the
  Nobel Prize by the King of Sweden at Stockholm.<br>
  <br>
  B&aacute;r&aacute;ny returned to Vienna the same year, but was
  bitterly disappointed by the attitude of his Austrian colleagues,
  who reproached him for having made only incomplete references in
  his works to the discoveries of other scientists, on whose
  theories they said his work was based. These attacks resulted in
  B&aacute;r&aacute;ny leaving Vienna to accept the post of Principal
  and Professor of an Otological Institute in Uppsala, where he
  remained for the remainder of his life. Holmgren and a number of
  famous Swedish otologists published a paper in defence of
  B&aacute;r&aacute;ny.<br>
  <br>
  During the latter part of his life B&aacute;r&aacute;ny studied the
  causes of muscular rheurmatism, and continued working on a book
  dealing with this subject even after he had suffered a stroke and
  was partially paralysed. B&aacute;r&aacute;ny married Ida Felicitas
  Berger in 1909. They had two sons; the elder became Professor of
  Pharmacology at the University of Uppsala, his brother Assistant
  Professor of Medicine at the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1914/barany-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Caroline Institute</a>, Stockholm; and one daughter, Ingrid, who became a psychiatrist.</p>

  They also had a

  He died at Uppsala on April 8, 1936.</p>
