  <h2>The Suffering People of Europe</h2>

  <p>In the Capitoline Museum in Rome is a
  sculpture in marble which, in its simple pathos, seems to me to
  be a most beautiful creation. It is the statue of the "Dying
  Gaul". He is lying on the battlefield, mortally wounded. The
  vigorous body, hardened by work and combat, is sinking into
  death. The head, with its coarse hair, is bowed, the strong neck
  bends, the rough powerful workman's hand, till recently wielding
  the sword, now presses against the ground in a last effort to
hold up the drooping body.</p>

  <p>He was driven to fight for foreign gods
  whom he did not know, far from his own country. And thus he met
  his fate. Now he lies there, dying in silence. The noise of the
  fray no longer reaches his ear. His dimmed eyes are turned
  inward, perhaps on a final vision of his childhood home where
  life was simple and happy, of his birthplace deep in the forests
  of Gaul.</p>

  <p>That is how I see mankind in its suffering;
  that is how I see the suffering people of Europe, bleeding to
  death on deserted battlefields after conflicts which to a great
  extent were not their own.</p>

  <p>This is the outcome of the lust for power,
  the imperialism, the militarism, that have run amok across the
  earth. The golden produce of the earth has been trampled under
  iron feet, the land lies in ruins everywhere, and the foundations
  of its communities are crumbling. People bow their heads in
  silent despair. The shrill battle cries still clamor around them,
  but they hardly hear them anymore. Cast out of the lost Eden,
  they look back upon the simple basic values of life. The soul of
  the world is mortally sick, its courage broken, its ideals
  tarnished, and the will to live gone; the horizon is hazy, hidden
  behind burning clouds of destruction, and faith in the dawn of
  mankind is no more.</p>

  <p>Where is the remedy to be sought? At the
  hands of politicians? They may mean well enough, many of them at
  any rate, but politics and new political programs are no longer
  of service to the world - the world has had only too many of
  them. In the final analysis, the struggle of the politician
  amounts to little more than a struggle for power.</p>

  <p>The diplomats perhaps? Their intentions may
  also be good enough, but they are once and for all a sterile race
  which has brought mankind more harm than good over the years.
  Call to mind the settlements arranged after the great wars - the
  Treaty of Westphalia<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the
  Congress in Vienna with the Holy Alliance<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and others. Has a single one of
  these diplomatic congresses contributed to any great extent to
  the progress of the world? One is here reminded of the famous
  words of Oxenstjerna<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> to his
  son when he complained about the negotiations in Westphalia: "If
  you only knew, my son, with how little wisdom the world is
  ruled."</p>

  <p>We can no longer look to traditional
  leadership for any hope of salvation. We have of late experienced
  one diplomatic and political congress after another; has any one
  of these brought the solution any nearer? There is at present one
  in progress in Lausanne<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Let
  us hope that it will bring us the longed-for peace in the East so
  that at least one delicate question may be resolved.</p>

  <p>But what of the main evil itself, the heart
  of the disease? It is whispered that France does not want to
  reach a final settlement with Germany, does not want Germany to
  finish paying her indemnities. For in that case, the pretext for
  occupying the western side of the Rhine would be removed, and she
  could no longer unsettle German industry with threats against the
  Ruhr district. This is naturally only malicious slander, but how
  common are such rumors!</p>

  <p>It is also whispered that neither do. the
  industrial leaders of Germany desire a final agreement with
  France. They would prefer the uncertainty to continue so that the
  value of the mark will fall steadily, enabling German industry to
  survive longer. For, if a settlement were to come, then the mark
  would be stabilized or even rise in value, and German industry
  would be ruined since it would no longer be competitive.</p>

  <p>Whether these things are true or not, the
  mere fact that they are uttered at all reflects the manner in
  which the whole European community and its way of life have been
  and still are toys in the hands of reckless political and
  financial speculators - perhaps largely bunglers, inferior men
  who do not realize the outcome of their actions, but who still
  speculate and gamble with the most valuable interests of European
  civilization.</p>

  <p>And for what? Only for power. This
  unfortunate struggle, this appalling trampling of everything and
  everyone, this destructive conflict between the social classes
  and even between peoples exists for power alone!</p>

  <p>When one has stood face to face with
  famine, with death by starvation itself, then surely one should
  have had one's eyes opened to the full extent of this misfortune.
  When one has beheld the great beseeching eyes in the starved
  faces of children staring hopelessly into the fading daylight,
  the eyes of agonized mothers while they press their dying
  children to their empty breasts in silent despair, and the
  ghostlike men lying exhausted on mats on cabin floors, with only
  the merciful release of death to wait for, then surely one must
  understand where all this is leading, understand a little of the
  true nature of the question. This is not the struggle for power,
  but a single and terrible accusation against those who still do
  not want to see, a single great prayer for a drop of mercy to
  give men a chance to live.</p>

  <p>Surely those who have seen at first hand
  the destitution pervading our misgoverned Europe and actually
  experienced some of the endless suffering must realize that the
  world can no longer rely on panaceas, paper, and words. These
  must be replaced by action, by persevering and laborious effort,
  which must begin at the bottom in order to build up the world
  again.</p>

  <p>The history of mankind rises and falls like
  the waves. We have fallen into wave-troughs before in Europe. A
  similar trough occurred a hundred years ago after the Napoleonic
  Wars. Everyone who has read the excellent work of
  Worm-M&uuml;ller<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> describing
  the conditions here in Norway during that time must have noticed
  the many remarkable similarities between the situation then and
  now. It may be a consolation to know that the abyss of those
  times disappeared and that Norway struggled upward again; but it
  took a depressingly long time, thirty to forty years.</p>

  <p>This time, as far as I can see, the trough
  is even deeper and more extensive, embracing the major part of
  Europe, and, in addition, exists under conditions that now are
  more complex. It is true that industry did exist at that time,
  but people lived off the land to a far greater extent. Now
  industry has come into its own, and it is more difficult to bring
  recovery to industry after a depression than to agriculture. A
  few good years will put farming back on its feet, but many years
  are required to develop new markets for industry. All the same,
  we may reasonably hope that the process of revival will be more
  rapid this time, for everything happens more quickly in our day
  because of our systems of communication and the vast apparatus of
  economic facilities that we now possess. But there are as yet few
  signs of progress. We have still not reached the bottom of the
  wave-trough.</p>

  <p>What is the basic feeling of people all
  over Europe? There is no doubt that for a great many it is one of
  despair or distrust of everything and everyone, supported by hate
  and envy. This hatred is each day disseminated among nations and
  classes.</p>

  <p>No future, however, can be built on
  despair, distrust, hatred, and envy.</p>

  <p>The first prerequisite, surely, is
  understanding - first of all, an understanding of the cause and
  the nature of the disease itself, an understanding of the trends
  that mark our times and of what is happening among the mass of
  the population. In short, an understanding of the psychology of
  every characteristic of our apparently confused and confounded
  European society.</p>

  <p>Such an understanding is certainly not
  attainable in a day. But the first condition for its final
  establishment is the sincere will to understand; this is a great
  step in the right direction. The continuous mutual abuse of
  groups holding differing views, which we witness in the
  newspapers, will certainly never lead to progress. Abuse
  convinces no one; it only degrades and brutalizes the abuser.
  Lies and unjust accusations achieve still less; they often
  finally boomerang on those who originate them.</p>

  <p>It must also always be remembered that
  there is hardly a trend or movement in the community which does
  not in some degree possess a reason and right of its own, be it
  socialism or capitalism, be it fascism or even the hated
  bolshevism. But it is because of blind fanaticism for and against
  - especially against - that conflicts come to a head and lead to
  heartrending struggles and destruction; whereas discussion,
  understanding, and tolerance might have turned this energy into
  valuable progress.</p>

  <p>An expansion of this subject is not
  possible here; suffice it to say that the parable about seeing
  the mote in your neighbor's eye while not aware of the beam in
  your own<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> is valid for all
  times, and not least for the age in which we live.</p>

  <p>But when understanding is absent and
  especially when the will to understand is lacking, then that
  fermenting uncertainty, which threatens us with total
  destruction, arises. No one knows what tomorrow will bring. Many
  people live as though each day were the last, thus sliding into a
  state of general decadence. From this point the decline is steady
  and inexorable.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the worst that this insecurity,
  this speculation in uncertainty, creates, is the fear of work; it
  was bred during the war, and it has grown steadily since. It was
  bred by the stock-jobbing and the speculation familiar to us all,
  whereby people could make fortunes in a short time, thinking they
  could live on them for the rest of their lives without having to
  work and toil. This created an aversion to work which has lasted
  to this very day. There are still some who will honestly and
  wholeheartedly settle down to hard toil, but the only places
  where I have met this sincere will to work are those where the
  angel of death by starvation is reaping his terrible harvest.</p>

  <p>I shall always remember a day in a village
  east of the Volga to which only one-third of its inhabitants had
  returned; of the remaining two-thirds, some had fled and the rest
  had died of starvation. Most of the animals had been slaughtered;
  but courage had still not been completely extinguished, and
  although their prospects were bleak, the people still had faith
  in the future. "Give us seed", they said, "and we will sow it in
  the soil." "Yes", we replied, "but what will you do without
  animals to pull the plough?" "That does not matter", they said;
  "if there are no animals, we will put ourselves and our women and
  children to the plough." It was not selfindulgence that was
  speaking here, not extravagance, not mere showmanship - it was
  the very will to stay alive, which had not given in.</p>

  <p>Must we all live through the bitter pangs
  of hunger before we learn the real value of work?</p>

  <p>I might also mention conditions in Germany.
  I have been told that because of short working hours and
  restricted output, Germany does not produce the coal needed for
  her own requirements and must therefore buy coal from England - I
  believe a figure of one million tons a month was mentioned - and
  pay for it with foreign currency. But if the working hours were
  increased to ten hours a day, Germany could herself produce an
  adequate supply of coal. That is but one example.</p>

  <p>In Switzerland where everything is grinding
  to a halt, where industry is ruined because it can no longer
  produce at prices attractive to world markets, I was told that if
  the daily working hours were to be increased to ten, with
  reasonable pay, the workers would find employment for the whole
  week instead of for the three days during which the factories are
  now running at a loss merely to stay in existence. Moreover, the
  workmen themselves would gladly work longer if they dared, but
  they cannot do so lest they contravene their union's program.
  Such is the situation.</p>

  <p>This sad state of affairs can, it is true,
  be blamed partly on the unpredictable fluctuations in the value
  of money. These are characteristic problems which, it appears to
  me, not even the experts can satisfactorily explain.</p>

  <p>But below the surface of these obvious
  factors there are, quite plainly, greater internal ones. It is an
  undeniable fact that people cannot live without working, and
  there has been too little work for too long. It will be asked:
  "What is the purpose of work if there is no market for the
  products?" And markets are indeed not there. But neither can
  markets be created without work. If no work is done, if markets
  are not created where they should exist, then no purchasing power
  will be developed, and everyone must suffer in consequence. The
  universal disease is, in fact, lack of work. Even honest work
  cannot thrive, however, except where there are peace and
  confidence: confidence in one's self, confidence in others, and
  confidence in the future.</p>

  <p>Here we strike at the heart of the matter.
  How then can this confidence in peace be inspired? Can it proceed
  from politicians and diplomats? I have already expressed my
  opinion of them. They can, perhaps, do something, but I am not
  particularly convinced of that, nor of the ability of politicians
  of the individual countries to achieve anything in this
  situation. In my opinion, the only avenue to salvation lies in
  cooperation between all nations on a basis of honest
  endeavor.</p>

  <p>I believe that the only road to this goal
  lies through the League of Nations. If this fails to introduce a
  new era, then I see no salvation, at any rate at present. But are
  we right in placing so much faith in the League of Nations? What
  has it done so far to promote peace and confidence? In asking
  this question we must remember that the League is still a young
  plant that can easily be damaged and prevented from growing by
  the frost of doubt. We should bear in mind that the League can
  attain full powers only when it embraces all nations, including
  the big ones still outside<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
  But even in its short lifetime, it can claim credit for actions
  which point to a brighter future. It has already in its short
  active life settled many controversial questions which would
  otherwise have led, if not to war, at least to serious
  disturbances.</p>

  <p>One example was the &Aring;land controversy
  between Sweden and Finland. Though there were some who were
  dissatisfied with the solution<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, they nevertheless accepted it,
  thus preventing further trouble.</p>

  <p>A serious frontier dispute arose between
  Yugoslavia and Albania. Serbian troops had already crossed the
  border. The League of Nations intervened, settled the question,
  and both parties accepted the solution<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> without further bloodshed.</p>

  <p>Mention can also be made of the Silesian
  question which threatened serious trouble between Germany and
  Poland. This too has been settled - very badly according to some,
  while others maintain that any other solution would have been
  impossible in view of previous agreements reached in the Treaty
  of Versailles<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. But the
  fact is that the settlement has been sanctioned by both parties
  and that it has not led to any further trouble.</p>

  <p>Another example is that of Poland and
  Lithuania. It is true that the League of Nations did not in this
  case reach any settlement, the problem having proved too
  difficult because of various reasons which I am not going to
  delve into here. The fact is, however, that the act of
  investigation by the League of Nations in itself prevented the
  two parties from taking up arms<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It may be claimed that these were
  controversies between small nations, but what if real issues
  arose between greater powers - would they yield to the
  arbitration of the League of Nations? Well, I point to the
  Silesian question again. Germany is no small nation, and it is
  moreover a fact that the victorious great powers which set out to
  settle the question were unable to reach agreement; so the matter
  was referred to the League of Nations. Recently, however, we have
  had an even better example of great powers submitting to the
  judgment of the League of Nations in an issue between Great
  Britain and France.</p>

  <p>In 1921 the French government issued a
  decree declaring that everyone living in Tunisia and Morocco was
  compelled to do national service. Thus British subjects living in
  the French protectorates were liable to conscription in the
  French army. The British government objected strongly, while the
  French maintained that this was an internal problem. Neither
  would give in and the controversy became serious. Nine years ago
  such a question could only have ended in a war or at best in an
  expensive diplomatic conference. At that time there was no world
  organization which could have dealt with such a question. Now,
  however, it was referred to the League of Nations, and the
  tension was immediately released<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The mere fact that the League of Nations
  has set up the Permanent Court of International Justice<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> constitutes a great and important
  step toward the more peaceful ordering of the world, a step in
  the direction of creating confidence among nations.</p>

  <p>If any doubt still exists about the
  position now occupied by the League of Nations in the minds of
  people, reference can be made to the last election in Great
  Britain. Of the 1,386 candidates standing, only three dared to
  face their electors with a declaration that they were opponents
  of the League of Nations. Two or three more made no mention of
  the subject, but all the rest expressed their faith in the
  League.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, however, the greatest and
  most important achievement of the League so far, and one which
  presages a really new and better future for Europe, is the
  measure initiated at the last Assembly in Geneva, that of
  arranging an international loan to Austria<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> to give her a chance of surviving
  the threat of economic ruin. This action raises hope for yet
  more; it is the prelude to a new and promising trend in the
  economic politics of Europe.</p>

  <p>It is my conviction that the German
  problem, the intricate differences between Germany and her
  opponents, cannot and will not be solved until it too has been
  laid before the League of Nations<a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, the difficult question of
  total or partial disarmament was first broached at the last
  meeting in Geneva. Here, as well as in most other fields of the
  League's activity, there is one name which stands out, namely
  that of <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/index.html">Lord Robert
  Cecil</a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Again we must
  keep in mind, particularly in the matter of partial disarmament,
  the serious difficulties arising from the fact that there are
  important military powers which are not yet members of the
  League.</p>

  <p>But more important by far than any partial
  disarmament of armies and fleets, is the "disarmament" of the
  people from within, the generation, in fact, of sympathy in the
  souls of men. Here too, in the great and important work that has
  been carried on, the League of Nations has taken an active
  part.</p>

  <p>I must, however, first mention the gigantic
  task performed by the Americans under the remarkable leadership
  of Hoover<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>. It was begun
  during the war with the Belgian Relief, when many thousands of
  Belgians, children and adults, were supported. After the war, it
  was extended to Central Europe, where hundreds of thousands of
  children were given new hope by the invaluable aid from the
  Americans, and finally, but not least, to Russia. When the whole
  story of this work is written, it will take pride of place as a
  glorious page in the annals of mankind, and its charity will
  shine like a brilliant star in a long and dark night. At the same
  time, the Americans have, through other organizations such as the
  American Red Cross and the Near East Relief, achieved the
  unbelievable in the Balkans, in Asia Minor, and now, finally, in
  Greece. Many European organizations must also not be forgotten.
  In particular, divisions of the Red Cross in different countries,
  among them our own, have contributed much during and after the
  war.</p>

  <p>The League of Nations sponsored activities
  of this nature soon after its formation. Its first task was the
  repatriation of the many thousands of prisoners of war still
  scattered round the world two years after the war, mostly in
  Siberia and Eastern and Central Europe. I do not intend to dwell
  on this theme since it has already been mentioned at the meeting
  in the Nobel Institute. I shall say only that, as a result of
  this effort, nearly 450,000 prisoners were sent back to their
  homes and, in many instances, to productive work.</p>

  <p>Immediately after this, the League took up
  the fight against epidemics which were then threatening to spread
  from the East, and worked to control disease in Poland, along the
  Russian border, and in Russia itself. The League has, through its
  excellent Commission on Epidemics<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>, worked effectively to prevent
  the spread of epidemics and has saved thousands from destitution
  and annihilation.</p>

  <p>Efforts are now being made, through a
  special organization sponsored by the League of Nations<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>, to provide subsistence aid for
  destitute Russian refugees, more than a million of whom are
  scattered all over Europe.</p>

  <p>Mention must also be made of the work now
  in progress in support of famine-stricken refugees in Asia Minor
  and Greece<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>. It is true
  that it has still barely begun, but this work too can be of the
  greatest importance. Under the present conditions in these areas,
  there is a threat of disorganization and despair worse than
  anywhere else in Europe. If this danger can be averted or at
  least reduced, if this malignant growth can to some extent be
  eradicated, then there will be one such cancer the less in the
  European community, one risk the less of unrest, of disturbance,
  of dissolution of states in the future.</p>

  <p>Having already emphasized the significance
  of this type of work, I must do so once more. The relief in
  thousands of homes in seeing the return of their menfolk, the
  help received by them in their distress; the gratitude this
  inspires, the confidence in people and in the future, the
  prospect of sounder working conditions - all this is, I believe,
  of greater importance for the cause of peace than many ambitious
  political moves that now seldom reach far beyond a limited circle
  of politicians and diplomats.</p>

  <p>Finally, a few words about the assistance
  to Russia<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>. In this the
  League of Nations did not participate, a fact which I deeply
  regret because I cannot but believe that had the League, with its
  great authority, lent its support while there was still time, the
  situation in Russia would have been saved, and conditions in both
  Russia and Europe would now be totally different and much
  better.</p>

  <p>I shall not go into greater detail on the
  work that has been done. I wish only to emphasize that the
  difficulty certainly did not lie in finding the food or
  transporting it to those who were starving. No, there was more
  than enough grain in the world at that time, and adequate
  distribution facilities were available. The problem lay in
  obtaining funds, an obstacle which has always bedeviled such
  attempts to supply aid - not least so at this moment.</p>

  <p>European governments were unwilling to
  sanction the loan of ten million pounds sterling which appeared
  indispensable if the starving millions of Russia were to be saved
  and the famine prevented from turning into a tragedy, not only
  for Russia, but for all Europe. The only alternative, therefore,
  was to rely on private contributions and to institute an appeal
  for charity to individuals all over the world.</p>

  <p>The result exceeded every expectation.
  Donations poured in from all countries, and not least from our
  own. In spite of the existence of people here at home who thought
  it right to oppose the collection, the contribution of our little
  country was still so great, thanks to the Norwegian Parliament,
  the Norwegian government, and the excellent work of the Famine
  Committee, that had the big countries contributed in proportion,
  the famine in Russia would now be a thing of the past.</p>

  <p>One notable exception outside Europe must
  be mentioned. Once again, the American people contributed more
  than any other, first through the Hoover organization and then
  through the government itself, which donated twenty million
  dollars to the fight against famine on the condition that the
  Russian government would provide ten million for the purchase of
  seed. Altogether, America has certainly contributed fifty to
  sixty million dollars to the struggle against the Russian famine,
  and has thus saved the lives of countless millions.</p>

  <p>But why were there some who did not want to
  help? Ask them! In all probability their motives were political.
  They epitomize sterile self-importance and the lack of will to
  understand people who think differently, characteristics which
  now constitute the greatest danger in Europe. They call us
  romantics, weak, stupid, sentimental idealists, perhaps because
  we have some faith in the good which exists even in our opponents
  and because we believe that kindness achieves more than cruelty.
  It may be that we are simpleminded, but I do not think that we
  are dangerous. Those, however, who stagnate behind their
  political programs, offering nothing else to suffering mankind,
  to starving, dying millions - they are the scourge of Europe.</p>

  <p>Russia is not alone in being threatened by
  a new and terrible famine. The situation in Europe also looks
  black enough. No one knows yet where it will end. The destitution
  is so great, so nearly insurmountable, the conditions so
  desperate, even in the rich fertile area of Russia, not to
  mention other countries, that in spite of widespread private
  generosity, what can be provided constitutes only a drop in the
  ocean.</p>

  <p>Everyone must join in this work. We must
  take up the fiery cross and light the beacons so that they shine
  from every mountain. We must raise our banner in every country
  and forge the links of brotherhood around the world. The
  governments too must stand shoulder to shoulder, not in a battle
  line, but in a sincere effort to achieve the new era.</p>

  <p>The festival of Christmas is approaching
  when the message to mankind is: Peace on earth.</p>

  <p>Never has suffering and bewildered mankind
  awaited the Prince of Peace with greater longing, the Prince of
  Charity who holds aloft a white banner bearing the one word
  inscribed in golden letters: "Work".</p>

  <p>All of us can become workers in his army on
  its triumphant march across the earth to raise a new spirit in a
  new generation - to bring men love of their fellowmen and an
  honest desire for peace - to bring back the will to work and the
  joy of work - to bring faith in the dawn of a new day.</p>
