              Ms. Jody Williams is the founding coordinator of the International 
              Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which was formally launched by 
              six nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in October of 1992. Ms. 
              Williams has overseen the growth of the ICBL to more than 1,000 
              NGOs in more than sixty countries. She has served as the chief strategist 
              and spokesperson for the campaign. Working in a unprecedented cooperative 
              effort with governments, UN 
              bodies and the <a href="../1917/index.html">International Committee 
              of the Red Cross</a>, the ICBL achieved its goal of an international 
              treaty banning antipersonnel landmines during the diplomatic conference 
              held in Oslo in September 1997.<br>
              <br>
              In her capacity as ICBL coordinator, she has written and spoken 
              extensively on the problem of landmines and the movement to ban 
              them. In recognition of her expertise on the issue, Ms. Williams 
              was invited to serve as a technical adviser to the UN's Study on 
              the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children, led by Ms. Graca Machel, 
              former first lady of Mozambique.<br>
              <br>
              Prior to beginning the ICBL, Ms. Williams worked for eleven years 
              to build public awareness about U.S. policy toward Central America. 
              From 1986 to 1992, she developed and directed humanitarian relief 
              projects as the deputy director of the Los Angeles-based Medical 
              Aid for El Salvador. From 1984 to 1986, she was co-coordinator of 
              the Nicaragua-Honduras Education Project, leading fact-finding delegations 
              to the region. Previously, she taught English as a Second Language 
              (ESL) in Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Washington, D.C.<br>
