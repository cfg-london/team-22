  <h2>Serum Therapy in Therapeutics and Medical Science</h2>

  <p>Serum therapy in the form in which it finds
  application in the treatment of diphtheria patients is an
  antitoxic or detoxicating curative method. It is based on the
  view, held by L&ouml;ffler in Germany and by Roux in France, that
  the parasites causing diphtheria, the L&ouml;ffler diphtheria
  bacilli, do not themselves cause diphtheria, but that they
  produce poisons which cause the disease to develop. Without this
  preliminary work by L&ouml;ffler and Roux there would be no serum
  treatment for diphtheria.</p>

  <p>When the diphtheria poison is rendered
  harmless within the human organism, then the diphtheria bacilli
  behave like the innumerable micro-organisms which we absorb
  without suffering harm every day and like those micro-organisms
  which correspond morphologically with the diphtheria bacilli,
  but, from the outset, have no capacity to produce poisons
  (pseudo-diphtheria bacilli). The poison excreted by the bacilli
  is the diphtheria bacilli's dangerous weapon against the human
  being, without which weapon they would be delivered over
  helplessly to the natural prophylactic power of the living human
  organism.</p>

  <p>The way in which the diphtheria bacilli,
  after penetrating into the human body, release then poison and
  how this poison develops its destructive activity has been the
  subject of many interesting investigations, the result of which
  can be summed up briefly as follows: In a typical clinical
  picture of diphtheria in human beings, as summarized for the
  first time 80 years ago by the Frenchman Bretonneau, the
  diphtheria bacilli are first localized in the pharyngeal
  amygdala, which, in all probability, they reach principally via
  the breath, but also in substances which we take in by way of
  nourishment. In the niches and small cavities of the amygdala the
  diphtheria bacilli can multiply as though in an artificial
  incubator and excrete their poisons. In animals, the organ,
  called "amygdala" tonsils) on account of its shape (L. "amygdala"
  = almond), is missing and this is probably the reason why
  epidemics of diphtheria are the tragic privilege of human beings.
  The diphtheria poison gets into the blood stream by way of the
  lymphatic vessels and starts up inflammatory processes from there
  in the various organs. The inflammatory symptoms are outwardly
  visible chiefly in the proximity of the site of production, on
  the pharyngeal mucous membrane and in the larynx.</p>

  <p>If we now introduce the diphtheria serum as
  an antitoxin into the blood by injecting it under the skin, this
  antitoxin will reach all parts of the body to which the blood has
  access. If the injection takes place at a time when the
  diphtheria bacilli have not yet begun their destructive activity,
  then the secondary inflammatory phenomena of diphtheria toxicity
  will not arise. We speak then of immunization or of preventative
  or prophylactic serum therapy. If, on the other hand, the toxic
  process has already begun, then the already existing inflammatory
  processes will follow their natural course, for the anti-toxin
  exerts no influence, either useful or harmful, on the
  <i>substrata</i> of the inflammation, on the cells and organs. In
  this case, all that can influence the already existing disease is
  <i>firstly</i> to render harmless the poison which has already
  reached the body fluids, and <i>secondly</i> to prevent the entry
  of fresh supplies of active poison into the blood stream. It is
  easily understandable that the diphtheria serum has an
  <i>abortive</i> action, but it is not the <i>disease</i> which is
  cut off but the creation of new disease-engendering
  substances.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from this how important
  <i>early</i> use of diphtheria serum is. The longer one delays
  the injection after the start of the illness, the more existing
  focal points of inflammation and the more disturbances of vital
  functions will threaten health and life.</p>

  <p>In addition, a certain time must elapse
  from the injection of the serum until its antitoxic and healing
  activity in the affected parts of the body can develop. Also,
  serum injected under the skin does not pass straight into the
  blood vessels but first into the lymphatic vessels. From here it
  takes several hours before passing gradually into the blood
  stream and further time still is needed before it is diffused,
  not only everywhere in the blood stream, but also into the
  extra-vascular poison-containing fluids. This interval between
  injection and detoxification can mean the difference between life
  and death for the threatened individual and I have asked myself
  whether, in the interest of the patient, this interval could not
  be shortened. It can indeed be done if the serum is injected
  directly into the blood stream instead of under the skin.
  According to experimental investigations carried out by my
  erstwhile collaborators, Dr. Knorr and Dr. Ransom, about 8 hours
  can be saved in this way. Furthermore, it is possible to have a
  local effect on the poison-producing localities by using dilute
  serum solution as a mouth wash to rinse the poisoned pharyngeal
  organs. So that we may recognize the position which serum
  therapeutics have gained in the treatment of diseases, as
  compared with other methods in medicine, I hope you will allow me
  to use one or two technical terms, not only because these have,
  during the course of time, come to embody a well-known and
  generally respected concept, but also because these technical
  expressions, taken from Latin and Greek, are more suited to
  international understanding than more modern expressions which we
  might use in their place.</p>

  <p>Since earliest times, in that sphere of
  medicine which is responsible for the analysis of the symptoms of
  disease, their cause and natural or artificially induced
  conquest, namely pathology, humoral and solidistic pathologists
  have been in opposition to one another. In the last century the
  solidistic pathologists won the upper hand and the form which
  Virchow has given to the solidistic pathology by the foundation
  of <i>cellular</i> pathology is now so firmly established that
  the old humoral pathology can probably be regarded as having been
  finally laid to rest. With the victory of solidistic
  <i>pathology</i>, however, there has now arrived, pari passu, in
  the teaching hospitals a solidistic and cellular <i>therapy</i>
  of which one cannot speak so highly as in the case of the
  cellular <i>pathology</i>.</p>

  <p>In the treatment of wounds, solidistic
  trend in therapy expressed itself more in salves, balsams,
  alteratives, which were supposed to influence the diseased body
  elements in ill-looking wounds to new and different activity. As
  you know, this aspect of solidistic therapy has vanished from
  medicine since Lister, with epoch-making success, laid down the
  principle, which he taught us to follow down to the smallest
  detail: "Keep fingers away from wounds, leave the cells as much
  as possible undisturbed, but take care that noxious agents from
  <i>outside</i> are kept away from wounds and cells".</p>

  <p>In internal medicine, however, solidistic
  therapy remained "faute de mieux". New remedies were constantly
  coming on to the market and into use in practice which were
  supposed to curb, with anti-febrins, the vigorous activity of the
  cells aroused by fever, encourage the will to live and alter the
  misdirected cell activity. I do not need to quote instances when
  I maintain that we were all reared in the solidistic- and
  cellular-therapy dogma according to which the morbid
  manifestations of life are and must remain the subject of
  internal therapy. A glance at any Government-sanctioned
  Pharmacopoeia will show that even now medicaments are classified
  against a background of this viewpoint.</p>

  <p>The detoxicating, or as it is also called,
  the antitoxic serum therapy, is, on the other hand,
  <i>humoral</i> therapy. Just as little as it has any direct
  influence on the diphtheria bacilli, is it able to have any
  direct action, whatever, on the living body elements of the
  patient who either has, or is threatened with, diphtheria. The
  detoxicating process acts exclusively in the body <i>fluids</i>,
  in the blood, in the lymphs and in the pericellular lymphatic
  areas. I must emphasize this especially, because many authors
  take the view that the diphtheria anti-toxin can also neutralize
  the poison which has penetrated into the body cells and become
  established there. My own experience runs entirely contrary to
  such a view.</p>

  <p>Serum therapy in the treatment of
  diphtheria is, therefore, humoral therapy in the strictest sense
  of the word. It leads us back to the supposedly long-abandoned
  crasis theory which attributed an important role in the
  development and overcoming of disease to the peculiarities of the
  mixing of the substances solved in the body fluids. As long as
  there is active diphtheria poison in the body fluids, then a
  <i>dyscrasia</i> exists. After inactivation of the diphtheria
  poison, or in other words after the detoxication of the body
  fluids by the addition of diphtheria antitoxin, the
  <i>dyscrasia</i> is overcome; in its place appears, so to say, a
  <i>eucrasia</i>. I do not object if someone tells me that the
  process of disease does not consist in a faulty mixture of
  fluids, but in the abnormal functioning of living body elements,
  the solids of the whole organism. In this sense, there can, in
  fact, only be solidistic <i>pathology</i> or cellular
  <i>pathology</i>, and never humoral pathology since, indeed the
  lifeless, inert body fluids cannot be attacked by any <img src=
  "krumelur3.gif" width="30" height="12" alt=" "> or illness. In
  so far, however, as the diseased function of the living body
  elements is, in the main, conditioned by the incorrect mixture of
  body fluids, I find the linguistic inconsistency of the use of
  the word <i>humoral pathology</i> no worse than if one speaks of
  p<i>athological anatomy</i>, although the subject matter of this
  discipline concerns <i>cadaver</i> anatomy and <img src=
  "krumelur3.gif" width="30" height="12" alt=" "> cannot really be
  attributed to cadavers. However this may be, no one doubts any
  more of the existence of a humoral <i>therapy</i> since antitoxic
  diphtheria therapy has found an assured place for itself in
  medicine.</p>

  <p>I must add another important epithet to the
  word <i>serum therapy</i> in order to characterize its position
  in medicine. It is <i>aetiological therapy</i> in contrast to the
  symptomatic therapy just described. As in the case of the Lister
  treatment of localized wound infections, serum therapy also, in
  the treatment of general infections, holds to the principle
  "leave the cells in peace and simply take care that noxious
  agents from outside are kept out, or, if they once get into the
  body, are removed". The internal anti-infectious therapy would
  appear to have the more difficult task, and as long as it was
  thought that anti-infectious activity could only be carried out
  by killing the living disease germs, the pessimists appeared to
  be justified in making the discouraging statement that
  "<i>interna</i>l disinfection would always remain impossible". If
  now an internal disinfection has, nevertheless, been achieved,
  this is not thanks to speculation or change of doctrine, but
  thanks to the fact that Nature herself has been taken as a guide.
  I doubt whether it will ever be possible to establish
  artificially the antitoxic principle of serum therapy in
  diphtheria, without the aid of vital organization and secretion
  faculties. It is one of the most wonderful things imaginable to
  see how the supply of poison becomes the prerequisite for the
  appearance of the antidote in the poisoned living organism, how
  then the antidote in the blood reaches a state of almost
  unbelievable antitoxic energy through the systematic increase of
  the poison supply, how the bearers of this energy, the albumins
  and globulins of the blood, show no sign of any chemical change
  whatever, how the newly-won energy is so elective that we have no
  other means of proving its existence than solely by the
  diphtheria poison.</p>

  <p>An attempt has been made to make a
  comparison between the method of action of the antitoxic serum
  albumin on the poison molecules with other compensating and
  inactivating processes. In my first work, I myself used the
  non-prejudicial expression "rendering the poison harmless",
  replacing it later, following <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/index.html">Ehrlich</a><a href=
  "#footnote*">*</a>, with the better sounding expression "poison
  destroying". But I gave up this expression as well when I
  realized that I was being credited, on account of it, with the
  assumption that the poison molecule would be, to a certain
  extent, demolished and so become non-poisonous. I began then to
  speak of "neutralization", but right from the start I secured
  myself against the opinion that the antitoxic and the toxic
  protein combine in a way which resembles the formation of salts
  from acid and alkali. Now I prefer to use the word "detoxication"
  which makes no reference to the method of action. But if I want
  to indicate roughly how I imagine this detoxicating process, then
  I speak of "inactivation". I imagine, in fact, that, as regards
  chemical analysis, the antitoxic and the toxic protein stay
  exactly the same <i>after</i> detoxication as <i>before</i>; what
  changes is simply the activated condition; in the same way as the
  conductors of positive and negative electricity, before and after
  compensation of their active conditions, remain the same
  substances in terms of chemical analysis. Perhaps, at some later
  date, work in the physico-chemical border territory which you
  here see represented by such illustrious names as <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/index.html">van't Hoff</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html">Arrhenius</a> will
  bring us to the point where we can refer to active protein
  without the need of talking in parables!</p>

  <p>With this example of antitoxic diphtheria
  therapy, I have attempted to enumerate for you the chief
  characteristics of serum therapy as a novum in therapeutics and
  as a progressive step in medicine.</p>

  <p>It is a humoral therapy, because its
  activity develops only within the fluid and solved components of
  the individual who is ill or threatened with illness. It has an
  anti-infectious action brought about by internal disinfection,
  but is, in this respect, in contrast to the anti-bacterial
  disinfectant treatment methods which, for example, can be carried
  out in laboratory experiments with the aid of the R. Pfeiffer's
  bacteriolysin; because its activity is only detoxication, we call
  it antitoxic. Because it does not influence the substrata of the
  diseased manifestations, the cells and organs, but only the
  <i>cause</i> of the disease, I call it aetiological therapy,
  which comes to approximately the same thing as the therapeutic
  endeavours which are referred to in other quarters as causal,
  radical, abortive, etc.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now I must speak on a special subject in
  which serum therapy takes its place with those methods of
  combating infectious diseases such as Jenner's smallpox
  vaccination, Pasteur's anthrax prevention, Pasteur's hydrophobia
  treatment, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/index.html">Koch</a>'s tuberculin
  therapy.</p>

  <p>These kinds of treatment can be indicated
  as isotherapeutic methods because they treat the infectious
  diseases with media which are of the <i>same</i> kind as the
  disease-causing, infective substances. Briefly expressed, serum
  therapy works through anti-bodies, iso-therapy through
  iso-bodies.</p>

  <p>You know that by treating horses with an
  iso-body, the diphtheria poison, we obtain the curative
  anti-body. In explaining the nature of isotherapy, I would like,
  however, to start with an example where, for me, the isotherapy
  is not just a means to an end, but an end in itself. This is the
  case in the experiments which I have been carrying out for a
  number of years in Marburg with the purpose of combating
  tuberculosis in cattle.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As you know, tuberculosis in cattle is one
  of the most damaging infectious diseases to affect agriculture.
  It causes premature death in affected animals, damages nutrition
  and milk production and is the cause of inferior meat.
  Furthermore, it is feared as being a carrier of tuberculosis to
  humans, although admittedly R. Koch recently disputed this.</p>

  <p>In different countries, or in different
  regions of the same country, the disease does not always strike
  with the same violence and frequency. Thanks to the support of
  Count Zedlitz, the Lord-Lieutenant of Hesse-Nassau, I have been
  in a position to ascertain some remarkable statistical facts in
  this connection. As a result of many thousands of tuberculin
  inoculations in two areas of the province of Hesse, I at first
  thought that the question of breed played an important part. It
  appeared, namely, that in the heavy, high milk-yielding strains
  (Dutch, Friesian and Swiss cattle) 30 to 40% showed a tuberculin
  reaction, whereas in an exceptionally pure breed of red cattle,
  raised in Hesse, the so-called Vogelsberger cattle, there was
  less than 1%. However, comparative infection experiments carried
  out ad hoc in Marburg showed no differences in susceptibility,
  and extensive research led finally to the explanation that the
  number of cattle reacting to tuberculin is, in the main,
  dependent upon whether any or few cattle are kept permanently in
  the same stalls. It appeared that, quite independent of hygienic
  feeding and living conditions, in almost every case the
  cow-houses with 20 and more cattle were heavily vitiated, whereas
  the small-man's cows kept in small stables only very occasionally
  reacted to tuberculin. The large cow-houses were nearly all
  occupied by heavy, high milk-yielding strains and the small ones
  by red cattle. And when, in the neighbouring area of
  Giessen-Gutshofen, the Vogelsberger cattle, which were in large
  numbers kept together in one building, were submitted to
  tuberculin tests the proportion of animals which reacted was also
  very high.</p>

  <p>When making these observations, attention
  was also paid to whether, in those areas which had been pointed
  out to us by the authorities as being suspected breeding grounds
  for human tuberculosis, an especially large number of cases of
  bovine tuberculosis was present. But such a coincidence was
  definitely not found to exist.</p>

  <p>One could feel inclined to use this
  observation (which I passed on to the Lord-Lieutenant at the
  beginning of this year in an official report) as corroborative
  evidence for the view expressed by R. Koch that the tubercle
  bacilli are different in humans and in cattle. My own
  observations, however, point more to the view that spontaneously
  occurring cases of cattle tuberculosis are no more caused by
  passing contact than is the case with humans, but that rather
  cohabitation of long duration is required if infection leading to
  tuberculosis is to be passed from individual to individual.</p>

  <p>In my experience cattle are on a relatively
  low susceptibility plane with regard to tuberculosis infection.
  In a series of cases, I introduced tuberculosis virus, from pearl
  nodules containing tubercle bacillus, under the skin direct from
  animal to animal, achieving in this way nothing more than a local
  tuberculosis with extensive proliferation of bacilli, which after
  existing for months completely disappeared. After intravenous
  injection of the emulsified pearl nodules I observed a general
  feverish condition lasting for weeks, but which also cleared up
  spontaneously. Many of these spontaneously cured cattle I later
  infected together with fresh control cattle in such a way that
  the latter died of acute miliary tuberculosis in 4-6 weeks,
  whereas those which had recovered earlier were quite healthy
  again after a short indisposition.</p>

  <p>If there is to be any certainty of cattle
  dying after a single, arbitrary infection with tuberculosis
  virus, it is essential that consideration be given to the
  following main factors:<br>
  (1) origin and special composition of the virus;<br>
  (2) method of application;<br>
  (3) dosage.</p>

  <p>I can confirm absolutely Koch's statement
  that many tubercle-bacilli cultures of human origin are no more
  dangerous to cattle than Arloing's homogeneous bacilli culture is
  to guinea-pigs.</p>

  <p>In my own experiments with tubercle bacilli
  of human origin which were avirulent to cattle, cultures were
  always used which had been cultivated for years in the
  laboratory. If, however, I used human cultures for cattle
  infection which had only recently been cultivated from tubercular
  sputum, they proved by no means unharmful. In the same way, those
  human bacilli which had become avirulent to cattle through
  long-continued culture in the laboratory can act again with
  considerable virulence in cattle if they are first used to infect
  goats and then, after the death of the animals, are cultivated
  from the carcases. I have a strain of human-goat tubercle bacilli
  which, after culture, is probably the most virulent of all to
  cattle.</p>

  <p>There is more probability that
  cattle-virulent cultures can be obtained without first being
  passed through goats if the culture stock is obtained from the
  body of the <i>cattle</i>. Even here, however, I have gained the
  impression that a long period of cultivation on artificial
  nutrient medium curtails the disease-causing activity in
  cattle.</p>

  <p>It is very noteworthy here that one must
  certainly not conclude that the loss of disease-causing activity
  for cattle necessarily means a decrease in virulence for other
  animals. The Pasteur <i>Anthrax</i> studies establish, in fact,
  that there is a definite scale for the decline in virulence. A
  weakened anthrax strain no longer fatal to mice is not fatal to
  any other kind of animal either, and one which is virulent for
  rabbits proves always extra virulent for guinea-pigs and mice. It
  would be very surprising indeed and would strain credulity if
  anyone were to report an anthrax strain which is virulent for
  rabbits, but not for mice and guinea-pigs. There is a firm scale
  here in accordance with which all anthrax strains, wherever and
  however they may be obtained, act with greater disease-causing
  energy in mice than in guinea-pigs, and with greater energy in
  guinea-pigs than in rabbits.</p>

  <p>In the case of tuberculosis things are
  different. I have studied with special care in this direction
  three tubercle bacilli modifications: tubercle bacilli from human
  beings (Tb-Hu), tubercle bacilli from cattle (Tb-Ca) and tubercle
  bacilli weakened according to Arloing (Tb-Arl). Tb-Hu and Tb-Ca
  remain, with great obstinacy, virulent to guinea-pigs and
  rabbits, but behave differently, in so far as Tb-Hu loses its
  Ca-virulence more quickly than Tb-Ca. Tb-Arl are harmless to
  human beings; in rabbits and horses, when injected intravenously,
  they cause severe illness which can quite soon end in death with
  symptoms of pneumonia.</p>

  <p>For my tuberculosis strains, therefore, I
  have a quite different virulence scale, according to the kind of
  animal which is being taken as standard. The reaction of horses
  is quite exceptionally striking. In these animals the tubercle
  bacilli obtained from cattle show the lowest degree of
  virulence.</p>

  <p>As regards my methods, I test the
  disease-causing energy in cattle in three ways: through infection
  from the subcutaneous tissue, through intravenous injection of
  the emulsified tuberculosis virus, and through intra-ocular
  infection. With my assistant, Dr. R&ouml;mer, I have found that
  intra-ocular infection is the most effective. I was led to this
  method of infection by a study of the work of Professor
  Baumgarten of T&uuml;bingen and I now use the intra-ocular
  infection method to determine the degree of artificially achieved
  tuberculosis immunity in my cattle. Next I use intravenous
  infection and lastly subcutaneous infection.</p>

  <p>Even when using the tubercle bacilli most
  virulent to cattle, the <i>culture dose</i> must not be too small
  in the case of intravenous infection if it is required to cause
  an illness severe enough to lead to the death of the animal. As
  an average dose for this purpose, I take 0.04 g from a culture
  not more than 6 weeks old. The quantity of bacilli contained in
  this dose corresponds approximately to 2 cm<sup>3</sup> of
  tuberculosis bouillon culture. With intra-ocular infection, a
  much stronger action is achieved with a much smaller quantity of
  bacilli. Here the propagation rate in the eye itself is very
  considerable.</p>

  <p>After observing several cases of
  spontaneous recovery in tuberculosis-infected cattle, the thought
  occurred to me that the tubercle-bacilli modifications which were
  only slightly active in the case of cattle behaved in the same
  way as the vaccines to the destructive virus. I then undertook an
  experiment aimed at <i>systematically</i> rendering young cattle
  immune to tuberculosis with living tubercle bacilli. An exact
  description of these immunization experiments, with detailed
  records and temperature curves, will most probably follow in
  March of next year in my "Beitrage zur experimentellen Therapie".
  At this point, I should like to emphasize the following results:
  in the case of cattle, I forego the subcutaneous preliminary
  treatment and use instead exclusively the intravenous injection.
  As immunization vaccine I use a little Ca-virulent Tb-Hu (3267),
  then go over to Tb-Ca (Nocard) and, finally, I use nothing
  stronger in the way of tuberculosis virus than a goat-passage
  culture.</p>

  <p>I have also made experiments using an
  originally strong tuberculosis virus which has then been dried
  under vacuum conditions at room temperature and left standing for
  a long time, whereby its disease-causing potential is greatly
  reduced. Where pure cultures on artificial nutrient media were
  concerned, I was not very satisfied with the results; the
  experiments with dried pearl nodules and tubercular organs from
  cattle turned out better.</p>

  <p>If, on account of the preliminary
  treatment, a cow became immune to Ca-virulent Tb-(cultures), then
  there was also an immunity against Ca-virulent Tb-Hu
  (goat-passage) and vice versa. This does not appear to confirm
  that Tb-Hu and Tb-Ca are different in kind.</p>

  <p>After my Marburg experiments showed the
  <i>possibility</i> of tuberculosis immunization for cattle, we
  were now faced with the task of finding out, by research through
  special experiments, in how short a time and with what minimum of
  detriment to the animal to be immunized and financial sacrifice,
  tuberculosis protection for cattle could be achieved in practice.
  In order to carry out these investigations, I procured for myself
  living space and grazing ground for a large number of cattle and
  I am hoping to use the large money award which has come to me
  through the Nobel Foundation to show the possibility and
  practicability of fighting tuberculosis in cattle along the lines
  of Pasteur's protective inoculation to a larger extent than up to
  now. It would give me much honour and pleasure if any among you
  would care to inspect my Marburg work and installations on the
  spot and see, at the same time, how I am using my best
  endeavours, in accordance with the intention of the noble founder
  himself, Alfred Nobel, to promote the common good.</p>

  <p>I need hardly add that the fight against
  cattle tuberculosis only marks a stage on the road which leads
  finally to the effective protection of human beings against the
  disease. Here, however, it has been my intention to report on
  facts, not hopes. And it is as a fact that I think I am able to
  report the immunization of cattle against tuberculosis to
  you.</p>
