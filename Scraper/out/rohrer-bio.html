  <h1>Heinrich Rohrer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rohrer.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Buchs, St. Gallen,
  Switzerland on 6.6., '33 as the third child, half an hour after
  my twin sister. We were fortunate to enjoy a carefree childhood
  with a sound mixture of freedom, school and farm work. In 1949,
  the family moved to Z&uuml;rich and our way of life changed from
  country to town. My finding to physics was rather accidental. My
  natural bent was towards classical languages and natural
  sciences, and only when I had to register at the ETH (Swiss
  Federal Institute of Technology) in autumn 1951, did I decide in
  favor of physics. In the next four years, Professors G. Busch,
  <a href="../1945/index.html">W. Pauli</a>, and P. Scherrer taught
  me the rudiments. In autumn 1955, I started work on my Ph.D.
  Thesis and it was fortuitous that J&ouml;rgen Lykke Olsen trusted
  me to measure the length changes of superconductors at the
  magnetic-field-induced superconducting transition. He had already
  pioneered the field with measurements on the discontinuity of
  Young's modulus. Following in his footsteps, I lost all respect
  for angstroms. The mechanical transducers were very vibration
  sensitive, and I learned to work after midnight, when the town
  was asleep. My four graduate years were a most memorable time, in
  a group of distinguished graduate students always receptive for
  fun, and including the interruptions by my basic training courses
  in the Swiss mountain infantry.<br>
  <br>
  In summer 1961, Rose-Marie Egger became my wife, and her
  stabilizing influence has kept me on an even keel ever since. Our
  honeymoon trip led us to the United States where I spent two
  post-doe years working on thermal conductivity of type-II
  superconductors and metals in the group of Professor Bernie Serin
  at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Then in the summer of 1963,
  Professor Ambros Speiser, Director of the newly founded IBM
  Research Laboratory in R&uuml;schlikon, Switzerland, made me an
  offer to join the physics effort there. Encouraged by Bruno
  L&uuml;thi, who later became a Professor at the University of
  Frankfurt, and, at the time, strongly recommended the hiring of
  Gerd Binnig, I accepted to start in December 1963, after having
  responded to the call of the wild in the form of a four-month
  camping trip through the USA.<br>
  <br>
  My first couple of years in R&uuml;schlikon were spent studying
  mainly Kondo systems with magnetoresistance in pulsed magnetic
  fields. End of the sixties, Keith Blazey interested me to work on
  GdAlO<sub>3</sub>, an antiferromagnet on which he had done optic
  experiments. This started a fruitful cooperation on magnetic
  phase diagrams, which eventually brought me into the field of
  critical phenomena. Encouraged by <a href="../1987/index.html">K.
  Alex M&uuml;ller</a>, who had pioneered the critical-phenomena
  effort in our Laboratory, I focused on the bicritical and
  tetracritical behavior and finally on the random-field problem.
  These were most enjoyable years, during which so many patient
  colleagues taught me physics. I left them with some regret, when
  I ventured with Gerd to discover new shores. We found them. Thank
  you, Gerd.<br>
  <br>
  In 1974/75, I spent a sabbatical year with Professor Vince
  Jaccarino and Dr. Alan King at the University of California in
  Santa Barbara, to get a taste of nuclear magnetic resonance. We
  solved a specific problem on the bicritical point of
  MnF<sub>2</sub>, their home-base material. We traded experience,
  NMR and critical phenomena. Rose-Marie and I also took the
  opportunity at the beginning and end of my sabbatical to show the
  USA to our two daughters, Doris and Ellen, on two extended
  camping trips from coast to coast.<br>
  <br>
  In all the years with IBM Research, I have especially appreciated
  the freedom to pursue the activities I found interesting, and
  greatly enjoyed the stimulus, collegial cooperation, frankness,
  and intellectual generosity of two scientific communities,
  namely, in superconductivity and critical phenomena. I should
  also like to take this opportunity to thank the many, many
  friends, teachers, and seniors who have contributed towards my
  scientific career in any way whatsoever, and most particularly my
  mother for her unstinting aid and assistance, especially when
  times were difficult.</p>
