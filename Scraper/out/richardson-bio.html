  <h1>Robert C. Richardson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="richardson.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on June 26, 1937 in
  Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC. My
  parents, Lois Price Richardson and Robert Franklin Richardson,
  lived in Arlington, VA. My sister and only sibling, Addie Ann
  Richardson, was born on May 6, 1939, also in Georgetown
  University Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  My earliest memories are of the apartment building in Arlington
  where my mother, sister, and I lived during the years of World
  War II while my father was away in the US Army. He was an officer
  in the Signal Corps. We lived across the street from the fire
  department and became accustomed to the blast of the siren at all
  hours of the day and night. It is fortunate that we lived so
  close to the fire department because one morning while my mother
  was visiting neighbors my sister set the apartment on fire while
  playing with the gas stove. Little damage was done, though I am
  certain that my mother was thoroughly embarrassed.<br>
  <br>
  My father was a native Virginian. Branches of his family could be
  traced back to the early colonial times. His father, Robert
  Coleman Richardson, after whom I was named, owned a general store
  in a small rural village, Penola, VA. My father attended Roanoke College
  for two years during the Great Depression. When his mother became
  seriously ill, he left college because of the increased family
  expenses. He became interested in electricity and began work as a
  'lineman' for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company in
  Richmond, VA.<br>
  <br>
  My mother's family was from North Carolina. She was an orphan,
  practically from birth, and was shuttled among relatives in North
  Carolina. As was a common practice in the rural South, she was
  taught at home by various aunts. She attended only one year of
  public school before going off to college. The one year of high
  school was in Reidsville, NC in 1918. She attended various
  colleges - Gulf Park College, the University of Alabama, the
  University of
  Mississippi, and the University of Virginia. She was one of the
  first women to attend the latter and obtained a Master's Degree
  in History there. During her college career she was brought in to
  the large and warm family of Ernest H. Mathewson in Richmond, and
  thus gained three brothers and two sisters. The Mathewsons were
  known by my sister and me as our other grandparents during our
  youth.<br>
  <br>
  My parents met in Richmond and were married there in 1935.
  Shortly thereafter, my father was transferred by the telephone
  company to their branch in Washington, DC. As an army reservist
  my father was called to active duty during World War II and again
  during the Korean War. During his service for the latter he was
  assigned to the Pentagon so that it did not become necessary for
  him to leave home. During his second tour of duty with the army
  he took advantage of the educational benefits associated with the
  'G.I. Bill of Rights' to finish college. He graduated from the
  University of
  Maryland in 1955.<br>
  <br>
  I do not remember having any special scientific interests during
  childhood but I did love school. In 1946, when I was in the
  fourth grade, my family moved from the apartment building we had
  lived in during the war years. My father bought a new house in
  one of the housing tract developments so common to the postwar
  suburbs of American cities. We still lived in Arlington, VA. My
  new elementary school, Walter Reed, was overcrowded. The fourth
  and fifth grades met in the same room with the same teacher. I
  paid as much attention to the fifth grade instruction as the
  fourth. I especially loved the history lessons because Mrs.
  Walton, our teacher, was a remarkable storyteller. During the
  summer between fourth and fifth grade, I went to summer school
  just to have something to do. The teacher of the summer session
  was confused about my grade status and inadvertently promoted me
  to the sixth grade. The Arlington County School system accepted
  her decision. So I skipped a grade. Had I remained in the same
  grade, one of my classmates in Walter Reed School would have been
  Warren Beatty (of film star fame), whose family had just moved to
  our neighborhood in Arlington.<br>
  <br>
  With my parent's encouragement, I became very active in the Boy
  Scouts. Scouting did not exist in rural Virginia, where my father
  grew up. In his youth, he had always envied boys from larger
  cities who could be in scouting. My involvement gave him,
  vicariously, the scouting experience he had missed. With his
  help, I became an Eagle Scout in the minimum amount of time
  permitted by the rules. I especially enjoyed the outdoor
  activities of scouting, hiking, camping, and even
  birdwatching.<br>
  <br>
  I spent the enjoyable summers of my high school years working as
  a counselor in Camp Letts, a Boy Scout Camp on the western shore
  of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. I was a nature counselor. I
  spent my days leading tours on nature trails through the camp. My
  ankles were covered with a minor poison ivy rash from June
  through August. In the evenings I led groups in 'stargazing;' and
  one morning each week I led a ten-mile canoe trip through the
  Maryland marshland to look at birds. I liked the canoe trips
  best. We would arrive at the entrance of the marsh just at
  sunrise when the maximum number of birds would be out feeding.
  The marshes had large water birds like egrets and herons, three
  kinds of wrens, more than twenty different warblers, vireos, plus
  large birds of prey like hawks and eagles. It was possible in a
  single morning for a scout to spot enough birds on a single trip
  to qualify for the birdwatching merit badge. I learned where all
  of the birds hung out and how to tell them by their songs.
  Although I am color blind, I memorized their descriptions in the
  bird manual. I would describe subtle pastel features of warblers
  and vireos flitting about in the tree tops 60 feet above the
  ground to the amazement of even the adult scout leaders. There is
  a famous painting by James Audobon of a bald eagle diving toward
  an osprey just after the osprey has caught a fish. Each summer I
  was fortunate enough to see that scene re-enacted at least once.
  It made a special impression on the groups I led because I showed
  them a copy of the painting before we left on the trips.<br>
  <br>
  My high school class at Washington-Lee High School had 925
  students in it. I graduated, as I recall, in a six-way tie for
  19th place. There was nothing exceptional about the math and
  science training at Washington-Lee. The idea of 'advanced
  placement' had not yet been invented. I did not take a calculus
  course until my second year of college. The biology and physics
  courses were very old fashioned. The idea of a 'photon' was said
  to be controversial. This in 1953! I was taught that absolute
  zero is the temperature at which all motion stops. It is most
  fortunate that the statement was wrong. Otherwise <sup>3</sup>He
  could not become a superfluid.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Virginia
  Polytechnic Institute, also called Virginia Tech, in the Fall
  of 1954. In those days, the Reserve Officers Training Corps
  program was compulsory for all physically fit entering students
  at VPI. Moreover, all ROTC students lived in a cadet corps with
  fairly rigorous military discipline. I surprised myself by really
  enjoying life in the VPI Corps of Cadets. I learned an easy and
  democratic camaraderie. As we were assigned to live in cadet
  companies in alphabetical order, my closest friends were those in
  the bottom third of the alphabet.<br>
  <br>
  In class, I started out as an electrical engineer but soon became
  bored and impatient with the mechanical drawing course and the
  rote application of a single principle, Kirchoff's Laws, in a
  five-hour course. I tried to become a chemistry major but ran
  into great difficulty in a course called quantitative analysis
  because of my color-blindness. I could not tell when the color of
  the indicator solution turned from pink to blue unless I made a
  very strong over-concentration of acid or base. When I complained
  to the professor he told me that I was very fortunate to discover
  my disability early in my college career because I certainly was
  not suited to be a chemist.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, I turned to physics as a major. I was not an especially
  diligent student but nevertheless obtained a reasonable education
  in physics. I graduated with a B average and fourth in a group of
  about 9 physics majors. My education through the Cadet Corps was
  at least as valuable as that in formal class training. I was a
  leader in several campus organizations. The rigorous honor code
  at VPI in those days was almost exhilarating. We were all very
  proud of it. I never saw anyone cheat on a test in my years
  there.<br>
  <br>
  In summers, while in college, I had a very interesting job with
  the National Bureau of Standards. I worked in the Electricity
  Division calibrating electrical resistance standards which power
  companies sent to NBS once each year. The NBS program for summer
  students was quite wonderful. First, we were well paid. Next, we
  actually did useful research. Finally, we attended a weekly
  seminar series which was given at our level of understanding. In
  my spare time at NBS, I read the scientific literature on
  electrical instrumentation and even met some of the authors of
  some of the classic articles. The experience at NBS gave me some
  notion of what a scientific research career could be.<br>
  <br>
  After graduating from college, I had a vague idea of going to a
  graduate program in business - with hopes of becoming an
  executive in a large corporation. First, though, I felt that I
  had not quite given physics and research a chance so I decided to
  remain at VPI for one more year to obtain a Master's Degree
  before going off to military service as an Army Officer. The
  project I worked on was the measurement of the lifetime of
  photo-excited carriers in germanium. In the process I had to
  build a great deal of equipment because Tom Gilmer, my advisor,
  had just come to VPI to a practically empty lab. Tom was a good
  mentor, but he was very busy as department chairman and VPI
  professors had quite a large teaching load. I learned a great
  deal about how to do things with my own hands - operate a lathe,
  solder, make simple electronic circuits, etc. I knew about
  keeping a lab book from my summer jobs at NBS. In that year I
  became a good deal more confident that I could learn physics at
  advanced levels, but still was not in any way special. I think I
  was still fourth in the group of graduate students. With the
  feeling that I would probably be a mediocre physicist, at best, I
  left VPI with the intent of attending a Masters in Business
  Administration, MBA, program after finishing military
  service.<br>
  <br>
  A great piece of good fortune fell for me during my year of
  graduate work at VPI. The Army ran short of money. Thus, rather
  than having to spend two years on active duty, I was only
  assigned for six months of active duty in the US Army Ordnance
  Corps between November 1959 and May 1960. This was a time well
  after the Korean War and well before the Vietnam War. There was
  no likelihood of actually having to see any combat. At Aberdeen
  Proving Ground, the Ordnance Corps training base, I took courses
  in how to manage a platoon which would do things like repairing
  jeeps and tanks. I hated the course and the being in the Army.
  Wearing a uniform and the military discipline did not bother me;
  I had become used to both while in the VPI Cadet Corps. But I did
  not enjoy the training in how to run a small business - for
  that's what a repair platoon in the Ordnance Corps was.
  Therefore, I decided to return to graduate school to obtain a Ph.
  D. in physics.<br>
  <br>
  I had no opportunity while in the Army to take tests like the
  Graduate Record Exam to qualify me for admission to one of the
  top graduate schools - like MIT, Harvard, or Cornell. Besides, I probably would not have
  been admitted even if I had taken the tests. Therefore, I looked
  for smaller research universities with strong specialties. In my
  graduate research project, I had made a simple liquid nitrogen
  dewar, and found the area of low temperature physics to be
  interesting. I had read some articles about the work going on at
  Duke
  University so decided to apply there. I received a warm
  letter from Horst Meyer, a new Assistant Professor at Duke,
  encouraging me to come to work for him. The letter was very
  flattering - the first strong encouragement I had ever received
  about my potential as a physicist. Therefore, I entered Duke in
  the Fall of 1960 as a full-time graduate student.<br>
  <br>
  I had a glorious time at Duke. I made strong friendships which
  have been maintained through the rest of my life. I met my wife,
  Betty McCarthy, there. One of only two physics majors in her
  class at Wellesley College, Betty was also a graduate student
  in Physics. We were married in 1962 and our daughters Jennifer
  and Pamela were born in Durham, NC, in 1965 and 1966.<br>
  <br>
  Horst was a very conscientious mentor. He taught me a great deal
  of the craft of low temperature technology he had learned as a
  research associate at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford. In all of the
  subsequent years he has been a valued friend. We had the best of
  two worlds in our low temperature group at Duke in those days.
  Bill Fairbank had been there but left before I arrived. Much of
  the old equipment and the residue of the experimental technology
  from Bill Fairbank remained. Horst brought a different set of
  techniques with him and we had our choice of which way to do
  things - for example the use of wood's metal to attach vacuum
  cans along with Epiezon J-oil for thermal contact were the Oxford
  technique. Indium O-rings and vacuum grease were the Fairbank
  method. Both had advantages.<br>
  <br>
  Horst put me on a good problem - the NMR study of the exchange
  interaction in solid <sup>3</sup>He. Earle Hunt came to Duke as a
  research associate with Horst and taught me about the new methods
  for pulsed NMR-spin echos and all of that. The combination of
  training with Horst and Earle put me in business for practically
  the rest of my research career.<br>
  <br>
  I finished my thesis in 1965 and remained at Duke for another
  year as a research associate in order to clean up some of the
  loose ends of the research and to look for a good job. In the
  latter, I was fortunate indeed. Cornell University, with its
  special funding as an Interdisciplinary Laboratory (IDL) had
  decided to expand its effort in low temperature physics. In the
  Spring of 1966 the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics
  invited me to join them to work with <a href="index.html">Dave
  Lee</a> and John Reppy on very low temperature helium research.
  As far as I was concerned, there could be no better career
  opportunity.<br>
  <br>
  I moved my family to Ithaca in October 1966 and have remained
  there ever since. I received sound career advice from Dave and
  John from the day I arrived. The research environment at Cornell
  has been superb with an unbroken string of talented graduate
  students, close colleagues in both theory and experiment, and a
  team of technical support specialists who helped make everything
  work. During my thirty years at Cornell I even learned how to
  teach undergraduate physics courses, an activity which my wife
  and I enjoy a great deal. After our daughters entered Junior High
  School, Betty turned to teaching physics at Cornell also. She is
  now a Senior Lecturer.<br>
  <br>
  My children grew to adulthood in Ithaca. It is a wholesome
  college town with few of the problems of large cities. Jennifer
  went to college back at Duke and later attended a Master of Fine
  Arts in Creative Writing program at Columbia
  University. Jenny married James Merlis in June 1994. We had a
  beautiful wedding reception among my large rhododendron bushes in
  our back garden. In addition to her writing and other activities,
  she now plays violin in an all female rock band called
  Splendora.<br>
  <br>
  Pamela went to college at Cornell. After graduation, she went to
  the New York School of Interior Design for a year and then
  decided to become a nurse. She returned home to take the science
  courses she had skipped at Cornell. She spent a year at our local
  community college taking chemistry, biology, anatomy, etc.,
  displaying a surprising scientific talent. After the year at home
  she went to Vanderbilt University where she entered a Masters of
  Nursing program. In November of 1994 - after one year in the
  Vanderbilt nursing program - she died tragically, of heart
  failure. Though she had been born with a heart defect, her death
  came without warning.<br>
  <br>
  In an effort to drag ourselves out of our grief and despondency
  over losing Pam, we have taken on a major family project in the
  past year: the production of an introductory college physics text
  book. Betty is the co-author of the book, with Alan Giambattista
  of Cornell; and I have been working on a companion CD ROM. When
  completed, the work will be published by McGraw Hill.</p>
