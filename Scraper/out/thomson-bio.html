  <h1>George Paget Thomson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="thomson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George Paget Thomson</b> was born in
  1892 at Cambridge, the son of the late <a href=
  "../1906/index.html">Sir J J. Thomson</a> (then Professor of
  Physics at Cambridge University), a Nobel Prize winner who, more
  than anyone else, was responsible for the discovery of the
  electron, and Rose Elisabeth Paget, daughter of the late Sir
  George Paget, Regius Professor of Medicine at Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  George Thomson went to school in Cambridge, and then up to the
  University. As an undergraduate at Trinity College
  he took mathematics followed by physics, and had done a year's
  research under his father when the 1914-1918 war broke out.<br>
  <br>
  He joined the Queen's Regiment of Infantry as a Subaltern and
  served for a short time in France, but returned to work on the
  stability of aeroplanes and other aerodynamical problems at
  Farnborough, and continued to work on this kind of problem at
  various establishments throughout the war, apart from eight
  months in the United States attached to the British War
  Mission.<br>
  <br>
  After the war he spent three years as Fellow and Lecturer at
  Corpus
  Christi College, Cambridge, and continued his research on
  physics. He was then appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy
  (as physics is called in Scotland) at the University of
  Aberdeen, a post he held for eight years. At Aberdeen he
  carried out experiments on the behaviour of electrons going
  through very thin films of metals, which showed that electrons
  behave as waves in spite of being particles. For this work he
  later shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with C.J. Davisson of the
  Bell Telephone Laboratories, who had arrived at the same
  conclusions by a different kind of experiment. The process of
  electron diffraction which these experiments established to be
  possible has been widely used in the investigation of the
  surfaces of solids.<br>
  <br>
  In the winter of 1929-1930 Thomson visited Cornell University,
  Ithaca, N.Y. as a "non-resident" lecturer. In 1930 he was
  appointed Professor at Imperial College in the University of London;
  he held this post until 1952, when he became Master of Corpus
  Christi College, Cambridge, retiring from the latter in
  1962.<br>
  <br>
  During his time at Imperial College he became interested in
  nuclear physics, and when the fission of uranium by neutron was
  discovered at the beginning of 1939 he was struck by its military
  and other possibilities, and persuaded the British Air Ministry
  to procure a ton of uranium oxide for experiments. These
  experiments were incomplete at the outbreak of war, when Thomson
  went back to the Royal Aircraft Establishment to work on a series
  of war problems, including magnetic mines. A year later he was
  made Chairman of the British Committee set up to investigate the
  possibilities of atomic bombs. This committee reported in 1941
  that a bomb was possible, and Thomson was authorized to give this
  report to the American scientists Vannevar Bush and James
  Conant.<br>
  <br>
  He spent the next year as Scientific Liaison Officer at Ottawa,
  and for part of this time was in close touch with the American
  atomic bomb effort. On returning to England he was appointed
  Vice-Chairman of the Radio Board and later became Scientific
  Adviser to the Air Ministry.<br>
  <br>
  After the war he returned to work at Imperial College, and early
  in 1946 became interested in the possibilities of nuclear power
  from deuterium (heavy hydrogen). Some experiments bearing on this
  were started at Imperial College under Dr. Ware, but Thomson's
  work was theoretical. Later, because of the requirements of
  secrecy, this work was transferred to the Associated Electrical
  Industry's Research Laboratories at Aldermaston, where Thomson
  continued to act as Consultant.<br>
  <br>
  Sir George T. is a Fellow of the Royal Society, and has received
  the Royal Medal and the Hughes Medal of that Society. He is a
  Doctor of Science at Cambridge, Hon. D.Sc. (Lisbon), Hon. LL.D.
  (Aberdeen), Hon. Sc. D. ( Dublin ), Sheffield, University of
  Wales and Reading. He has written a book on aerodynamics and
  other scientific works. His published works also include a
  popular book on <i>The Atom and The Foreseeable Future</i>,
  published in 1955, and <i>The Inspiration of Science</i>,
  published in 1962. He is a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences and of the Lisbon Academy, and a Corresponding
  Member of the Austrian Academy.<br>
  <br>
  In 1924 he married Kathleen Buchanan, daughter of the Very Rev.
  Sir George Adam Smith. They have two sons and two daughters. Ship
  models form part of his recreations.</p>
