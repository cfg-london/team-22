  <h1>Henri La Fontaine - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fontaine.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Henri Marie
  La Fontaine</b> (April 22, 1854-May 14, 1943) was born in
  Brussels. A professor of international law, a senator in the
  Belgian legislature for thirty-six years, a renowned
  bibliographer, a man of wide-ranging cultural achievements, he
  was noted, most of all, for his fervent and total
  internationalism.<br>
  <br>
  In 1877 at the age of twenty-three, La Fontaine registered as
  counsel with the Brussels Court of Appeal after reading law at
  the Free
  University of Brussels, from which he later received a
  doctorate in law. For the next sixteen years, he practiced law,
  becoming one of Belgium's leading jurists; wrote a technical work
  on the rights and duties of contractors of public works (1885)
  and collaborated on another concerning counterfeiting (1888);
  began his long work in the cause of peace; and participated in
  liberal reform causes.<br>
  <br>
  His interest in reform eventually led him into politics. A
  socialist, La Fontaine wrote for the movement, spoke at meetings,
  joined in founding <i>La Justice</i>, a socialist paper. Elected
  to the Belgian Senate as a Socialist, he represented Hainaut from
  1895 to 1898, Li&egrave;ge from 1900 to 1932, and Brabant from 1935
  to 1936. He was secretary of the Senate for thirteen years
  (1907-1919) and a vice-president for fourteen years: third
  vice-president (1919-1921), second vice-president (1921-1922),
  and first vice-president (1923-1932).<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career in the Senate he showed an abiding interest
  in education, labor, and foreign affairs. As a freshman senator,
  he introduced a bill to reform primary education and in his last
  year in the Senate spoke on the budget for public instruction. In
  labor legislation, he submitted a bill on mine inspection in 1897
  and in 1926 supported the adoption of the eight-hour day and
  forty-hour week. In foreign affairs, he spoke almost every year
  on the foreign affairs budget, asked the Belgian government to
  demand arbitration between the combatants of the Boer War (1901),
  introduced a bill approving the treaty of obligatory arbitration
  with Italy (1911), and gave his legislative support to the League
  of Nations, the establishment of an economic union with
  Luxembourg, the Locarno Pacts, the Kellogg-Briand Pact,
  disarmament, and the legal means of settling international
  disputes.<br>
  <br>
  La Fontaine was a member of the Belgian delegation to the Paris
  Peace Conference in 1919 and a delegate to the First Assembly of
  the League of Nations in 1920-1921. To those deliberations he
  brought his uncompromising internationalism. For example, during
  a plenary meeting that was considering Article 16 of the Covenant
  - the article which provided that members of the League must
  unite in diplomatic pressure, sanctions, or, if necessary, armed
  force to prevent a resort to aggressive war in breach of the
  Covenant - he spoke against an amendment releasing from
  commitment those countries which deemed themselves endangered
  should they take part in sanctions, saying: &laquo;Belgium thinks
  that however great the peril which a country might have to
  undergo under the system which we seek to establish here, that
  country ought to do its duty. It was thus that Belgium understood
  her obligations in 1914... We fully admit that, in circumstances
  of this nature, powerful countries may take certain measures, but
  in our opinion it would be impossible, on the pretext that they
  would suffer more than others, for some countries to hold aloof
  from the sacred task of defending justice, even at the peril of
  their own existence. &#8249;Fais ce que dois, advienne que
  pourra.&#8250;&nbsp;&raquo;<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  Ideas for some of the auxiliary bodies of the League of Nations
  and of such affiliated bodies as the Institute of Intellectual
  Cooperation may have been influenced by La Fontaine's plan for an
  international intellectual union, along with which he proposed
  the creation of international agencies that logically follow from
  the acceptance of the international idea - among them, a
  university, a library, a language, a parliament, a court, a bank,
  and clearing houses for labor, trade, immigration, and
  statistical information <a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  La Fontaine entered the organized peace movement when Hodgson
  Pratt, the British pacifist, came to Belgium in the early 1880's
  to establish a branch of his International Arbitration and Peace
  Association. Becoming the secretary-general of the
  Soci&eacute;t&eacute; belge de l'arbitrage et de la paix in 1889, La
  Fontaine thereafter participated actively in virtually all of the
  peace congresses held in the next twenty-five years. In 1907, he
  succeeded <a href="../1908/index.html">Fredrik Bajer</a> (one of
  the two Nobel Peace laureates for 1908) as president of the
  <a href="../1910/index.html">International Peace Bureau</a>
  (winner of the 1910 Peace Prize), an organization he helped to
  found and whose titular head he remained until his death.<br>
  <br>
  La Fontaine became a member of the Interparliamentary Union as soon as he
  attained eligibility by virtue of being elected to a national
  legislature. To La Fontaine the Union was an embryo world
  parliament, the precursor of a world government. An enthusiastic
  member, he was chairman of its Juridical Committee prior to World
  War I and a member of two of its important commissions - that on
  preparation of a model world parliament and that on drafting a
  model treaty of arbitration.<br>
  <br>
  In the two decades between 1894 and 1915, La Fontaine's literary
  efforts were prodigious, with much of his more important work
  associated with internationalism. The <i>Manuel des lois de la
  paix: Code de l'arbritrage</i> (1894) was approved by the
  International Peace Congress held at Antwerp. Published in 1902,
  the immense volume, <i>Pasicrisie internationale: Histoire
  documentaire des arbitrages internationaux, 1794-1900</i>, is a
  source book of 368 documents on arbitration, including
  agreements, rules of procedure, and case decisions, printed in
  whole or in part in their original languages. A complementary
  work, <i>Histoire sommaire et chronologique des arbitrages
  internationaux, 1794-1900</i>, provides commentary on
  <i>Pasicrisie</i>. His exhaustive and carefully edited
  <i>Bibliographie de la paix et de l'arbitrage international</i>,
  containing 2,222 entries, appeared in 1904. <i>The Great
  Solution: Magnissima Charta</i> (1916) offers a set of principles
  for organized international relations, not for a &laquo;World
  State&raquo; which he considered many years away, and sketches a
  &laquo;constitution&raquo; embodying the necessary institutions
  that would fit the times while preventing future wars. In
  &laquo;International Judicature&raquo; (1915) he outlines the
  essentials for a supreme court of the world. Not that he was very
  optimistic at this time. From Washington, D.C., where he lived
  following his flight to England and then to the United States
  after the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, he wrote in a
  private letter: &laquo;The peoples are not awake...[There are
  dangers] which will render a world organization impossible. I
  foresee the renewal of...the secret bargaining behind closed
  doors. Peoples will be as before, the sheep sent to the
  slaughterhouses or to the meadows as it pleases the shepherds.
  International institutions ought to be, as the national ones in
  democratic countries, established by the peoples and for the
  peoples.&raquo; <a href="#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  In the period before World War I, La Fontaine inaugurated an
  ambitious bibliographical scheme. In 1895, in collaboration with
  Paul Otlet, he established the Institut international de
  bibliographie. This &laquo;House of Documentation&raquo;, as it
  came to be called, was a vast informational retrieval scheme, in
  which he proposed to file, index, and provide information for
  retrieval on anything of note published anywhere in the world.
  With the help of a subsidy from the Belgian government, he went
  some distance in bringing his plan into reality, for the House
  developed a methodology of universal classification and produced
  some reference works, particularly bibliographies of social
  sciences and peace.<br>
  <br>
  From the work of the Institute came the idea for the Union of International
  Associations, which he founded with Paul Otlet in 1907, and,
  as secretary-general, directed thereafter. Still located in
  Brussels, the Union was granted consultative status with the
  Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 1951 and
  with UNESCO
  in 1952. As the &laquo;only centre in the world devoted to
  documentation, research and promotion of international
  organizations, particularly the voluntary (nongovernmental)
  variety&raquo;<a href="#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and as the
  publisher of <i>The Yearbook of International Organizations</i>,
  the first of which appeared in 1909, and of a host of reference
  works of proceedings, documents, bibliographies, directories, and
  calendars of meetings of international organizations, it carries
  on in a sophisticated manner the embryonic conceptions of its
  founder.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his life La Fontaine was concerned with education. He
  occupied the chair of international law from 1893 to 1940, first
  at the Universit&eacute; Nouvelle, a branch of the Free University
  of Brussels, and then at the Institut des Hautes &Eacute;tudes
  after the branch merged with the University following World War
  I. He taught courses on the elements of international law and on
  the evolution of the judicial structures of the world, and, as
  occasion required, offered courses of lectures on various
  subjects - among them, disarmament, the League of Nations,
  international misunderstandings, world federation, the law in
  relation to political and moral crises in the world.<br>
  <br>
  A zealous reformer, La Fontaine was a leading spokesman for
  women's rights. He was appointed secretary of a technical school
  for young women in 1878; he wrote <i>La Femme et le barreau</i>
  in 1901, taking an advanced position on the place of women in the
  legal profession; and for some time he was president of the
  Association for the Professional Education of Women.<br>
  <br>
  La Fontaine's talents and energy led him to explore many
  interests. A mountaineer, he wrote about climbing, compiled an
  international bibliography of &laquo;Alpinism&raquo;, and served as
  president of the Club alpin belge. He translated portions of
  Wagner's operas, published essays on American libraries and the
  status of American women, founded the review <i>La Vie
  internationale</i>, lectured to adult education classes on modern
  movements in the arts, served on the Brussels City Council from
  1904 to 1908, and even, in his young manhood, produced a volume
  of poetry.<br>
  <br>
  Henri La Fontaine lived to see his native Belgium invaded once
  again but not to see it liberated, for he died in 1943.</p>
