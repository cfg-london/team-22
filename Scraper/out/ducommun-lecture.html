  <h2>The Futility of War Demonstrated by History</h2>

  <p>War, we are told, shapes character; it
  resolves the major questions of international politics,
  consolidates nations, and indeed, constitutes the principal
  factor in the progress of civilization through its successive
  stages.</p>

  <p>Since all assertions must be carefully
  examined in order to benefit from what they may contain, let us
  consult together, if you will, - the annals of history to see
  what war has managed to resolve and consolidate from the earliest
  times to the present day. This examination will enlighten us
  concerning the civilizing role which war may have played in the
  world.</p>

  <p>The first theatre of war which history
  records is the vast expanse of territory comprising Greece and
  western Asia. In that area, at frequent intervals, there took
  place repeated migrations of armed tribes or hordes whose only
  thought was to acquire lands where they might first found tiny
  monarchies, and then empires. Law and reason were unknown: force
  was everything, and its abuse checked civilization at every turn
  by accustoming ignorant peoples to bend their heads before the
  saber.</p>

  <p>To this category of warlike operations
  whose sole motive was plunder, belong, in chronological order,
  the expedition of the Argonauts in 1260 B.C., the capture of Troy
  by the Greeks in 1184 B.C., and later, the migration of the
  Ionians and the Dorians. Nothing remained of all these
  expeditions a few years later except the spectacle of devastation
  and of ruins whose traces had not even disappeared before some
  new disaster supervened.</p>

  <p>These "Dark Ages" saw, among other things,
  the foundation of the kingdom of Macedonia by the Argive
  Caranus.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> Since much revolves
  around this unfortunate Macedonian, I ask you to bear with me if
  I depart from the chronological order of this study in order to
  follow the harrowing story of the Macedonian martyrology.</p>

  <p>In the fourth century B.C., Philip of
  Macedonia<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>, an ambitious
  princeling, subdued the Greeks, who were no less rapacious than
  himself, and war ravaged lands whose inhabitants had no reason to
  slaughter one another. Philip's son, the conqueror Alexander -
  called "Great", no doubt because of his large-scale massacres -
  once more subjugated the Greeks, and then vanquished the
  Persians. With his death, however, the image of war which he had
  molded from blood and mire disintegrated, and from the ruins of
  his former empire, now weakened to the point of anemia, were
  formed the kingdoms of Macedonia and Egypt.<sup><a href=
  "#footnote3">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>Poor Macedonia who aspired to become queen
  of the world! Thirty years later she was ravaged by the Gauls,
  then by the Romans, and the Middle Ages found her under the heel
  of the Turk. Today in the anguish of a slow agony, her imploring
  arms reach out in supplication to Europe<sup><a href=
  "#footnote4">4</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>Did war, at any stage of her miserable
  existence, consolidate the political institutions of the
  Macedonia of Alexander the Great, improve the lot of her peoples,
  or set her on the road to civilization?</p>

  <p>Let us retrace our steps and see what
  became of other kingdoms which lived by the rule of force - the
  kingdom of the Medes and the kingdom of the Persians, for
  example.</p>

  <p>About 600 B.C., the kingdom of the Medes
  conquered Assyria, which had been reduced to a pitiful state by
  the depredations of armed bands; but fifty years later Media was
  conquered by the Persians, who also seized Assyria and Egypt.
  More rivers of blood, more cities in flame, more ruins! Yet all
  this came to nothing, for after the Persian War, which lasted for
  fifty-one years, the king of Persia, Xerxes<sup><a href=
  "#footnote5">5</a></sup>, had been defeated by the Greeks, and
  Philip of Macedonia in his turn destroyed their monarchy, without
  in any way assuring the future of his dynasty or the supremacy of
  his nation.</p>

  <p>Again, war had created nothing,
  consolidated nothing; it had served merely to abase human nature
  and plunge nations into anarchy.</p>

  <p>Ancient Greece is rightly said to have
  scattered the shadows of these evil times with the light of her
  arts and literature. True, but far from owing her high degree of
  civilization to the insistence that might makes right, she became
  a source of light only when she had repelled the external
  invasions and renounced the civil wars which threatened to
  destroy the works of her geniuses. It cannot be said too often
  that it was to the ultimate establishment of peace that ancient
  Greece owed her glory and her prosperity.</p>

  <p>What can be said of the kingdom of Thrace,
  set up by the Gauls who had ravaged Macedonia, or of the kingdoms
  of Pontus, of Bythnia, of Pergamum and of Syria, founded by
  adventurers after the battle of Ipsus in 301 B.C.? Not the
  slightest trace is left of these nations which, born in pillage,
  died in blood.</p>

  <p>And what of the Roman Empire? Let us indeed
  talk of Rome, which for centuries brought ruin to every state
  then known and which flung at all mankind the challenge of the
  "civis Romanus": Surrender or die! How well its legions, who made
  and unmade emperors, knew how to introduce civilization to the
  vast lands they overran!</p>

  <p>You will say perhaps that the ancient
  Romans, possessing at home a level of culture unknown to the rest
  of the human race, carried it with them to whatever part of the
  world they went. Wrong! People were tired of the ancient anarchy
  that had dominated their world, and at its end their longing for
  peace and security was manifest everywhere. But the bloody
  victories of the Roman emperors continually thwarted this
  awakening without offering to the vanquished in return even the
  smallest particle of their much vaunted civilization. The
  vanquished became no more than wretched slaves.</p>

  <p>In support of militaristic ideas, people
  often cite the example of certain Roman lands whose populations,
  being far from any of the numerous theatres of war, lapsed into
  decadence. The fact in itself is true, but the corruption of the
  foremost families of these lands was precisely a result of the
  wars of conquest which had led to the loss of their homeland's
  independence. The conqueror had bent them under his yoke, and its
  weight crushed any sense of dignity which could have inspired
  them to rebel. Under the domination of the conqueror, their
  choice lay between fighting wars for the glory and profit of Rome
  or becoming shameless lackeys of the master without hope of ever
  enjoying again the rewards of remunerative labor.</p>

  <p>It is certainly true that if ever a
  colossal and persevering effort was made to build a world empire,
  it was made by ancient Rome, which drowned whole kingdoms in the
  blood of the people over many generations. Yet what is left now
  of this absolute power, this monstrous creation, this crowning
  achievement of war? After the Punic Wars, the destruction of
  Carthage, and the conquests of Spain and of Gallia Narbonensis,
  there followed, as if by way of expiation, the degradation of the
  Roman Empire by the barbarian invasions. In the fifth century
  A.D., the Alans, Suevians, and Vandals invaded Italy, Gaul, and
  Spain. The Visigoths and Burgundians, in their turn, settled in
  Gaul and the Saxons in Great Britain. Then, toward the middle of
  the next century, the Heruls put an end to the Western Empire.
  The Heruls were subsequently overrun by the Ostrogoths, whose own
  monarchy was soon afterwards destroyed by the Emperor Justinian
  <sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>And as the din of battle fades away, the
  work of civilization must start all over again in a world of
  physical and moral chaos. This, then, is what is known as the
  ennobling and civilizing influence of war through the ages!</p>

  <p>No sooner had the human family begun to
  recover its balance, to emerge timidly from the ruins, than new
  wars came to plunge it back into the morass. The inexorable law
  of the strongest or of the most brazen reasserted itself in the
  seventh and eighth centuries with the appearance of the Saracen
  armies who seized Chaldea, Phoenicia, Palestine, Egypt, Cyprus,
  Rhodes, and a part of Spain. Then, since once again wars of
  conquest were doomed to achieve nothing permanent, the Saracens
  were in their turn defeated at Poitiers by Charles
  Martel<sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> in 732. Half a
  century later, Charlemagne<sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>
  crushed the Lombard empire in Italy and the empire of the Avars
  in Pannonia (Hungary), overran Spain as far as the Ebro River,
  and conquered all of Germania.</p>

  <p>A powerful empire was founded on the debris
  of monarchies and peoples. Would it now be possible to recuperate
  and take up again the thread of civilization which had been
  broken for so many centuries by bloody struggles of no lasting
  consequence?</p>

  <p>Alas no! The so-called civilized world
  entered the eleventh century to find that the Furies of war once
  more awaited it in the form, on the one hand, of the first war
  between England and France under Philip I in 1087<sup><a href=
  "#footnote9">9</a></sup> and on the other, the First Crusade in
  1096.</p>

  <p>The hatred fomented by the first
  hostilities between England and France lasted for more than eight
  centuries; provinces were lost, retaken, and lost again, but to
  what useful end? In 1415 Henry V of England was proclaimed King
  of France<sup><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup>. In 1450 the
  English were expelled from French territory. In 1755 a new
  Anglo-French war broke out; this was followed by war at sea in
  1778 which lasted until 1783<sup><a href=
  "#footnote11">11</a></sup> when the Peace of Versailles brought a
  momentary halt to hostilities. These, however, were soon resumed
  with renewed vigor, continuing throughout the period of the
  Republic and the Empire. Are we to pretend that such persistent
  hatred serves the cause of civilization and restores order where
  disorder prevailed in international relations? The detailed
  history of these wars gives us proof of the contrary.</p>

  <p>And the Crusades? That absurd epic, which
  originated in 1096, declared its aim to be the deliverance of the
  lands of the Holy Sepulchre from the Turks. There were seven
  Crusades, which cut down the flower of Europe's nobility and
  annihilated innumerable poor serfs for a period of more than 150
  years until 1270<sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup>. At this
  time the Greeks, having thrown off the Crusaders, revived the
  Eastern Empire, and eleven years later, the Turkish Empire came
  into being. The Crusades, it is claimed, brought to the people of
  the East the civilization of the West. It is more probable that
  they bestowed upon the West the vices of the East. In any case,
  it is certain that the peoples of Europe who had taken part in
  the Crusades were even more ignorant at the end of these distant
  expeditions than when they had first heard the cry of Peter the
  Hermits: "God wills it! God wills it!"<sup><a href=
  "#footnote13">13</a></sup></p>

  <p>Moreover, to gain some idea of the sort of
  civilization spread abroad among nations by these great and
  entirely fruitless wars, it is enough to refer to the state of
  anarchy prevailing, for example, in France, where the habitual
  contempt for law led inevitably to armed strife, province against
  province, town against town, castle against castle; and always,
  the peasant was the victim sacrificed to the sins of his noble
  masters.</p>

  <p>The dismal night of the Middle Ages is so
  familiar to us that we need not dwell on its era of violence and
  human retrogression. This chaotic period, the product of bloody
  contests whose sole, though unavowed, purpose was spoliation,
  shows well enough that war can lead only to war and never to
  progress or civilization.</p>

  <p>Let us now go into the history of the
  formation of the modern state where we will find war once more the
  evil genie of misery and injustice at every stage of
  development.</p>

  <p>The year 1618 saw the outbreak of the
  Thirty Years' War, waged by the German States, Austria, Sweden,
  and France under the pretext of religion. Massacre, pillage, the
  burning of villages and of whole lands, famine and demoralization
  - such is the sinister record of over a quarter of a century's
  folly. After the population of Germany had been decimated, a
  peace was signed in Westphalia which did no more than reaffirm
  the original state of affairs except for granting some
  concessions to princes who did not even know how to preserve
  them. It was certainly not worth the trouble of tearing one
  another apart for thirty years just to arrive at the conclusion
  that nobody knew for what or for whom he had been fighting.</p>

  <p>The lesson learned would seem to have been
  forceful enough to persuade everybody, from then on, to devote
  himself to establishing the permanent peace so badly needed.
  However, the waves stirred up by the storm were not so easily
  calmed, and the end of the seventeenth century was marked by a
  series of intrigues and truces which continued to the middle of
  the eighteenth, alternating with periods of so-called general
  peace which, even then, allowed few people to breathe freely.</p>

  <p>We certainly cannot claim that civilization
  made no progress at all in the course of the centuries following
  the Dark Ages. Wars, however frequent and destructive they may
  be, have never been able to kill entirely the intellectual and
  moral sense which raises man above the beast. The spirit of
  discovery and the need for solidarity as a prime condition of
  personal well-being had not been lost in the debris of kingdoms
  made and unmade by war. Great inventions and important
  discoveries had broadened the scope of productive activity, first
  of individuals and then of groups, and mankind was beginning to
  seek protection against an arbitrary use of violence that served
  only ignorance and oppression. The relative calm of the second
  half of the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth
  centuries nurtured this tendency, allowing it to grow - timidly
  at first among the enlightened - and to spread later among the
  masses. The concept of justice was emerging, escaping from the
  shackles of violence.</p>

  <p>The Republic which succeeded the Bourbon
  monarchy in France had to wage wars in order to assert the right
  of the people to establish for themselves a political regime
  which would support their chosen internal policy. So it was that
  the clamor of war finally confused France to the point of making
  her forget that her role was a defensive one. Militarism
  reappeared, more ruthless than ever, bringing about the terrible
  era of the Napoleonic Wars and a reversion to barbarism in full
  contradition of the great principles proclaimed by the Revolution
  of 1789.</p>

  <p>There are those who maintain that the war
  which followed for twenty unbroken years, spreading to every
  corner of Europe, had the merit of circulating modern ideas even
  though presented to various peoples on the bayonets of the French
  grenadiers; who maintain, in short, that the frequent massacres,
  the sacking of cities and towns, and the crushing of the defeated
  had this time been the true agents of civilization.</p>

  <p>This is a flagrant misconception to be
  found in extravagantly chauvinistic history books. The principles
  of the French Revolution would have forced their way into the
  consciousness of nations more surely and more quickly during
  peace and prosperity than they could ever have done in an
  atmosphere of hatred and defiance which encouraged excesses of
  unwarranted violence.</p>

  <p>It is a fact that the end of the wars of
  the first Empire found populations, that of France above all,
  drained of manpower and resources of every kind. After dreaming
  of world domination, leading her armies to the farthest frontiers
  of Europe, and serving the whims of a despot, France now had to
  give up a part of her own territory and, under monarchs set on
  the throne from without, begin the toilsome climb from the depths
  of the abyss into which militarism had hurled her.</p>

  <p>The other countries in Europe, mutilated
  and devastated by twenty years of war, did not, in the midst of
  their ruins, seem to appreciate very much the lessons in
  civilization which were supposedly imparted to them along with
  the grapeshot. Beyond doubt the people would have accepted these
  modern ideas of law and justice more willingly and more quickly if
  they had peaceably discovered their source instead of discovering
  it while watching their fields laid waste, their homes burned,
  and their young men killed.</p>

  <p>Let no one refer to the sword of Napoleon I
  as the instrument of progress and civilization!</p>

  <p>Some will object perhaps that I have so far
  spoken only of wars of conquest and will ask me what I think
  about the wars of independence which broke out in Europe after
  the Restoration of 1815; no doubt they will demand comment
  particularly about the intervention on behalf of the Greeks in
  1827 and about the aid given by France in 1860 to Italy in her
  struggle to resist Austrian domination.</p>

  <p>Such a question would not embarrass me. The
  struggles of races and nations to regain their independence are
  the products of earlier violations of right, which constitute
  provocation in the eyes of the passive nations. Had the latter
  not, in the first place, been deprived of their autonomy, been
  oppressed and cut off from lands to which they had a natural
  affinity, their people would not have resorted to force in order
  to rectify an original abuse of force. The Greek war of
  independence, for example, was no more than the conclusion of an
  earlier war of conquest; the same is true of every other uprising
  of a people demanding their right to independence.</p>

  <p>These calls to arms are for the purpose of
  reestablishing the natural order of affairs as it was before its
  violation by foreign invasions in an era when force superseded
  law; they are simply the result of these invasions and of the
  oppressive measures taken to assure their continued effect. These
  wars would not have occurred, nor would these situations
  themselves have arisen, if a regime of international justice such
  as that advocated by the friends of peace had been established
  rather than repressed for over two thousand years by the
  apologists of war.</p>

  <p>What can we say of other wars of our time
  which did not have the liberation of oppressed peoples as their
  primary objective? Fomented by diplomatic intrigues or by private
  speculation, these intermittent reversions to primitive brutality
  have produced nothing, apart from the spilling of blood, except
  the creation of a state of anarchy in international relations and
  the foundation for future conflicts. In 1855, France, England,
  and the Piedmont seized Sebastopol in order to weaken Russia and
  strengthen Turkey<sup><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup>. Now,
  these same powers are allying themselves with Russia in an effort
  to impose their will on the Sultan with respect to the internal
  administration of his states<sup><a href=
  "#footnote15">15</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>The French expedition to Mexico in 1861
  cost the French 800 million francs and exacted untold material
  wealth and manpower from the Mexicans, only to end in the
  disaster at Quer&eacute;taro which erased all traces of the empire
  on whose throne the French army had placed the Archduke
  Maximilian<sup><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>The invasion of Schleswig-Holstein by
  Austria and Prussia in 1864 had, by 1866, resulted in mutual
  recrimination between the two who had conspired together in this
  act of violence, thereby appointing themselves the sole judges of
  their own cause. Austria, humiliated at Sadowa, later joined
  hands with Prussia again to form the Triple Alliance<sup><a href=
  "#footnote17">17</a></sup>, which now is scarcely worth the paper
  it is written on.</p>

  <p>Again in Europe, the Russo-Turkish War of
  1877 was concluded by the Treaty of San Stefano, which the Treaty
  of Berlin later nullified and which was even less well disposed
  to the claims of the Balkan peoples.</p>

  <p>As for the Spanish-American War over the
  possession of Cuba, or the war in the Transvaal, or the combined
  expedition against China, or the present Russo-Japanese War - all
  these are too recent<sup><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> for
  us to be able to draw any conclusions. One thing, however, is
  certain, and that is that they have contributed appreciably to
  the discrediting of war. I leave to the militarists the difficult
  task of trying to explain to us how these wars have served to
  shape character or to promote the progress of civilization, or to
  achieve the reign of justice on earth. So far, they have not come
  forward with the explanation.</p>

  <p>In concluding my historical survey, I
  invite the attention of those who wish to devote some serious
  study to the relationships between war and the moral and material
  development of mankind.</p>

  <p>One question often asked of pacifists is:
  Granted that war is an evil, what can you find to put in its
  place when an amicable solution becomes impossible? The treaties
  of arbitration concluded in the past few years<sup><a href=
  "#footnote19">19</a></sup> provide an answer to this question by
  showing with what ease, given goodwill on both sides,
  international disputes can be ironed out and eliminated as cruel
  preoccupations of our times.</p>

  <p>The Convention for the Pacific Settlement
  of International Disputes' signed at The Hague in 1899 by
  twenty-six nations offers a solution to international conflicts
  by a method unknown in the ancient world, in the Middle Ages, or
  even in modern history, a method of settling quarrels between
  nations without bloodshed. The method is not yet perfect, it is
  true, but it is an expression of what we were hoping for in
  bettering the conditions which gave it birth. Let it become a
  duty to apply its provisions in every case possible, and the
  friends of peace will be satisfied with this beginning. Later,
  after some experience has been gained, it will be perfected, and
  the human conscience, at last awakened, will regard it as the
  cornerstone of the structure of law and justice which will
  preside over international relations in the future.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the ideas which have
  sprung up in opposition to the abuse of force represented by war,
  several nations, including some of the most important ones, have
  recently signed treaties agreeing to submit to arbitration at the
  Court of The Hague any differences which may arise between them.
  We have welcomed the signing of such treaties between France and
  Great Britain, between France and Italy, between Great Britain
  and Italy, between France and Spain, and between The Netherlands
  and Denmark. Other similar conventions are being drafted by most
  of the European nations. This is a true sign of the times and,
  for once, the militaristic mind will be hard put to plunge
  mankind again into the follies of the past.<sup><a href=
  "#footnote20">20</a></sup></p>

  <p>That is not all: France and England, taking
  advantage of the security given them by their treaty of permanent
  arbitration, have just concluded an agreement with respect to all
  the colonial questions that might have become a source of
  friction or dispute between them; namely, those of Egypt,
  Morocco, Siam, Newfoundland, etc. Let us admit that if all the
  other signatory nations of the Hague Convention were to draw up
  arbitration treaties between each other, and then were to settle
  points that might possibly constitute a source of conflict, there
  would no longer be any need to declare peace: it would exist
  <i>ipso facto</i>. No longer would the reign of peace be subject
  to the perpetual contradictions of war, for it would rest on the
  unassailable bedrock of justice, of law, and of the solidarity of
  peoples!</p>
