  <h1>Abdus Salam - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="salam.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Abdus Salam</b> was born in Jhang, a
  small town in what is now Pakistan, in 1926. His father was an
  official in the Department of Education in a poor farming
  district. His family has a long tradition of piety and
  learning.<br>
  <br>
  When he cycled home from Lahore, at the age of 14, after gaining
  the highest marks ever recorded for the Matriculation Examination
  at the University of the Punjab, the whole town turned out to
  welcome him. He won a scholarship to Government College,
  University of the Punjab, and took his MA in 1946. In the same
  year he was awarded a scholarship to St. John's
  College, Cambridge, where he took a BA (honours) with a
  double First in mathematics and physics in 1949. In 1950 he
  received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding
  pre-doctoral contribution to physics. He also obtained a PhD in
  theoretical physics at Cambridge; his thesis, published in 1951,
  contained fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics which had
  already gained him an international reputation.<br>
  <br>
  Salam returned to Pakistan in 1951 to teach mathematics at
  Government College, Lahore, and in 1952 became head of the
  Mathematics Department of the Punjab University. He had come back
  with the intention of founding a school of research, but it soon
  became clear that this was impossible. To pursue a career of
  research in theoretical physics he had no alternative at that
  time but to leave his own country and work abroad. Many years
  later he succeeded in finding a way to solve the heartbreaking
  dilemma faced by many young and gifted theoretical physicists
  from developing countries. At the ICTP, Trieste, which he
  created, he instituted the famous "Associateships" which allowed
  deserving young physicists to spend their vacations there in an
  invigorating atmosphere, in close touch with their peers in
  research and with the leaders in their own field, losing their
  sense of isolation and returning to their own country for nine
  months of the academic year refreshed and recharged.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 Salam left his native country for a lectureship at
  Cambridge, and since then has visited Pakistan as adviser on
  science policy. His work for Pakistan has, however, been
  far-reaching and influential. He was a member of the Pakistan
  Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the Scientific Commission
  of Pakistan and was Chief Scientific Adviser to the President
  from 1961 to 1974.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1957 he has been Professor of Theoretical Physics at
  Imperial College, London, and since 1964 has combined this
  position with that of Director of the ICTP, Trieste.<br>
  <br>
  For more than forty years he has been a prolific researcher in
  theoretical elementary particle physics. He has either pioneered
  or been associated with all the important developments in this
  field, maintaining a constant and fertile flow of brilliant
  ideas. For the past thirty years he has used his academic
  reputation to add weight to his active and influential
  participation in international scientific affairs. He has served
  on a number of United Nations committees concerned with the
  advancement of science and technology in developing
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  To accommodate the astonishing volume of activity that he
  undertakes, Professor Salam cuts out such inessentials as
  holidays, parties and entertainments. Faced with such an example,
  the staff of the Centre find it very difficult to complain that
  they are overworked.<br>
  <br>
  He has a way of keeping his administrative staff at the ICTP
  fully alive to the real aim of the Centre - the fostering through
  training and research of the advancement of theoretical physics,
  with special regard to the needs of developing countries.
  Inspired by their personal regard for him and encouraged by the
  fact that he works harder than any of them, the staff cheerfully
  submit to working conditions that would be unthinkable here at
  the (<a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/index.html">International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna (IAEA)</a>.
  The money he received from the Atoms for Peace Medal and Award he
  spent on setting up a fund for young Pakistani physicists to
  visit the ICTP. He uses his share of the Nobel Prize entirely for
  the benefit of physicists from developing countries and does not
  spend a penny of it on himself or his family.<br>
  <br>
  Abdus Salam is known to be a devout Muslim, whose religion does
  not occupy a separate compartment of his life; it is inseparable
  from his work and family life. He once wrote: "The Holy Quran
  enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah's created laws of
  nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to
  glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I
  render thanks with a humble heart."</p>
