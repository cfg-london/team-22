  <h1>Joseph E. Murray - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="murray.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born, as were my father and his
  parents, in Milford, Massachusetts, a town 30 miles southwest of
  Boston. My father's parents were of Southern Irish and English
  extraction. My mother was born in Providence, Rhode Island, soon
  after her parents had emigrated to the United States from Italy.
  Father was a lawyer and a District Court Judge, mother a school
  teacher. Both parents had benefited from and stressed the value
  of the educational opportunities this country offered. By example
  and precept they emphasized the need for service to others.<br>
  <br>
  From earliest memory I wanted to be a surgeon, possibly
  influenced by the qualities of our family doctor who cared for
  our childhood ailments. As a second year high school chemistry
  student, I still have a vivid memory of my excitement when I
  first saw a chart of the periodic table of elements. The order in
  the universe seemed miraculous, and I wanted to study and learn
  as much as possible about the natural sciences.<br>
  <br>
  I chose to attend a small liberal arts college, College of the Holy
  Cross, and concentrated on Latin, Greek, Philosophy and
  English. Assuming I'd receive ample science in medical school, I
  took the minimum of chemistry, physics and biology.<br>
  <br>
  My four years at Harvard Medical School were all that I had dreamed
  they would be. The classmates and faculty were stimulating and
  friendly. The hospitals were filled with all varieties of
  patients. Although the hours of study and hospital duty were
  long, life was rich and full. Symphony Hall and the Gardner
  Museum were within walking distance, squash courts were available
  for daily exercise, our singing group met weekly, bicycle trips
  and club dances added to the variety. It was heaven.<br>
  <br>
  During the final few months of medical school, while attending a
  Boston Symphony Orchestra concert with several classmates and
  their dates, I noticed a lovely young lady "far too nice" for the
  fellow she was with. At intermission I manipulated her towards
  the corridor and learned that she was Bobby Link, a music student
  concentrating on voice and piano. By the time the intermission
  had ended I realized that I had met the girl I would marry.<br>
  <br>
  After intermittent dates during my internship and brief meetings
  during hectic wartime weekends while I was on active duty, Bobby
  and I were married in June 1945. We have six children, three boys
  and three girls. Each has contributed to society in her/his own
  way, in education, medicine, nursing, business and science.
  Bobby's music, pursued professionally for 15 years after
  marriage, continually adds to the richness and beauty of our
  family and social life.<br>
  <br>
  My only medical school activity bearing any resemblance to
  research was a study of the then new Papanicolau smear of
  epithelial cells. I presented a report before the student
  Boyleston Society with Dr. Arthur Hertig as my faculty sponsor.
  Later, while a surgical intern at the Peter Bent Brigham
  Hospital, I introduced this technique clinically.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in the biology of tissue and organ transplantation
  arose from my military experience at Valley Forge General
  Hospital in Pennsylvania. As a First Lieutenant with only a
  nine-month surgical internship behind me, I was randomly assigned
  to VFGH to await overseas duty. World War II was still raging,
  the Rhine River had not been crossed, the Battle of the Bulge was
  ahead.<br>
  <br>
  VFGH was a major plastic surgical center. While there, I spent
  all my available spare time on the plastic surgical wards which
  were jammed with hundreds of battle casualties. I enjoyed talking
  to the patients, helping with dressings, and observing the
  results of the imaginative reconstructive surgical
  operations.<br>
  <br>
  I learned only years later that Colonel James Barrett Brown, the
  Chief of Plastic Surgery, had noticed my day and night presence
  on the wards and requested that Lt. Murray be kept at VFGH and
  not sent overseas like the rest of the "nine-month wonders."
  Three years later, two years after the war ended, I finally was
  discharged in November 1947.<br>
  <br>
  During my army service, we always had many burned patients to
  care for. Some were so extensively burned that donor sites for
  skin autografts were not available. As a life-saving measure for
  these patients, skin grafts were taken from other persons and
  used as a temporary surface cover.<br>
  <br>
  The slow rejection of the foreign skin grafts fascinated me. How
  could the host distinguish another person's skin from his own?
  Colonel Brown and I often discussed this while scrubbing. In
  civilian life Brown had treated many severely burned patients
  with temporary skin allografts and observed and written about the
  differential dissolution of skin allografts from various donors.
  He tentatively postulated that the closer the genetic
  relationship between the skin donor and the recipient, the slower
  the dissolution of the graft. In 1937, he had experimentally
  cross skin grafted a pair of identical twins and documented
  permanent graft survival in both twins. This was the impetus to
  my study of organ transplantation, which is the subject of my
  Nobel Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  My life as a surgeon-scientist, combining humanity and science,
  has been fantastically rewarding. In our daily patients we
  witness human nature in the raw-fear, despair, courage,
  understanding, hope, resignation, heroism. If alert, we can
  detect new problems to solve, new paths to investigate.<br>
  <br>
  Our laboratory work involved close contact with many non-clinical
  scientists. <a href="../1960/index.html">Sir Peter Medawar</a>,
  1960 Nobel Laureate, was a frequent visitor to our lab and to the
  hospital. He once commented, after visiting an early renal
  transplant patient, that it was the first time he had been in a
  hospital ward. Dr. <a href="../1988/index.html">George
  Hitchings</a> and Dr. <a href="../1988/index.html">Trudy
  Elion</a>, 1988 Nobel Laureates, were completely at home in our
  lab and knew many of the dogs by name. Sir Roy Calne, who worked
  in our laboratory at Harvard Medical School and Peter Bent
  Brigham in 1960-61 as a Surgical Research Fellow, and I
  frequently visited them in Tuckahoe, New York, to discuss
  prospective trial drugs. Billingham, Eichwald, Amos, van Rood -
  to mention only a few other basic investigators - also enriched
  the tapestry of our lives.<br>
  <br>
  Medawar said it best, "This whole period was a golden age of
  immunology, an age abounding in synthetic discoveries all over
  the world, a time we all thought it was good to be alive. We, who
  were working on these problems, all knew each other and met as
  often as we could to exchange ideas and hot news from the
  laboratory."<br>
  <br>
  For recreation, I have always been a physical enthusiast. As a
  family we have camped, hiked, trekked, or backpacked over
  portions of five continents. Competitive tennis remains fun. Our
  extended family, with 11 grandchildren, gets together frequently
  during the year, and always every summer on Martha's Vineyard
  Island in Massachusetts.<br>
  <br>
  We have been blessed in our lives beyond my wildest dreams. My
  only wish would be to have ten more lives to live on this planet.
  If that were possible, I'd spend one lifetime each in embryology,
  genetics, physics, astronomy and geology. The other lifetimes
  would be as a pianist, backwoodsman, tennis player, or writer for
  the <i>National Geographic</i>. If anyone has bothered to read
  this far, you would note that I still have one future lifetime
  unaccounted for. That is because I'd like to keep open the option
  for another lifetime as a surgeon-scientist.</p>
