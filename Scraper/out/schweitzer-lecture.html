  <h2><br>The Problem of Peace</h2>

  <p>For the subject of my lecture, a
  redoubtable honor imposed by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize,
  I have chosen the problem of peace as it is today. In so doing, I
  believe that I have acted in the spirit of the founder of this
  prize who devoted himself to the study of the problem as it
  existed in his own day and age, and who expected his Foundation
  to encourage consideration of ways to serve the cause of
peace.</p>

  <p>I shall begin with an account of the
  situation at the end of the two wars through which we have
  recently passed.</p>

  <p>The statesmen who were responsible for
  shaping the world of today through the negotiations which
  followed each of these two wars found the cards stacked against
  them. Their aim was not so much to create situations which might
  give rise to widespread and prosperous development as it was to
  establish the results of victory on a permanent basis. Even if
  their judgment had been unerring, they could not have used it as
  a guide. They were obliged to regard themselves as the executors
  of the will of the conquering peoples. They could not aspire to
  establishing relations between peoples on a just and proper
  basis; all their efforts were taken up by the necessity of
  preventing the most unreasonable of the demands made by the
  victors from becoming reality; they had, moreover, to convince
  the conquering nations to compromise with each other whenever
  their respective views and interests conflicted.</p>

  <p>The true source of what is untenable in our
  present situation - and the victors are beginning to suffer from
  it as well as the vanquished - lies in the fact that not enough
  thought was given to the realities of historical fact and,
  consequently, to what is just and beneficial.</p>

  <p>The historical problem of Europe is
  conditioned by the fact that in past centuries, particularly in
  the so-called era of the great invasions, the peoples from the
  East penetrated farther and farther into the West and Southwest,
  taking possession of the land<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>. So
  it came about that the later immigrants intermingled with the
  earlier already established immigrants.</p>

  <p>A partial fusion of these peoples took
  place during this time, and new relatively homogeneous political
  societies were formed within the new frontiers. In western and
  central Europe, this evolution led to a situation which may be
  said to have crystallized and become definitive in its main
  features in the course of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>In the East and Southeast, on the other
  hand, the evolution did not reach this stage; it stopped with the
  coexistence of nationalities which failed to merge. Each could
  lay some claim to rightful ownership of the land. One might claim
  territorial rights by virtue of longer possession or superiority
  of numbers, while another might point to its contribution in
  developing the land. The only practical solution would have been
  for the two groups to agree to live together in the same
  territory and in a single political society, in accordance with a
  compromise acceptable to both. It would have been necessary,
  however, for this state of affairs to have been reached before
  the second third of the nineteenth century. For, from then on,
  there was increasingly vigorous development of national
  consciousness which brought with it serious consequences. This
  development no longer allowed peoples to be guided by historical
  realities and by reason.</p>

  <p>The First World War, then, had its origins
  in the conditions which prevailed in eastern and southeastern
  Europe. The new order created after both world wars bears in its
  turn the seeds of a future conflict.</p>

  <p>Any new postwar structure is bound to
  contain the seeds of conflict unless it takes account of
  historical fact and is designed to provide a just and objective
  solution to problems in the light of that fact. Only such a
  solution can be really permanent.</p>

  <p>Historical reality is trampled underfoot
  if, when two peoples have rival historical claims to the same
  country, the claims of only one are recognized. The titles which
  two nations hold to disputed parts of Europe never have more than
  a relative value since the peoples of both are, in effect,
  immigrants.</p>

  <p>Similarly, we are guilty of contempt for
  history if, in establishing a new order, we fail to take economic
  realities into consideration when fixing frontiers. Such is the case if
  we draw a boundary so as to deprive a port of its natural
  hinterland or raise a barrier between a region rich in raw
  materials and another particularly suited to exploiting them. By
  such measures do we create states which cannot survive
  economically.</p>

  <p>The most flagrant violation of historical
  rights, and indeed of human rights, consists in depriving certain
  peoples of their right to the land on which they live, thus
  forcing them to move to other territories. At the end of the
  Second World War, the victorious powers decided to impose this
  fate on hundreds of thousands of people, and under the most harsh
  conditions<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>; from this we can
  judge how little aware they were of any mission to work toward a
  reorganization which would be reasonably equitable and which
  would guarantee a propitious future.</p>

  <p>Our situation ever since the Second World
  War has been characterized essentially by the fact that no peace
  treaty has yet been signed<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It
  was only through agreements of a truce-like nature that the war
  came to an end; and it is indeed because of our inability to
  effect a reorganization, however elemental, that we are obliged
  to be content with these truces which, dictated by the needs of
  the moment, can have no foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>This then is the present situation. How do
  we perceive the problem of peace now?</p>

  <p>In quite a new light - different to the
  same extent that modern war is different from war in the past.
  War now employs weapons of death and destruction incomparably
  more effective than those of the past and is consequently a worse
  evil than ever before. Heretofore war could be regarded as an
  evil to which men must resign themselves because it served
  progress and was even necessary to it. One could argue that
  thanks to war the peoples with the strongest virtues survived;
  thus determining the course of history.</p>

  <p>It could be claimed, for example, that the
  victory of Cyrus over the Babylonians created an empire in the
  Near East with a civilization higher than that which it
  supplanted, and that Alexander the Great's victory in its turn
  opened the way, from the Nile to the Indus, for Greek
  civilization. The reverse, however, sometimes occurred when war
  led to the replacement of a superior civilization by an inferior
  one, as it did, for instance, in the seventh century and at the
  beginning of the eighth when the Arabs gained mastery over
  Persia, Asia Minor, Palestine, North Africa, and Spain, countries
  that had hitherto flourished under a Greco-Roman
  civilization.</p>

  <p>It would seem then that, in the past, war
  could operate just as well in favor of progress as against it. It
  is with much less conviction that we can claim modern war to be
  an agent of progress. The evil that it embodies weighs more
  heavily on us than ever before.</p>

  <p>It is pertinent to recall that the
  generation preceding 1914 approved the enormous stockpiling of
  armaments. The argument was that a military decision would be
  reached with rapidity and that very brief wars could be expected.
  This opinion was accepted without contradiction.</p>

  <p>Because they anticipated the progressive
  humanization of the methods of war, people also believed that the
  evils resulting from future conflicts would be relatively slight.
  This supposition grew out of the obligations accepted by nations
  under the terms of the Geneva Convention of 1864, following the
  efforts of the Red Cross. Mutual guarantees were exchanged
  concerning care for the wounded, the humane treatment of
  prisoners of war, and the welfare of the civilian population.
  This convention did indeed achieve some significant results for
  which hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians were to
  be thankful in the wars to come. But, compared to the miseries of
  war, which have grown beyond all proportion with the introduction
  of modern weapons of death and destruction, they are trivial
  indeed. Truly, it cannot be a question of humanizing war.</p>

  <p>The concept of the brief war and that of
  the humanization of its methods, propounded as they were on the
  eve of war in 1914, led people to take the war less seriously
  than they should have. They regarded it as a storm which was to
  clear the political air and as an event which was to end the arms
  race that was ruining nations.</p>

  <p>While some lightheartedly supported the war
  on account of the profits they expected to gain from it, others
  did so from a more noble motive: this war must be the war to end
  all wars. Many a brave man set out for battle in the belief that
  he was fighting for a day when war would no longer exist.</p>

  <p>In this conflict, just as in that of 1939,
  these two concepts proved to be completely wrong. Slaughter and
  destruction continued year after year and were carried on in the
  most inhumane way. In contrast to the war of 1870<a href=
  "#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>.the duel was not between two isolated
  nations, but between two great groups of nations, so that a large
  share of mankind became embroiled, thus compounding the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>Since we now know what a terrible evil war
  is, we must spare no effort to prevent its recurrence. To this
  reason must also be added an ethical one: In the course of the
  last two wars, we have been guilty of acts of inhumanity which
  make one shudder, and in any future war we would certainly be
  guilty of even worse. This must not happen!</p>

  <p>Let us dare to face the situation. Man has
  become superman. He is a superman because he not only has at his
  disposal innate physical forces, but also commands, thanks to
  scientific and technological advances, the latent forces of
  nature which he can now put to his own use. To kill at a
  distance, man used to rely solely on his own physical strength;
  he used it to bend the bow and to release the arrow. The superman
  has progressed to the stage where, thanks to a device designed
  for the purpose, he can use the energy released by the combustion
  of a given combination of chemical products. This enables him to
  employ a much more effective projectile and to propel it over far
  greater distances.</p>

  <p>However, the superman suffers from a fatal
  flaw. He has failed to rise to the level of superhuman reason
  which should match that of his superhuman strength. He requires
  such reason to put this vast power to solely reasonable and
  useful ends and not to destructive and murderous ones. Because he
  lacks it, the conquests of science and technology become a mortal
  danger to him rather than a blessing.</p>

  <p>In this context is it not significant that
  the first great scientific discovery, the harnessing of the force
  resulting from the combustion of gunpowder, was seen at first
  only as a means of killing at a distance?</p>

  <p>The conquest of the air, thanks to the
  internal-combustion engine, marked a decisive advance for
  humanity. Yet men grasped at once the opportunity it offered to
  kill and destroy from the skies. This invention underlined a fact
  which had hitherto been steadfastly denied: the more the superman
  gains in strength, the poorer he becomes. To avoid exposing
  himself completely to the destruction unleashed from the skies,
  he is obliged to seek refuge underground like a hunted animal. At
  the same time he must resign himself to abetting the
  unprecedented destruction of cultural values.</p>

  <p>A new stage was reached with the discovery
  and subsequent utilization of the vast forces liberated by the
  splitting of the atom. After a time, it was found that the
  destructive potential of a bomb armed with such was incalculable,
  and that even large-scale tests could unleash catastrophes
  threatening the very existence of the human race. Only now has
  the full horror of our position become obvious. No longer can we
  evade the question of the future of mankind.</p>

  <p>But the essential fact which we should
  acknowledge in our conscience, and which we should have
  acknowledged a long time ago, is that we are becoming inhuman to
  the extent that we become supermen. We have learned to tolerate
  the facts of war: that men are killed en masse -some twenty
  million in the Second World War - that whole cities and their
  inhabitants are annihilated by the atomic bomb, that men are
  turned into living torches by incendiary bombs. We learn of these
  things from the radio or newspapers and we judge them according
  to whether they signify success for the group of peoples to which
  we belong, or for our enemies. When we do admit to ourselves that
  such acts are the results of inhuman conduct, our admission is
  accompanied by the thought that the very fact of war itself
  leaves us no option but to accept them. In resigning ourselves to
  our fate without a struggle, we are guilty of inhumanity.</p>

  <p>What really matters is that we should all
  of us realize that we are guilty of inhumanity. The horror of
  this realization should shake us out of our lethargy so that we
  can direct our hopes and our intentions to the coming of an era
  in which war will have no place.</p>

  <p>This hope and this will can have but one
  aim: to attain, through a change in spirit, that superior reason
  which will dissuade us from misusing the power at our
  disposal.</p>

  <p>The first to have the courage to advance
  purely ethical arguments against war and to stress the necessity
  for reason governed by an ethical will was the great humanist
  Erasmus of Rotterdam in his <i>Querela pacis (The Complaint of
  Peace)</i> which appeared in 1517<a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>. In this book he depicts Peace on stage
  seeking an audience.</p>

  <p>Erasmus found few adherents to his way of
  thinking. To expect the affirmation of an ethical necessity to
  point the way to peace was considered a utopian ideal. Kant
  shared this opinion. In his essay on "Perpetual Peace", which
  appeared in 1795<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and in other
  publications in which he touches upon the problem of peace, he
  states his belief that peace will come only with the increasing
  authority of an international code of law, in accordance with
  which an international court of arbitration would settle disputes
  between nations. This authority, he maintains, should be based
  entirely on the increasing respect which in time, and for purely
  practical motives, men will hold for the law as such. Kant is
  unremitting in his insistence that the idea of a league of
  nations cannot be hoped for as the outcome of ethical argument,
  but only as the result of the perfecting of law. He believes that
  this process of perfecting will come of itself. In his opinion,
  "nature, that great artist" will lead men, very gradually, it is
  true, and over a very long period of time, through the march of
  history and the misery of wars, to agree on an international code
  of law which will guarantee perpetual peace.</p>

  <p>A plan for a league of nations having
  powers of arbitration was first formulated with some precision by
  Sully, the friend and minister of Henry IV. It was given detailed
  treatment by the Abb&eacute; Castel de Saint-Pierre in three works,
  the most important of which bears the title <i>Projet de paix
  perp&eacute;tuelle entre les souverains chr&eacute;tiens</i> [Plan
  for Perpetual Peace between Christian Sovereigns]. Kant was aware
  of the views it developed, probably from an extract which
  Rousseau published in 1761<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Today we can judge the efficacy of
  international institutions by the experience we have had with the
  League of Nations in Geneva and with the United Nations. Such
  institutions can render important services by offering to mediate
  conflicts at their very inception, by taking the initiative in
  setting up international projects, and by other actions of a
  similar nature, depending on the circumstances. One of the League
  of Nations' most important achievements was the creation in 1922
  of an internationally valid passport for the benefit of those who
  became stateless as a consequence of war<a href=
  "#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>. What a position those people would have
  been in if this travel document had not been devised through
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1922/index.html">Nansen</a>'s
  initiative! What would have been the fate of displaced persons
  after 1945 if the United Nations had not existed!</p>

  <p>Nevertheless these two institutions have
  been unable to bring about peace. Their efforts were doomed to
  fail since they were obliged to undertake them in a world in
  which there was no prevailing spirit directed toward peace. And
  being only legal institutions, they were unable to create such a
  spirit. The ethical spirit alone has the power to generate it.
  Kant deceived himself in thinking that he could dispense with it
  in his search for peace. We must follow the road on which he
  turned his back.</p>

  <p>What is more, we just cannot wait the
  extremely long time he deemed necessary for this movement toward
  peace to mature. War today means annihilation, a fact that Kant
  did not foresee. Decisive steps must be taken to ensure peace,
  and decisive results obtained without delay. Only through the
  spirit can all this be done.</p>

  <p>Is the spirit capable of achieving what we
  in our distress must expect of it?</p>

  <p>Let us not underestimate its power, the
  evidence of which can be seen throughout the history of mankind.
  The spirit created this humanitarianism which is the origin of
  all progress toward some form of higher existence. Inspired by
  humanitarianism we are true to ourselves and capable of creating.
  Inspired by a contrary spirit we are unfaithful to ourselves and
  fall prey to all manner of error.</p>

  <p>The height to which the spirit can ascend
  was revealed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It led
  those peoples of Europe who possessed it out of the Middle Ages,
  putting an end to superstition, witch hunts, torture, and a
  multitude of other forms of cruelty or traditional folly. It
  replaced the old with the new in an evolutionary way that never
  ceases to astonish those who observe it. All that we have ever
  possessed of true civilization, and indeed all that we still
  possess, can be traced to a manifestation of this spirit.</p>

  <p>Later, its power waned because the spirit
  failed to find support for its ethical character in a world
  preoccupied with scientific pursuits. It has been replaced by a
  spirit less sure of the course humanity should take and more
  content with lesser ideals. Today if we are to avoid our own
  downfall, we must commit ourselves to this spirit once again. It
  must bring forth a new miracle just as it did in the Middle Ages,
  an even greater miracle than the first.</p>

  <p>The spirit is not dead; it lives in
  isolation. It has overcome the difficulty of having to exist in a
  world out of harmony with its ethical character. It has come to
  realize that it can find no home other than in the basic nature
  of man. The independence acquired through its acceptance of this
  realization is an additional asset.</p>

  <p>It is convinced that compassion, in which
  ethics takes root, does not assume its true proportions until it
  embraces not only man but every living being. To the old ethics,
  which lacked this depth and force of conviction, has been added
  the ethics of reverence for life, and its validity is steadily
  gaining in recognition.</p>

  <p>Once more we dare to appeal to the whole
  man, to his capacity to think and feel, exhorting him to know
  himself and to be true to himself. We reaffirm our trust in the
  profound qualities of his nature. And our living. experiences are
  proving us right.</p>

  <p>In 1950, there appeared a book entitled
  <i>T&eacute;moignages d'humanit&eacute; [Documents of
  Humanity]</i><a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>, published by some
  professors from the University of G&ouml;ttingen who had been
  brought together by the frightful mass expulsion of the eastern
  Germans in 1945. The refugees tell in simple words of the help
  they received in their distress from men belonging to the enemy
  nations, men who might well have been moved to hate them. Rarely
  have I been so gripped by a book as I was by this one. It is a
  wonderful tonic for anyone who has lost faith in humanity.</p>

  <p>Whether peace comes or not depends on the
  direction in which the mentality of individuals develops and
  then, in turn, on that of their nations. This truth holds more
  meaning for us today than it did for the past. Erasmus, Sully,
  the Abb&eacute; Castel de Saint-Pierre, and the others who in their
  time were engrossed in the problem of peace dealt with princes
  and not with peoples. Their efforts tended to be concentrated on
  the establishment of a supranational authority vested with the
  power of arbitrating any difficulties which might arise between
  princes. Kant, in his essay on "Perpetual Peace", was the first
  to foresee an age when peoples would govern themselves and when
  they, no less than the sovereigns, would be concerned with the
  problem of peace. He thought of this evolution as progress. In
  his opinion, peoples would be more inclined than princes to
  maintain peace because it is they who bear the miseries of
  war.</p>

  <p>The time has come, certainly, when
  governments must look on themselves as the executors of the will
  of the people. But Kant's reliance on the people's innate love
  for peace has not been justified. Because the will of the people,
  being the will of the crowd, has not avoided the danger of
  instability and the risk of emotional distraction from the path
  of true reason, it has failed to demonstrate a vital sense of
  responsibility. Nationalism of the worst sort was displayed in
  the last two wars, and it may be regarded today as the greatest
  obstacle to mutual understanding between peoples.</p>

  <p>Such nationalism can be repulsed only
  through the rebirth of a humanitarian ideal among men which will
  make their allegiance to their country a natural one inspired by
  genuine ideals.</p>

  <p>Spurious nationalism is rampant in
  countries across the seas too, especially among those peoples who
  formerly lived under white domination and who have recently
  gained their independence. They are in danger of allowing
  nationalism to become their one and only ideal. Indeed, peace,
  which had prevailed until now in many areas, is today in
  jeopardy.</p>

  <p>These peoples, too, can overcome their
  naive nationalism only by adopting a humanitarian ideal. But how
  is such a change to be brought about? Only when the spirit
  becomes a living force within us and leads us to a civilization
  based on the humanitarian ideal, will it act, through us, upon
  these peoples. All men, even the semicivilized and the primitive,
  are, as beings capable of compassion, able to develop a
  humanitarian spirit. It abides within them like tinder ready to
  be lit, waiting only for a spark.</p>

  <p>The idea that the reign of peace must come
  one day has been given expression by a number of peoples who have
  attained a certain level of civilization. In Palestine it
  appeared for the first time in the words of the prophet Amos in
  the eighth century B.C.<a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and it
  continues to live in the Jewish and Christian religions as the
  belief in the Kingdom of God. It figures in the doctrine taught
  by the great Chinese thinkers: Confucius and Lao-tse in the sixth
  century B.C., Mi-tse in the fifth, and Meng-tse in the
  fourth<a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>. It reappears in
  Tolstoy<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a> and in other
  contemporary European thinkers. People have labeled it a utopia.
  But the situation today is such that it must become reality in
  one way or another; otherwise mankind will perish.</p>

  <p>I am well aware that what I have had to say
  on the problem of peace is not essentially new. It is my profound
  conviction that the solution lies in our rejecting war for an
  ethical reason; namely, that war makes us guilty of the crime of
  inhumanity. Erasmus of Rotterdam and several others after him
  have already proclaimed this as the truth around which we should
  rally.</p>

  <p>The only originality I claim is that for me
  this truth goes hand in hand with the intellectual certainty that
  the human spirit is capable of creating in our time a new
  mentality, an ethical mentality. Inspired by this certainty, I
  too proclaim this truth in the hope that my testimony may help to
  prevent its rejection as an admirable sentiment but a practical
  impossibility. Many a truth has lain unnoticed for a long time,
  ignored simply because no one perceived its potential for
  becoming reality.</p>

  <p>Only when an ideal of peace is born in the
  minds of the peoples will the institutions set up to maintain
  this peace effectively fulfill the function expected of them.</p>

  <p>Even today, we live in an age characterized
  by the absence of peace; even today, nations can feel themselves
  threatened by other nations; even today, we must concede to each
  nation the right to stand ready to defend itself with the
  terrible weapons now at its disposal.</p>

  <p>Such is the predicament in which we seek
  the first sign of the spirit in which we must place our trust.
  This sign can be none other than an effort on the part of peoples
  to atone as far as possible for the wrongs they inflicted upon
  each other during the last war. Hundreds of thousands of
  prisoners and deportees are waiting to return to their homes;
  others, unjustly condemned by a foreign power, await their
  acquittal; innumerable other injustices still await
  reparation.</p>

  <p>In the name of all who toil in the cause of
  peace, I beg the peoples to take the first step along this new
  highway. Not one of them will lose a fraction of the power
  necessary for their own defense.</p>

  <p>If we take this step to liquidate the
  injustices of the war which we have just experienced, we will
  instill a little confidence in all people. For any enterprise,
  confidence is the capital without which no effective work can be
  carried on. It creates in every sphere of activity conditions
  favoring fruitful growth. In such an atmosphere of confidence
  thus created we can begin to seek an equitable settlement of the
  problems caused by the two wars.</p>

  <p>I believe that I have expressed the
  thoughts and hopes of millions of men who, in our part of the
  world, live in fear of war to come. May my words convey their
  intended meaning if they penetrate to the other part of the world
  - the other side of the trench - to those who live there in the
  same fear.</p>

  <p>May the men who hold the destiny of peoples
  in their hands, studiously avoid anything that might cause the
  present situation to deteriorate and become even more dangerous.
  May they take to heart the words of the Apostle Paul: "If it be
  possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
  men".<a href="#not13"><sup>13</sup></a> These words are valid not
  only for individuals, but for nations as well. May these nations,
  in their efforts to maintain peace, do their utmost to give the
  spirit time to grow and to act.</p>
