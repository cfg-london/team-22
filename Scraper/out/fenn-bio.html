  <h1>John B. Fenn - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fenn.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Herbert
  Bennett Fenn, the eldest of three children was born and raised on
  a farm in northern Delaware which his father operated but did not
  own. I never saw that farm but I vividly remember my
  Grandmother's frequent reference to a single chestnut tree in the
  front yard, so large and prolific that the nuts from that one
  tree paid the taxes on the farm every year! My mother was the
  sixth of ten children in the family of John Clarence Dingman, a
  country doctor in Spring Valley, N.Y. whose three surviving sons
  also became physicians. Dad worked his way through college,
  graduating in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers in 1910, the
  same year that mother received a degree in Home Economics and
  Nutrition from Columbia. They were both hired by the Presbyterian
  Mission Board to teach at the Sheldon Jackson Mission School in
  Sitka, originally settled by the Russians and sometime capital
  (until replaced by Juneau in 1900). The Chairman of that Board
  told each one about the other and warned them both not to fall in
  love, but if they did and got married he would provide them with
  a house for as long as they stayed in Sitka! They did and he did,
  so after mother's death in 1990 (Dad had died in 1944) we found
  in her papers a clipping from the Sitka paper with a photograph
  of the "Honeymoon Cottage".</p>

  <p>During a cruise in 1996 I spent a day in
  Sitka. The Mission School is now Sheldon-Jackson University. I visited the
     library, discovered a complete file of student newspapers, and
     found several articles about my parents! Moreover, the present
     Librarian was then living in the "Honeymoon Cottage" and gave
     me a tour so I was actually able to look out through its front
     windows and see the magnificent view of Sitka Bay that my
     parents used to rave about.</p>

  <p>The newlyweds were very happy in Alaska and
  no doubt would have remained there indefinitely had it not
  emerged that mother would be unable to bear children except by
  Caesarian Section, a procedure not then available in Sitka.
  Determined to have a family she persuaded Dad to move back to the
  States where he became manager of the Metacloth Company, a small
  enterprise in Lodi, N.J. whose main product was cotton duck
  treated by immersion in a concentrated ammoniacal solution of
  copper hydroxide followed by a wash in acid. The deep blue
  "cuprammonium" solution dissolved some of the cellulose which
  reprecipitated during passage through the succeeding acid bath,
  filling the pores of the cloth enough to make it "water
  resistant" but not "water-proof". Residual copper provided a
  characteristic blue-green color along with a high resistance to
  attack by micro-organisms and white ants. For these reasons,
  "Metacloth" was in fairly steady demand for tents and tarpaulins
  in tropical latitudes. My abrupt introduction to "chemistry"
  occurred on one of the treasured Saturdays when Dad took me to
  the plant. Nosing around outside I lifted a small flap on the
  cover of a large tank half full of cuprammonium solution. I still
  recoil at the memory of that ammoniacal, and demoniacal, assault
  on my eyes and nose. It was a startling revelation on how and why
  a whiff of smelling salts can often revive people from a dead
  faint!</p>

  <p>Our home was in Hackensack, N.J., next door
  to Lodi and County Seat of Bergen County. I was born in New York
  City in 1917 and three plus years later my brother Norman arrived
  in Paterson, N.J. where two of mother's brothers were surgeons.
  The Metacloth company was sold in 1926 and Dad was
  unceremoniously dumped by the new owners. He was not a vindictive
  man but he got no little satisfaction out of the several
  occasions in the next two years when his help was needed in
  overcoming mistakes made by the new management. Meanwhile,
  approaching fifty and finding equivalent jobs scarce, he was
  paying the bills by working as a draftsman at the Fokker Aircraft
  Company in Teterboro, N.J. The value of having a trade as back-up
  for a profession was an enduring object lesson for a youngster on
  the eve of the Great Depression but there was for him a far more
  exciting consequence of the Fokker connection. When Lindbergh's
  "Spirit of St. Louis" was shipped back from Paris after its
  famous flight across the Atlantic, it was parked for a time in a
  hangar at the Teterboro airport. The thrill of a lifetime for a
  ten year old boy was when his Dad took him into that hangar where
  he was allowed to sit in the cockpit and move the controls,
  pretending to be pilot of that famous plane!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the family fortunes were going
  down hill, much further than my brother and I were aware. Just
  before Dad lost his job, he and mother had invested their life
  savings in a new (for us) house that everyone insisted was worth
  "every nickel" of the $15,000 that it cost! Unfortunately, after
  we had to move and before the house could be sold the great
  depression had begun. No prospective buyers had enough nickels so
  those savings disappeared in the meltdown of foreclosure.
  Meanwhile, a door of opportunity had opened in Berea, Kentucky, a
  small community of 3500 or so inhabitants at the edge of
  bluegrass country some 40 miles south of Lexington and roughly
  halfway between Cincinnati, Ohio and Knoxville, Tennessee. The
  town of Berea was home for a remarkable institution known by the
  same name but officially entitled "Berea College and Allied
  Schools". Both the community and the school had their roots in a
  non-sectarian Union Church founded in 1848 by John G. Fee, on a
  ridge of land donated by Cassius Clay, a brother of Henry Clay,
  the famous orator and statesman from Lexington, Ky.</p>

  <p>Fee was a Congregational Minister from
  Massachusetts and a fervent abolitionist determined to provide
  educational opportunities for needy students, regardless of their
  race or creed. After decades of effort by himself and his
  followers his dream grew into what in 1928 comprised a
  coeducational student body of about 1700 divided among four
  schools: (1) The <i>Foundation-Junior-High School</i> with an
  ungraded program into which students with as little as two years
  of formal schooling could enroll and progress at their own rate
  up through the equivalent of 8th grade into a standard and
  accredited 9th grade curriculum; (2) The <i>Academy</i>, with an
  accredited curriculum for grades 10 through 12, (3) the <i>Normal
  School</i> with a two year program leading to a Teaching
  Certificate, and (4) the <i>College</i> which offered accredited
  curricula leading to BA degrees in the liberal arts and sciences
  as well as BS degrees in Home Economics and Agriculture. Mother's
  sister was teaching in the College and knew that the Industrial
  Arts Department of the Foundation School and the Academy needed
  someone to teach Auto Mechanics and Practical Electricity. Dad
  was eminently qualified and got the job. We moved to Kentucky in
  time for me to enter the eighth grade in the "Training School" of
  Berea's Normal School in the fall of 1928. The next fall I
  entered ninth grade in the Foundation School and continued on
  through the Academy and College.</p>

  <p>A lot of misgivings, pain and confusion
  attended our passage through the newly opened door, including an
  automobile accident on the way to Kentucky, but life on the other
  side turned out to be rich and rewarding beyond what any of us
  had dreamed. In later years Dad and Mother both said, time and
  again, that losing his "good" job in New Jersey turned out to be
  the greatest blessing that we could have received! To this day my
  brother and I share those sentiments and count ourselves
  especially privileged to have been reared in what was a truly
  remarkable community. Its soul was its President, William J.
  Hutchins, father of Robert Maynard Hutchins, the "boy wonder" of
  the American education scene who became Secretary of Yale at the
  age of 24, Dean of its Law School at 26 and President of the
  University of
  Chicago at 30! "William J", as the father was fondly known at
  his own institution, was truly one of nature's noblemen. A
  striking man of vision and patrician to the core, his Berea was a
  singular stage on which the play was always provocative and the
  message meaningful. Name an outstanding man or woman of letters,
  the arts, science, or religion, of those days and the odds are
  high that he or she came to Berea to talk at one of the thrice
  weekly "United Chapels" for students from all schools. Attendance
  was required of all, and resented by most, but at my 50th class
  reunion there was a remarkable consensus among my surviving
  classmates that the community experiences of those United Chapel
  services were by far the most memorable and valuable components
  of their educational. Alas, that tradition has long since
  disappeared, one more victim of "students' rights" and
  television. Moreover, as the public education system improved in
  surrounding "Appalachia", the need for Berea's Foundation School,
  Academy and Normal School faded over the years, so that the only
  survivor is a now a substantially larger Berea College.</p>

  <p>A unique feature of Berea was and is a
  student labor program that provided much of the manpower required
  to run the institution. Under the supervision of permanent staff,
  the dining halls, dormitories, offices, and yard work were all
  maintained and operated by student labor. In addition were
  several "Industries" including a bakery, broom factory, dairy,
  large truck garden, sheep farm, piggery, a "woodwork department"
  that made fine furniture, and a weaving establishment. The normal
  work load was two hours a day by which a student could earn as
  much as half or two thirds of his or her out of pocket expenses
  that in the 1930's averaged only $250 to $300 per year because
  tuition was free! The system was very democratic because every
  student was required to work at least two hours a day. A fair
  fraction of the student body comprised so-called half-day
  students who worked four hours a day, earning enough to pay all
  expenses. I knew students who arrived at Berea with nothing but
  the clothes on their backs, having dropped out of school after
  the second grade, and worked their way through college! It is not
  surprising that competition to enter Berea, especially the
  college, was extremely keen. In order to avoid having to reject
  such a large fraction of applicants, the Trustees had established
  a policy requiring that 85 per cent of the student body come from
  a region of Appalachia comprising some 500 or so counties in
  Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina.
  The remaining 15 percent of the students came from the rest of
  the world. Today's Berea is quite a different place because the
  growth of alternative educational opportunities in Berea's
  "Territory", has decreased demand to the point that in 1987, at
  my 50th reunion, I learned there were only two applicants for
  every opening in the College compared to 20 or 30 in my day. Part
  of that decrease in demand is due to a higher level of average
  income in that "territory" so that fewer students can show that
  they cannot afford to go elsewhere, a requisite for
  admission.</p>

  <p>When I graduated from the Academy in 1932 I
  was only 15, too young, my parents thought, to go to college, so
  I stayed in the Academy an extra year taking courses in
  mechanical drawing and shorthand. I also continued the piano
  lessons that I had started the year before and spent enough time
  practicing so that I actually gave a recital during my last year
  in college! Alas, whatever piano skills I had have faded until
  now I do well to play chopsticks with my grandchildren! When I
  entered College with the class of '38 I had not decided on a
  major but I leaned toward a science, probably because of my long
  affair with the Book of Knowledge, an encyclopedia for young
  people which my parents bought when I was around eight or nine.
  During the hours that I pored over them, its 20 volumes became a
  well worn magic carpet to new and fascinating worlds. I've often
  quipped that "I got through college on the Book of Knowledge", a
  bit of rhyming hyperbole that contains an appreciable kernel of
  truth.</p>

  <p>The College required at least one course in
  science for all students no matter what their major. Having
  enjoyed my chemistry course in the Academy I enrolled in
  Introductory Chemistry during my freshman year. It was taught by
  Professor Julian Capps, the senior of the two member chemistry
  faculty. He was a wonderful teacher who made his subject live. I
  was so seduced that Chemistry became my major even though
  Gravimetric Analysis gave me fits in my sophomore year. I
  repeated the lengthy phosphorous determination on three samples
  each of ten unknowns before I got one set of three results with
  acceptable agreement! It seems ironic that mass spectrometry, the
  center of my scientific life for the last 20 years, is really
  just an exercise in gravimetric analysis!</p>

  <p>During that sophomore year an experiment in
  another kind of chemistry turned out to have a big effect on my
  chemical education. I fell in love with a girl in the junior
  class. Determined to catch up with her and graduate when she did,
  I went to summer school in 1936 at the University of Iowa
  because it had a 10 week session that allowed me to earn 12
  semester hours of credit in Organic Chemistry under "Uncle
  Charlie" Raiford, and Inorganic Chemistry under Professors Jacob
  Cornog and Perry Bond. All in all it was a very hot and grueling
  summer. The romance that had blossomed in the spring and sent me
  off to summer school, withered the following fall. However,
  because I would be within two courses of finishing my degree
  requirements by end of that year, my third in college, I managed
  to get classified as a Senior and became a provisional member of
  Class of '37 at the June commencement, the objective inspired by
  a young man's fancy of the previous spring. My courses in
  chemistry thus far had required only some facility in simple
  algebra. Straight A's in all Prof. Peck's courses in the Academy
  (plane geometry, advanced algebra, solid geometry and
  trigonometry) had excused me from freshman math in college, all
  that was then required for a major in chemistry.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for my future our next door
  neighbor, George Bent, was visited by his brother Henry, then an
  assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard. When Henry
  discovered that I was contemplating graduate work in chemistry,
  having had no college math, he was aghast and spent a couple of
  hours impressing me with the importance of mathematics in
  chemistry. As a result I spent much of my third and last year of
  college immersed in that subject. Fortune had tossed me another
  favor in the form of Berea's new curriculum based on four 9 week
  quarters instead of two 18 week semesters. So-called "intensive"
  courses met 6 hours a week for nine weeks while "running" courses
  met 3 hours a week for eighteen. Thus, a standard full load of l5
  class hours per week comprised two intensive courses and one
  running course, an arrangement which I heartily endorse. One
  major advantage is that a student takes only three courses at any
  one time instead of five. It is much less distracting to be
  studying three subjects at a time rather than five. The
  particular advantage for me was that the calendar time for a
  three credit-hour course was cut in half so that both Course B,
  and its prerequisie Course A, could be completed in two nine week
  quarters instead of two eighteen week semesters. Thus, in my
  senior year I was able to take Analytic Geometry, Differential
  Calculus, Integral Calculus, and Complex variable, all in that
  same year! It was pretty heavy going, but it enabled me to
  survive in graduate school where I took one more undergraduate
  course in Advanced Calculus. The record seems to say that I have
  also survived after graduate school but a lack of mathematical
  skills has been a great handicap throughout my life.</p>

  <p>Though I had taken part in the June
  Commencement exercises at Berea in 1937, I still had course
  requirements to complete before I could get my degree. I
  fulfilled those requirements at Purdue University that summer by taking
  Physical Chemistry with lectures by Roy Newton and laboratory
  under Hershel Hunt, along with a course in Chemical Microscopy
  under Ed F. Degering.</p>

  <p>During that hectic last year in college I
  had applied to several universities for graduate study in
  chemistry. Yale and Northwestern responded with offers of
  teaching assistantships that would meet most of my expenses. I
  first leaned toward Northwestern but, for reasons I won't take
  space to enlarge on, I finally decided on Yale. That decision
  delayed by half a century my meeting Malcolm Dole who in 1937 was
  a young assistant professor of chemistry at Northwestern. It was
  the experiments he reported much later (in 1968) that changed the
  course of my scientific life.</p>

  <p>At Yale I found myself in a new and
  different world. I had done time in two much larger universities
  and one much smaller college but I was completely unprepared for,
  and awed by, the splendor of Yale's campus. Its architectural
  theme has been disdainfully dubbed "Fifth Avenue Gothic" by the
  self-styled experts who sneer at such expensive imitation of the
  old world. But a wide eyed small town youth from Kentucky found
  it all fascinating and loved to wander around and through the
  gardens, gargoyles and gates that were scattered throughout the
  campus. To me it was rewarding recreation to discover and explore
  the little nooks and courtyards where one could sit in the shade
  of a tree completely oblivious to the cacaphony of a busy city,
  only a few yards away but completely shut out by the thickest
  walls and heaviest masonry I had ever seen. Sterling Library,
  then said to be the largest in the world with open stacks, became
  a favorite haunt where I spent many winter weekend afternoons
  with a good book and an apple or a candy bar. My room in the Hall
  of Graduate Studies looked out on a forest of chimneys, slate
  roofs, and Gothic towers that resembled a Hollywood version of
  medieval London. I ate in an elegant dining hall, complete with
  menus and waiters - twenty one meals per week for a now
  incredible eight dollars! Even so, to save money I took advantage
  of an option in the board contract and "signed out" every week
  for dinner on Friday night along with breakfast and lunch on
  Saturday. This "fasting" saved me $1.15 every week and probably
  was good for my figure! My assistantship paid a total of $850 for
  nine months, of which $350 went for tuition and fees. By such
  frugalities as the weekly "fast" I could make the remaining $500
  cover most of my other expenses. My parents were horrified when
  they later learned of my miserly existence at Yale but I was
  determined to get along without their support.</p>

  <p>On the appointed day in September the six
  new graduate students in physical chemistry met in Sterling
  Chemistry Laboratory with Professor Herbert Harned, the ranking
  faculty member in that subject whose colleagues included <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1968/index.html">Lars Onsager</a>, Benton
  B. Owen, Rodney Smith, George Murphy, John Vance, and Gosta "Gus"
  Akerlof. With little or no ceremony, no introductions and no
  opportunity to ask questions or indicate preferences, we were
  assigned to advisors. I recall "Herbie" as he was known but not
  addressed, saying to me: "Fenn, you might as well go with Gus."
  Thus, began what blossomed into a close friendship that lasted
  until the day Gus died, many years later, in Princeton.</p>

  <p>The Yale curriculum for chemistry graduate
  students in those days was pretty cut and dried. During the first
  year we took four courses, spent 12 to 14 hours per week as
  assistants in undergraduate labs and the rest of the time getting
  our feet wet in the laboratory on what would become our
  dissertation research. At the end of that first year the faculty,
  on the basis of course grades and day to day observations,
  decided whether or not each student was Ph.D. material. Those for
  whom thumbs were down were given a Master's degree and dismissed.
  The others continued, almost always receiving a Ph.D. after two
  more years. The second year was much like the first except that
  we took only a couple of courses and spent much more time on our
  research projects. At the beginning of the third year we had to
  take a two day written comprehensive exam. While I was a student,
  all who took that exam passed it so I don't know what the
  consequences of failing would have been. One very big difference
  in the third year was that we could no longer be teaching
  assistants but were expected to spend full time on research.
  Thus, unless we were lucky enough to win one of the two
  fellowships available to third year students, we were on our own
  financially. My solution to this problem was to get married, not
  to my sophomore flame but to Margaret Wilson, who became
  supervisor of my student labor at Berea while I was working in
  the Registrar's Office. She was a beautiful woman by whom I (then
  in the tenth grade!) was smitten the first day she started work
  as Assistant Registrar. Always ten years older than I she seemed
  to be so far beyond my reach that I never dreamed she could ever
  be more than the close friend and confidante that she became. I
  had escorted her to several events while I was in college and
  when I was home after I graduated. Romance bloomed while I was at
  Yale and she finally agreed to become my bride at end of my
  second year. She also became my "fellowship" during that third
  year at Yale, supporting us both on the 50 cents per hour she
  earned at various odd jobs. To this day I marvel that the
  daughter of a very conservative minister had the courage to
  ignore the disapproval of her parents and the inevitable
  elevation of eyebrows by everybody, everywhere, at our flagrant
  departure from the social norm. One of my closest friends told us
  decades later that he had been sure our marriage would not last
  more than a year or so. In fact it was not until 1992 that I lost
  my bride of 53 years in a New Zealand car crash. She was then 85
  but looked and acted ten years younger than the husband she had
  "snatched from the cradle."</p>

  <p>The plain truth is that in matters of
  matrimony this society's norms are genetically out of joint.
  Women on average live about ten years longer than men and yet
  become the wives of husbands who are several years older. That is
  why widows greatly outnumber widowers. Some say that this
  imbalance in life expectancy will be redressed as women
  increasingly become exposed to the stresses of employment in the
  workplace. I am much more inclined to believe the geneticist who
  told me that the female of the species lived longer than the male
  because she is fundamentally tougher and more resistant to the
  ravages of age. In choosing a mate men should follow the advice
  of Ben Franklin in his letter of advice to a young man on
  choosing a mistress. His message? "be sure she is older than you
  are!"</p>

  <p>Only in choosing a graduate school did I
  exert any influence on the research I would do for my thesis.
  That influence was unwitting because I knew nothing of the
  faculty research interests at either Yale or Northwestern. Indeed
  I had only the vaguest idea of what graduate study and research
  were all about. Thus, I felt neither joy nor apprehension when I
  was summarily assigned to Gus Akerlof's group. Most of the
  research by Harned and his colleagues was on the properties of
  electrolyte solutions, the more dilute the better. So narrow was
  this focus that when I left Yale I halfway believed the old
  cliche that "Physical Chemistry was the study of slightly
  contaminated water." Gus was a bit of a maverick because he had
  an interest in concentrated solutions. In essence what I had to
  do was measure the potential difference between electrodes of
  silver-silver chloride and platinum-hydrogen in solutions of HCl
  with molalities from 0.01 to 10.0 in solvents comprising methanol
  in water at concentration intervals of 10 per cent from zero to
  ninety, at temperatures every ten degrees from zero to 50
  Celsius. As I remember the total number of acceptable emf
  measurements was around 3000, taking into account that each
  measurement was made in duplicate. Thus, my routine every
  afternoon for most of two years was to prepare three pairs of
  cells with both cells of each pair containing the same solution.
  The cells were suspended in a large water bath or "thermostat"
  and allowed to equilibrate over night (i.e. with hydrogen
  bubbling over the Pt electrodes.) If by the next morning the emfs
  in each pair of cells agreed to within some forgotten small
  fraction of a millivolt, then I would haul some 80 pounds or so
  of ice from the basement to lower the bath temperature to near
  273 K. The rest of the day would be spent recording emf values
  for all six cells at every ten K as the thermostat was heated to
  313 or 323 K depending on the vapor pressure (i.e. the methanol
  content) of the cell solvent. All the results were fitted by
  least squares to a quadratic curve for the dependence of emf on
  concentration. The least square calculations were all carried out
  on a hand-cranked Monroe Calculator, except when I was lucky
  enough to grab the one electrically driven machine in the
  calculating room. Clearly, I was less than inspired by this
  introduction to "original research". The experiments were a
  boring chore with few redeeming features. The results contained
  no surprises and nothing of much interest to anyone, least of all
  me. It was some years later before any of them found their way
  into the literature and then only as part of a table in a review
  article that Gus had been asked to write. My dissertation
  attested to the sterility of that project, consisting as it did
  of 45 pages of tables with only three pages of text! Although
  this first experience in "original research" shattered some
  illusions, my three years at Yale were a rewarding experience. I
  made many long lasting friendships with both fellow students and
  faculty. The Physical Chemists were a very congenial group and
  Herbie Harned was really a very interesting man, except in the
  class room. He came by almost every lab almost every day to chat
  with us students about almost everything. Sometimes his visits
  were inconveniently long and would interfere with experiments.
  One of the older graduate students had told me that Herbie would
  run for cover if he were asked to help, for example by holding a
  light or a tool during some adjustment. That ploy worked like a
  charm and saved me many hours. Actually, the Harneds were very
  kind and warm hearted people. They held an open house every
  Friday night which both students and faculty felt obliged to
  attend more or less regularly. More often than not we ended up
  around the piano in a group sing-along with Roger Bates, then a
  Sterling Fellow and accomplished musician, at the keyboard.</p>

  <p>I also learned a lot about life and lore
  outside of chemistry, e.g. to play bridge, to drink beer and to
  smoke a pipe during the mostly dull seminars every Tuesday night.
  I had many interactions with many interesting people. The weekly
  university calendar was filled with provocative events ranging
  from seminars to sermons and concerts to contests. My
  perspectives were stretched by memorable if abstruse encounters
  with great minds, including lectures on resonance by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">Linus Pauling</a>, and two
  required courses in statistical mechanics under Lars Onsager
  (known to the students as Norwegian I and II!). Gus and his wife
  Rosalie, who was the sister of Joe Hirschfelder, looked after his
  students with great care and affection, making their house our
  home away from home. Rosalie took my new bride under her wing,
  showering us newlyweds with almost too much attention. I was
  extremely fond of Gus and most grateful for his always calm
  demeanor and seeming imperturbability. He strongly disapproved of
  marriage for graduate students but when I told him I wanted to
  take a wife he protested not at all and simply said "OK, we take
  it from here." He and "Magee" as my wife was later known, became
  extremely fond of each other and he later told me many times that
  marrying her was the smartest thing I ever did, an opinion shared
  by everyone who has known us both. All in all, my time at Yale
  was happy and rewarding but I left with a much diminished
  interest in "scholarly research", and no desire to return. I
  often think about how surprised and pleased Gus would have been
  to know that six decades later his son <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/index.html">George Akerlof</a> would
  share the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics and his student John Fenn
  would share the 2002 Prize in Chemistry!</p>

  <p>My immediate and exciting prospect after
  graduation from Yale was a job in the research department of the
  Phosphate Division of Monsanto Chemical Company in Anniston,
  Alabama. The starting salary was $2700 per year, then the going
  rate for new PhD's in industry and a mind-boggling jump from the
  $1000 or so a year Magee and I had been living on. I couldn't
  understand why my mother laughed when I once remarked that I
  didn't know how we could spend so much money!</p>

  <p>Anniston, the county seat of Calhoun county
  and "Cast Iron Pipe Capital of the World", was located halfway
  between Atlanta and Birmingham. Living there was my introduction
  to the deep south where cotton still grew and the Confederate
  Flag still flew. It was the home of Fort McClellan, a long time
  army base that was already gearing up for America's forthcoming
  participation in World War II. Two of my mother's brothers had
  been medical officers at McClellan during World War I and two of
  our closest friends from New Haven passed through there after
  being drafted in the wake of Pearl Harbor. We had the chance to
  compensate them a wee bit with an occasional home-cooked meal. I
  was more fortunate because the army was not yet drafting
  husbands.</p>

  <p>Monsanto had recently acquired the Anniston
  Plant when it bought Swann Chemical Company started by a
  legendary character named Theodore Swann. He had pioneered the
  production of phosphoric acid from elemental phosphorous shipped
  in by tank car from a plant in Columbia, Tennessee where it was
  produced by smelting "phos rock" in an electric furnace. At
  Anniston the phosphorous was burned in air to produce its
  pentoxide which could be hydrated to form acid of any desired
  concentration. Major customers for the acid per se included the
  soft drink industry, especially the Coca Cola Company in nearby
  Atlanta. According to local folk lore, the first tank car of food
  grade acid to be delivered was filtered through laboratory
  Buechner funnels because the filtration plant was not ready in
  time to meet the deadline on the sales contract! Much of the
  phosphoric acid left the plant in the form of sodium and
  potassium phosphates that among other applications were widely
  used as soap builders, water conditioners and in food products
  such as baking powders.</p>

  <p>The other main product line, which some
  said was the main reason Monsanto bought Swann, comprised
  biphenyl and its chlorinated derivatives known as Arochlors, the
  now notorious PCBs. Biphenyl was produced by bubbling benzene
  vapor through large baths of molten lead at a temperature of
  around 800&deg;C, as I remember. Liquid metal as a heating agent
  provided a rapid rise and close control of the temperature, thus
  minimizing formation of byproducts which mostly comprised ortho,
  meta and para diphenyl benzenes. The various Arochlors were
  characterized by their chlorine content which ranged from 10 per
  cent to 60 per cent by weight. One of their main uses was as
  transformer oils because they had very good heat transfer
  characteristics, would not burn and were very inert. Indeed, they
  were so inert and sticky that the chemists insisted that if
  Arochlors ever got into a laboratory some of it would remain
  forever! Because it was so inert we practically bathed in the
  stuff, never dreaming that it might be toxic. General Electric
  dumped PCB wastes into the Hudson River for many years and is now
  resisting Federal orders to dredge it all up. Recently, the press
  has reported growing anger in Anniston and threats of legal
  action as new surveys have shown the extent to which PCBs from
  the plant where I worked have contaminated the soil and waters
  around the town. My own substantial exposure seems to have had no
  ill effects, but I daresay that even today, sixty years later,
  the PCB content of my fatty tissue would horrify the EPA! There
  is no doubt that PCBs in the environment accumulate in the fatty
  tissues of mammals and fish. The evidence of resulting toxicity
  is less convincing. I remember a paper by an Australian chemist
  claiming that the only documented evidence of significant
  toxicity stemmed from two cases in which PCB's, used as the heat
  transfer medium in the heating coils of deep fat fryers, leaked
  into the fat. The resulting reaction produced highly toxic
  benzo-compounds whose identity I have forgotten. I do know that
  sixty years ago I practically bathed in the stuff while operating
  a pilot plant in which PCB was produced in the vapor phase by
  reaction of biphenyl with HCl and air over a copper catalyst in a
  variation of the old Deacon process for producing chlorine by the
  oxidation of HCl. Occasionally I would get a slight skin rash, as
  did the other operators, but I have detected no lasting
  effects.</p>

  <p>After I had been at Anniston for a year,
  James W. Mullen II., a young Ph.D. organic chemist from Princeton came
  aboard. He and I became good friends, sharing a growing
  dissatisfaction with the way things were being run at work. Jim
  insisted that someday he was going to start a research company
  and that when he did he wanted me to join him. Talking about what
  we might do was fun but it all seemed like pipe dreaming to me.
  Having become increasingly disenchanted with the work situation
  we both resigned and left Anniston on the same day in 1943. Jim
  went to Bell Labs in New Jersey. I took my family, which now
  included an 18 month old daughter, Marianne, to Wyandotte,
  Michigan where I had obtained a job in the research department of
  Sharples Chemicals, a relatively small producer of alcohols,
  amines, esters and other derivatives of amyl chloride produced by
  the chlorination of pentane. One day in June of 1945 a letter
  came from Jim saying that he had finally started his company and
  wanted me to join him. I took a train down to Richmond to find
  out more. At Bell Labs he had become involved in Project
  Bumblebee, a large scale effort by the Navy to develop a
  ramjet-powered anti-aircraft missile for the fleet. The ramjet
  depends upon ram pressure from high speed flight to compress air
  enough so that its expansion after heating by combustion could
  provide useful thrust. It was clear that supersonic flight
  velocities would be required to achieve substantial thrust but
  because there was little or no information on drag at such
  velocities, nobody knew whether that thrust could equal or exceed
  the drag. The Project name, Bumblebee, derived from a bit of
  aeronautical badinage to the effect that by all the laws of
  modern aerodynamics it is impossible for a bumblebee to fly, but
  the bumblebee doesn't know any aerodynamics so it goes ahead and
  flies anyway!</p>

  <p><b>From flames to flying
  elephants</b><br>
  Experiment, Inc., the name Jim Mullen gave his company, prospered
  over the next seven years. To watch and participate in its
  growth, from a total of three employees when I arrived to perhaps
  45 or so when I left in 1952, was an exciting experience. Most of
  its business was based on R&amp;D contracts with government
  agencies for which the central theme was combustion and
  propulsion but we did pursue some commercial ventures. There were
  some important personal dividends from my investment of time at
  Experiment. One was that I learned a little bit about the
  dynamics and thermodynamics of compressible flow, a newly popular
  area of research spawned by the advent of jet propulsion and
  sometimes referred to as "Aerothermodynamics", or
  "Aerothermochemistry" if changes in chemical composition were
  involved. Another personal dividend was the opportunity to do
  some research in combustion, both applied and fundamental. Jim
  was a strong believer in publishing our results. Thus the first
  research publication of my life was a paper on ignition in high
  speed flow, co-authored by Jim and a junior colleague, M.R. Irby.
  That paper appeared in 1949, almost a decade after I left
  graduate school<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Consequent to
  several more papers, visits to other labs, and attendance at
  various meetings, I began to get some recognition in the
  Combustion Community. Moreover, in an about-face from my feelings
  at Yale, I found I enjoyed doing research and communicating with
  others about my findings and theirs.</p>

  <p>My life in Berea had made me think that I
  would someday like to become a college professor. But I had also
  thought that I should get some of the realworld industrial
  experience that had seemed to help make Julian Capps, my
  chemistry professor at Berea, such an effective teacher. That
  desire to join a college faculty had faded somewhat at Yale but
  was revived a bit during my experience at Experiment, Inc. We
  obtained a number of provocative results on some properties of
  flames, in particular on stabilizing them in high velocity flows.
  Both Jim and the sponsors of our studies were happy to have us
  attend technical meetings and to publish results of our studies,
  (so long as they didn't involve classified information.)
  Consequently, I got to know, and become known by, a number of
  people in the combustion community. One result of this new and
  limited "notoriety" was an offer from Princeton University to
  serve as Director of Project SQUID, a program of pure and applied
  research in "those fields of science relating to jet propulsion"
  including combustion, fluid flow and heat transfer. Financed by
  the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and administered by Princeton,
  Project SQUID was named after the jet-propelled decapod of the
  sea. (That name had additional but unpremeditated relevance in
  that both the animal and its namesake secreted ink, the former in
  clouds that confused predators, the latter in print in reports
  that confused readers!) SQUID's organizational structure
  comprised a prime contract between ONR and Princeton, with
  subcontracts at any one time between Princeton and from 12 to 20
  or so university and industrial laboratories. The overall purpose
  was to cultivate interest and activity by students, faculty and
  other investigators in combustion, fluid flow and heat
  transfer.</p>

  <p>One reason for my interest in Princeton was
  that by then I had learned that research could be a lot more fun
  than it had been when I was a student at Yale. Another reason was
  that my Yale mentor, Gus Akerlof, had set up a laboratory in its
  newly established James Forrestal Center to develop, with Navy
  (but not SQUID) support, an electrical discharge process for the
  production of hydrazine, an attractive rocket propellant. Gus had
  once visited me in Richmond and in fact had put my name in the
  pot at Princeton when he learned that the previous director of
  SQUID was leaving. One of the "other reasons" for my interest was
  that Jim Mullen and many of his friends, were Princeton
  graduates. After seven years among those fiercely loyal alumni I
  had been brainwashed to the point of believing that maybe Old
  Nassau really was the "best old place of all." Moreover, as I
  have already noted, my life in Berea had long made me think that
  I would enjoy becoming a teacher and living in a college
  community.</p>

  <p>At Princeton I would report directly to Sir
  Hugh Taylor, long-time Chairman of Princeton's Chemistry
  Department, then Dean of the Graduate School and Chairman of the
  University Research Board. The position was "with rank of
  Professor" and the Dean assured me that I would be welcomed as an
  active member of the academic community. And so, after much soul
  searching, Magee and I decided to leave the "Cradle of the
  Confederacy" for what was and is often called "the northernmost
  southern town in the country". That epithet stemmed from the
  substantial numbers of Princeton students that over the years
  have come from below the Mason Dixon line. Before the Civil War
  it had become customary for students from the south to celebrate
  graduation by freeing their personal servants. An interesting
  result is that Princeton has a much larger black population than
  do other towns of comparable size in that part of the
  country.</p>

  <p>My new job turned out to be very
  interesting and highly educational. I had to travel a lot but was
  able to visit many laboratories and meet well known scientists in
  many fields all over the country. I got to know the people in ONR
  pretty well and my circle of acquaintances included people in ARO
  (Army Research Office) and AFOSR (Air Force Office of Scientific
  Research) both of which were providing some support for Project
  SQUID and were represented on its Steering Committee. ONR had a
  branch in London (ONRL) that maintained a rotating corps of 12 to
  15 Scientific Liaison Officers whose job was to promote
  interaction between scientists and engineers in Europe and
  America by visiting laboratories and attending scientific
  meetings. They would get to know the investigators, learn about
  what they were doing, help them establish contacts with their
  counterparts in America, arrange visits, find items of equipment,
  assist with travel arrangements, and the like. Research
  laboratories in Europe were beginning to recover from the trauma
  of World War II and they welcomed the communication links and the
  help with their needs that ONRL could provide. The SQUID office
  had occasionally been involved in making travel and visiting
  arrangements for some of the European scientists who came to
  America under ONRL's auspices. After I had been at Princeton for
  about three years I was invited to serve a year as an ONRL
  Liaison Officer in the areas of combustion and propulsion. My
  bosses in ONR Washington approved and I persuaded John Scott, who
  had just finished his Ph.D. in Aeronautical Engineering at
  Princeton, to mind the store at SQUID while I was gone. Thus,
  Magee and I and the children, then 9, 11 and 13, went to London
  for the calendar year of 1955. And what a wonderful year it was!
  The children still insist that living London was the high point
  in the Fenn family fortunes which have been going down hill ever
  since! I share some of those sentiments because that year was
  also a marvelous experience for the parents. The kids were in
  school so Magee was free to roam London during the day. I visited
  many laboratories in many countries, made many friends, and
  learned "more things than had been dreamt of in my
  philosophy."</p>

  <p>Among these "things" was my stumbling on to
  something that was to set the stage for the rest of my scientific
  life. Up to that time flames and their behaviour were the focal
  point of almost all efforts to elucidate the kinetics and
  mechanisms of the important reactions in high temperature
  combustion. The general approach was mostly based on attempts to
  measure and interpret flame characteristics such as propagation
  velocity, flammability limits, ignition temperatures and the
  like. I had become convinced that flames, with their extremely
  high gradients of temperature and composition, were much too
  complex to be useful as stages for the study of those reactions.
  I often recalled a comment by Philip Rudnick, professor of
  Physics at Vanderbilt, who was active in the propulsion Panel of
  Project Bumblebee. He said that the more he learned about flames
  the more he was convinced that they were organisms whose study
  properly belonged in the province of biology! I'm sure that view
  strikes a responsive note in many investigators who have been
  exasperated by the vagaries of flame behaviour that seem to give
  them a life of their own. Indeed, the analogy can be extended.
  Flames, like organisms, are born, need fuel and oxidant for
  nourishment, grow and multiply to the extent that those
  necessities are accessible, and are poisoned unto death when
  immersed in their own waste products! Not only is their structure
  and behavior complex but the conversion of reactants to products
  involves sequences of so many reactions over such short distances
  that to determine how the composition and temperature changed
  with distance (i.e. time) in real flames, i.e. the relation
  between their "fine structure" and their behaviour, was not
  experimentally feasible with the tools and techniques then
  available.</p>

  <p>Thus, for some time I had been somewhat
  naively musing about whether and how it might be possible to
  study chemical reactions by the same approach that physicists so
  successfully use in the study of nuclear reactions. They build
  accelerators to produce beams of atomic nuclei with energies of
  megavolts to gigavolts with which they bombard stationary targets
  comprising collision partners of interest. They then characterize
  the products from reactive collisions by analyzing the
  post-collision trajectories of the product particles as measured
  by appropriate detectors, e.g. bubble or cloud chambers. I had
  been introduced to the possible uses of molecular beam scattering
  experiments in chemistry by Professor I. (Izzy) Amdur, a
  colleague of the Professor Frederick Keyes at MIT whose elegant
  measurements on the transport properties of gases were being
  supported by Project SQUID. Amdur was using beam scattering
  experiments to characterize the intermolecular potentials of
  molecules. His approach was based on electrostatic acceleration
  of ions to relatively high energies and then neutralizing them by
  charge-exchange collisions with neutral molecules for which the
  cross-sections are much larger than those for momentum exchange.
  In this way he could produce beams of neutral molecules with
  translational energies equal to those of the incident ions.
  Space-charge effects give rise to the Childs-<a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1932/index.html">Langmuir</a> law by which
  the maximum intensity (current density) of an ion beam is
  proportional to the square root of its energy. Consequently,
  neutral beams with intensities high enough to provide good
  signal/noise in a scattering experiment, must perforce have
  energies substantially higher than the intermolecular potentials
  that Amdur was trying to probe. His solution to this problem was
  to locate his detector so that it would "see" only the
  post-collision beam molecules whose trajectories differed by only
  a very small amount from their pre-collision values. This
  "small-angle scattering" approach allowed him to exploit the high
  intensities obtainable with beams of high energy molecules (in
  laboratory coordinates) in the study of molecule-molecule
  interactions at low energies in center-of-mass coordinates of the
  colliding partners. Unfortunately, that approach did not seem to
  lend itself to the study of reactive collisions.</p>

  <p>When I went to ONR London in late 1954,
  nobody had successfully carried out reactive scattering
  experiments with molecular beams on any chemical reaction, even
  one with a negligibly small activation energy. Moreover,
  activation energies for many combustion reactions were known to
  be as high as 30 kcal per moltwo or more. The energies of beam
  molecules from conventional effusive sources are always limited
  by the temperature at which the source can be operated. The
  average translational energy of an oxygen molecule from a source
  at 3000 K would be only about 10 kcal/mol or 1.2 eV, (but that
  temperature is well above the melting point of most materials
  from which the source might be made!). Any polyatomic molecules
  of interest in combustion would completely decompose even at much
  lower temperatures. In sum, the collision energies that can be
  reached simply by raising beam source temperatures are severely
  limited. Even so, the possibility of bringing about reactive
  collisions by colliding a beam of reactant molecules with other
  gaseous molecules had been contemplated since the late 1920's. In
  spite of numerous attempts, no really convincing results had been
  obtained when we left for London at the end of 1954. However,
  shortly after we returned to Princeton in early 1956, the age of
  reactive scattering experiments with molecular beams dawned when
  Datz and Taylor reported that intersecting beams of K atoms and
  HBr molecules produced detectable amounts of KBr.<a href=
  "#not2"><sup>2</sup></a> These results gave some substance to my
  musings but there was a fundamental problem with the idea of
  applying the same method to combustion reactions. Activation
  energies for K+HBr are negligibly small. For many of the most
  interesting reactions in combustion the activation energies were
  thought to range from 0.5 to 2.0 or more eV, much much higher
  than for the reaction studied by Datz and Taylor. Amdur's charge
  exchange technique could easily produce beams with much higher
  energies but because of space charge effects could not provide
  useful intensities at energies as low as a few eV. Nor did
  Amdur's ploy of looking only at small angle scattering seem
  applicable in the study reactive scattering. To produce beam
  molecules from classical effusive sources with energies of even
  0.5 eV would require source temperatures of 3000 K. Neither
  materials of construction for the source, nor reactant molecules
  other than atoms, could endure such temperatures. The situation
  thus seemed hopeless.</p>

  <p>One day in London I was calculating rocket
  exhaust velocities achievable with various propellants and
  suddenly realized that many reactant molecules at the velocities
  attainable with some such propellants would have translational
  energies as high as two or more eV. I began to fantasize about
  using micro- rockets in vacuum as molecular beam sources,
  anticipating by 30 years an experiment we actually carried out
  for another purpose! I then remembered that rocket visionaries
  had often touted hydrogen as an ideal propellant fluid for
  nuclear powered rockets because its of its low molecular weight.
  The limiting maximum convective velocity that can be reached by a
  gas expanding into vacuum is equal to
  (Cp/MT<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> where Cp is its constant
  pressure heat capacity, M its molecular weight and T<sub>0</sub>
  its source temperature. Thus the maximum velocity reachable by
  helium is about 3.33 times that for argon. If the helium is
  "seeded" with one or two per cent argon, and if those argon atoms
  are swept along like dust particles in a wind storm, the
  translational kinetic energy of the argon atoms after free jet
  expansion of the mixture would be almost 10 times that of the
  helium atoms, if the two reached the same terminal flow
  velocity.</p>

  <p>A few days later I was browsing in ONRL's
  library and ran across the now famous paper by E.W. Becker and K.
  Bier reporting the production of intense beams of hydrogen
  molecules by expansion of the gas from high pressure through a
  small converging-diverging nozzle into vacuum<a href=
  "#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>. That paper referenced the also now
  famous paper by Kantrowitz and Grey in the Review of Scientific
  Instruments which proposed the use of a converging-diverging
  nozzle to produce a jet of high velocity molecules in a region of
  low pressure.<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a> A small core
  portion of that jet would be admitted through a conical "skimmer"
  into a high vacuum region to form a jet of molecules. The
  "static" temperature of the molecules (as measured by a
  thermometer traveling with the gas and at the same velocity)
  would be very low so that the divergence of the molecular
  trajectories downstream of the skimmer would be very small and
  the velocity distribution in the direction of flow would also be
  very narrow. In sum, the jet would comprise a very intense beam
  of molecules, all traveling at nearly the same velocity! Another
  paper in the same issue of that journal reported a not very
  successful attempt by Kistiakowsky and Schlichter to reduce the
  Kantrowitz-Grey idea to practice.<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>
  Both of those papers also happened to be in the ONRL library and
  when I read them I began to take my musings seriously. (It is
  said that Kistiakowsky and Schlicter were so frustrated by
  troubles in their experiment that when Schlicter had suffered
  enough to deserve a degree, they vented their frustration by
  demolishing the apparatus with an axe!)</p>

  <p>I later learned that twentyfive years
  earlier, T.H. Johnson, a Sterling Fellow at Yale, had produced
  intense beams of mercury atoms by expanding the vapor from a
  "boiler" at several hundred torr into vacuum<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Unfortunately this truly remarkable
  result had been ignored because it was at odds with the dogma
  from Stern's lab in Hamburg that raising the source gas pressure
  (density) would produce a sort of stagnant cloud of molecules at
  the exit of the source orifice. That mythical cloud would scatter
  a large fraction of the emerging molecules that might otherwise
  have contributed to beam intensity. Later in his career at the
  Franklin Institute Johnson he also found diffraction effects in
  the scattering of hydrogen from an LiF crystal, confirming the
  wave nature of particles much heavier than the electrons with
  which Davisson and Germer had earlier found diffraction effects.
  Unfortunately, some eight weeks earlier Estermann, Frisch and
  Stern had found the same result in G&ouml;ttingen<a href=
  "#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> so Johnson's work again went unnoticed
  while <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1943/index.html">Stern</a> got
  the Nobel Prize! An able investigator who was 25 years too early
  with one landmark experiment and 8 weeks too late with another,
  Johnson had every right to feel frustrated by the fickleness of
  fate.</p>

  <p>The results predicted by Kantrowitz and
  Grey in 1951, having been already achieved by Johnson in 1929,
  were confirmed in the above-mentioned paper by Becker and Bier in
  1954. They showed that convective flow of gas through a small
  orifice from high pressure into vacuum could indeed produce
  molecular beams with much higher intensities than could the
  effusive sources introduced and exploited to great advantage by
  Otto Stern and his colleagues. Moreover, these "convective" beams
  had much narrower velocity distributions than did their effusive
  cousins. Consequently, the achievable intensity within a narrow
  velocity interval, a highly desirable feature, could be very much
  higher with convective beams. What had not yet been shown, nor
  apparently considered, was that heavy molecules could be
  accelerated to suprathermal translational energies by expansion
  of a light carrier gas such as hydrogen or helium in which those
  heavy molecules were present a low levels.</p>

  <p>When I returned to Princeton after my year
  in London, I found that John Scott, who had run the SQUID Office
  during my absence, was going to the University of
  Virginia as an assistant professor of Aeronautical
  Engineering. He was wondering what research he ought to work on
  and I told him about my musings on molecular beams from high
  pressure sources. I also told him that if he would submit
  proposal on such work to Project SQUID I would try my best to get
  support for it. When he arrived at Virginia he found a group that
  was already using beam scattering experiments to characterize the
  exchange of energy and momentum between molecules and surfaces.
  Their goal was to understand and predict surface heat transfer
  and drag for aerodynamic bodies at very high altitudes where flow
  was molecular rather than continuum. The high intensities
  achievable with beams from supersonic free jets (or "nozzle
  beams", as they came to be known) would be most useful in such
  surface scattering experiments. Moreover, the high translational
  energies that seemed achievable with the seeded beams I was
  dreaming about, would make possible the study of drag and heat
  transfer in molecular flow under conditions much closer to those
  expected in ultra high altitude flight than those obtainable with
  the effusive beams they had been using. As a result of their
  enthusiasm and mine, the first nozzle beam system in America was
  built in Charlottesville, VA.<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a> I
  should really say, the first in America since the one T.H.
  Johnson built at Yale in 1929 that produced high intensity beams
  of mercury atoms but had been ignored. It now seems clear that
  the reason for Johnson's success was that the walls of his system
  were all water cooled enough to condense most of the incident
  mercury atoms. The net result was an effective pumping speed
  orders of magnitude higher than the nominal speed of his vacuum
  pumps or those of any of the other molecular beam systems then in
  existence. (Fraser in his 1932 book on "Molecular Rays" refers to
  a system then being built with the "exorbitant" pumping speed of
  100 liters per second<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>. The
  nominal speed of each of two 32 inch pumps that we bought "off
  the shelf" 45 years later was 30,000 liters per second!) The real
  reason for the generally observed decrease in beam intensity with
  increasing source gas density was scattering due not to the
  molecules in a "cloud" at the source orifice exit but to those in
  the relatively high density of background gas throughout the
  system due to inadequate pumping speed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, I was getting more and more
  intrigued with the problems and possibilities of beams from free
  jet sources and eager to become more directly involved. I had by
  this time learned that in spite of Dean Taylor's rosy assurances
  I could not become an active participant in academic research
  unless I had some direct association with a department. SQUID had
  been supporting research on two-phase flow by Shao Lee (Charlie)
  Soo, a young assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering.
  During a visit to Soo's lab one day I met Robert Drake, the new
  chairman hired to refurbish that department's image by expanding
  its research activities. I described my wild ideas on free jet
  beams and said: "If I write a proposal and get some support will
  your department provide a home for the project?" Bob had done his
  doctoral research in rarefied gas dynamics at UC Berkeley.
  Familiar with the molecular perspective on gas dynamics he
  immediately said yes. I prepared a proposal on which I was listed
  as a "Consultant" because I was not on the faculty and under
  university rules could not be a Principal Investigator. That role
  was assumed jointly by Bob Drake and Michele Boudart, my next
  door neighbor and close friend who was interested in chemical
  kinetics and catalysis and was on the faculty of Chemical
  Engineering. I had been discussing my beam ideas with him and he
  too found them intriguing. The proposal was submitted to NSF who
  sent it for review to Immanuel Estermann, a co-author with Stern
  and Frisch of the landmark paper on diffractive scattering of
  hydrogen from LiF, one of the two papers cited when Stern won the
  Nobel prize in 1943. Estermann had become Director of ONR's
  Material Sciences Division (whose Power Branch was responsible
  for Project SQUID) and was thus my ultimate boss. He took his
  reviewing seriously and spent a day in Princeton discussing the
  proposal with me. (The fact that his daughter was then living in
  Princeton was no doubt something of an inducement for him to make
  the trip from Washington.) He had visited Becker's laboratory in
  Marburg, Germany and was aware of the difficulties Becker had
  encountered in fabricating the tiny converging-diverging nozzles
  prescribed by Kantrowitz and Grey. As he took his leave he said:
  "John, I'm afraid this research may be too difficult to pursue
  with graduate students but I think it is important so I'm going
  to recommend support." He apparently was as good as his word
  because NSF gave us the money we had sought and we began work in
  the fall of 1960. As it turned out, Estermann's fears about the
  difficulties of making very small Laval (converging- diverging)
  nozzles were groundless. The Marburg group discovered
  empirically, that beam intensities became higher when the
  diverging section of the nozzle was cut off!<a href=
  "#not10"><sup>10</sup></a> The lower intensities obtained with a
  diverging nozzle are due to viscosity effects which Kantrowitz
  and Grey had ignored in their analysis. Dave Miller's group in
  San Diego, later showed experimentally that for most practical
  purposes the jets from a simple orificea (hole in a flat plate),
  a simple converging nozzle, or a long tube, had almost identical
  properties as long as the flow was "choked", i.e. reached sonic
  velocity, at the exit plane of the nozzle, tube or
  orifice.<a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
