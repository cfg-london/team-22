  <h1>Melvin Calvin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="calvin.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Melvin Calvin</b> was born in St.
  Paul, Minnesota, April 8, 1911, of Russian emigrant parents. He
  received the B.S. degree in Chemistry in 1931 at the Michigan College of Mining
  and Technology, and the Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from the
  University of
  Minnesota in 1935. He spent the academic years 1935-1937 at
  the University of Manchester, England. He began his
  academic career at the University of California at Berkeley in 1937, as an
  instructor, and has been a full professor since 1947. He has
  served as Director of the big-organic chemistry group in the
  Lawrence Radiation Laboratory since 1946. This group became the
  Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics in 1960.<br>
  <br>
  He has been the recipient of a number of medals, awards, and
  lectureships, and holds membership in numerous learned societies.
  In addition, he has been elected to the National Academy of
  Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society of London, the
  Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and Letters, and the German
  Academy of Scientists, Leopoldina. He holds honorary D.Sc.
  degrees from Michigan College of Mining and Technology, the
  University of
  Nottingham, Oxford University, and Northwestern
  University.<br>
  <br>
  His scientific life began with a thesis on the electron affinity
  of halogens, done under the direction of Professor George A.
  Glocker at the University of Minnesota and completed in 1935. The
  following two-year postdoctoral period was spent with Professor
  Michael Polanyi at the University of Manchester, at which time
  his interest in coordination catalysis, particularly
  metalloporphyrins, was awakened. This interest is still paramount
  and has resulted both in theoretical <i>(The Chemistry of Metal
  Chelate Compounds)</i> and practical (oxygen-carrying synthetic
  chelate compounds) applications. The investigation of the
  electronic, photoelectric and photochemical behaviour of such
  materials now occupies a good fraction of his time.<br>
  <br>
  Upon coming to Berkeley, California, at the invitation of
  Professor Gilbert N. Lewis, his interest turned to general
  theoretical aspects of organic molecular structure and
  behaviour.There were two prime publications of this period. The
  first, with Professor Gilbert N. Lewis, was on <i>The Color of
  Organic Substances</i>, and the second, with Professor G.E.K.
  Branch, was <i>The Theory of Organic Chemistry</i>. It was from
  these men that the fundamental interest in the behaviour of
  organic molecules in their most detailed terms was derived.<br>
  <br>
  This interest combined with the earlier one on the catalytic
  behaviour of coordination compounds were the natural parents of
  his present preoccupation with the problem of photosynthesis. The
  ready availability of carbon-14 which began in 1945 channeled the
  early work to development of techniques for its use <i>(Isotopic
  Carbon)</i> and its application to the exploration of
  photosynthetic carbon dioxide reduction <i>(The Path of Carbon in
  Photosynthesis)</i>.<br>
  <br>
  An extension of his interest from here into the general problems
  of biology was unavoidable, and thus his laboratory is at present
  peopled by emigrants from all areas of science on both sides of
  chemistry - physics on the one hand and biology on the
  other.<br>

  Dr. Calvin is married to the former Genevieve Jemtegaard,
  daughter of Norwegian emigrant parents, they have two daughters,
  Elin and Karole, and one son, Noel.</p>
