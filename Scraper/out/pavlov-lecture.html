  <h2>Physiology of Digestion</h2>

  <p>It is not accidental that all phenomena of
  human life are dominated by the search for daily bread - the
  oldest link connecting all living things, man included, with the
  surrounding nature. Food finding its way into the organism where
  it undergoes certain changes - is decomposed, enters into new
  combinations and again dissociates - represents the process of
  life in all its fullness, from such elementary physical
  properties of the organism as weight, inertia, etc., all the way
  to the highest manifestations of human nature. Precise knowledge
  of what happens to the food entering the organism must be the
  subject of ideal physiology, the physiology of the future.
  Present-day physiology can but engage in the continuous
  accumulation of material for the achievement of this distant
  aim.</p>

  <p>The first stage through which the food
  substances introduced from without must pass, is the digestive
  canal; the first vital action on these substances, or to be more
  exact and objective, their first participation in life, in its
  process, constitutes what we call the <i>digestion</i>.</p>

  <p>The digestive canal represents a tube
  passing through the entire organism and communicating with the
  external world, i.e. as it were the external surface of the body,
  but turned inwards and thus hidden in the organism.</p>

  <p>The physiologist who succeeds in
  penetrating deeper and deeper into the digestive canal becomes
  convinced that it consists of a number of chemical laboratories
  equipped with various mechanical devices.</p>

  <p>The mechanical apparatuses are formed by
  muscular tissue that is a constituent part of the wall of the
  digestive canal. They either take care of the passage of the
  components of food from one laboratory to another, or detain them
  for a certain time in a given laboratory or, finally, expel them
  when they prove harmful to the organism; moreover, they
  participate in the mechanical processing of the food, aiding the
  chemical action on it by thorough mixing, etc.</p>

  <p>A special, so-called glandular tissue which
  is either also a constituent part of the wall of the digestive
  canal, or lies beyond it in the shape of separate masses and
  communicates with it by means of tubes, produces chemical
  reagents, the so-called digestive juices that flow into separate
  segments of the digestive tract. The reagents are, on the one
  hand, aqueous solutions of such well-known chemical substances as
  hydrochloric acid, soda, etc., on the other hand, however,
  substances which are found only in a living organism and which
  break up the main components of food (proteins, carbohydrates,
  and fats) with such ease (so rapidly, at such a low temperature,
  and in such small quantities) as no other chemically well-studied
  substance could perform. These substances which act in vitro just
  as well as in the digestive canal, and which, therefore, are
  objects of chemical investigation entirely subject to laws, have
  so far, however, defied chemical analysis. As is known, they are
  called ferments.</p>

  <p>From this general description of the
  digestive process I shall turn to facts relating to this process
  established by me and by the laboratory of which I am in charge.
  In doing so I deem it my duty to recall with profound gratitude
  my numerous laboratory co-workers.</p>

  <p>It is perfectly clear that successful study
  of the digestive process, as of any other function of the
  organism, depends to a considerable degree on whether we succeed
  in finding the nearest and most convenient point of view on the
  process under observation and in removing all intervening
  processes between the phenomena under observation and the
  observer.</p>

  <p>In order to investigate the production of
  secretion in the big digestive glands, that communicate with the
  digestive canal only by means of tubes, we cut from the wall of
  the digestive canal small pieces, in the centre of which were the
  normal openings of the secretory ducts; we then closed the
  opening in the wall of the canal by stitching, and the excised
  pieces were sutured to the corresponding site on the surface of
  the skin with the openings of the secretory ducts to the outside.
  Thanks to this procedure the juice was diverted from the
  digestive canal and could be collected in special vessels. In
  order to collect the juice produced by those microscopic glands
  that are located directly in the wall of the digestive canal,
  already since a long time large pieces were cut out from the wall
  of the digestive canal and artificial pouches with openings to
  the outside were made; the defect in the digestive canal, of
  course, was closed by stitching. In the case of the stomach,
  however, the nerves of the glandular cells were always severed
  when constructing an artificially isolated pouch and this,
  naturally, affected the normal work of the stomach. Taking into
  account the more delicate anatomical relations, we modified the
  operation in such a way that the normal nervous paths were left
  fully intact when making the isolated stomach-wall pouch.</p>

  <p>Finally, as the digestive canal is a
  complex system, a series of separate chemical laboratories, I cut
  the connections between them in order to investigate the course
  of phenomena in each particular laboratory; thus I resolved the
  digestive canal into several separate parts. This, of course,
  necessitated laying short and convenient passage-ways from the
  outside into each separate laboratory. For this purpose metal
  tubes have long been in use; these coalesce with the skin in
  artificial body openings, and during the intervals between the
  experiments they can be sealed by means of plugs.</p>

  <p>In this way we often had to perform very
  minute operations, sometimes several of them on one and the same
  animal. It goes without saying that the desire to accomplish the
  task with more confidence, to avoid wasting time and labour, and
  to spare our experimental animals as much as possible, made us
  strictly observe all the precautions taken by surgeons in respect
  to their patients. Here, too, we had to apply appropriate
  anaesthesia, observe scrupulous cleanliness during the operation,
  provide clean dwellings after the operation, and take thorough
  care of the wounds. But these measures did not suffice. After
  remaking the animal's organism in accordance with our design,
  which naturally caused more or less damage to the experimental
  animal, we had to find a modus vivendi for it that would ensure
  an absolutely normal and long life. Only by observing this
  condition would the results of our work be regarded as fully
  conclusive and as having elucidated the normal course of the
  phenomena. We succeeded thanks to our correct appraisal of the
  changes evoked in the organism, and thanks to the expedient
  measures taken by us; our healthy and happy animals did their
  laboratory work with real gusto; they always eagerly moved from
  their cages to the laboratory and readily jumped onto the tables
  where our experiments and observations were conducted. Believe
  me, I am not exaggerating. Thanks to our present surgical methods
  in physiology we can demonstrate at any time almost all phenomena
  of digestion without the loss of even a single drop of blood,
  without a single scream from the animal undergoing the
  experiment. At the same time this is an extremely important
  practical application of the power of human knowledge, which may
  also be of immediate use to man, who, due to the implacable
  fortuities of life, is often mutilated in similar, though more
  varied ways.</p>

  <p>In our observations on dogs, we soon
  noticed the following fundamental fact: the kind of substances
  getting into the digestive canal from the external world, i.e.
  whether edible or inedible, dry or liquid, as well as the
  composition of the food determined on the onset or else absence
  of the work of the digestive glands, the peculiarities of their
  functioning in the former case, the amount of reagents produced
  by them, and their condition. This can be shown by a number of
  examples. Take, for instance, the production of saliva by the
  mucous salivary glands. With each meal, when edible substances
  find their way into the oral cavity, thick and viscous saliva
  containing much mucus flows out of these glands. With the
  introduction into the animal's mouth of substances that it finds
  repugnant, such as salt, acid, mustard, etc., the saliva may flow
  in the same quantity as in the first case, but now its quality is
  quite different - it is fluid and watery. If the dog is given now
  meat, then ordinary bread, other conditions being equal, the
  secretion of saliva in the second case will be more abundant than
  in the first. Similarly, of the substances for which the animal
  has a distaste some, for example chemical irritants like acid,
  alkali, etc., evoke a more profuse secretion of saliva than
  other, chemically indifferent substances, like bitters;
  consequently here, too, different activity of the salivary glands
  is observed. The gastric glands react in the same way; they
  secrete their juice now in larger, now in smaller quantities, now
  of a higher and now of a lower acidity and content of
  protein-dissolving ferment, so-called pepsin. Bread evokes the
  secretion of gastric juice with the highest ferment content, but
  of lowest acidity; milk evokes the minimum ferment content, while
  meat evokes the maximum acid content. For a certain quantity of
  protein if provided in the form of bread, the glands produce from
  two to four times as much as when provided in the form of meat or
  milk.</p>

  <p>However, the diversity of the work of the
  gastric glands is not confined to the above-mentioned phenomena;
  it is manifested also in peculiar fluctuations in the quantity
  and quality of the reagent during the period of the functioning
  of the glands following the introduction of one or another food
  substance.</p>

  <p>But that will suffice. I should only abuse
  your attention by giving an exposition of all the facts collected
  by us in this field. I shall merely mention that we observed
  similar correlations in relation to the other glands of the
  digestive tract.</p>

  <p>Now it may further be asked: what does this
  changeability in the work of the glands signify? In reply we
  shall revert to the phenomenon of salivary secretion. Edible
  substances evoke the secretion of thick, concentrated saliva.
  Why? The answer, obviously, is that this enables the mass of food
  to pass smoothly through the tube leading from the mouth into the
  stomach. Under the action of certain substances disagreeable to
  the dog the same glands secrete fluid saliva. What purpose does
  the saliva serve in such cases? Apparently, either to dilute
  these substances and thereby weaken their chemically irritating
  action, or, as we know from our own experience, to cleanse the
  mouth from such substances. In this case exclusively water, not
  mucus, is required, and water is actually secreted.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, bread, and especially dry
  bread, evokes secretion of considerably larger quantities of
  saliva than meat. This, too, is perfectly understandable: the
  eating of dry bread requires saliva, firstly, to dissolve the
  components of the bread and so make it possible to recognize its
  taste (something utterly inedible might have gotten into the
  mouth), and secondly, to soften the hard and dry bread, otherwise
  it would go down with difficulty and could even cause injury to
  the walls of the oesophagus while moving from the mouth into the
  stomach.</p>

  <p>The relations inside the stomach are
  exactly the same. The bread protein induces secretion of more
  protein ferment than the protein of milk or meat, and a
  corresponding phenomenon is observed in the test tube: protein of
  meat and milk is broken up more easily by the protein ferment
  than vegetable protein.</p>

  <p>Here again I could cite numerous additional
  examples of similar purposeful relationships between the work of
  the digestive glands and the properties of the substances
  entering the digestive tract (but this I shall do on a future
  occasion). There is nothing surprising at all in this phenomenon;
  and other relations would not be expected. It is clear to all
  that the animal organism is a highly complex system consisting of
  an almost infinite series of parts connected both with one
  another and, as a total complex, with the surrounding world, with
  which it is in a state of equilibrium. The equilibrium of this
  system, as of any other system, is a condition for its existence.
  And if in certain cases we are unable to disclose the purposeful
  relations in this system, the reason is that we lack knowledge;
  it does not mean at all that these relations are absent in the
  system during its continual existence.</p>

  <p>Now we shall pass to a further question
  which arises from what has been said above: how is this
  equilibrium effected? Why is it that the glands produce and
  secrete in the digestive tract the very reagents needed for the
  successful treatment of the respective object? Apparently, it
  should be assumed that in some way certain properties of the
  object act on the gland, evoke in it a specific reaction and
  cause its specific activity. Analysis of this influence on the
  gland is an extremely intricate matter and one that requires much
  time. The main thing is to reveal in the object those properties
  which, in this particular case, act as stimuli on the glands in
  question. An investigation of this kind is not at all so easy as
  it looks at first sight. Here are some facts to prove this. By
  means of the previously mentioned metal tube, we introduce meat
  into the empty and inactive stomach of the dog, without the
  animal noticing it. In a few minutes the gastric reagent, an acid
  solution of the gastric protein ferment, begins to exude from the
  walls of the stomach. Which property of the meat lump has acted
  as the stimulus on the gastric glands? The simplest way would be
  to assume that this action has been caused by its mechanical
  properties-pressure, or friction against the walls of the
  stomach. But such an assumption would be absolutely wrong.
  Mechanical influences are completely ineffective with regard to
  the gastric glands. We can mechanically influence the wall of the
  stomach in any way - strongly or feebly, continuously or with
  interruptions, on limited areas or in a diffused way - but
  without obtaining a single drop of gastric juice. Actually, it is
  the components of meat soluble in water that are the stimulating
  substances. However, as yet we lack exact knowledge of these
  substances since the extractable substances of meat form a large
  group that still awaits investigation in full measure.</p>

  <p>Here is one more example. A few minutes
  after the thyme finds its way into the next section of the
  digestive canal - into the duodenum - one of the glands of this
  section comes into action; this is the <i>pancreas</i>, a large
  organ located at the side of the digestive tract and connected
  with it by an excretory duct. But which of the properties of the
  thyme advancing in the intestine acts as a stimulating agent on
  this gland? Contrary to our expectations, it turned out that this
  action was exerted not by the properties of the juice which
  joined it in the stomach, namely, by its acid content. If we pour
  into the stomach or directly into the intestine pure gastric
  juice, or simply the acid which it contains, or even some other
  acid, our gland will begin to function just as vigorously, or
  even more vigorously, than in the case of the normal thyme
  passing from the stomach into the intestine. The profound
  significance of this unexpected fact is quite clear.</p>

  <p>The gastric laboratory uses its protein
  ferment under an acid reaction. Different intestinal ferments,
  and among them, naturally, pancreatic ferments, cannot develop
  their activity in an acid medium. Hence, it is clear that the
  first task of the laboratory is to provide the neutral or
  alkaline reaction necessary for its successful activity. These
  circumstances are effected by the above-mentioned interrelations,
  since the acid content of the stomach, as already stated, induces
  secretion of alkaline pancreatic juice (and the higher the acid
  content, the greater the secretion). Thus, the pancreatic juice
  acts above all as a solution of soda.</p>

  <p>One more example. It has been known for a
  long time that the pancreatic juice contains all the three
  ferments which act on the major food substances - a protein
  ferment, which is different from the gastric ferment, a starch
  ferment and a fat ferment. As proved by our experiments, the
  protein ferment in the pancreatic juice is, constantly or at
  times, entirely or partly (this is still a matter of argument),
  in an inactive, latent form. This may be justified by the fact
  that the active protein ferment might endanger the other two
  pancreatic ferments and destroy them. Simultaneously we
  established that the walls of the upper section of the intestine
  secrete a special fermentative substance the action of which is
  to transform the inactive pancreatic protein ferment into an
  active one. The active ferment, upon coming into contact with the
  protein substances of the food in the intestine, loses its
  harmful action with regard to the other ferments. <i>The
  secretion of the above-mentioned special intestinal ferment by
  the wall of the intestine is solely due to the stimulating action
  of the pancreatic protein ferment.</i></p>

  <p>Thus, the purposeful relationship of
  phenomena is based on the <i>specificity of the stimuli</i>, that
  correspond to similarly specific reactions. But this by no means
  exhausts the subject. Now the following question should be
  raised: how does the given property of the object, the given
  stimulant, reach the glandular tissue itself, its cellular
  elements? The system of the organism, of its countless parts, is
  united into a single entity in two ways: by means of a specific
  tissue which exists solely for the purpose of maintaining
  interrelations, that is, the nervous tissue, and by means of body
  fluids bathing all body elements. These same intermediaries
  transmit our stimuli to the glandular tissue. We have thoroughly
  studied the first kind of these interrelations.</p>

  <p>Long before us it was established that the
  work of the salivary glands is regulated by a complex nervous
  apparatus. The endings of the centripetal sensory nerves are
  stimulated in the oral cavity by different stimuli; these are
  transmitted via these nerves to the central nervous system and
  thence, with the help of special centrifugal, secretory nerve
  fibres directly connected with the glandular cells, they reach
  the secretory elements and induce them to certain activity. As is
  known, this process, as a whole, is designated as a <i>reflex</i>
  or a reflex stimulation.</p>

  <p>We have asserted, and also proven
  experimentally, that normally this reflex is always of a specific
  nature, i.e. that the endings of the centripetal nerves receiving
  the stimulation are different, each bringing about a reflex only
  when there are very defined external stimuli. Accordingly, the
  stimuli reaching the glandular cell must also be a special,
  peculiar one. This is the fundamental mechanism of the work of
  the organs purposefully depending on external influences, a
  relationship that is accomplished by the nervous system.</p>

  <p>As was to be expected, the discovery of the
  nervous apparatus of the salivary glands immediately impelled
  physiologists to seek a similar apparatus in other glands lying
  deeper in the digestive canal. Despite great efforts no positive
  results could be achieved in this respect for a long time.
  Apparently, the new objects of investigation had essential
  properties that made their elucidation difficult for
  investigators using the earlier methods.</p>

  <p>Taking into account these special
  relations, we were able, fortunately, to achieve what for such a
  long time had been a pium desiderium. Physiology has, at last,
  gained control over the nerves which stimulate the gastric glands
  and the pancreas. Our success was mainly due to the fact that we
  stimulated the nerves of animals that easily stood on their own
  feet and were not subjected to any painful stimulus either during
  or immediately before stimulation of their nerves.</p>

  <p>Our experiments not only proved the
  existence of a nervous apparatus in the above-mentioned glands,
  but also disclosed some facts clearly showing the participation
  of these nerves in normal activity. Here is a striking
  example.</p>

  <p>On dogs we performed two simple operations
  they very easily endure and after which, if taken good care of,
  they live for many years like very healthy and normal animals.
  These operations are the following: (1) Severing the tube leading
  from the mouth into the stomach and suturing both ends separately
  to the skin of the throat in such a way that food cannot pass
  from the mouth into the stomach of the animal but falls out
  through the upper opening of the tube; (2) the operation
  mentioned already earlier and used since a long time, in which a
  metal tube is introduced into the stomach through the abdominal
  wall. These animals have to be fed, of course, by putting the
  food directly into the stomach through this metal tube. When,
  after a fast of several hours and after the empty stomach of the
  dog has been thoroughly washed, the animal is fed in the natural
  way (whereby the food, as already mentioned, falls out of the
  oesophagus before reaching the stomach) then in a few minutes
  pure gastric juice begins to trickle out of the empty stomach.
  This secretion lasts as long as the animal is given food and
  persists some time (in a few cases even a long time) after the
  so-called sham feeding is discontinued. The secretion of juice is
  very abundant; one can obtain many hundreds of cubic centimetres
  of gastric juice in this way. In our laboratory we perform this
  operation on many dogs and the gastric juice thus obtained not
  only serves the purpose of research, but also as a good remedy in
  treating patients suffering from insufficiency of the gastric
  glands. Our animals living many years (more than 7-8 years)
  without ever showing any deviation from normal health thus donate
  a part of their vital supplies to the benefit of man.</p>

  <p>From the described experiment it is clear
  that the mere act of eating, the food even not reaching the
  stomach, determines the stimulation of the gastric glands. If the
  so-called vagus nerves are severed at the neck of these dogs the
  sham feeding will no longer cause any secretion of gastric juice,
  no matter how long the dog stays alive and in spite of the fact
  that it feels excellent. So the stimulation effected by the act
  of eating reaches the gastric glands by means of the nerve fibres
  that are contained in the vagus nerves.</p>

  <p>Now I shall allow myself to leave my main
  theme for a moment. Cutting of the vagus nerves in animals has
  been performed already for a long time and presented an
  absolutely fatal operation. In the course of the 19th century
  physiologists learned about numerous influences exerted by the
  vagus nerves on the different organs and their respective
  investigations revealed at least four disorders in the organism
  occurring after severing these nerves, each of which being lethal
  by itself. In our dogs we took appropriate measures against each
  of these disorders, one of which concerns the digestive system,
  and due to this procedure the animals whose vagus nerves were cut
  enjoyed a healthy and happy life. Thus, four simultaneously
  acting lethal causes were deliberately eliminated. A striking
  proof of the power of science that regards the organism as a
  machine!</p>

  <p>Some ten years ago the great man to whom
  the annual science festival in Stockholm owes its existence
  honoured me and my friend, the late Professor Nencki, with a
  letter enclosing a considerable donation for the benefit of the
  laboratories under our direction. In that letter Alfred Nobel
  expressed his keen interest in physiological experiments and
  proposed that we should try several highly instructive projects
  concerning the supreme tasks of physiology, the problem of the
  organisms ageing and dying off. Indeed physiology is qualified to
  hope for significant victories in this field; it is as yet
  impossible to delimitate here the boundaries of the power of
  physiology. This power of physiology, however, can only be
  secured in the future if we continue deepening our knowledge of
  the organism as a very complicated mechanism. Above I have
  provided a small example supporting this.</p>

  <p>I shall now return to the subject of my
  lecture. One kind of stimulators of the digestive glands - it
  quite unexpectedly came to the fore during our investigations -
  has not yet been mentioned. It has long been known for sure that
  the sight of tasty food makes a hungry man's mouth water; also
  lack of appetite has always been regarded as an undesirable
  phenomenon, from which one might conclude that appetite is
  essentially linked with the process of digestion. In physiology
  too psychical stimulation of both the salivary and the gastric
  glands has been reported. It is remarkable that nevertheless
  psychical stimulation of the gastric glands is far from being
  generally admitted and the outstanding role of psychical
  influences on the mechanism of the processing of food in the
  digestive tract has not at all met with proper acknowledgement.
  Our investigations led us to bringing these influences to the
  fore. Appetite, craving for food, is a constant and powerful
  stimulator of the gastric glands. There is not a dog in which
  skilful teasing with food does not evoke a more or less
  considerable secretion of juice from the empty and hitherto
  inactive stomach. At the mere sight of food nervous and excitable
  animals secrete several hundred, sedate and quiet animals only a
  few cubic centimetres of gastric juice. By modifying the
  experiment in a certain way an extremely profuse secretion of
  juice takes place in all animals without exception; I have in
  mind the experimental sham feeding mentioned previously in which
  the food cannot reach the stomach from the mouth. An exact and
  frequently repeated analysis of this experiment convinced us that
  in this case the secretion of juice cannot be regarded as being
  the result of a simple reflex stimulation of the mouth and throat
  by the food swallowed. Any given chemical irritant can be brought
  into the mouth of a dog thus operated upon, without even a single
  drop of gastric juice flowing upon this stimulation. One can
  still assume that the oral surface is stimulated not by arbitrary
  chemical substances but only by specific ones contained in the
  food consumed. Further observations, however, do not confirm this
  supposition. One and the same food acts differently as a gland
  stimulator depending on whether the food was consumed by the dog
  eagerly or unwillingly, by order. Generally the following
  invariable phenomenon is observed: each kind of food ingested by
  the dog during this experiment acts as a strong stimulus only
  when it suits the dog's taste. We must admit that in the act of
  eating the craving for food, the appetite - and therefore a
  psychical phenomenon - serves as a powerful and constant
  stimulus. The physiological significance of this juice, which we
  termed <i>appetite juice</i>, proved outstandingly great. When we
  introduce bread into the dog's stomach through the metal tube so
  as to prevent the dog from noticing it, i.e., without arousing
  its appetite, the bread may remain in the stomach unchanged for a
  whole hour, without evoking even the slightest secretion of
  juice, since it lacks the substances that would stimulate the
  gastric glands. However, when the same bread is consumed by the
  animal, the gastric juice secreted thereupon, the appetite juice,
  acts chemically on the protein substances of the bread, or, in
  other, more usual words, digests it. Amongst the substances
  resulting from the protein thus changed are some that in turn act
  on the gastric glands as independent stimuli. They carry on the
  work which is started by the first stimulus, the appetite, that
  naturally is diminishing by then. Already while studying the
  action of the gastric glands it could be discovered that appetite
  not only generally acts as a stimulus on these glands, but also
  that it excites them <i>in a varying degree</i> according to its
  direction. For the salivary glands the rule holds that all
  variations in their activity observed in physiological
  experiments are exactly duplicated in experiments using psychical
  stimulation, i.e. in which a given object is not brought into
  direct contact with the mucous membrane of the mouth, but arouses
  the animal's attention from some distance. For example, the sight
  of dry bread evokes a stronger secretion of saliva than the sight
  of meat, although the latter, judging from the animal's
  movements, may arouse a considerably keener interest. On teasing
  the dog with meat or any other edible substance a highly
  concentrated saliva flows from the submaxillary glands; the sight
  of distasteful substances, on the other hand, conditions the
  secretion of a very fluid saliva from the same glands. In short,
  the experiments with psychical stimulation represent an exact but
  reduced copy of those with physiological stimulation of the
  glands using the same substances. With regard to the action of
  the salivary glands psychology has thus taken its place besides
  physiology. Even more than that! At first sight the psychological
  aspect of this action seems to be even more indisputable than the
  physiological. When an object attracting the dog's attention at a
  distance brings about secretion of saliva, it is fully justified,
  of course, to assume that this is a psychical phenomenon and not
  a physiological one.</p>

  <p>When, however, the dog consumes something
  or when a substance is forcibly poured into its mouth and saliva
  thereupon flows, it still has to be proved that indeed there is
  something physiological in this phenomenon and that it is not
  purely psychical but in dimensions reinforced due to special
  accompanying conditions. These considerations would all the more
  be in accordance with reality, since most substances entering the
  mouth while eating or artificially, strangely enough, activate
  the salivary glands after severing of all sensory nerves of the
  tongue in a very similar way as before this operation. One would
  have to go further, resort to more radical measures such as
  poisoning the animal or taking away higher parts of the central
  nervous system, in order to become convinced that between objects
  stimulating the oral cavity and the salivary glands not only a
  psychical but also a physiological connection exists. We are thus
  confronted with two series of apparently entirely different
  phenomena. What now is the physiologist to do with the psychical
  phenomena? Disregarding them is impossible since in the action of
  the salivary glands, in which we are interested, they are closely
  connected with the purely physiological phenomena. If,
  nevertheless, the physiologist wants to study them, he finds
  himself faced with the question: How?</p>

  <p>Since we used the studies of the lowly
  organized representatives of the animal kingdom as an example,
  and, naturally, wanted to remain physiologists instead of
  becoming psychologists, we decided to take an entirely objective
  point of view also towards the psychical phenomena in our
  experiments with animals. Above all, we tried to discipline
  sternly our way of thinking and our words and ignored completely
  the mental state of the animal; we restricted our work to careful
  observation and exact formulation of the influence exerted by
  distant objects on the secretion of the salivary glands. The
  results were according to our expectations: the observable
  relations between external phenomena and variations in the
  activity of glands could be systematically analysed; they
  appeared to be determined by laws, because they could be
  reproduced at will. We were pleased to find that our experiments
  proved to be right and fruitful. I shall give some examples here
  illustrating the results obtained with the new method in our
  field of interest.</p>

  <p>When the dog is repeatedly teased with the
  sight of objects inducing salivary secretion from a distance, the
  reaction of the salivary glands grows weaker and weaker and
  finally drops to zero. The shorter the intervals between repeated
  stimulations the quicker the reaction reaches zero, and vice
  versa. These rules apply fully only when the conditions of the
  experiment are kept unchanged. The identity of the conditions,
  however, need to be only of a relative character; it may be
  restricted only to those phenomena in the external world that
  were previously associated with the act of eating or with the
  compulsory introduction of the substances in question into the
  animal's mouth; the variation of the remaining phenomena is of no
  significance. This relative identity mentioned above can be very
  easily attained by the experimenter so that an experiment in
  which a stimulus repeatedly applied from a distance gradually
  loses its effect, can be readily demonstrated even in the course
  of one lecture. When in a repeated stimulation from a distance a
  certain substance becomes ineffective, the action of another
  substance is not at all eliminated. For example, when milk ceases
  to produce an effect, the action of bread is very strong. When
  bread too has lost its effect due to repetition of the
  stimulation experiment, acid or other substances is still highly
  effective. These relations also explain the real meaning of the
  above-mentioned identity of experimental conditions; every detail
  of the surrounding objects appears to be a new stimulus. If a
  certain stimulus has lost its influence, it can recover the
  latter only after a long resting that has to last several
  hours.</p>

  <p>The lost action, however, can also be
  restored with certainty at any time by special measures.</p>

  <p>When repeatedly showing of bread no longer
  stimulates the dog's salivary glands one needs only to let the
  animal eat bread to attain full restoration of the action of
  bread at a distance. The same result is achieved when the dog is
  given some other food. Even stronger: If something inducing
  salivary secretion, such as acid, is brought into the animal's
  mouth, the original action of the sight of bread is also
  restored. Generally, everything that stimulates the activity of
  the salivary gland retrieves the lost reaction: the greater the
  activity the more fully the reaction is restored.</p>

  <p>Also according to rules our reaction can be
  inhibited by certain interferences, for instance, affecting the
  dog, its eye or its ear by an extraordinary stimulus and thereby
  evoking a strong motor reaction in the animal such as trembling
  of the entire body.</p>

  <p>Since my time is limited I shall content
  myself with what I have said and pass on to the theoretical
  consideration of the experiments just mentioned. The given facts
  fit readily in our physiological way of thinking. Our stimuli
  working from a distance may rightly be termed and regarded as
  reflexes. When observing carefully it appears that the activity
  of the salivary gland is always excited by some external
  phenomenon, i.e. that it is induced by external stimuli like the
  usual physiological salivary reflex; only the second is evoked
  from the oral surface, the first, however, from the eye or from
  the nose, etc. The difference between the two reflexes is firstly
  that our old physiological reflex is constant, unconditioned,
  while the new reflex continually fluctuates and, hence, is
  <i>conditioned</i>. Examining the phenomena more closely the
  following essential differences between the two reflexes can be
  observed: in the unconditioned reflex those properties of the
  object act as stimuli with which the saliva is confronted
  physiologically e.g. hardness, dryness, certain chemical
  properties; in the conditioned reflex, however, those properties
  of the object act as stimuli that in themselves have no direct
  relation at all with the physiological role of the saliva, e.g.
  colour, etc. These last properties appear here in some way as
  signals for the first. One is bound to regard their stimulating
  action as a further, more delicate adaptation of the salivary
  glands to the phenomena in the external world. Here is an
  example: We intend to pour acid into the dog's mouth; to protect
  the oral mucous membrane it is apparently very desirable that
  saliva accumulates before the acid enters the mouth; on the one
  hand the saliva prevents direct contact of the acid with the
  mucous membrane and, on the other hand, it immediately dilutes
  the acid thus generally weakening its injurious chemical action.
  However, essentially the signals have only a conditional
  significance: they change readily and also, the signalized object
  cannot come into contact with the oral mucous membrane.
  Consequently the finer adaptation would have to consist in the
  fact that the properties of the object serving as a signal
  sometimes do and at other times do not stimulate the salivary
  glands. This is what we see in reality. Any phenomenon in the
  external world can be made a temporary signal of an object
  stimulating the salivary glands, if the stimulation of the oral
  mucous membrane by this object has been associated repeatedly
  once or several times with the action of the given external
  phenomenon on other sensitive body surfaces. In our laboratory we
  are trying at present to apply many such highly paradoxical
  combinations, and with success. On the other hand promptly active
  signals can lose their stimulating effect if repeated over a long
  period without bringing the object concerned into contact with
  the oral mucous membrane. When the most usual kinds of food are
  shown to the dog for days and weeks, without letting him eat it,
  the sight of the food will finally cease to evoke salivary
  secretion. The mechanism of stimulating the salivary glands
  through the signalling characteristics of the objects, i.e. the
  mechanism of "conditioned stimulation" can be easily conceived
  from the physiological point of view as a function of the nervous
  system. As we have just seen, each conditioned reflex, i.e.
  stimulation through the signalling characteristics of the objects
  is based on an unconditioned reflex, that is, a stimulation
  through the essential characteristics of the object. So it must
  be assumed that the point of the central nervous system that is
  being stimulated strongly during an unconditioned reflex diverts
  to itself the weaker stimuli exerted by the external world on
  other points of the central nervous system, i.e. that due to the
  unconditioned reflex a temporary, incidental path is created for
  all the other external stimuli towards the central point of this
  reflex. The conditions influencing the opening and closing of
  this path, its being in use or in disuse, constitute the internal
  mechanism of the signalling characteristics of external objects
  being effective or ineffective, the physiological basis of the
  finest reactivity of the living matter, the most delicate
  adaptive capability of the animal organism.</p>

  <p>I wish to express here my deep conviction
  that in this direction, along the broad lines I have sketched,
  physiological research can advance greatly and successfully.</p>

  <p>Essentially only one thing in life
  interests us: our psychical constitution, the mechanism of which
  was and is wrapped in darkness. All human resources, art,
  religion, literature, philosophy and historical sciences, all of
  them join in bringing light in this darkness. But man has still
  another powerful resource: natural science with its strictly
  objective methods. This science, as we all know, is making huge
  progress every day. The facts and considerations which I have
  placed before you at the end of my lecture are one out of
  numerous attempts to employ a <i>consistent</i>, purely
  scientific method of thinking in the study of the mechanism of
  the highest manifestations of life in the dog, the representative
  of the animal kingdom that is man's best friend.</p>
