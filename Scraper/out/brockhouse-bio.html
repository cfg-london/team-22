  <h1>Bertram N. Brockhouse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="brockhouse.jpg" class="bio-img">It appears that I was born
  in hospital in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada on July 15, 1918. My
  first memories are of a farm near Milk River where I lived with
  my mother and father and my sister, Alice Evelyn, and a variety
  of farm and domestic animals. My father, Israel Bertram
  Brockhouse, had homesteaded with other members of his family in
  1910. He had spent his years to that time in the United States
  after being brought to this continent at two years of age from
  the family's native Yorkshire. My mother, Mable Emily (Neville)
  Brockhouse had grown up in Illinois, the product of uncounted
  generations of North American English people. As the years went
  on there were two other children born: Robert Paul, who died in
  infancy, and Gordon Edgar who became much later a railroad civil
  engineer. In the winter of 1926-27 our family moved to Vancouver
  B.C. and it was in that city my sister and brother and I grew
  up.<br>
  <br>
  My sister entered the school system in a normal way. But I had
  been a somewhat nominal attendee of the one-room elementary
  school a couple of miles from our farm and my preparation for the
  system was somewhat mixed. I must have learned to read and to do
  simple arithmetic at a very early age because I cannot remember
  ever learning these subjects. But in other ways I was much behind
  my potential classmates. But the fine Vancouver schools I
  attended (Central and then Lord Roberts elementary schools and
  King George High School - and the Sunday School of St. John's
  United Church) soon took care of this. So I had what I believe to
  be a good basic education, except for social and organizational
  defects probably arising from the facts that I found school work
  easy and that I was younger than most of my classmates.<br>
  <br>
  There were other people of course who had influence on me. These
  included my two aunts: Edith (Neville) Murphy in Chicago and
  Maude (Brockhouse) Smith in western Canada. My older cousin
  Wilbert B. Smith may have inspired an early interest in radio
  technology.<br>
  <br>
  Our family finances were somewhat precarious so I carried
  newspapers for most of my teens. But the Great Depression made
  things worse and in 1935 our family moved by train to Chicago in
  the hope of bettering the situation. I had completed High School
  by this time and took some evening courses at Central YMCA
  College (now Roosevelt University). I was interested in the
  technical aspects of radios and learned to repair and design and
  build them. This and my facility with mathematics was, I suppose,
  what pointed me eventually in the direction of physics. For part
  of our time in Chicago I worked as a lab assistant in a small
  electronic firm, Aubert Controls Corporation. But the company
  failed in the recession of 1937. In 1938 our family decided to
  return to Vancouver and we drove across the continent, all of us
  I think enjoying the experience.<br>
  <br>
  In Chicago I had begun to repair radios as a small business and I
  continued this in Vancouver. My parents ran a small grocery store
  but neither enterprise was really successful. I had always been
  interested in politics but now I began to take part as an active
  member of the leftist party of the era, the CCF. My adherence to
  the CCF continued for many years, in fact until I became an
  employee of the Dominion Government in the shape of the Chalk
  River Laboratory. (I understood then (and still do) that there is
  something dishonourable in a democratic society for a Government
  employee being other than politically neutral). I was profoundly
  anti-totalitarian and hence anticommunist so that when World War
  II erupted I was motivated from many sides to join the military.
  On September 26, 1939 I enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy with
  the design of becoming a Radio Telegrapher. In the event I spent
  some months at sea as a seaman and ASDIC operator but spent most
  of my six years in the Navy servicing ASDIC equipment at a shore
  base. In 1944 I was enrolled in a six-month course in Electrical
  Engineering at Nova Scotia Technical College and then as a
  newly-minted Electrical Sub-Lieutenant assigned to the test
  facilities at the National Research Council in Ottawa. It was
  there that I met Doris Miller, the girl who later became my
  wife.<br>
  <br>
  The war having ended, in late August 1945 I was drafted home to
  Vancouver and was discharged from the Navy on September 11 1945,
  under the principle "first in - first out". The Department of
  Veterans' Affairs was ready to supply finances for either a small
  land-holding or for training or education. Thus the way was clear
  for me to start immediately at the University of British
  Columbia. My preparation was such that the obvious choices for my
  course of study was either Electrical Engineering or Physics and
  I chose to enroll in Physics and Mathematics. I did very well in
  my first year, actually winning a scholarship. The university
  life was probably not typical because many of us were older than
  would normally have been the case. It was not all study, I
  operated also a (very) small business which eased our financial
  problems and I owned a motorcycle for transportation and
  enjoyment.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1946 after taking a summer class for extra
  credit, I took a vacation on my motorcycle, going all the way to
  Ottawa via Chicago. This was probably a decisive step in my life
  because I took up with Dorie again. With time short I returned
  with my motorcycle by train to Vancouver. Just before Christmas
  of 1946 my father died. He had long been troubled with a heart
  condition so his death was not a surprise. In the spring of the
  year Alice married so our family was now considerably changed. I
  had received some University credit for my irregular courses in
  mathematics and electricity and together with overload credits I
  was able to complete my B.A. program in April. I had been offered
  a summer job in the Nationel Research Council laboratory (the
  electrical standards section) so off I went to Ottawa again.
  There Dorie and I became engaged to be married.<br>
  <br>
  It had been arranged that I should return to Vancouver to take a
  Master's degree course but instead I went to the Low Temperature
  Laboratory of the University of Toronto. This was one of the two
  Universities in Canada to offer Ph. D. programs at that time (the
  other was McGill in Montreal). Being already 29 years of age I
  was very anxious to embark on my physics career. Furthermore,
  partly no doubt for financial reasons, DVA was very keen that I
  do my studies in Canada. So I started work under the guidance of
  Professors Hugh Grayson-Smith and James Reekie on the effects of
  stress and temperature on ferro-magnetism and finished a Master's
  program in the then normal period of eight months. In May, Dorie
  and I were married in the village of Kirkfield, the old home of
  her family. For the remainder of the summer we lived in Ottawa,
  Dorie continuing as a film technician at the National Film Board
  while I worked as a summer student in the acoustics section of
  the National Research Council. The more passive part of my
  education was now complete. The instruction via course-work which
  I received at UBC and Toronto was probably as good as I could
  reasonably have expected. Certainly I remember almost all the
  teachers and courses with fondness. Partly because my mind was
  "already formed" I suppose, I did not become comfortable with
  Quantum Mechanics and indeed never did so. The classical nature
  of the small researches I performed contributed to what was
  probably an "old-fashioned outlook" even at the time. And now I
  was forced to assume full responsibility for my future - and the
  future of my new family.<br>
  <br>
  The Low-Temperature Laboratory at Toronto was long-established
  and reasonably well-equipped. But at this point my supervisors
  both left to assume more senior positions at other institutions.
  Furthermore the third faculty member in the Lab also left. So I
  was left essentially unsupervised and should also have moved -
  except that we were now expecting the birth of our first child.
  But happily, as we thought, Sir Edward Bullard, an expert in
  earthmagnetism, was coming to head the Department - and to assume
  direction of my thesis work. If he had stayed for longer than he
  did then possibly I would have changed my field and worked on the
  earth-magnetism problems then very current and in which I had
  some interest. But he left to assume a high position in the U.K.
  so ultimately I had to do the best I could while receiving every
  possible help from the Department.<br>
  <br>
  My thesis subject was a contribution to Solid State physics which
  involved experiments at both low and high temperatures. There
  were a few books on the general subject, two excellent ones being
  by Frederick Seitz and by <a href="../1977/index.html">N.F.
  Mott</a> and H. Jones. These I to a considerable extent devoured.
  I had had lectures on the subject from Grayson-Smith and had a
  small correspondence with him. I had courses in Thermodynamics,
  Statistical Mechanics and Theory of Errors. I took a course on
  Nuclear Theory from my friend Melvin Preston, who was then at
  Toronto. So I was not too badly prepared in a general way for
  work on the periphery of Nuclear Energy, when the chance to work
  at Chalk River was offered to me.<br>
  <br>
  In August 1950 I went up to Deep River, in the van carrying our
  belongings, while Dorie (and baby Ann) stayed with her parents in
  a cottage on Balsam Lake near Kirkfield. There I met Don Hurst in
  whose (neutron physics) group I was to work and saw the house on
  Hillcrest Ave which was assigned to us. In a short while Dorie
  (and Gordon-soon-to-be) and Ann joined me. There was still some
  work to do on my thesis so I would be very busy for the next
  months. But in October Gordie was born and I passed my Ph. D.
  exam and we were set for the next period of our lives.<br>
  <br>
  We had originally thought of staying for only a few years and
  then going on, probably to a University. In the event we stayed
  for twelve years and four more children. As I progressed we moved
  (twice) to a better house as was the custom. Despite my long and
  irregular hours each of us had a social life and one together and
  we have kept in touch with some of our acquaintance then to this
  day. Since the work I did then represents a major part of the
  content of my lecture I will here be brief; I have reviewed it
  elsewhere - the major advance at this time in early 1951 was the
  realization that phonons could be studied by studying inelastic
  scattering and that evocative experiments to do so might be
  feasible at Chalk River.<br>
  <br>
  The first actual experiments studied the scattering of neutrons
  by highly absorbing elements, in the process verifying the famous
  Breit-Wigner formula. This work (on scatterers Cd, Sm and Gd) was
  done in collaboration with Myer Bloom and D.G. Hurst and was
  published in Physical Review (1951) and in the Canadian Journal
  of Research (1953). The apparatus was later much mod)fied and
  used to study the inelastic scattering from several materials
  (Aluminium, Graphite and Diamond) by absorption methods. This was
  the first quantitative experiment in slow neutron spectroscopy
  and was published in Physical Review. Other experiments by
  absorption methods were done about the same time at Harwell by
  R.D. Lowde and P.A. Egelstaff; that by Ray Lowde was particularly
  significant as it went far to establish the concept "spin wave"
  on a microscopic basis.<br>
  <br>
  Preparations were underway to attempt proper (differential)
  studies of inelastic scattering and some almost futile attempts
  had been made, when our work was terminated by an accident to the
  NRX high flux reactor which was the source of the neutrons we
  used. This occurred in November, 1952 and I did not resume actual
  experiments at NRX until the summer of 1954. Fortunately, I was
  invited to go to Brookhaven National Laboratory and was able to
  spend most of one year there with my family, returning to Deep
  River in February, 1954. The time was very profitable for me, I
  worked on several experiments, with collaborators and without.
  But I did not do any spectroscopic work though I met Donald
  Hughes and Harry Palevsky, now also thinking about inelastic
  scattering and in particular thinking about the "Cold Neutron" or
  (Beryllium) Filter-Chopper method. And I met Leon Van Hove and
  learned about the new generalized (time-dependent) correlations
  which Noel K. Pope and I were later to put to good use.<br>
  <br>
  After NRX was available to us again in August 1954, things
  progressed rapidly. Because of the efforts of David G. Henshaw
  and Jack Freeborn, we had metal monochromators of greatly
  improved efficiency compared with the NaCl crystals which we were
  using in 1952. Alec T. Stewart was rapidly getting the Be/Pb
  Filter-Chopper apparatus together and the primitive Triple-Axis
  spectrometer was functioning. So I was able to present a paper
  with substantial (if primitive) results at the New York meeting
  of the American Physical Society at the end of January, 1955.
  Publications followed soon after, in Physical Review and in the
  Canadian Journal of Research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956 we were able to complete the first true Triple-Axis
  crystal spectrometer, though only for operation at constant
  incoming energy. The flexibility of operation and the accuracy of
  the results were both greatly improved. The "Constant Q Method"
  was invented in 1958 and at about the same time a new apparatus
  allowing operation with variable incoming energy was installed at
  the new high-flux reactor NRU. (Ed Glaser and William McAlphin
  played crucial roles in these developments.) With the
  considerable improvements in both the neutron flux and the
  operating conditions afforded by NRU the subject entered a new
  phase in 1959. The Triple-Axis spectrometer thereby reached
  nearly full development. Visitors from other countries were now
  arriving to spend time working in the group. (The first such
  visitor was P.K. Iyengar from India who with several others
  became a life-long friend.) From about 1958 on the interest
  shifted, from the neutron physics and the methods and the
  validity of the theory, to the specific results and
  interpretation for the specific speciment material.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956 also Alec Stewart completed the Filter-Chopper apparatus.
  This was an equipment similar in general to that of Hughes and
  Palevsky; it was used in experiments on Aluminium and Vanadium,
  both chosen for the same good technical reasons that others chose
  to work on them. When Stewart left to become a professor at
  Dalhousie University I converted the instrument to the first
  "Rotating Crystal Spectrometer" - a bad choice of name as it
  should have been termed "Spinning Crystal". This instrument was
  used principally to study liquids and polycrystals, as was its
  improved successor at the NRU reactor.<br>
  <br>
  Three other major technological initiatives were taken. Filters
  of (large, perfect) single-crystals (quartz), preferably cooled
  to low temperatures, enabled major improvement in the ratio of
  slow neutrons to fast in the primary beam and thus in the signal
  to background ratio. The "Beryllium Detector" method was
  developed by enabling the Triple-Axis spectrometer to accept
  Beryllium polycrystalline filters in the scattered beam and thus,
  with incoming neutrons of variable energy, to get energy
  distributions in a different and sometimes advantageous manner -
  an inverse of the Filter-Chopper method. Finally profitable uses
  of the new material, pyrolitic graphite, were found - as filters
  and as crude monochromators.<br>
  <br>
  As time went on I began to receive invitations to attend
  Conferences and colloquia. In 1957 I made my first trip to
  England and Europe. Aside from several seminars, I gave a paper
  in September at a Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of
  Liquids; held in Varenna on Lago di Como in Italy. My last stop
  was at a gathering in Stockholm of neutron scattering people.
  After giving my paper on the first day I became ill with "flu"
  and spent the next few days of my trip to Europe in hospital.
  Nevertheless the trip was very inspirational and rewarding. In
  October 1960, this time accompanied by Dorie, I made another trip
  to Europe, and gave papers at two <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/index.html">IAEA</a> Conferences in Vienna. One
  of these was the first of the IAEA Conferences on Inelastic
  Scattering that played such a large role in the development of
  the subject.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 our group was joined by A.D.B. (David) Woods, who from
  then on was my closest collaborator. Numerous people spent
  periods of time in the group. Of these I must mention William
  Cochran who collobarated in the project to study the lattice
  vibrations in alkali halide crystals and in the course of this
  work developed his well-known "shell model" for the atoms in
  these and other crystals. Following this, his student from
  Cambridge University, Roger A. Cowley, commenced his own long
  association with the group. In 1961 Gerald Dolling arrived after
  studies at Cambridge and Harwell (with G. L. Squires); he is the
  only person among those mentioned who is still active in the
  group.<br>
  <br>
  Other colleagues at Chalk River and visistors there were
  important to my program. These included: I.L. (Dick) Fowler,
  Harris McCrady, Walther Woytowich, C.W. Crawford, C.E.L. Gingell,
  William Howell, G.R. DeMille, Guiseppe Caglioti, T. Arase, R.G.
  Johnson, K.R. Rao, M. Sakamoto, Hiroshi Watanable, Leo N. Becka,
  Roger N. Sinclair, B.A. Dasannacharya, R.H. (Bob) March, A.E.
  (Ted) Dixon, R. Sherman Weaver, J. Bergsman.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 I took up a position as Professor of Physics at McMaster
  University, in Hamilton, Ontario. The research program that I had
  embarked on eleven years before had been successful beyond
  expectations and the field was becoming well established. For
  over fifteen years it had been my intention to take up a
  University career and in my mid-forties it seemed that "now" was
  the time if I were to do so. McMaster had a "swimming-pool"
  reactor which promised to make the transition easier on the
  research side. For social reasons I preferred not to join a
  mega-university or live in a mega-city, partly because I thought
  that it would be better for our family of six children. Dorie was
  supportive of these ideas. So off we went in the summer of 1962,
  first to a house in Dundas and soon after to the house in
  Ancaster in which we still live.<br>
  <br>
  Chalk River had been very good to us. And now the Laboratory
  facilitated our transfer and encouraged my plans to continue a
  research program based at McMaster and to use the reactor there
  for training students and for preliminary work on experiments to
  be carried out at Chalk River. This arrangement was I think very
  successful all through the 1960s and early '70s and indeed has
  been carried on by others since that time. At McMaster a talented
  group of students put together a neutron diffractometer and a
  triple-axis instrument and these were available from 1965 on -
  and indeed are still in use. For the first years we used existing
  equipment at Chalk River but about 1971 we installed our own
  spectrometer at NRU and the smaller group now working with me
  used it (as did others) until I completely left neutron
  scattering about 1979.<br>
  <br>
  Deep River was also good to us. Five of our six children were
  born in Deep River Hospital. (Gordon Peter, Ian Bertram, James
  Christopher, Alice Elizabeth and Charles Leslie.) Our contacts
  with friends made then have remained deep. But there was one
  matter for distress - in babyhood Jamie developed hyperactive and
  autistic behaviour and in 1961 he was placed in Smith Falls
  Hospital School where he remained until, somewhat improved, we
  brought him home to Ancaster in 1967. He was sent to special
  schools in Hamilton; since then he has worked in a sheltered
  workshop. Of late years he has lived with other afflicted persons
  in a supervised apartment. Our other five children have all gone
  on to successful careers; Charles, a molecular biologist, is the
  only scientist among them. We now have eight grandchildren in
  four families.<br>
  <br>
              At McMaster I lived the normal life of a Professor of Physics. Each 
              year I usually taught two courses (mostly Solid State Physics, Thermodynamics 
              and Statistical Mechanics) and carried out the other duties required 
              of me. Eleven people won wheir Ph.D. degrees under my supervision: 
              S.H. Chen, J.M. Rowe, E.C. Svensson, S.C. Ng, A.P. Miller, E.D. 
              Hallman, J.R.D. Copley, A.P. Roy, W.A. Kamitakahara, H.C. Teh, A. 
              Larose. About half of them found their careers in neutron scattering. 
              The research of the group consisted of studies of the phonons in 
              crystals and their temperature behaviour, especially in single crystals 
              of metallic alloys. There were also several Master's projects, one 
              of which should be mentioned: the highly quantitative study by R.R. 
              Dymond of the reflective behaviour of maltreated copper monochromators. 
              The contributions of several other men should be mentioned, including 
              G.A. DeWit, William Scott, James Couper, E. Roger Cowley, A.K. Pant, 
              Jake Vanderwal and David Macdonald.<br>
  <br>
  But my greatest debt is to my wife of 46 years and my family,
  whose support and encouragement were indispensable and total. And
  following this, my colleagues and I owe gratitude to the
  technologists who engineered and maintained the reactors which
  provided the neutrons employed in the work - and to Don Hurst who
  introduced me to the subject - and to the National Research
  Council of Canada, who supported the program at McMaster over
  many years - and, finally, to the people of Canada, who supported
  all these and us.<br>
  <br>
  From 1960 on I suffered, at intervals of a few years, serious
  health problems of several varieties. These were kept under
  control by our medical allies and by the support of Dorie and our
  families. My work was not affected much in formal ways though
  undoubtedly some aspects did suffer. Throughout my career my
  father-in-law (Sidney L. Miller) maintained a cottage on Balsam
  Lake, north of Toronto; this was a considerable blessing for all
  of us. In addition we did a little camping from time to time,
  until I developed a bad back. And music - consert, opera, records
  - have always been part of our life.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1970s I gradually realigned my intellectual interests.
  One avenue I explored was what might loosely be termed
  "philosophy of physics". Another (intersecting) route was
  concerned with energy supply and the economics and ethics
  thereof. And there were others. In my explorations I entertained
  the hope that I would find some interesting niche in which to
  work. But I also realized the extreme importance of reaching
  general points of view, if this were at all possible. In this
  quest I struggled with new descriptions of the furniture of the
  world. Not much of what I sought was found and not much of that
  was made public - though I did give some seminars and some talks
  to service clubs and the like. Perhaps the new impetus to action,
  given by the amazing event of the Nobel Prize and its
  accompaniments, will move me on to produce something more
  well-defined.</p>
