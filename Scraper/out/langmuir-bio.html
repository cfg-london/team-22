  <h1>Irving Langmuir - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="langmuir.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Irving Langmuir</b> was born
  in Brooklyn, New York, on January 31, 1881, as the third of four
  sons of Charles Langmuir and Sadie, <i>ne&eacute;</i> Comings. His
  early education was obtained in various schools and institutes in
  the USA, and in Paris (1892-1895). He graduated as a
  metallurgical engineer from the School of Mines at Columbia
  University in 1903. Postgraduate work in Physical Chemistry
  under <a href="../1920/index.html">Nernst</a> in G&ouml;ttingen
  earned him the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D. in 1906.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to America, Dr. Langmuir became Instructor in Chemistry
  at Stevens
  Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, where he taught
  until July 1909. He then entered the Research Laboratory of the
  General Electric Company at Schenectady where he eventually
  became Associate Director.<br>
  <br>
  Langmuir's studies embraced chemistry, physics, and engineering
  and were largely the outgrowth of studies of vacuum phenomena. In
  seeking the atomic and molecular mechanisms of these he
  investigated the properties of adsorbed films and the nature of
  electric discharges in high vacuum and in certain gases at low
  pressures.<br>
  <br>
  His work on filaments in gases led directly to the invention of
  the gasfilled incandescent lamp and to the discovery of atomic
  hydrogen. He later used the latter in the development of the
  atomic hydrogen welding process.<br>
  <br>
  He was the first to observe the very stable adsorbed monatomic
  films on tungsten and platinum filaments, and was able, after
  experiments with oil films on water, to formulate a general
  theory of adsorbed films. He also studied the catalytic
  properties of such films.<br>
  <br>
  Langmuir's work on space charge effects and related phenomena led
  to many important technical developments which have had a
  profound effect on later technology.<br>
  <br>
  In chemistry, his interest in reaction mechanism caused him to
  study structure and valence, and he contributed to the
  development of the Lewis theory of shared electrons.<br>
  <br>
  Among the awards made to him were: Nichols Medal, (1915 and
  1920); Hughes Medal (1918); Rumford Medal (1921); Cannizzaro
  Prize (1925); Perkin Medal (1928); School of Mines Medal
  (Columbia University, 1929); Chardler Medal (1929); Willard Gibbs
  Medal (1930); Popular Science Monthly Award (1932); Nobel Prize
  in Chemistry (1932); Franklin Medal and Holly Medal (1934); John
  Scott Award (I937); "Modern Pioneer of Industry" (1940); Faraday
  Medal (1944); Mascart Medal (1950). In addition, he was a Foreign
  Member of the Royal Society of London, Fellow of the American
  Physical Society, Honorary Member of the British Institute of
  Metals, and of the Chemical Society (London). He had served as
  President of the American Chemical Society and as President of
  the American Association for the Advancement of Science.<br>
  <br>
  Honorary degrees were bestowed upon Langmuir by the following
  colleges and universities: Northwestern, Union, Edinburgh (Scotland), Columbia, Kenyon,
  Princeton, Lehigh, Harvard, Oxford, Johns Hopkins, Rutgers, Queens (Canada), and Stevens Institute
  of Technology.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Langmuir's hobbies were mountaineering, skiing, flying, and,
  most of all, to understand the mechanism of simple and familiar
  natural phenomena. He married Marion Mersereau in 1912. They had
  a son, Kenneth, and a daughter, Barbara. After a short illness,
  he died on August 16, 1957.</p>
