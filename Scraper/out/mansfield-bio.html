  <h1>Sir Peter Mansfield - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="mansfield.jpg" class="bio-img">
                I was born on 9th October 1933 in Lambeth, London, the youngest 
                of three brothers. I grew up in Camberwell, ten minutes walk from 
                Camberwell Green, the epicentre of the Borough. My father, Sidney 
                George Mansfield was the eldest son in a family of five sons and 
                four daughters.</p>
              <p>My father worked for the South Metropolitan 
                Gas Company, as a gas fitter. My mother, Rose Lillian, was the 
                youngest of three daughters. At the time of my birth she was not 
                working, but looked after me and my two brothers, Conrad William, 
                the eldest, and Sidney Albert.</p>
              <p><b>Outbreak of World War II</b><br>
                In September 1939 when war broke out I was nearly 6 years old 
                and my memory of this period is now hazy. However, I do recall 
                very clearly the first time the air raid siren sounded on the 
                day war was declared. I was playing in the street nearby and ran 
                home asking what the strange wailing sound was. In the months 
                that followed plans were instigated to evacuate all children from 
                the London area.</p>
              <p>I was evacuated from London on three occasions 
                during the war years. The first was a relatively short period 
                spent in Seven Oaks. Later I was sent to Torquay, Devon and stayed 
                with the Rowland family. During a lull in the air raids I came 
                back to London for approximately one year, then returned to Torquay 
                shortly after the commencement of the V2 bombardment of London 
                and was fortunate to be able to stay again with the Rowlands.</p>
              <p><b>Secondary education</b><br>
                Back in London after the war I was hurriedly told by my school 
                master that I should take the 11+ examination, something I had 
                never heard of before. There was no preparation because time was 
                too short. I took the exam and failed, but not completely. The 
                mark I received was not quite high enough to get me into the local 
                Grammar school, but it was sufficient for me to go to a Central 
                School in Peckham. However, this situation lasted for approximately 
                one year. Then all Secondary schools, in London at least, were 
                completely reorganized so that Central schools were dispensed 
                with altogether and pupils from Secondary schools and Central 
                schools were merged into new schooling arrangements which were 
                called Secondary Modern schools, (these were later renamed Comprehensive 
                schools, but after I had left).</p>
              <p><b>Rocket science</b><br>
                I left school at age 15 and started work as a printer's assistant. 
                This took me almost to the age of 18. Because I had developed 
                an interest in rocketry I applied for and obtained a job in the 
                then Ministry of Supply at the Rocket Propulsion Department in 
                Westcott, Buckinghamshire. I remained in this position for around 
                18 months and was called up for National Service to serve in the 
                army for two years, returning to Westcott after National Service 
                in 1954. I studied for Advanced Levels part time for approximately 
                two years and gained University entrance.</p>
              <p><b>University education</b><br>
                In 1956 I entered Queen Mary College, University of London. My 
                subject was Physics and in my third undergraduate year we were 
                given individual projects to pursue instead of the normal practical 
                laboratories which we had taken during the first two years of 
                the course. My individual topic was set by Dr Jack G Powles. 
                It was to build a portable NMR spectrometer to measure the earth's 
                magnetic field. This had been done previously using valve technology, 
                but my task was to build a transistorized version. I knew very 
                little about transistors at this time since it had not formed 
                any part of the electronics course that we had undergone in physics. 
                My experience was very much in valve technology. Nevertheless, 
                I enjoyed the project very much and of course learned a great 
                deal about transistors. Towards the end of my undergraduate studies 
                I was approached by Jack Powles, who offered me a position in 
                his research group working on NMR.</p>
              <p>At that time Jack Powles was a Reader in Physics 
                and I felt greatly honoured to be asked to join his research group. 
                Jack Powles' main interest then was in studying molecular motion 
                in a range of materials, mainly liquids. My task was to build 
                a pulsed NMR spectrometer to study solid polymer systems. It was 
                during this period that I discovered what we later called 'solid 
                echoes'. This was towards the end of my three year doctoral studies 
                and we were only able, therefore, to produce a short paper on 
                solid echoes observed in a single crystal of Gypsum.</p>
              <p><b>The American adventure</b><br>
                Towards the end of my studies I was asked whether I would be interested 
                in going to the United States for a short post-doctoral period. 
                Jack offered to arrange a position working with Professor Charlie 
                Slichter in the University of Illinois at Urbana, Illinois.</p>
              <p>I married my wife, Jean Margaret Kibble, on 
                1st September 1962 and we left to join the University of Illinois 
                in October 1962. Charlie and his first wife Nini met us at the 
                airport at Urbana-Champaign and installed us in what turned out 
                to be temporary post-graduate accommodation at Orchard Downs. 
                Orchard Downs was about two miles from the campus centre and was 
                therefore within walking distance, so I thought. Of course I had 
                not taken in to account the weather. In late October early November 
                the typical air temperature in early morning could reach minus 
                20 degrees Centigrade even though the skies above were clear blue. 
                I remember attempting to walk in one morning and I got roughly 
                half way to the campus when the frost began to effect me. I continued 
                to walk briskly and by the time I got to the Physics Department 
                my limbs were beginning to seize up with the cold. My eyelids 
                crunched when I blinked and I was extremely thankful that I managed 
                to get to the Department before anything serious happened.</p>
              <p>The research work that I was involved in during 
                my stay at Urbana was the NMR study of doped metals. A scientific 
                paper by Kohn and Vosko had predicted that conduction electron 
                scattering around zinc centres would behave in a periodic manner 
                so that the resonance shifts of copper atoms would vary in shells 
                around the zinc scattering centres and these shifts would be measurable 
                by looking for low amplitude side bands in the copper resonances 
                of the two copper isotopes. My task was first to build a double 
                resonance spectrometer capable of looking at the copper resonances 
                in a pulsed mode and secondly, to produce single crystals of doped 
                copper as suitable samples to be studied. Building the apparatus 
                was relatively straight forward since I had already built a pulsed 
                spectrometer back in London, but the production of a single crystal 
                of copper with sufficient surface area to give a measurable free 
                induction decay signal was a novel experience for me. It involved 
                growing a single crystal and slicing it into thin plates to give 
                sufficient surface area. The slicing process was done with an 
                electro-spark cutting process which left the surfaces severely 
                disturbed so that it was necessary to etch the damaged surfaces 
                away to reveal a clean undamaged surface.</p>
              <p>I worked as a post-doc for approximately two 
                years and made several samples and did many experiments on these 
                samples but could not see the predicted effect. But the experience 
                that I gained on this project and the knowledge and background 
                that I learnt during my stay in Illinois were invaluable.</p>
              <p>In Charlie Slichter's laboratory, I was not 
                able to pursue the solid echo work started in London, but a colleague 
                from Jack Powles' laboratory, Doug Cutler, who came over at roughly 
                the same time as we did was working with Professor Ted Rowland 
                in the Metallurgy Department at Urbana. The apparatus that Doug 
                Cutler was using was very similar to the equipment that I had 
                left behind in London. Towards the end of my stay in Urbana I 
                persuaded Doug Cutler to perform a couple of experiments for me 
                on pure aluminium powder. He was able to see solid echo effects 
                and I produced a short mainly theoretical paper extending the 
                theory of solid echoes to systems with spin greater than a half. 
                In the same paper I also included solid echo effects on the two 
                spin species system, NaF. My colleague, Dr John Strange (now Professor), 
                while working as a post-doc at Cornell University, also allowed 
                me to include some of his preliminary experimental data.</p>
              <p>While I was busy in the Physics Department 
                my wife took a post working in the University Health Centre as 
                a Secretary. She quickly made friends with a number of other secretaries 
                and introduced me to people with whom I would not otherwise have 
                come in contact. We saw her friends on several occasions and had 
                an enjoyable interaction with them. Of course we also interacted 
                with the Slichters and the other members of the group.</p>
              <p><b>The wanderers return</b><br>
                After the two year period we were sad to leave Urbana and the 
                various friends that we had made there during our stay. But we 
                were also pleased to return to London to see our respective parents 
                after such a long period away. I had been approached by Professor 
                Raymond Andrew while we were still in the States. He had recently 
                moved from Bangor to Nottingham and in a letter to me in July 
                or August of 1964 he wrote to offer me a Lectureship at the University 
                of Nottingham. I had had other offers including one from Jack 
                Powles who had recently taken the founding Professorship in Physics 
                at the University of Kent at Canterbury, however I decided that 
                I liked the offer from Nottingham and accepted. After several 
                weeks in London my wife and I made our way to Nottingham to meet 
                Professor Andrew and to take up his offer. I was still quite interested 
                in pursuing my earlier ideas developed during my PhD studies in 
                London and so I was given a room where I was able to set up equipment 
                to pursue my studies in multiple-pulse NMR.</p>
              <p><b>Life in Nottingham</b><br>
                I was extremely fortunate to be offered a Canadian research student
                   shortly after my arrival at Nottingham. His name was Don Ware
                   and he came from UBC in Canada. He had an MSc in NMR from
                  the  Chemistry Department at UBC. His MSc supervisor was Basil
                  Dunell.  Don had little experience in pulsed NMR but was keen
                  to learn  so I proposed that he build a pulsed NMR spectrometer
                  capable  of performing multiple-pulse experiments. This was
                  in 1964. A  year or so later Jack Powles came to Nottingham
                  to give a colloquium  talk in the Physics Department. Afterwards
                  he was shown around  the various research groups. By that time
                  Don and I had managed  to perform our first multiple-pulse
                  experiments and we were pleased  to demonstrate these results
                  to Jack. During the course of his  visit he said he thought
                  he had seen something similar from a  pre-print that he had
                  been sent by John Waugh from MIT. But he  wasn't sure whether
                  it was the same or not, and that he would  contact me when
                  he got back to Canterbury. A week or so later  a copy of John
                  Waugh's pre-print to Jack arrived on my desk. By  then I had
                  already drafted a letter of our own which was duly  sent off
                  for publication to Physics Letters. Our paper was published
                   shortly after John Waugh's paper and its appearance triggered
                   a period of inter-group squabbling that continued on up to
                  the  early 70's.</p>
              <p>In 1972 Dr Alan Garroway, an American post-doc, 
                joined my group to study multi-pulse techniques. He had carried 
                out his PhD studies at Cornell University. His work had been concerned 
                with using NMR to study fluid flow. He and his first wife, Mary 
                (now deceased), arrived in February 1972, and on the day they 
                arrived we invited them to dinner, but the country was in the 
                grip of a series of electricity power cuts so that Alan and Mary's 
                first experience of Britain was a candle lit dinner. Earlier in 
                1971 I had received an SRC research grant to pursue multi-pulse 
                NMR and included in the equipment support was money for a mini-computer. 
                I had, therefore, purchased a Honeywell computer with 4 k bytes 
                of magnetic memory and had spent quite a bit of the summer of 
                1971 adapting the machine so that we could connect it to the experimental 
                apparatus in a computer controlled mode. One of the first things 
                that Alan was engaged in was the implementation of the Cooley-Tukey 
                fast Fourier transform algorithm so that transient signals could 
                be rapidly captured and transformed into a spectrum. This work 
                was very successful and later in 1972 we were regularly using 
                the computer controlled spectrometer to study the response of 
                a number of suitable compounds including Calcium Fluoride. Computerization 
                of the NMR spectrometer meant that we were able to pop specimens 
                in for extremely rapid analysis and as a result we quickly ran 
                out of suitable compounds to study with interesting chemical shift 
                anisotropies. It was at this point in early summer of 1972 that 
                I started to think seriously about applications of the line narrowing 
                process.</p>
              <p><b>The birth of MRI</b><br>
                In those days coffee and tea breaks were taken in the tea room 
                of the Physics Department. It was an opportunity for members of 
                staff and students, sometimes in different research groups, to 
                interact and exchange ideas. On this occasion all other people 
                had left the tea room except for me, Alan Garroway and my student 
                Peter Grannell. We had exhausted all the readily available materials 
                for studying chemical shift anisotropy. Among the results that 
                we had obtained was an extreme elongation of the free induction 
                decay of Fluorine in a single crystal of Calcium Fluoride. It 
                suddenly occurred to me that by removing the dipole-dipole interaction 
                in Calcium Fluoride it ought to be possible, at least theoretically, 
                to look at the atomic structure of Fluorine by imposing an external 
                magnetic field gradient. Alan, who had worked with gradients during 
                his PhD studies, was skeptical, but Peter Grannell was more amenable 
                to the idea. I rushed away from this meeting and wrote up several 
                pages of calculations showing the theoretical possibilities and 
                handed them to Peter Grannell. Peter was in the last year of his 
                PhD studies which finished formally on the 1st October 1972. We 
                had already discussed the possibility of him staying on as a post-doc 
                and I suggested that one of the topics he should work on was NMR 
                diffraction studies along the lines of the calculations I had 
                already produced.</p>
              <p><b>Alt Heidelberg du Feine</b><br>
                I had also made arrangements for sabbatical leave to work in Professor 
                Karl Hausser's group in Heidelberg starting in October 1972. My 
                family and I left for Heidelberg in late September 1972 with the 
                plan that Peter and I would continue to interact via post while 
                he prepared to do some experiments on NMR diffraction. I had already 
                decided that there were extremely difficult problems to overcome 
                using real single crystals of Calcium Fluoride and that a simulated 
                approach was called for initially. In this approach a model lattice 
                was to be constructed with several plates of camphor separated 
                by thin sheets of plastic. Although a solid, camphor contains 
                a large number of highly mobile protons which rotate to give a 
                relatively narrow absorption line. The sheets separating the camphor 
                plates contained far fewer mobile protons which gave virtually 
                no signal component to the free induction decay. Our first experimental 
                results were obtained as early as November 1972, and they showed 
                the diffraction effects when the magnetic field gradient was switched 
                on. When the gradient was turned off a single absorption line 
                shape was observed with no splitting. After repeating these results 
                many times during the early part of 1973, the results were written 
                up for presentation at the First Specialized Colloque Ampère in 
                Krakow, Poland in September 1973. At the same time a more formal 
                publication was submitted to the Journal of Physics, C which appeared 
                in November 1973.</p>
              <p><b>Journey to Krakow</b><br>
                My wife and I made the long journey to Krakow by coach stopping 
                overnight in Leibzig. My talk at the Conference was scheduled 
                as the first invited lecture entitled "Multi-pulse Line Narrowing 
                Experiments: NMR Diffraction in Solids?". My recollection is that 
                the paper was well received and created some discussion afterwards. 
                One person in the resulting discussion asked if I was aware of 
                similar work that had been carried out by Professor Paul Lauterbur. 
                In fact I was completely unaware and asked where I might find 
                this work. I also asked whether it was concerned with imaging 
                in solids and was told that it was not, that it was concerned 
                with imaging of water in test tubes. The person raising the matter 
                was none other than my old sparring partner, Professor John Waugh. 
                When I returned to England I looked up the relevant publication 
                in the library and decided that the approaches though completely 
                different were not entirely unrelated. The paper by Paul Lauterbur 
                had been published several months earlier in the year. But there 
                were several concerns that I had concerning Paul's approach to 
                imaging liquids and indeed our own approach to imaging in solids. 
                The first which applied to both techniques, was the question of 
                defining an active slice of material. In the case of Paul's work 
                he had used the method of projection reconstruction to obtain 
                an image and in that technique a large number of experiments needed 
                to be conducted in order to extricate the image with reasonable 
                resolution. This took valuable time. In my own approach my first 
                concern was the complication of producing images from multi-pulse 
                experiments. There was also the question of defining a slice. 
                We very soon decided that the pursuit of imaging in solids was 
                perhaps ahead of its time and could be deferred for future work. 
                It would be so much easier to look at biological specimens where 
                the relaxation times were shorter and where the line widths were 
                generally speaking narrower.</p>
              <p><b>Passage to India</b><br>
                Early in 1974 a number of colleagues from the Physics Department 
                travelled to India for an International Conference on NMR. Among 
                these were Dr Bill Moore and Raymond Andrew's post-doc, Dr Waldo 
                Hinshaw. At this conference Paul Lauterbur gave a talk on his 
                work on imaging which created some excitement and provoked quite 
                a bit of discussion among the Nottingham group during their return 
                flight to England. Shortly afterwards they conceived a different 
                approach to imaging which was called the "sensitive point" method 
                of imaging. By applying time dependent magnetic field gradients 
                along two orthogonal axes they were able to define a point volume 
                of the specimen which could be swept thereby interrogating the 
                whole plane, point by point, to produce an image. Inevitably this 
                was an extremely slow process.</p>
              <p><b>The slice of life</b><br>
                I was still very much concerned with imaging speed and also the 
                question of sliced definition. After a lot of thought and discussion 
                with Peter Grannell we came up with a method of slice selection 
                which looked as though it might work reasonably well. Alan Garroway 
                also came up with a different method of slice selection using 
                a string of short pulses to define the slice and between us we 
                thought that the sensible approach would be to combine our efforts 
                and publish a short note on the general technique of slice selection. 
                This was sent to the Journal of Physics and was published in the 
                form of a letter. The question of imaging times was still concerning 
                me and during the course of 1974 I spent a great deal of time 
                turning over my thoughts on how this may be achieved. One way 
                forward was what I called line scan imaging. In this method a 
                line of magnetization in a specimen was selectively excited and 
                read out. This process was repeated until the object had been 
                scanned. The technique was much faster than the sensitive point 
                scan method of Hinshaw and also turned out to be faster than the 
                projection reconstruction method of Paul Lauterbur, but I was 
                still not satisfied. Nevertheless, line scanning was used to produce 
                a number of images and in particular it was used to scan the finger 
                of one of my early research students, Dr Andrew Maudsley. The 
                scan times for these finger images were 15-23 minutes. These were 
                the first images of a live human subject and were presented at 
                a special meeting of the Medical Research Council which was convened 
                in 1976 to review the work of the several imaging groups that 
                had sprung up both at Nottingham and also in Aberdeen. All groups 
                were vying for MRC support and this meeting was called specially 
                to review the topic and to decide how best to support the work. 
                The images demonstrating live human anatomy were annotated by 
                Professor Rex Coupland, then head of the Department of Human Morphology. 
                They produced a startling response at this meeting and convinced 
                the MRC that our work should be supported. We produced a grant 
                application requesting a substantial sum of money to produce a 
                whole body MRI machine.</p>
              <p>The application was handed to Professor Andrew 
                for his comments before sending it off to MRC. In fact the application 
                was delayed by a month or so with no comment or explanation. However 
                I learnt subsequently that Raymond Andrew himself had already 
                sent in a research grant application to MRC and he had decided 
                that he should wait until he had received a decision from MRC 
                before allowing my application to go forward. His application, 
                which was granted, was concerned with building an intermediate 
                size imaging machine with a sample access diameter of about 10 
                cm. The intention was to establish an intermediate step between 
                the small scale approaches that we had already demonstrated and 
                the whole body machine which I was keen to press on with. My grant 
                application was sent in subsequently and considered at the following 
                round of grants. The application was successful and the result 
                was announced in 1977.</p>
              <p>The delay in the submission of my MRC grant 
                created some acrimony which continued in one form or another for 
                several years until Raymond took early retirement and left for 
                the University of Florida in 1984. During this period strife within 
                the Andrew group occurred when Bill Moore decided that he wanted 
                to split his imaging activities away from Raymond's group. This 
                occurred in the late 70's when a whole body magnet was obtained 
                with a grant from the Wolfson Foundation and Bill Moore together 
                with Neil Holland decided that the results of this new work should 
                be independently managed. Thus a period of internecine squabbling 
                broke out between Raymond Andrew's remaining group, which included 
                Dr Paul Bottomley and a member of staff, Dr Peter Allen, who was 
                loosely associated, and the third group headed by Bill Moore. 
                After a while, under this new regime, matters began to settle 
                down again in a quasi steady state. </p>
              <p><b>Blacksburg</b><br>
                Dr Peter Morris, who in 1977 had just finished his PhD studies 
                on multi-pulse NMR in solids and liquid crystals, stayed on at 
                Nottingham as a post-doc for two years or so. This occurred at 
                approximately the time when the MRC funding was granted. He together 
                with Dr Ian Pykett were heavily involved in the installation of 
                our first 0.1 T electro-magnet and subsequent RF and gradient 
                coil designs. We had all been working flat out to get a large 
                scale image in time for the ENC Meeting in Blacksburg, Virginia 
                in April 1978. In the event, the night before we were due to fly 
                out, I volunteered to climb into the machine for an attempt at 
                imaging my abdomen.</p>
              <p>Just a day or so before, I had received a 
                typewritten draft of a piece from Professor Tom Budinger of the 
                University of California at San Francisco suggesting that the 
                gradient levels and switching rate that we were proposing to use 
                to produce my abdominal image, were potentially dangerous. I personally 
                did not believe the calculations and had performed alternative 
                calculations which suggested that the expected induced transient 
                currents flowing in response to the gradient switching were much 
                lower than those predicted by Tom.</p>
              <p>I climbed into the machine and signaled to 
                Peter and Ian to push the button for a single pulse. There was 
                an audible crack but I felt nothing. I then signaled to start 
                the scan. The magnet was enclosed in aluminium sheeting forming 
                an RF screen. Due to lack of time there was no light inside. I 
                was therefore clamped in the magnet vertically and in pitch darkness 
                for 50 minutes until the procedure was completed. Our wives and 
                fiancées were present ready to haul me out of the magnet in an 
                emergency, but the whole experiment went well and images were 
                recorded. Photographs of the raw images were taken, but the film 
                was processed in a local store in the USA a day or so before the 
                presentation. </p>
              <p><b>Trouble ahead</b><br>
                During the early 80's there were growing difficulties within the 
                University of Nottingham concerned mainly with the promotional 
                prospects in the various departments on campus. This meant that 
                aspiring members of staff were being artificially held back because 
                of arbitrary constraints introduced by the government of the day 
                and forced upon the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Basil Weedon. These 
                constraints induced a feeling of great uncertainly throughout 
                the University which was heightened when calls were made to introduce 
                an early retirement scheme in order to reduce the over staffing 
                levels that were considered extant in many Departments. These 
                considerations produced a rash of requests for early retirement 
                which in some cases carried a substantial early retirement premium 
                especially for younger members of staff. In the exodus that followed 
                the Department of Physics lost four members of staff to early 
                retirement. These were Professor Andrew, Dr Moore, Dr Peter Allen 
                and Dr Bill Derbyshire. Dr Moore went to the United States to 
                take up a Professorship at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in 
                Boston, Massachusetts. Dr Allen went to the University of British 
                Colombia in Canada to set up a medical imaging group there and 
                Dr Derbyshire took a Senior Lectureship at Sunderland Polytechnic. 
                Sadly Dr Moore collapsed and died while playing tennis approximately 
                six months after taking up his new position. Raymond Andrew died 
                of cancer in 2001 at the age of 78. Dr Peter Allen successfully 
                created his own MRI group and continues to research his particular 
                interests in medical imaging. Dr Derbyshire later took a position 
                working with Rank-Hovis and is now retired.</p>
              <p>With all these staff changes occurring over 
                a 1-2 year period, my group was the only one in MRI to survive 
                in Physics at Nottingham. In fact in 1984, I myself was courted 
                to return to the States with no fewer than three offers, from 
                the University of Alabama, University of Illinois at Urbana and 
                the University of Maddison, Wisconsin. I decided to stay at Nottingham 
                despite the attractive offers. </p>
              <p><b>A new start</b><br>
                Shortly after my return to Nottingham, I received a call from 
                the Department of Health telling me that there was some funding 
                available to purchase a 0.5 T superconductive magnet - was I interested? 
                I accepted immediately and later in 1984/5 the magnet arrived 
                and was installed in a small extension of the Physics Department. 
                These events helped to settle me firmly in Nottingham and removed 
                all doubts I may have had about moving elsewhere.</p>
              <p>I had been greatly concerned about our proposals 
                to use the 0.5 T magnet for EPI. My major worry was whether rapid 
                magnetic gradient switching within the close confines of the magnet 
                would induce the static magnetic field to quench. I had been thinking 
                seriously about the problem for several months prior to the arrival 
                of the magnet, but with no clear solution in mind when it arrived. 
                Shortly after installation of the magnet, I recall rushing down 
                to the laboratory in great excitement to announce to my post-doc, 
                Dr Barry Chapman, that I believed I had solved the magnetic problem 
                by introducing a magnetic screen between the gradient coil and 
                the inner bore of the static magnet. The idea was that the screen, 
                itself, would be another coil designed to make the total magnetic 
                flux from the screen and the primary gradient coil zero beyond 
                the screen, thereby removing any interaction between the gradient 
                coil and the magnet.</p>
              <p>We hurriedly put together some calculations 
                and filed the idea as a Patent. Meanwhile, Dr Robert Turner, who 
                had joined my research group to learn about MRI in general and 
                EPI in particular, had been thinking about the problem from a 
                different view point, using a so-called annealing algorithm, but 
                without success. I mentioned my approach to him and within three 
                months or so, he together with Dr Roger Bowley, a theoretician 
                in Physics, had come up with a much more rigorous mathematical 
                analysis of my idea. This material was added to the Patent within 
                the one year allowed before final filing. So active magnetic screening 
                was born and quickly applied to the development of EPI at Nottingham. 
                Once published active magnetic screening was rapidly taken up 
                by the MRI industry and forms the basis of all commercial MRI 
                machines today.</p>
              <p><b>The golden era</b><br>
                The 10 year period from 1980-1990 was exceptionally fruitful in 
                terms of research output, development and medical applications 
                of high speed imaging. Considerable effort was put into the implementation 
                of EPI, initially by two research students, Roger Ordidge and 
                Richard Rzedzian (now deceased), then later by several other students 
                including David Guilfoyle and Mark Doyle. While this was going 
                on, other work continued in non-medical applications of MRI principally 
                by Stephen Blackband and Richard Bowtell. Other types of whole 
                body imaging were tried out by Volker Bangert, a German student 
                from Berlin who had a grant from the Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst. 
                The major effort made in EPI produced increasingly better images 
                as a result of further work carried out by research students Martin 
                Cawley and Alistaire Howseman. Whole body EPI work with a series 
                of patients became possible with the help of Dr Michael Stehling, 
                a medical graduate from Germany who came to Nottingham, initially 
                as a visitor with a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 
                but later decided to stay on to study for a PhD in MRI.</p>
              <p>By the end of the 80's the quality of EPI 
                data had improved dramatically so that most regions of the human 
                body could be studied rapidly, bringing relief to many patients. 
                It was at about this time that Dr Penny Gowland joined the group 
                and made substantial contributions to our work on foetal imaging.</p>
              <p>This was the end of a Golden Era in the development 
                of MRI at Nottingham. There were, of course, further developments 
                well into the 1990's and beyond including the trial experiments 
                using EVI at 0.5 T, carried out by Paul Harvey, and at 3.0 T, 
                carried out by Paul Glover, Ron Coxon and Jonathan Hyking.</p>
              <p>Following my retirement in 1994 from teaching 
                in the University, I continued my research activities both at 
                the University and with the help of my small company, General 
                Magnetic. Our main interest has been concerned with MRI safety 
                matters. In particular we have tried to reduce the acoustic noise 
                levels generated by the gradient coils when pulsed in EPI. This 
                work, started in the University by Joanna Beaumont and Ron Coxon, 
                has subsequently been further developed by Dr Barry Chapman, and 
                my son in law, Brett Haywood.</p>
              <p>Another safety issue also related to gradient 
                coils is the unwelcome level of electric field that naturally 
                accompanies high levels of changing magnetic field. Electric fields 
                are responsible for neural stimulation induced in patients when 
                being imaged. Currents flowing within the patient may induce peripheral 
                muscular twitch for relatively mild stimulation levels. However, 
                for larger and faster gradients applied to the thorax, induced 
                cardiac fibrillation is a real and serious danger. This aspect 
                of our work is a joint venture between the University of Nottingham 
                and General Magnetic and involves Professor Roger Bowley and Brett 
                Haywood.</p>
              <p>None of the work in MRI could have been achieved 
                without the enthusiasm and dedicated support of a highly motivated 
                team of technical and academic staff, research students and post-docs 
                sustained over the period from 1972 - to the present day. I wish 
                also to thank my three secretaries, Mary Newsum-Smith, Lesley 
                Key and Pamela Davies for their unstinting help and the patience 
                shown to me over the course of a long and exciting career. Last, 
                but no means least, I would like to thank my wife, Jean, and my 
                family for their unfailing and unswerving support during the good 
                as well as the not so good times.</p>
