  <h1>Adolf Butenandt - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="butenandt.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Adolf Frederick Johann
  Butenandt</b> was born on March 24, 1903 at
  Bremerhaven-Weserm&uuml;nde. The son of a business man Otto
  Butenandt of Hamburg, he went to school at Bremerhaven and
  studied chemistry at the Universities of Marburg and G&ouml;ttingen.
  In 1927 he graduated at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where
  he had studied under <a href="../1928/index.html">Adolf
  Windaus.</a><br>
  <br>
  From 1927 until 1930 he was Scientific Assistant at the Institute
  of Chemistry, G&ouml;ttingen, and from 1931 until 1933 he was
  Privatdozent in the Department of Biological Chemistry at the
  University of G&ouml;ttingen and acting Head of the laboratories
  for organic and inorganic chemistry. He then became Professor
  Ordinarius and Director of the Institute for Organic Chemistry at
  the Institute of Technology at Danzig, a post which he held until
  1936.<br>
  <br>
  From 1936 until 1960 he was Professor in the University of Berlin
  and Director of the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry,
  Berlin-Dahlem, which later moved to T&uuml;bingen and then to
  Munich. From 1945 until 1956 he was Professor of Physiological
  Chemistry at T&uuml;bingen and in 1956 he became Professor of
  Physiological Chemistry in the University of
  Munich. From 1956 until 1960 he was Director of the Institute
  of Physiological Chemistry in the University of Munich.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1960 he has been President of the Max Planck Society at
  Munich.<br>
  <br>
  Butenandt's name will always be associated with his work on sex
  hormones, for which he was awarded, jointly with Leopold Ruzicka,
  the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for 1939. In 1929 he isolated
  oestrone in pure, crystalline form, almost at the same time that
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1943/index.html">E.A. Doisy</a> did
  this in America. In 1931 he isolated androsterone in pure,
  crystalline form. From androsterone he as well as Ruzicka,
  independently of each other, obtained testosterone in 1939, a
  compound which had been obtained from the testes in 1935 by Ernst
  Laqueur. Progesterone was isolated by Butenandt from the corpus
  luteum in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to these researches, Butenandt carried out much
  investigation of the interrelationships of the sex hormones and
  on the possible carcinogenic properties of some of them. His work
  on the sex hormones was largely responsible for the production of
  cortisone on a large scale.<br>
  <br>
  A great number of honours and distinctions was bestowed upon him.
  He was awarded several medals and prizes from Germany, France,
  Sweden and England, he received the Grand Cross for Federal
  Services with Star (1959), he holds six honorary doctorates
  (Munich, Graz, Leeds, Madrid and two from T&uuml;bingen) and is
  Freeman of the city of Bremerhaven. He is corresponding member of
  the Academy of Sciences at G&ouml;ttingen, honorary life member
  of the New York
  Academy of Sciences, and honorary member of the Japanese
  Biochemical Society, the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher
  Leopoldina, Halle, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  He married Erika Ziegner in 1931; they have seven children and
  live at Munich-Obermenzing.</p>
