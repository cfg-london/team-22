  <p><img src="steinbeck.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John Steinbeck</b> (1902-1968), born in
  Salinas, California, came from a family of moderate means. He
  worked his way through college at Stanford University
  but never graduated. In 1925 he went to New York, where he tried
  for a few years to establish himself as a free-lance writer, but
  he failed and returned to California. After publishing some
  novels and short stories, Steinbeck first became widely known
  with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), a series of humorous stories
  about Monterey <i>paisanos.</i><br>
  <br>
  Steinbeck's novels can all be classified as social novels dealing
  with the economic problems of rural labour, but there is also a
  streak of worship of the soil in his books, which does not always
  agree with his matter-of-fact sociological approach. After the
  rough and earthy humour of <i>Tortilla Flat,</i> he moved on to
  more serious fiction, often aggressive in its social criticism,
  to <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), which deals with the strikes
  of the migratory fruit pickers on California plantations. This
  was followed by <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), the story of the
  imbecile giant Lennie, and a series of admirable short stories
  collected in the volume <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). In 1939 he
  published what is considered his best work, <i>The Grapes of
  Wrath,</i> the story of Oklahoma tenant farmers who, unable to
  earn a living from the land, moved to California where they
  became migratory workers.<br>
  <br>
  Among his later works should be mentioned <i>East of Eden</i>
  (1952), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), and
  <i>Travels with Charley</i> (1962), a travelogue in which
  Steinbeck wrote about his impressions during a three-month tour
  in a truck that led him through forty American states. He died in
  New York City in 1968.</p>
