  <h1>Roy J. Glauber - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="glauber.jpg" class="bio-img">What is it that makes a dedicated scientist out of a kid with
 an everyday background? Is it the ungovernable forces that
 seem to shape all our lives, or is it the development of our own
 curiosity and tastes that tips the balance of randomness? I've
 always been puzzled by those questions and can't claim to
 have found serious answers. Perhaps these recollections will reveal
 one, even if it escapes me as I write.</p>
   
  
     
 <p>To be a traveling salesman in the 1920's gave one possession
 of a company-owned car, acquaintance with a potentially vast area
 of the country, and a slightly better income than one would earn
 within the tight confines of New York City. My father, having
 enjoyed some experience with that life before getting married in
 1924, couldn't wait to get back on the road, a possibility
 he had to postpone for about three years until his wife and new-born
 son, at last aged two, were ready to travel. The itinerant life
 was a restless one and quite disconnected. After long hours spent
 driving through endless farmlands we would stay overnight
 at the houses of farmers who had hung the sign &quot;Tourists-Vacancy&quot; near
 the road &ndash; never two successive nights in the same house.
 That was long before the days of roadside motels. Even hotels were
 scarce in some of the small towns we visited. Rural electrification
 was not yet a reality and I became quite accustomed to the smells
 of illumination by kerosene and acetylene lamps, as well as all
 the odors of barnyards and outdoor plumbing.</p>
     
 <p>The periods in which my father was visiting customers, in whatever
 small town we were passing through posed a problem for my mother.
 Trained as an elementary school teacher, but pregnant before she
 had begun teaching, she was determined to make these passages as
 instructive for me as she could. The most interesting place in
 each town, as well as I could make out, was the fire department.
 We received guided tours of their living quarters and fire engines
 all over the Midwest. Where fire departments were lacking, visits
 to assorted courtrooms, police departments and even local lockups
 would do for my introduction to civics.</p>
     
 <p>In one Cleveland hotel room when I was four, we actually had
 a radio. It occupied a wooden cabinet about the size of a steamer
 trunk. I remember insisting there must be a man inside it. He had
 given his name as Maurice Chevalier. Discovering that the cabinet
 top was hinged, I opened it and can still feel my bafflement at
 discovering within it only a few glowing radio tubes.</p>

    Life on the road. Standing on the bumper of my father's
      car, Ohio, 1930.
  
</p>
 <p>The 1929 market crash had an immediate impact for me. The company
 my father was working for failed and the car we had been using
 was repossessed. The result was my first ride on a train, an exciting
 experience that there was no occasion to repeat, once my father
 had another job and a most imposing new car, a Marmon, a kind of
 Cadillac of its day, and one of many brands destined for early
 extinction.</p>
     
 <p>The arrival of a baby sister in 1931 and my need to begin school
 meant that we had somehow to settle down. My folks decided we would
 return to New York, but the only way to do it, under the circumstances,
 was for our family to move into a crowded apartment in upper Manhattan
 with my father's mother and aunt. It was quite a shock, moving
 there from the wide-open expanses of the middle west, to sit in
 the crowded classrooms of an ancient school building. I had had
 very little experience playing with other kids in the small towns
 we had visited, and had no idea how to deal with the crowds of
 kids who managed somehow to play on the concrete sidewalks and
 in the adjoining gutters.</p>
     
 <p>My mother was talented at crafts of various sorts. She sewed
 and embroidered well and, though untrained, she sketched and
 painted quite skillfully. She encouraged me to draw as soon
 as I could hold pencils or crayons steadily. That was the beginning
 of my career as a creative artist, specializing in speeding trains,
 airplanes and the occasional dirigible. It was a necessary release
 from the need to get fresh air by playing on the sidewalks.</p>
     
 <p>After one school year in Manhattan, we found an apartment in
 Sunnyside, an attractive area of Queens, and moved there in 1932.
 It was a kind of deliverance. The neighborhood was spacious
 and not yet fully built up. It consisted largely of modest
 single family houses that all had at least a small area devoted
 to yards or gardens. All the blocks of individual houses and even
 our apartment building had central areas of lawn with space for
 children to play &ndash; not withstanding all the &quot;Please keep off the
 grass&quot; signs.
 There were even vacant lots with tiny hills and semi-permanent
 puddles that lent excitement to the four daily treks to and from
 school.</p>
 <p>Sunnyside's residents consisted mostly of young families,
 quite a few contending with the unemployment so widespread
 in those depression years. The building for Public School 150 however
 was clean, well lit, and quite new. Its teachers were mostly young
 and optimistic, a vigorous contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed
 more generally in the country. The school's annual Christmas
 play, written by the fifth and sixth graders in 1932 was entitled, &quot;Santa's
 Depression.&quot; It depicted Santa Claus as being broke, and
 unable to afford to make his usual rounds, until everyone pitched
 in to help him out. In the same period there were demonstrations
 against foreclosures on home mortgages going on in the neighborhood
 streets. Those depression years cast a long shadow over the lives
 of children no less than their parents.</p>
     
 <p>My earlier years had left me with no experience in sports of
 any kind so it wasn't easy discovering how to engage in outdoor
 exercise. Unlike Manhattan, however, Sunnyside had many residential
 streets with little traffic. The best solution to my exercise problem
 was roller skating &ndash; with steel-wheeled skates that clamped
 to one's everyday shoes. Those steel wheels were quite noisy
 rolling or scraping on concrete, notwithstanding their good ball
 bearings, and I wore down to those very bearings many a set of
 skate wheels, cruising the neighborhood streets.</p>
     
 <p>Electricity mystified me throughout childhood and I vividly remember
 once at age seven trying to see what it was all about. Plugging
 lamp cords into wall sockets must lead to the flow of something
 through those wires, but whatever it was, one never got to see
 it before it was swallowed up by the lamp. One morning I awoke
 early, determined to catch sight of it. I screwed the wires of
 a short length of lamp cord into a male plug and inserted it into
 a wall socket, leaving free the frayed wires at the other end.
 There was a bright blue flash at that end, accompanied by a muffled
 bang. That was followed by silence, till my parents awoke and began
 wondering why none of the light switches seemed to be working.
 The fuse was easily replaced, but I never overcame my surprise
 that what passed so silently through slender wires could behave
 so aggressively.</p>
     
 <p>My most interesting projects were the ones I could pursue indoors
 like building models of contemporary airplanes of all shapes and
 of ships and locomotives. I had no cash allowance to spend on such
 projects and so was wholly dependent on gifts of construction kits
 from uncles and aunts. When those were scarce, as they sometimes
 were, I ventured into other areas, attempting to use crate
 wood to construct the projects suggested in various instruction
 books written for young boys. The most interesting of these projects
 usually failed, and I began to conclude the authors could never
 themselves have really built the exciting things they were describing.
 Their version of a guitar, for example, fashioned from a cigar
 box and some cheese box wood never had the rigidity to permit stretching
 a guitar string tightly enough. My guitar looked a bit like one
 but couldn't sound a single note.</p>
     
 <p>There were other failures, many of them, but each brought new
 experience in the use of hand tools. An uncle, to encourage
 this construction bent, presented me with a three-year subscription
 to Popular Mechanics magazine. That magazine, besides celebrating
 all of the mechanical wonders of the age, included brief plans
 for all sorts of home projects: door chimes, folding tables, towel
 racks, bookends and knife sharpeners. The subscription did a great
 deal to keep my interest in mechanical things alive, but I can't
 say I ever succeeded in building any of those worthy projects.
 And I doubt that anyone who didn't have a machine shop at
 his disposal ever did either.</p>
     
 <p>All the sawing, drilling and sanding I was doing at home left
 little time for drawing and painting, but there was ample opportunity
 to pursue those interests in school. Tempera paints were available
 there, a certain amount of free time, and a good deal of encouragement
 from the teachers, who felt a need to keep the backs of their classrooms
 decorated with mural paintings executed by the kids. They were
 painted over large areas of brown wrapping paper that covered the
 rear blackboards. I enjoyed designing those huge works and loved
 the freedom painting them gave me from sitting at my classroom
 desk.</p>

    My cover for the PS 150, Queens, NY School Magazine, December 1935.
  
</p>
 <p>The school produced a magazine every term and when my design
 for the cover of the Christmas 1935 issue was accepted, I felt
 like the Michelangelo of the fifth grade. In fact I did have some
 involvement with sculpture as well. Small carvings in soap, greatly
 encouraged by the Procter and Gamble Corporation, were a medium
 of the day, and I made many of them, mostly of musicians playing
 instruments. But a more conventional medium was Plasticine clay,
 which remains permanently soft. Those sculptures tended not to
 last long, but we managed, with a teacher, to take a few to a real
 sculptor's studio, and I was fascinated there to learn to
 make plaster molds and permanent castings.</p>
     
 <p>If I was fully determined in the fifth and sixth grades to become
 an artist of one sort or another, it was not without a certain
 note of caution. My uncle, Sam Adler, was a gifted artist who had
 not yet succeeded in selling any of his work, nor did those years
 seem to promise that he ever would. His advice to me was that becoming
 an artist was an excellent idea, provided my motivation was so
 strong as to leave no alternative. I began then to feel that my
 artwork was not spontaneous enough, that if I were a true artist
 I shouldn't have to think so hard before even starting drawings;
 they should just pour out more instinctively. My involvement with
 art receded to a hobby.</p>
     
 <p>The years in which the depression lingered must have been difficult
 ones for the owners of apartment buildings. Faced with many vacancies,
 they offered rent-free months and other incentives to new
 tenants, so there was always a certain degree of restlessness among
 the city's apartment dwellers. In 1936, when I was ten, my
 parents decided that the higher ground of the Bronx &ndash; and
 the top floor of a six story apartment house &ndash; would be a
 better place to live than the flat sea-level expanse of Long
 Island. A precipitous increase of the local population density
 went with that move, and it became once again impossible for me
 or my sister to spend much time outdoors, in the streets. My first
 salvation was reading. I visited the local public library regularly
 and began reading the great adventure stories of Jules Verne, Alexander
 Dumas and Walter Scott. The junior high school I went to seemed
 mired in a curriculum too timid to do anything serious, and altogether
 flat-footed at what it did undertake. Mathematics, I remember,
 consisted of memorizing the decimal equivalents of the familiar &quot;business
 fractions&quot; and doing compound interest calculations out longhand.
 I was so put off by those lessons I occasionally got failing grades.
 Our premature introduction to French required our memorizing a
 list of proverbs which didn't literally translate into their
 English counterparts.</p>
     
 <p>That junior high school experience was typified by what was called &quot;music
 appreciation&quot; in the auditorium assemblies. The principal,
 a Mr. Snyder, had himself written words to accompany several dozen
 themes of the great works of music. Singing his rhyming words he
 evidently felt, set to the themes of the great composers, should
 imprint those masterpieces on our young memories. Indeed they
 did, but it was at the expense of burdening those themes permanently
 with his infernal doggerel.</p>
     
 <p>But that school did offer my first exposure to science and it
 was exciting. We were shown how to coil wire around nails and make
 them into electromagnets with the current from dry cells.
 Those 6 volt dry cells, widely used to power doorbells, cost 25
 cents in the local 5 and 10. From that time on I was never without
 them.</p>
     
 <p>My ambition to be an artist was further dampened by an art appreciation
 course largely devoted to biographies of the less scandalous painters,
 and punctuated by black and white lantern slides of their masterpieces.
 That course also had a creative element devised to avoid, at all
 costs, creating any sort of untidiness in the classroom. I was
 encouraged to draw with pastel crayons, again on a large sheet
 of wrapping paper hung at the back of the classroom, while the
 other kids who felt less inclined toward art, were set to copying
 mounted cartoon panels on drawing paper. Neither the pastels for
 me, which were intended evidently to make the room look like an
 art class, nor the cartoon exercises for the other kids, seemed
 to have any instructive value.</p>
     
 <p>My lingering interests in art presently became centered on puppetry
 and marionettes. The instructions I saw for making them in some
 magazine articles and a handbook seemed to offer an interesting
 combination of sculpture and construction. After fashioning several
 puppet heads of papier mach&eacute; and painting them, I set about
 constructing their marionette bodies and string controls. When
 it came the turn of our class to present a play in the school auditorium
 I volunteered to produce a small troupe of marionettes and a stage
 appropriate for the class presentation. Our decision to stage the
 fairy tale &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot; turned out to set a more
 imposing task than I had imagined. Fortunately my mother came to
 my aid, offering not only to costume the marionettes but to
 help in constructing several. The task kept both of us busy for
 a solid month. The eventual presentation by the class, speaking
 for and operating the marionettes, must have been some sort of
 success since we had to repeat it several times. But I was ultimately
 embarrassed by the fact that so much of the work had been visibly
 my mother's, and resolved that any further projects of mine
 would be wholly independent.</p>
     
 <p>When did my interest in science become more serious? It really
 wasn't too serious, I'd have to admit, until still
 another change of location. My parents, realizing in 1937 that
 the move to the Bronx had not been a success, decided to move to
 an apartment at the north end of Manhattan. We lived in a more
 spacious neighborhood there and across a peaceful street from Inwood
 Park &ndash; the only uncultivated area left in Manhattan. The
 school I attended there for the ninth grade, which was nominally
 the first year of high school, was materially less boring than
 the prior year's. Algebra was an altogether new beginning
 and even a redemption for mathematics. It was finally freed of
 all that dismal arithmetic. That was a joy more than sufficient
 to overcome the uselessness of so many of the procedures that the
 curriculum did include. Who, even in those days, could imagine
 seriously needing to carry out long division of lengthy polynomials,
 or see any need to teach that procedure to children? No one with
 experience beyond teacher training could have been responsible
 for that curriculum.</p>
     
 <p>But general science was another of the subjects we studied, and
 the energy and enthusiasm of its young teachers more than made
 up for its attenuated subject matter. I had read an elementary
 book on astronomy by that time and had been taken by my Aunt Sarah
 on an exciting visit to the Hayden Planetarium. I found that I
 could easily visualize the diurnal motions of the stars, the monthly
 motion of the moon, and somewhat more sketchily the motions of
 the readily visible planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. The images
 associated with astronomy quickly captured my imagination, and
 I began to read everything about it I could find.</p>
     
 <p>The encyclopedia had some simplistic diagrams of how a telescope
 works, and they seemed to assure me that I could build one from
 some ordinary magnifying glasses I had accumulated. I did that
 and was amazed by the rainbow colored edges I saw on the image
 of the moon and presently dismayed by its overall fuzzy quality.
 It took a bit of reading to discover what the trouble was &ndash; chromatic
 aberration, endemic to all such primitive refractors. The cure &ndash; the
 only one accessible to me &ndash; would be to build a reflecting
 telescope. But that would be a long-term project, fortunately one
 that had already been pioneered by quite a few adult amateur astronomers.
 There was a book, in two volumes, in fact, that drew together the
 experiences of several amateurs and gave a good deal of guidance,
 if not detailed instruction, for grinding, polishing and figuring
 the mirror, and for constructing the remaining optical elements
 and the mounting. Going through the entire procedure required nine
 months of work. Coarse and fine grinding of the mirror took only
 a couple of weeks, but polishing and figuring it to its final shape
 consumed months. Building a stable yet flexible mounting for
 the telescope, one that would permit me to follow objects in the
 sky, compensating for the earth's rotation was another matter
 entirely. I had only a few hand tools appropriate to woodworking,
 and still no access to machine tools of any sort. Constructing
 the wooden cell to house the mirror involved strenuous use of a
 coping saw and a wood file for several days on end.</p>
     
 <p>The steel polar axis for the equatorial mounting was originally
 the steering shaft of a Ford car. The proprietor of the junkyard
 I found it in was happy to give it to me free. But I had somehow
 to put a 41&deg; bend into that shaft, to equal the latitude of
 New York. I drew an outline of the bend I needed on a sheet of
 asbestos and took it off together with the three foot shaft to
 a garage that I knew refashioned truck housings. The owner was
 tickled by the project, heated the shaft in his forge till
 it glowed brightly and pounded it into the precise shape I needed.
 It must have taken him a good three-quarters of an hour altogether,
 and I felt I owed him payment for his time. He thought the matter
 over, and I recall his smile as he said that would come to 25 cents.
 In fact I got a good deal of aid over those months from people
 who were pleased to help an ambitious kid with virtually no money
 to spend on his projects. My accumulated savings of $10 were no
 more than half spent during those nine months.</p>
     
 <p>Stability of the telescope mounting demanded that it be fairly
 massive but not too heavy to be carried by hand. The only way I
 could use it, after all, was to carry it upstairs to the roof of
 the apartment building. A weight of 40 or 50 pounds seemed appropriate
 for the base of the mounting, and I would have to make it of cast
 concrete. A schoolmate kindly brought me a sack of cement and a
 bag of sand contributed by his father, a local contractor. I fashioned
 a mold of the appropriate shape from recycled box wood and filled
 it with the concrete mixture called for by the instructions on
 the cement sack. The only place available to me for the casting
 operation was the wooden floor of my bedroom, between my bed and
 work desk. I had taken some precautions against the leakage of
 a little water by covering the floor first with waxed paper and
 a layer of newspaper. My understanding of the setting of concrete
 was that some miracle of chemistry would incorporate all of the
 water into the finally hardened product, with none left to leak
 out onto the floor. That is how plaster of Paris had hardened.
 But the result was a memorable lesson. I couldn't say what
 fraction of the hardening was eventually due to drainage, but it
 must have been appreciable. I had to spend an entire day mopping
 up pools of water around the hardening mass. I suppose when concrete
 sidewalks harden their leakage just seeps into the ground
 below. In my case it would have been the apartment downstairs.</p>
     
 <p>Observing with the telescope wasn't too easy either. In
 winter the apartment house roof was cold and often windy.
 Because of the city lights the sky was rarely dark enough to permit
 seeing the fainter objects, usually diffuse nebulae or distant
 galaxies. Still there were the thrilling topography of the moon,
 frequent views of the major planets and countless planetary nebulae,
 double stars, and clusters of all sorts. Lacking the means to find
 the fainter objects mechanically, I had to go about tracking them
 down by locating their positions on star maps relative to the brighter
 stars or objects easier to find. By putting in at least a little
 time on most clear nights I managed over the next year or two to
 find most of the hundred or so extended objects catalogued
 by the Italian astronomer Messier. I even managed to fashion a
 film holder and cardboard shutter for the telescope so that I took
 through it a sequence of moon pictures during the lunar eclipse
 of November 8, 1938.</p>
     
 <p>The possibility of performing optical tests as exquisitely sensitive
 as the Foucault test of the telescope mirror's figure with
 even the most primitive sorts of equipment convinced me that optics
 was full of miracles. Some other miracles I had seen involved the
 mysteries of light polarization. The Polaroid Corporation was sponsoring
 an exhibit I had visited at the Museum of Science and Industry
 at Rockefeller Center that showed, among other things, the remarkable
 colors that appeared in transparent materials like cellophane when
 seen between crossed sheets of Polaroid film. How could I procure
 any of the magical Polaroid film? That seemed hopeless for a 12-year
 old, but I had heard of the possibility of light polarization by
 reflection. The best reflectors for the purpose would be smooth
 and black &ndash; to avoid the complications of transmission. My
 father, who at that time in 1937 was selling jewelry displays made
 of just such black glass, found me several rectangular pieces of
 the right size. I was able then to mount all the optical elements,
 including a 25 watt light bulb within a cigar box and use the device
 to reveal the same sorts of polarization phenomena I had seen at
 the museum. Seeing the unseen in that way turned out to be as much
 of a thrill as any I had with the telescope.</p>
     
 <p>In the late 30's an organization with the imposing name
 The American Institute of the City of New York began organizing
 activities for young people interested in science. They held science
 congresses during the Christmas vacations and science fairs
 during the spring school break, both at the Museum of Natural History. The science
   congresses were patterned after professional scientific meetings, and split
   just as incoherently into many sessions, according to fields and specialties.
   Each session had several ten minute talks presented by the kids as contributed
   papers. One of those presentations in 1937 was my own description of the plans
   for the forthcoming 200-inch telescope at Mt. Palomar. It was a visionary
 image that kept my spirits up while I was having troubles of my
 own building my 6-inch diameter telescope. The sponsoring Institute
 saw to it that our talks were attended by at least a sprinkling
 of mature scientists whom they could somehow persuade to volunteer.
 I was flattered that my own talk was attended, if only briefly,
 by Dr. Clyde Fisher, the curator of the Hayden Planetarium. One
 of his assistant lecturers, Dorothy Bennett, stayed for the whole
 ten minutes and dropped a suggestion to me that added immensely
 to my experience over the next four years.</p>
     
 <p>Dorothy Bennett was something of a wonder. Seeking a career in
 New York, she had arrived there as a fresh graduate of the University
 of Minnesota just in time for the economic debacle of 1929. With
 boundless energy and no prior acquaintance with astronomy she found
 a position working on the plans for the City's new planetarium.
 One of her many inspirations was to begin in 1930 a citywide astronomy
 club for kids of high school age. It met on Saturday evenings biweekly,
 in an imposing auditorium on the top floor of the Roosevelt Memorial
 building, adjacent to the Planetarium. There the kids, who came
 in by subway from the far reaches of the city, heard invited lectures
 by real astronomers. It was that club that Miss Bennett suggested
 I try attending. I was indeed excited by it and caught up in it
 from the first meeting I went to. It then formed a large part
 of my life till I went off to college.</p>
     
 <p>Watched over by Dorothy in a kind of godmotherly role, the Junior
 Astronomy Club actually had a permanent office in a former watchman's
 apartment in the basement of the Roosevelt Memorial. There it held
 committee meetings, originated large mailings to the membership
 and ground out its monthly mimeographed publication, the Junior
 Astronomy News. I rushed to take part in all of those programs,
 ceaselessly amazed that the club could manage all of its activities
 on dues that only came to 25 cents per year. The secret of that
 miracle was that Dorothy had assigned to the club the royalties
 of a book she had inspired,<i> The Handbook of the Heavens</i>,
 and the proceeds from the sales of a rotating star map, a planisphere
 she designed. Enough copies of those publications had been sold
 to keep the club afloat for over ten years. Dorothy left the planetarium
 for a position in the publishing industry in 1939, entrusting
 supervision of our club to a group of its older alumni, who carried
 on the tradition for quite a few years more.</p>
     
 <p>I often wondered what happened to Dorothy in the years after
 that. She didn't just vanish into the publishing world, I
 found. Within a couple of years she had become the originator and
 editor of the Little Golden Books of Simon and Schuster. Those
 small paperbacks, devoted at first to assorted topics in natural
 science or history, became one of the wonders of the publishing
 industry. They were colorfully illustrated and were sold in vast
 numbers at newsstands and stores everywhere. Countless kids
 must have owed their knowledge of fossils, seashells, or trees
 to those books and to Dorothy. When eventually the publishers decided
 to extend their franchise into more commercial and less educational
 material, Dorothy left them and took up a succession of new careers
 in archaeology and ethnography. Her adventures extended to many
 other novel areas of public education.</p>
     
 <p>In September 1938 a new high school was opened by the City, with
 the declared intention of providing a more extensive background
 in science. That school, the Bronx High School of Science was to
 have an entrance examination and a freshly chosen staff of
 young teachers. It was established however in an old building still
 used as an annex for a traditional local school, and three years
 had to pass before its growing student body had displaced the more
 disaffected population originally present. It was interesting being
 a pioneer in this way, but not without problems. Although the two
 populations didn't overlap in classes they did &ndash; and
 experienced friction &ndash; everywhere else.</p>
     
 <p>My choice of this high school required long trolley car rides
 between upper Manhattan and the Bronx, but it proved fortunate
 in several respects. The kids were better informed about most things
 than average high school kids, and were often interesting to talk
 to. Not many of them entertained ambitions of becoming scientists
 however. They were there, mainly, it seemed, in search of somewhat
 higher educational standards. The lawyers, doctors and businessmen
 who emerged from my cohort, in fact, greatly outnumbered the handful
 of eventual scientists. Although all high schools offered some
 elective courses, it would have been difficult in most of them,
 to take both a science and a math course in each year. If we were
 able to do that, it was at the expense of studying Latin or taking
 a second modern language course. I was more than pleased at the
 time by those omissions, but have come to regret them since.</p>
     
 <p>Whatever may have been the weaknesses of the school's physical
 plant or its curriculum, the faculty members seemed to make up
 for them. They were mostly young, energetic and unjaded. We seemed
 to have the depression years to thank for that. Most of the
 teachers had graduated from the tuition-free city colleges during
 the early 30's and, seeing no future in continuing their
 studies, had taken refuge in positions with the school system.
 The subjects they taught, like European history and economics,
 seemed to have real substance, for a change, and mathematics stood
 out among them. It was the real thing, not just an introduction
 one would have to repeat and improve upon in college. When algebra
 became more serious in the second year of high school it became
 more interesting. My teacher in intermediate algebra, Samuel Altwerger,
 appreciating my involvement with astronomy and my growing enthusiasm
 for mathematics, suggested that it might be a good idea for me
 to learn calculus. He assured me I could learn it just by reading
 a textbook. He gave me one small book for that purpose and borrowed
 a larger one for me from the library. I found, to my surprise,
 that he was right. I had no trouble with these and absorbed an
 understanding of elementary calculus quickly. In fact that was
 well before I really needed calculus, but the experience marked
 a kind of turning point for me. I had never felt inclined toward
 mathematics before, but what I had learned by the time I reached
 college permitted me to skip several elementary courses there.</p>
     
 <p>However much I came to like mathematics, my passion was still
 building optical instruments. I had been reading about the pivotal
 role played by spectroscopy in developing an understanding
 of atoms, and I resolved to build a spectroscope myself. Most of
 its parts would have to be made of metal, and that meant even more
 numbing use of hand files, this time not on wood, but brass. It
 wasn't difficult putting the spectroscope together. Neither
 its structure nor its optics presented other problems. But there
 was one central element missing. I had neither a prism nor a diffraction
 grating to use as the dispersive device that generates the spectrum.
 Fortunately the principal of the new high school, Dr. Morris Meister,
 had been given a replica diffraction grating as a graduation
 present, and he was happy to loan it to me. That spectroscope,
 entered in the 1939 science fair, won two prizes. I had very little
 chance to use it after that, since the American Institute exhibited
 it over many months in a display case at the New York World's
 Fair of 1939 and its repetition in 1940.</p>
     
 <p>The Junior Astronomy Club also had an involvement in those World's
 Fairs. Part of the extensive Westinghouse exhibit was devoted to
 the scientific hobbies of kids of high school age. I was happy
 to organize demonstrations of the grinding of telescope mirrors
 for the exhibit and enlist a succession of our club members, each
 to spend a week or two on public display at the task. When my own
 turns came I became good friends with the young chemist who
 worked next to me, notwithstanding the shower of ashes his synthetic
 volcano blew over my optical surfaces. Young Frank Pierson never
 did become a chemist. He became a well-known screen writer
 and for several years president of the Academy of Motion Picture
 Arts and Sciences.</p>

 my spectroscope, and through a borrowed microscope. It won one
 of the prizes, a visit to the Westinghouse Corporation in Pittsburgh,
 Pennsylvania, where I had a chance to visit their &quot;atom smasher&quot;,
 a vertically mounted Van de Graaf generator, and to talk briefly
 with a couple of real scientists, including a well known theorist,
 E. U. Condon. Then, as a climax to the trip, I was ushered into
 the office of the president of the corporation. He promptly drew
 from his top desk drawer a tattered old pocket notebook. It was
 his official record, he explained, of the hours he had worked for
 the company at the turn of the century for a wage of only a few
 cents an hour.</p>
 <p>The junior year of high school meant starting to think about
 going to college. The teacher assigned as my guidance counselor,
 thinking perhaps of the experience of his colleagues, assured me
 that there were too few positions available anywhere for astronomers
 or physicists, and that I would be best off going to an engineering
 school. He felt I should apply to a range of them, but he saw Rensselaer
 Polytech as the ideal compromise. The father of my best friend,
 a Harvard graduate himself, gave me rather different advice. Disappointed
 at the unlikelihood of his own son's admission to Harvard,
 he guessed that I might make it. More to the point, he suggested
 that scholarship support could be available. Neither my parents
 nor I would otherwise have been so presumptuous as to imagine that
 large a leap in social status. I did fill out the lengthy Harvard
 applications, however, and take the several required examinations.
 The application for the scholarship awarded by the New York Harvard
 Club involved a searching interview conducted in a large, oak-paneled
 room by a dean and half a dozen club member contributors. I was
 eventually admitted to a number of colleges, including Rensselaer
, but without scholarship aid. Harvard, on the other hand, granted
 me a Harvard Club scholarship, while making it clear that there
 were many more exams to take before I would be declared admitted.</p>

    May 1941 announcement of talks at the Electrical
        Engineering Auditorium by four high school students. My talk was about
        photographs I had taken with the instruments I had shown at the 1940
        Science Congress. The talk by Baruch Blumberg dealt with a model refrigerator
        he had constructed. He didn&rsquo;t continue with physics, however, and
        switched to medicine, winning the Nobel Prize in 1976 for the discovery
        of the hepatitis B virus. The chairman, Irwin Arias, also turned out
        to be a distinguished hepatologist.
  
</p>   
 <p>Beginning at Harvard in the fall of 1941 meant suddenly being
 treated like a member of the gentry. We had waiter service at our
 dining tables and daily printed menus listing alternative dishes.
 Of course, some fraction of the waiters were fellow classmates,
 working for board. Our society was stratified in many other ways
 as well. The rents for the dormitory rooms were graded according
 to their location, with the result that the scholarship students
 were clustered in the less desirable areas. They never got to meet
 the occupants of the higher priced real estate. I scarcely minded
 any of that. I had come from a different world than those normal
 Harvard students. College was for them primarily a social experience,
 overlaid by a burden of course work. For me, on the other hand,
 having skipped a couple of grades along the way, and some two years
 younger than most of my classmates, it was the other way around.
 I enjoyed a few social contacts, but worked hard at my studies,
 finding them demanding at times, but on the whole well planned
 and satisfying.</p>
     
 <p>That freshman year was punctuated on December 7 by the Japanese
 attack on Pearl Harbor and by the entry the next day of the U.S.
 into the war in Europe as well as the Pacific. The next few months
 saw significant changes in our lives as students. The rather searching
 physics course I was taking had been planned as the first half
 of a two year cycle. Because faculty members were departing for
 war work the remaining year-long course would not be offered as
 planned. It would instead be packed into the second semester of
 the first-year course. That proved to be quite a tall order but
 a fast way of learning.</p>
     
 <p>The entire school then began operating during the summer and
 accelerating its course programs with the thought of providing
 as much education as possible before the young men left for the
 armed forces. In the meantime Harvard's dining halls lost
 their graciousness and were transformed into the cafeteria-style
 mess halls they have been ever since. The draft age, then 21, was
 presently lowered to 18 and the university began losing students
 in large numbers. With its faculty depleted the Physics Department
 announced that its graduate courses were shortly to be given for
 the last time &quot;for the duration.&quot; That announcement
 made it a good idea to jump directly into the graduate courses,
 skipping the intermediate ones which had looked neither demanding
 nor very interesting anyway. It was with the war thus cracking
 the whip that I managed to assimilate most of the courses of a
 graduate school education by the time I turned 18 in September
 1943. At that point I felt ready for war work myself and filled
 out a questionnaire sent out by an agency called the National Roster
 of Scientific Personnel. Its purpose was to ascertain scientific
 training and try to place people accordingly.</p>
     
 <p>The armed forces by that time had become vastly larger than the
 country's immediate needs. The Army developed what it called
 a Specialized Training Program, in effect for storage of its legions
 in the universities for a year or so, until they would be needed
 in the invasion of Europe. The program exposed a large population
 of draftees to college courses for the first time and was a productive
 experiment in education. I was given a position teaching elementary
 physics in the program and had my hands full doing that along with
 taking a full program of courses of my own.</p>
     
 <p>Then one day in October 1943, a stranger in a dark suit appeared
 in the Physics Department office evidently asking for me. He introduced
 himself as a Mr. Trytten from Washington, D.C. and asked to speak
 privately to me. We withdrew to a faculty meeting room in which
 the blinds were never raised. Closing the door, he asked if I would
 be interested in joining a new project that was engaged in interesting
 work. That it was &quot;out west&quot; was the most he would
 tell me about either the location of the place or what it was doing.
 It sounded fascinating nonetheless, and I found the security questionnaires
 he put before me easy to fill out. Having so little prior history
 helped. His seeking me out seemed to relate to my having filled
 out the National Roster blanks. It was then a matter of several
 weeks before my security clearance had been completed and I was
 instructed to send whatever belongings I needed to the now famous
 Post Office Box 1663, Santa Fe, New Mexico. In my case it was
 a trunk sent not by mail but by Railway Express. There were many
 occasions, then and later to imagine what a capacious P.O.
 box that one must be.</p>
     
 <p>I could find many tiny hints at what was going on out there,
 all of them questionable and several, as it later became clear,
 completely wrong. The most solid hint was in fact a negative one.
 For about two years after the discovery of uranium fission
 in 1939 there had been occasional notes in the New York Times speculating
 on the possibility of starting a chain reaction. They had stopped
 appearing, it was hard to say just when, but at least two years
 earlier. So I had no idea whether it had become a dead issue, or
 my offer of a position implied some real progress toward a
 chain reaction.</p>
     
 <p>The train ride from New York to Lamy, New Mexico, the stop for
 Santa Fe, consumed two and a half days. A driver from Los Alamos
 had come to the station principally to meet a short man in a black
 overcoat, but took me along, stopping first at an unassuming project
 office in Santa Fe, where I learned that the man in the overcoat
 was John von Neumann, a legendary mathematician.</p>
     
 <p>The ride from Santa Fe up to &quot;the Hill&quot; was an experience
 I shall never forget. First there was the breathtaking scenery
 of the canyons of the Pajarito Plateau. Then there was my fellow
 passenger, John Von Neumann, who engaged in a lively conversation
 for most of the trip with the driver, whom I learned only later
 was a mathematician who had worked with &quot;Johnny&quot; earlier.
 With a thought perhaps of maintaining security, they discussed
 some calculations underway using the most outlandish mathematical
 terminology, and describing mathematical errors in physical terms
 that I knew represented physical impossibilities. The ride
 was an incredible mixture of visual thrills and intellectual enigmas.</p>
     
 <p>I was astonished, shortly after arrival at the project, to be
 told that the chain reaction had long since been achieved in Chicago
 and the present intention was to construct a reaction fast
 enough to be a bomb. It was disturbing news and I recoiled
 from it at first, but the challenges and uncertainties involved
 helped reconcile me to it. More importantly, I felt, as everyone
 else on the project did, that whatever these uncertainties might
 be, the Germans, possessing the same understanding we had, were
 likely to be working on the bomb as well. And if they reached that
 goal before we did they would not be sentimental about using it
 to stave off eventual defeat. That fear applied only to the known
 expertise of the Germans. The conflict with Japan didn't
 appear to motivate anyone's involvement in the project.</p>
     
 <p>The project was only a few months old when I joined it but most
 of its eventual leaders were already there. Not many were yet well-known.
 They were remarkably youthful. Oppenheimer in his late thirties
 was one of the oldest. He had a universal understanding of the
 work and an eloquence in describing it that kept us spellbound.
   <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Hans Bethe</a>, the leader of the theoretical division, had a
 penetrating understanding that seemed capable of formulating absolutely
 anything quantitatively and evaluating it effortlessly, an aura
 he maintained even many years later. <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a> was there as leader
 of a small theoretical group. He was often cantankerously teasing
 the security people. His lectures were always offbeat performances
 demonstrating novel approaches to problems in ways devoted as much
 to entertainment as to the technical message. There were others,
 too many to mention, and among them as an occasional visitor, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels
 Bohr</a>, whom we called Nicholas Baker for obvious reasons, together
 with his son <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/index.html">Aage</a>.</p>
     
 <p>Overwhelmed by these giants, my own position in the Theory Division
 at age 18 was a modest one. There were many problems in neutron
 diffusion such as finding the critical mass that required more
 careful formulations than had been carried out in the earliest
 projections. I worked on those for the better part of the two years
 I spent at Los Alamos and wrote three lengthy secret papers on
 those subjects.</p>
     
 <p>There were many delays before the Trinity Test of the bomb in
 July 1945 and with them the uncertainty of how well it would work
 grew steadily. Unable to secure a position among the experimenters
 at Alomogordo, I had to be content with watching for the flash
 from the top of Sandia Peak near Albuquerque. I saw the flash
 indeed and some of the glow that followed from a distance of over
 a hundred miles. The test was followed by some tense days, leading
 up to August 6, when the use of the bomb at Hiroshima was announced.
 One thing the portentous announcement meant was a certain release
 from secrecy. We could now resume contact with the outside world.
 We could say, if only in general terms what we had been working
 on. But there were no celebrations of any sort until the war was
 over a few days later.</p>
     
 <p>Resuming the life of an undergraduate at Harvard early in 1946
 proved surprisingly difficult, even though I needed only a few
 credits to graduate. Having had a team of assistants to do calculations
 for me at Los Alamos didn't make it any easier, I found,
 to do my own homework back at school, particularly when I
 felt I had moved beyond all that. Fortunately that time was brief,
 and then I became a graduate student. But I had already taken most
 of the graduate courses on offer, and so was largely left on my
 own, being allowed to register, in effect, for independent reading
 and research. The principal reason for my remaining at Harvard
 was the addition of <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Julian
 Schwinger</a> to the faculty. I had met
 him during a brief appearance he made at Los Alamos, late in 1945,
 and was immediately so impressed with his knowledge and his incredibly
 informative lecturing style that I felt he was unique among teachers
 and would be the ideal thesis advisor as well. I became friendly
 with Julian over the next three years and was never less than amazed
 by his ability to construct elegant mathematical structures that
 would permit him to see further than any of his contemporaries.
 There were times in those postwar years when it seemed he was responsible
 for most of the progress in theoretical physics, and very
 likely would be for years to come. His lectures were brilliantly
 delivered and notes on them were highly prized and reproduced wherever
 they could be found. Many students crowded in to work with him,
 however, and he limited the time he spent with them, so they didn't
 always produce great theses. Though nominally registered to work
 with Julian, I actually worked by myself and produced in 1949 a
 quantum field theoretical thesis that was useful to my later development
 but scarcely much better than the others of the day.</p>

    Life with Wolfgang Pauli; a Spring 1950 outing. Prepared
      to photograph Pauli kicking the ball into the lake, as he had done earlier,
      I stood to one side, carefully aiming the camera at him. Pauli indeed kicked
      the ball, and I managed to snap the shutter just before the camera hit
      me squarely in the face.
  
</p> 
 <p>Robert Oppenheimer, who seemed to know more of me than I had
 imagined, invited me to spend my first postdoctoral year in
 Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. The group of 20
 or so postdocs who gathered there included quite a few eventual
 leaders of the postwar generation of theorists. None had a stable
 position anywhere else and so the atmosphere was quite competitive.
 In the first term of 1950, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Wolfgang
 Pauli</a> was scheduled to
 visit the Institute. Following the advice of friends who had worked
 in Z&uuml;rich, I arranged with Pauli to return with him to Z&uuml;rich
 and work with him until the fall of that year when I would return
 to Princeton and the Institute. Having a few months to live in
 Z&uuml;rich and to travel over Europe was the principal experience
 of that encounter. Pauli at age 50 had relaxed into the role of
 a critic and was no longer inspiring much research. He did retain
 a mordant sense of humor, however, and was forever doing his best
 to tease me. Teasing others as well, if not insulting them outright,
 he was always interesting to be around.</p>

         spoke about neutron physics, Fermi about pion scattering, and I lectured
         on particle collision theory.
     
   </p>
   <p>After another year I spent at the Institute, Oppy found me a
 teaching position. It was only a temporary one, replacing
 Feynman at Caltech. Feynman was to spend the year in Brazil, where
 by his own account, he worked hard on the bongo drums, and Caltech
 needed someone to teach quantum mechanics. The chemistry department
 out there, under <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">Linus
 Pauling</a>, seemed to be an exceptionally active
 one. My research for the year was devoted to resolving a puzzle
 they had encountered in studying electron diffraction by molecules.
 Solving the problem didn't interest me in molecules very
 much, but it did involve me deeply in scattering problems in which
 the incident particles were of wavelength much smaller than the
 ranges of interactions. Those problems, I understood, would become
 steadily more important in nuclear physics as accelerator energies
 were increased. I continued studying those problems then when I
 was invited back to Harvard in the fall of 1952 and for some years
 after that. The result was a species of nuclear diffraction theory
 analogous in some ways to optical diffraction theory, but
 generalized to include inelastic collisions between incident particles
 and complex nuclear systems. The theory is even used these days
 to treat the high-energy collisions of pairs of heavy nuclei.</p>
     
 <p>Once I was back at Harvard I began to climb the academic ladder
 of professorial positions and was able to direct the thesis
 work of a number of gifted students. Theoretical physicists weren't
 nearly as specialized in those days as they are now. All of theory
 was considered one's province and so those theses ranged
 over half a dozen fields, as did my own work.</p>
     
 <p>The late 50's proved to be an exciting time for many reasons.
 A radically new light source, the laser, was being developed and
 there were questions in the air regarding the quantum structure
 of its output. That was particularly so in view of the surprising
 discovery of quantum correlations in ordinary light by Hanbury
 Brown and Twiss. A second source of excitement, all my own, was
 that I had met the young woman I was to marry, Cynthia Rich, and
 had been going out with her since 1957. We married in July 1960,
 bought a contemporary house a year later, and settled into quite
 a happy life together. That was the period in which I began to
 work on quantum optics with a surmise that the Hanbury Brown-Twiss
 correlation would be found absent from a stable laser beam, and
 then followed it with a sequence of more general papers on photon
 statistics and the meaning of coherence.</p>
     
 <p>Our first child, a son Jeffrey, arrived in 1963. I remember feeling
 his arrival was a kind of redemption, a species of renewal
 for which I was more than grateful at age 38. I was doing a good
 deal of traveling in those days, particularly during vacations,
 and it always amazed me how transportable the baby was. We had
 no trouble taking him on short domestic trips anywhere, but thinking
 back on my own experience perhaps, waited till he was nearly 4
 before taking him on a longer trip to Geneva for a sabbatical at
 CERN. My work in this period gravitated back to high-energy collision
 theory, since experiments had begun to reveal many of the results
 my diffractive multiple scattering theory had predicted.</p>

      outlasted the moustache.
  
</p>    
 <p>Our second child, a daughter Valerie, didn't arrive until
 1970, and by that time our placid and comfortable academic life
 had been roiled up in many ways. Years of demonstrations against
 the Vietnam War, the anguish of the black liberation movement,
 and finally the bitter recriminations of militant feminism had
 left the world of our university seriously fragmented. My wife,
 joining with the militants, decided that the days of traditional
 marriage were over, and that her own should be one of the first
 to go. The law, she found, would permit her to end it, of her own
 choice, while retaining custody of the children. Devastated by
 her decision, I simply couldn't believe she would hew to
 it, and it took some time to try to reach a settlement. By that
 time, indeed, she no longer sought active custody of the children,
 and having taken care of them earlier, I proceeded thereafter to
 raise them as a single father. It was a time-consuming occupation,
 but an immensely rewarding one, and I managed fortunately to remain
 involved and reasonably productive in my work. I'm sure there
 is some number of papers I never got to write as a result, but
 raising those children and seeing them succeed was not an experience
 I would trade for the missing papers or any sort of recognition.
 Both Jeff and Val have families of their own now and are busy raising
 my grandchildren. I envy them that privilege, and wish I had the
 opportunity to be raising them all myself.</p>
