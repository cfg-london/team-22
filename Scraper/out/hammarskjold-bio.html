  <h1>Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hammarskjold.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Dag
  Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskj&ouml;ld</b> (July 29, 1905-September
  18, 1961) was the youngest of four sons of Agnes (Almquist)
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld and Hjalmar Hammarskj&ouml;ld, prime minister
  of Sweden, member of the Hague Tribunal, governor of Uppland,
  chairman of the Board of the <a href=
  "/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/index.html">Nobel Foundation</a>. In a
  brief piece written for a radio program in 1953, Dag
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld spoke of the influence of his parents: "From
  generations of soldiers and government officials on my father's
  side I inherited a belief that no life was more satisfactory than
  one of selfless service to your country - or humanity. This
  service required a sacrifice of all personal interests, but
  likewise the courage to stand up unflinchingly for your
  convictions. From scholars and clergymen on my mother's side, I
  inherited a belief that, in the very radical sense of the
  Gospels, all men were equals as children of God, and should be
  met and treated by us as our masters in God."<a href=

  <br>
  Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld was, by common consent, the outstanding
  student of his day at Uppsala University where he took his degree in 1925
  in the humanities, with emphasis on linguistics, literature, and
  history. During these years he laid the basis for his command of
  English, French, and German and for his stylistic mastery of his
  native language in which he developed something of the artist's
  touch. He was capable of understanding the poetry of the German
  Hermann Hesse and of the American Emily Dickinson; of taking
  delight in painting, especially in the work of the French
  Impressionists; of discoursing on music, particularly on the
  compositions of Beethoven; and in later years, of participating
  in sophisticated dialogue on Christian theology. In athletics he
  was a competent performer in gymnastics, a strong skier, a
  mountaineer who served for some years as the president of the
  Swedish Alpinist club. In short, Hammarskj&ouml;ld was a
  Renaissance man.<br>
  <br>
  His main intellectual and professional interest for some years,
  however, was political economy. He took a second degree at
  Uppsala in economics, in 1928, a law degree in 1930, and a
  doctoral degree in economics in 1934. For one year, 1933,
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld taught economics at the University of Stockholm.
  But both his own desire and his heritage led him to enter public
  service to which he devoted thirty-one years in Swedish financial
  affairs, Swedish foreign relations, and global international
  affairs. His success in his first position, that of secretary
  from 1930 to 1934 to a governmental commission on unemployment,
  brought him to the attention of the directors of the Bank of
  Sweden who made him the Bank's secretary in 1935. From 1936 to
  1945, he held the post of undersecretary in the Ministry of
  Finance. From 1941 to 1948, thus overlapping the
  undersecretaryship by four years, he was placed at the head of
  the Bank of Sweden, the most influential financial structure in
  the country.<br>
  <br>
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld has been credited with having coined the term
  "planned economy". Along with his eldest brother, Bo, who was
  then undersecretary in the Ministry of Social Welfare, he drafted
  the legislation which opened the way to the creation of the
  present, so-called "welfare state. " In the latter part of this
  period, he drew attention as an international financial
  negotiator for his part in the discussions with Great Britain on
  the postwar economic reconstruction of Europe, in his reshaping
  of the twelve-year-old United States-Swedish trade agreement, in
  his participation in the talks which organized the Marshall Plan,
  and in his leadership on the Executive Committee of the
  Organization for European Economic Cooperation.<br>
  <br>
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld's connection with the Swedish Ministry of
  Foreign Affairs began in 1946 when he became its financial
  adviser. In 1949 he was named to an official post in the Foreign
  Ministry and in 1951 became the deputy foreign minister, with
  cabinet rank, although he continued to remain aloof from
  membership in any political party. In foreign affairs he
  continued a policy of international economic cooperation. A
  diplomatic feat of this period was the avoiding of Swedish
  commitment to the cooperative military venture of the North
  Atlantic Treaty Organization while collaborating on the political
  level in the Council of Europe and on the economic level in the
  Organization of European Economic Cooperation.<br>
  <br>
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld represented Sweden as a delegate to the
  United Nations
  in 1949 and again from 1951 to 1953. Receiving fifty-seven votes
  out of sixty, Hammarskj&ouml;ld was elected Secretary-General of
  the United Nations in 1953 for a five-year term and reelected in
  1957. Before turning to the world problems awaiting him, he
  established a firm base of operations. For his Secretariat of
  4,000 people, he drew up a set of regulations defining their
  responsibilities to the international organization of which they
  were a part and affirming their independence from narrowly
  conceived national interests.<br>
  <br>
  In the six years after his first major victory of 1954-1955, when
  he personally negotiated the release of American soldiers
  captured by the Chinese in the Korean War, he was involved in
  struggles on three of the world's continents. He approached them
  through what he liked to call "preventive diplomacy" and while
  doing so sought to establish more independence and effectiveness
  in the post of Secretary-General itself.<br>
  <br>
  In the Middle East his efforts to ease the situation in Palestine
  and to resolve its problems continued throughout his stay in
  office. During the Suez Canal crisis of 1956, he exercised his
  own personal diplomacy with the nations involved; worked with
  many others in the UN to get the UN to nullify the use of force
  by Israel, France, and Great Britain following Nasser's
  commandeering of the Canal; and under the UN's mandate,
  commissioned the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) - the
  first ever mobilized by an international organization. In 1958 he
  suggested to the Assembly a solution to the crises in Lebanon and
  Jordan and subsequently directed the establishment of the UN
  Observation Group in Lebanon and the UN Office in Jordan,
  bringing about the withdrawal of the American and British troops
  which had been sent there. In 1959 he sent a personal
  representative to Southeast Asia when Cambodia and Thailand broke
  off diplomatic relations, and another to Laos when problems arose
  there.<br>
  <br>
  Out of these crises came procedures and tactics new to the UN -
  the use of the UNEF, employment of a UN "presence" in world
  trouble spots and a steadily growing tendency to make the
  Secretary-General the executive for operations for peace.<br>
  <br>
  It was with these precedents established that the United Nations
  and Hammarskj&ouml;ld took up the problems stemming from the new
  independence of various developing countries. The most dangerous
  of these, that of the newly liberated Congo, arose in July, 1960,
  when the new government there, faced with mutiny in its army,
  secession of its province of Katanga, and intervention of Belgian
  troops, asked the UN for help. The UN responded by sending a
  peace-keeping force, with Hammarskj&ouml;ld in charge of
  operations.<br>
  <br>
  When the situation deteriorated during the year that followed,
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld had to deal with almost insuperable
  difficulties in the Congo and with criticism in the UN. A last
  crisis for him came in September, 1961, when, arriving in
  Leopoldville to discuss details of UN aid with the Congolese
  government, he learned that fighting had erupted between Katanga
  troops and the noncombatant forces of the UN. A few days later,
  in an effort to secure a cease-fire, he left by air for a
  personal conference with President Tshombe of Katanga. Sometime
  in the night of September 17-18, he and fifteen others aboard
  perished when their plane crashed near the border between Katanga
  and North Rhodesia.<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  After his death, the publication in 1963 of his "journal"
  entitled <i>Markings</i> revealed the inner man as few documents
  ever have. The entries in this manuscript, Hammarskj&ouml;ld
  wrote in a covering letter to his literary executor, constitute "
  a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and
  with God." There is a delicate irony in this use of the language
  of the diplomat. The entries themselves are spiritual truths
  given artistic form. <i>Markings</i> contains many references to
  death, perhaps none more explicit or significant than this
  portion from the opening entries, written when he was a young
  man:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">Tomorrow we shall meet,<br>
    Death and I -.<br>
    And he shall thrust his sword<br>
    Into one who is wide awake.<a href=
    "#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>
