  <h1>Owen Chamberlain - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chamberlain.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Owen Chamberlain</b> was born
  in San Francisco on July 10, 1920. His father was W. Edward
  Chamberlain, a prominent radiologist with an interest in physics.
  His mother's maiden name was Genevieve Lucinda Owen.</p>
 
  <p>He obtained his bachelor's degree at Dartmouth College in 1941.
  He entered graduate school in physics at the University of
  California, but his studies were interrupted by the involvement
  of the United States in World War II. In early 1942 he joined the
  Manhattan Project, the U.S. Government organization for the
  construction of the atomic bomb. Within the Manhattan Project he
  worked under Professor Emilio Segr&egrave;, both in Berkeley,
  California, and in Los Alamos, New Mexico, investigating nuclear
  cross sections for intermediate-energy neutrons and the
  spontaneous fission of heavy elements. In 1946 he resumed
  graduate work at the University of Chicago where, under the inspired
  guidance of the late <a href="../1938/index.html">Professor
  Enrico Fermi</a>, he worked toward his doctorate. He completed
  experimental work on the diffraction of slow neutrons in liquids
  in 1948 and his doctor's degree was awarded in 1949 by the
  University of Chicago.</p>
 
  <p>In 1948 he accepted a teaching position at the University of
  California in Berkeley. His research work includes extensive
  studies of proton-proton scattering, undertaken with Professor
  Segr&egrave; and Dr. Clyde Wiegand, and an important series of
  experiments on polarization effects in proton scattering,
  culminating in the triple-scattering experiments with Professor
  Segr&egrave;, Dr. Wiegand, Dr. Thomas Ypsilantis, and Dr. Robert D.
  Tripp. In 1955 he participated with Dr. Wiegand, Professor
  Segr&egrave;, and Dr. Ypsilantis in the discovery of the
  antiproton.</p>
 
  <p>For the next few years he and his colleagues studied
    the  interactions of antiprotons with hydrogen, deuterium and other elements,
    and used  antiprotons to produce antineutrons. In 1960 he, together with
    Professors Carson  Jeffries and Gilbert Shapiro, pioneered the development
    and use of polarized proton  targets to study the spin dependence of a wide
    variety of high energy processes,  including the scattering of pi-mesons
    and protons on polarized protons, the determination of the parity of hyperons,
    and a test of time reversal symmetry in electron-proton scattering. These
    and other similar experiments were his main activity for the next 20 years.
    In the late  '70s and early '80s he briefly participated in the study of
    the interactions of energetic light  nuclei with nuclear targets at the Berkeley
    Bevalac accelerator. In the final years before  retiring from active service
    he worked with Dr. David Nygren on the development and construction of the
    Time-Projection-Chamber that was subsequently used with great success to
    study high-energy  positron-electron interactions at the Stanford Linear
    Accelerator Center.</p>
 
  <p>He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of
    the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded a Guggenheim
    Fellowship in 1957 for the purpose of doing studies in the
    physics of antinucleons at the University of Rome. He was
    appointed Professor of Physics at the University of
    California, Berkeley, in 1958, and served as Loeb Lecturer at
    Harvard University in 1959.</p>
  <p>In 1943 he married Beatrice Babette Copper (dec. 1988). They had three daughters
  and one son. Subsequent marriages to June Steingart Greenfield (dec. 1991)
  and currently to Senta Pugh Gaiser.</p>
