  <h1>Sir Austen Chamberlain - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chamberlain.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Sir
  Joseph Austen Chamberlain</b> (October 16, 1863-March 17, 1937)
  was the eldest son of Joseph Chamberlain, the great British
  statesman known as the &laquo;Empire-builder&raquo; he was a
  half-brother of Neville Chamberlain, prime minister from 1937 to
  1940. Like William Pitt the Younger, son of a famous father a
  hundred years earlier, he was trained for statesmanship. It was
  said of Austen that he did not choose a career, he accepted one.
  Having completed his boyhood schooling at Rugby and his
  university studies at Cambridge, he spent nine months at the &Eacute;cole
  des Sciences Politiques in Paris and twelve months in Berlin.
  When he returned to Birmingham in 1887, he became, in effect, his
  father's private secretary. Consequently, in 1892, when Austen
  Chamberlain was twenty-nine years old, he was well equipped to
  take a seat in the House of Commons, representing East
  Worcestershire, a constituency near the family home in
  Birmingham. Upon his father's death in 1914, Austen became the
  member for West Birmingham, holding this seat until his own death
  in 1937.<br>
  <br>
  Austen Chamberlain's forty-five year career in the House of
  Commons may be divided into two periods: the first from his entry
  into the House in 1892 to 1922 when Lloyd George resigned as
  prime minister; and the second from 1922 to his death in 1937. In
  the first period he was concerned primarily with domestic
  questions; in the second, with international questions.<br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain made his mark quickly. His maiden speech in 1893 was
  praised by William Gladstone; from 1895 to 1900 he was civil lord
  of the Admiralty; from 1900 to 1902, financial secretary to the
  Treasury; for one year, 1902-1903, the postmaster general; from
  1903 to 1906, he was chancellor of the Exchequer.<br>
  <br>
  In the wartime coalition government formed by Herbert Asquith in
  1915, Chamberlain accepted the position of secretary of state for
  India, resigning in 1917. When David Lloyd George formed a
  coalition government after the election of 1918, he made
  Chamberlain his chancellor of the Exchequer. Chamberlain filled
  this post from 1919 to 1921 with distinction, paying the enormous
  debts accumulated during the war, maintaining a stable currency,
  and strengthening the national credit.<br>
  <br>
  Upon Bonar Law's retirement from the leadership of the
  Conservative Party in 1921, Chamberlain succeeded him for
  eighteen months. By this time Lloyd George's coalition was
  tottering and the rank and file of the Conservative Party wanted
  to break away from it. When Chamberlain stood by the prime
  minister, the party, withdrawing from the coalition, first placed
  Bonar Law in the prime ministry and then Stanley Baldwin.<br>
  <br>
  In the Baldwin government of 1924 to 1929, Chamberlain was
  secretary of state for foreign affairs. His brilliant tenure in
  office reflected the brilliant qualities he brought to it. In
  establishing policy, he was philosophically realistic and morally
  fearless; in pursuing a course of action he was patient,
  determined, resourceful; in personal negotiation he was
  linguistically fluent, faultlessly polite, charming in manner and
  elegant in appearance.<br>
  <br>
  His first important act as foreign secretary shocked some
  diplomatic circles. In 1925 on behalf of his government he
  rejected the proposed Geneva Protocol in a speech to the Council
  of the League of Nations, not so much because it required
  compulsory arbitration of international disputes as because it
  was the Council which was to decide what action member states
  should take to enforce the authority of the League in time of
  crisis. He tempered the effect of this rejection by suggesting
  that the best way in theory to deal with situations as they arose
  was to &laquo;supplement the Covenant by making special
  arrangements in order to meet special needs&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  The road to Locarno now lay open. <a href=
  "../1926/index.html">Gustav Stresemann</a>, the German foreign
  minister, and <a href="../1926/index.html">Aristide Briand</a>,
  the French foreign minister, were willing to travel the road with
  him. After meticulous preparation during the summer of 1925,
  representatives of seven powers - Great Britain, Germany, France,
  Belgium, Italy, Poland, and Czechoslovakia - met at Locarno in
  southern Switzerland on October 5, 1925. On Chamberlain's
  birthday, October 16, the foreign ministers initialed the
  documents known as the Locarno Agreements. Eight treaties or
  agreements in all, they included the Rhine Guarantee Pact (or
  &laquo;Locarno Pact&raquo;) with Germany, Belgium, France, Great
  Britain, and Italy as signatories; individual treaties of
  arbitration between Germany and former enemy nations; guarantee
  treaties involving France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; and a
  collective note on the entry of Germany into the League of
  Nations.<br>
  <br>
  Upon his return to London after the triumph at Locarno,
  Chamberlain was given an immense ovation, was made Knight of the
  Garter, and a year later, along with Stresemann and Briand, his
  two companions in diplomacy, was awarded the Nobel Peace
  Prize.<br>
  <br>
  In his later years in the foreign office Chamberlain dealt with
  vexing questions in China and Egypt. He displayed what firmness
  he could in defending British interests against encroachments of
  the Chinese Nationalists, but, lacking full cooperation from the
  United States and Japan, could forge no long-range solutions. To
  provide some permanent pattern for Anglo-Egyptian relations,
  Chamberlain drew up a draft of a treaty in 1927 which anticipated
  the treaty signed in the mid-thirties.<br>
  <br>
  Out of office in his last years, partly because he chose to
  provide opportunity for the young men in Parliament, Chamberlain
  still spoke with a commanding voice in the Commons. He was among
  the first to see potential danger in Hitler; he favored both the
  imposition of sanctions against Italy during the Abyssinian
  crisis and their removal when they failed to prevent an Italian
  victory.<br>
  <br>
  During these years he was also writing with a graceful pen. His
  <i>Down the Years</i> is part reminiscence, part character
  studies of great men he had known, part familiar essays. His
  <i>Politics from Inside</i> consists chiefly of letters he wrote
  to his stepmother from 1906 to 1914 to keep his ailing father
  informed of governmental and diplomatic events.<br>
  <br>
  On March 17, 1937, Austen Chamberlain died of apoplexy, the same
  affliction that had killed his father a month before World War I
  began.</p>
