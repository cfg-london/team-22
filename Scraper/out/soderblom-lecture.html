  <h2>The Role of the Church in Promoting Peace</h2>

  <p>It is my belief that "leaving ourselves in
  peace" with our self-conceit and evil passions does not lead to
  real peace. Peace can be reached only through fighting against
  the ancient Adam in ourselves and in others.</p>

  <p>Our generation has lived through not only a
  world catastrophe, but also through a violent inner revolution.
  People with unshakable faith in progress, believing that the
  world was on the road to Paradise, suddenly found themselves
  plunged into the darkest hell of hatred and duplicity. Filled
  with anguish, we asked ourselves whether the church, which had
  been called the Prince of Peace, had fulfilled its duty. Had we
  not sung on every Sunday "Glory be to God on high, and on earth
  peace, goodwill toward men"? Had we not pronounced on every
  Christmas Day "The boot and the bloodstained cloak worn by the
  soldier in battle shall be burnt and destroyed by fire... Eternal
  peace must be secured and sustained by law and justice"?</p>

  <p>Many of us in different countries and of
  different creeds, both in the Old World and in the New, asked
  ourselves this question and realized that more could be done for
  peace by a Christendom united at least in its most essential
  principle: to live according to the commandment of love. We also
  realized that ignorance should be dispelled and that religion and
  morality should be based on the following two major premises: (I)
  the commandment of love transcends all frontiers, as enunciated
  by the Savior in the parable of the Good Samaritan, the son of a
  hated neighboring people; and (2) the Christian concept of
  justice is generated by a continuous process of divine creation,
  as are the sanctity and the dissemination of Christian
  justice.</p>

  <p>The first attempts at cooperation by the
  churches came from different quarters: an organization was formed
  at Constance at the outbreak of the war, under the name of the
  World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the
  Churches; and a joint appeal to cooperate was issued in November,
  1914<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>, after difficult
  preparations, by churchmen in Scandinavia, Switzerland, The
  Netherlands, and the U. S. A. (these countries were then still
  neutral), and in Finland and Hungary. This appeal, however, was
  received with suspicion, scorn, and resistance - understandable
  in view of the circumstances. Our voices, not yet united in an
  Ecumenical Council<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> as they
  are today, were weak against the thunder of cannons. In the
  summer of 1917, I was traveling on the train from Stockholm to
  Uppsala, rather dispirited after recent disappointments. We had
  already decided to make arrangements for a meeting. It was to be
  a testimony by patriots of the two sides at war, showing that
  they possessed, besides loyalty to their own nation, something
  deeper, something fundamental and unifying, namely the Cross of
  the Savior. Not far from Uppsala, I picked up an English
  newspaper and saw on the first page: "The British Council for
  Promoting an International Christian Conference". I could hardly
  believe my eyes. This was precisely what we were planning here in
  the North. I sent them a telegram saying that our invitation was
  ready to be sent. I had already warned in a sermon against
  possible Pharisaism in neutral countries, but Providence could
  not be praised too highly for having saved the three Scandinavian
  countries from the deluge, even though it had not spared them the
  pain of witnessing it. After discussions and correspondence, the
  organization of the meeting was undertaken by three of us:
  myself, the Bishop of Oslo, an eminent and scrupulous person of
  outstanding culture, and the Bishop of Sj&auml;lland<sup><a href=
  "#footnote3">3</a></sup>, the indefatigable champion of the
  unification of churches.</p>

  <p>The joint invitation described the purpose
  of the congress as a declaration of Christian unity and an
  expression, before the world, of the belief that the values of
  Christendom transcend those of individual nations without in any
  way detracting from their importance. The causes of the war and
  the purely political measures for achieving peace were not to be
  discussed. The aim was to examine what the different churches
  could achieve in the struggle against war, and how they could
  bring about the proper state of mind or climate needed for better
  international understanding. Reckless nationalism had to be
  replaced by Christian brotherhood. The British association
  mentioned earlier, which was campaigning for a united Christian
  testimony, inquired whether such a conference could not be
  arranged in the neutral North. A number of articles subsequently
  appeared in <i>The Challenge</i><sup><a href=
  "#footnote4">4</a></sup>, suggesting that it was the duty of the
  churches to take the initiative since the Social Democratic
  Congress in Stockholm had now been postponed. As early as the
  middle of September <i>The Challenge</i> had "insisted in the
  strongest terms on a meeting of representatives from the most
  important Christian communities in all countries at war". The
  paper added: "Let the church take the lead in showing the world
  the unity of Christ's followers in their obedience to Him." A
  leading article in a later issue described such a conference as
  an inescapable duty, with unique possibilities in the present
  situation. As pleasantly surprised as ourselves, the paper
  requested further information about our intention to organize an
  international church assembly and published an article on the
  matter.</p>

  <p>In <i>Internationale Monatsschrift</i>
  Professor Adolf von Harnack<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>
  wrote recently: "We are delighted when noble patriotism is
  brought to light in this world of material interests, but poor
  indeed is the man who finds his highest ideals in patriotism
  alone or sees the nation as the epitome of all good. What a
  relapse from the time when we in this world experienced the
  presence of Jesus Christ among us! We should, therefore, strive
  with all our might for Christian unity of mankind and we should
  be generous in our small circles to prove that the brotherly
  unification of mankind is not an idealistic dream of utopians but
  a realistic aim, inseparable from the Gospel."</p>

  <p>Because of passport difficulties in the
  West, the assembly had to be restricted to churchmen from Norway,
  Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. The conference
  was held quietly in Uppsala<sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup>.
  Bishop Otto Jensen, Professor Morgenstierne, and Parson Eugene
  Hanssen<sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup> were among those
  Norwegians who could not come but who declared their support.
  Bishop Bernt St&oslash;ylen attended and reached our very hearts
  when speaking in Uppsala Cathedral. Other Norwegian
  representatives were the present Bishop Eivind Berggrav, Dean C.
  Hansteen, Secretary General Piene, and the present Parson
  Thvedt<sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup>. The Danish
  delegation of ten included the Bishop of Sj&auml;lland and Chief
  Librarian H. O. Lange<sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup>.
  Bishop L&ouml;negren from Sweden acted as vice-chairman. The
  sermon at the morning service was preached by Bishop Stadener,
  who is now the president of the Swedish Board of Education.
  Secretarial duties were effectively performed by the untiring
  Knut B. Westman, who had previously been in China but is at
  present a professor at Uppsala<sup><a href=
  "#footnote10">10</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>Bishop Otto Jensen wrote from Hamar: "I am
  delighted that the desire for peace and brotherliness is
  spreading within the Evangelical Church. Through unity and
  cooperation, the Evangelical Church, too, can become a world
  power. It is the Evangelical Church which in freedom, authority,
  and generous love, possesses the principles which can build the
  future on new foundations."</p>

  <p>Jens Gleditsch<sup><a href=
  "#footnote11">11</a></sup> sent a letter containing the seeds of
  the profound and thought-provoking speech he was to give later at
  the Ecumenical Conference in Stockholm in 1925.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the meeting in December,
  1917, was a declaration of faith in brotherhood, justice, and
  peace. In fact, I can still remember a young Norwegian churchman,
  a Swede, and a Dane composing in my library the brilliant
  sentences which have remained the tenets of the ecumenical
  revival.</p>

  <p>The Conference of Churches in Neutral
  Countries [Neutral Church Conference] issued statements on (1)
  the unity of Christians; (2) Christians and the life of society;
  and (3) Christians and the law. The documents, signed by
  Ostenfeld, St&oslash;ylen, and S&ouml;derblom, were issued for the
  consideration of the church and as a guide for her work.</p>

  <p>The supranational character of the
  Conference had an effect far greater than we had dared to hope.
  The mission also proved to be a harbinger and an implement of
  peace. The Christian mission is by its very nature supranational,
  a spiritual entity that addresses people as human beings and not
  as speakers of given languages and members of given races and
  nationalities. The mission's demand for freedom to fulfill our
  spiritual and Christian task was not respected by the Great War.
  The Neutral Conference addressed a letter to the Continuation
  Committee for missions, established in Edinburgh<sup><a href=
  "#footnote12">12</a></sup>. We later also approached through
  delegates those Christian and other bodies which were most
  closely interested in these problems. Our appeal was favorably
  received and led to the desired results on more than one
  occasion.</p>

  <p>I would like to quote now the three main
  points of the proclamation issued at the Uppsala meeting in
  December, 1917.</p>

  <p>"(1) The unity of Christians.</p>

  <p>When our Christian creed speaks of a
  universal holy church, it reminds us of the deep inner unity
  which all Christians possess in Christ and in the work of His
  spirit, irrespective of national and scriptural differences. We
  can say without ingratitude or unfaithfulness to the special
  gifts in Christian experience and thinking which each church has
  received from God throughout history, that this unity, found at
  its strongest at the Cross of Christ, can and must be improved in
  our way of life and in preaching.</p>

  <p>(2) Christians and community life.</p>

  <p>The great endeavor of the Christian
  community to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world
  can and must be realized by the Evangelical church in a spiritual
  way, through its preaching and its example. The church should
  represent the waking conscience of mankind. Together with the
  Christians in all nations at war, we are deeply aware of the
  incompatibility between war and the spirit of Christ, and we
  would, therefore, like to stress some main points regarding the
  part to be played by Christians in community life.</p>

  <p>(a) In the past, unfortunately, the church
  has often stressed differences rather than unifying factors, but
  she must now assert the ideals of Christian fraternity, condemn
  selfishness, and fully participate in efforts to remove the
  causes of war, whether these are of a social, economic, or
  political nature.</p>

  <p>(b) Christians should realize that they are
  partly responsible for public opinion and should serve love and
  truth in public, national, and international life, as well as in
  their personal relations. They should try to understand others,
  their thoughts, languages, and behavior.</p>

  <p>(c) The church must work for international
  understanding and for the settlement of international disputes
  through mediation and arbitration.</p>

  <p>(3) Christians and the law.</p>

  <p>According to the Christian point of view,
  our awareness of right and wrong is a divine gift, as are its
  outgrowths: law and civil order. Civil order, at least at a basic
  level, is a prerequisite for the efficient practice of the
  teaching of the Gospel. Every existing legal system is
  incomplete, requiring for its completion the development of moral
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>The church must, therefore, uphold the
  sanctity of law and promote its development in the name of
  Christ, both inside and outside national boundaries. She must,
  therefore, fight against all glorification of violence and
  against any force contrary to the rule of law, and she must
  preach that nations and communities, like individuals, must act
  according to ethical principles, basing their hopes for
  coexistence on the principles of truth, justice, and love.</p>

  <p>Wherever the church has erred in this
  respect she must humbly confess it and correct the mistakes.</p>

  <p>The framework of law has only a limited
  value in itself since it must be fitted with inner moral
  convictions for it to be effective. To create and foster such a
  state of Christian brotherly love, self-discipline, and justice
  constitute the main duty of the church in this field."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>These were the main themes of the
  Conference held in 1917.</p>

  <p>The doctrine of the sanctity of the
  judicial system, which was proclaimed in the annals of the
  Revelation but has since been often obscured or misinterpreted,
  received an unexpected and, if maintained, effective confirmation
  in a resolution put forward jointly by an Englishman, a German,
  and a Frenchman at the Ecumenical Council at Eisenach in
  1928<sup><a href="#footnote13">13</a></sup>, and approved both by
  the Universal Ecclesiastic World Federation and by the Ecumenical
  Council itself.</p>

  <p>The originator was the Bishop of
  Chichester, G. K. A. Bell<sup><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup>,
  well known to us from the Ecumenical Conference. He is not a
  politician. He is a priest in the true sense of the word. He has
  won respect for his opinions through his strong religious
  convictions and his indefatigable evangelical service. His words
  are weighed with care.</p>

  <p>His motion at Eisenach was supported by a
  German and a Frenchman, two of the noblest and most genuine
  representatives of contemporary Christianity. One was Dr. Walter
  Simons<sup><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup>, then president of
  the National Court of Law in Leipzig, who had been acting
  president of Germany between Ebert and Hindenburg. His papers
  were generally acknowledged as the most distinguished at the
  Stockholm meeting in 1925, and elsewhere as well. A French
  newspaper commented on the lofty thoughts that dwell behind his
  Goethe-like brow.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman was Professor Wilfred Monod
  from Paris<sup><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup>, of an
  apostolic nature, glowing with enthusiasm for his country and for
  truth, unity, and peace.</p>

  <p>It may be seen then that the resolution did
  not originate from irresponsible visionaries but from trustworthy
  men, deeply loyal to their people. This resolution is an act and
  it calls for action.</p>

  <p>The Eisenach Resolution contains the
  following four points, the first two of which agree with the
  message of the Stockholm meeting:</p>

  <p>"(1) We welcome wholeheartedly the solemn
  declaration made by the leading statesmen of the world in the
  names of their nations that they condemn war as a means of
  settling international disputes and denounce it as a tool of
  international power politics. We agree, furthermore, that the
  solution of all disputes or conflicts must never be sought by any
  means other than peaceful ones.</p>

  <p>(2) We believe that the settlement of
  international disputes by war is irreconcilable with the spirit
  of Christ, and therefore irreconcilable with the spirit and
  conduct of His church."</p>

  <p>The third point relates more closely to the
  present situation.</p>

  <p>"(3) We are convinced that the time must
  come when existing treaties have to be revised in the interest of
  peace, but we maintain that all international disputes and
  conflicts which cannot be solved through diplomacy or mediation
  must be settled through arbitration by the International Court of
  Justice or some other court of law acknowledged by both
  parties."</p>

  <p>The fourth point, the most original and
  far-reaching in this resolution, not only states a magnificent
  generalization, but also establishes a rule which is a direct
  consequence of our Christian faith, a rule which has therefore
  won the approval of the church and which is to be followed
  literally at critical moments when war threatens, for there will
  always be disputes between nations, as there are between
  individuals and groups. The intention is to extend the legal
  system in such a way as to preclude the desperate course of war
  between nations, in the same manner in which blood feuds have
  been abolished and tribal fighting stopped in law-abiding
  communities.</p>

  <p>This year something has taken place which
  would not have been thought possible before the World War: a more
  general formulation of the fourth point was accepted by the
  Lambeth Conference, the international council of Anglican bishops
  held every ten years.</p>

  <p>To elucidate the aims of the fourth point I
  propose to discuss this point in greater detail.</p>

  <p>"(4) The legal system is the work of God,
  and it is the duty of the church to stress its sanctity and to
  work for its extension beyond national boundaries. The church
  must uphold the binding nature of any contract obliging nations
  to settle disputes through arbitration or legal channels. Thus,
  if the government of the church's own country disregards this
  obligation to submit a dispute to such a procedure, the church
  must condemn any war developing from this situation, and must
  disclaim, in both word and action, any connection with it."</p>

  <p>What? Desert the fatherland when it goes to
  war? Forsake it in its fatal hour? Oppose the legal government of
  the country? I was not at Eisenach myself, but I assure you that
  our brothers there carefully considered this proposal before God
  and their conscience prior to submitting, accepting, and
  referring it to all accessible church communities in the world. I
  had already been told about the idea in May, 1929, when I was in
  London in connection with a peace lecture<sup><a href=
  "#footnote17">17</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>We have to examine this matter more
  closely.</p>

  <p>Jesus said: "Render therefore unto Caesar
  the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are
  God's."<sup><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup> St.Paul wrote:
  "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
  no power but of God."<sup><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup> St.
  Peter wrote: "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
  Lord's sake."<sup><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup> This rule
  was valid even when Nero was emperor of Rome. Romantics and
  unthinking individuals have taken offense at such words. But
  society and history are not built of romantic effusions and
  dreamy ideas but by labor according to the dictates of conscience
  and the order of law. There is one universal tenet: "We ought to
  obey God rather than men."<sup><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup>
  However, it is not this tenet to which we are here appealing. It
  is always a grave act to shake one's loyalties. While our entire
  civilization is rocking and darkness is spreading over its
  future, it would be more dangerous than ever to alter its
  foundations, even though they are imperfect and in need of
  improvement. Let us bear in mind the words of St. Paul: "For the
  mystery of iniquity doth already work: only there is one that
  restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way."<sup><a href=
  "#footnote21">21</a></sup> And who would take the responsibility
  of removing the sole restraint from lawlessness? No, what we are
  recommending is not a breach of loyalty; on the contrary, it is
  obedience to a higher obligation. A supranational judicial system
  is being built. Binding treaties between nations who are
  committed to conciliation or arbitration when disputes arise
  rather than to war represent the foundations of a larger edifice
  of the rule of law. What we do advocate is obedience to the rule
  of Christ and His apostles instructing us to respect civic law.
  We do not limit this to our own people or province. All people
  and all nations must participate in the construction of a
  supranational legal system, which, according to our Christian
  doctrine, is a continuation of God's creation. And when this
  legal obligation has been fully realized, Christians and the
  church must unswervingly observe it, even in case of
  conflict.</p>

  <p>It may seem unwarranted to talk about such
  matters here in the North where, on the basis of the past hundred
  years or so, we can hardly imagine a conflict among ourselves.
  However, we must be loyal to our brothers throughout the world in
  this matter, as in any service rendered in the cause of peace.
  Does anyone believe that a Scandinavian government would break an
  agreement and refuse an offer by another nation to conciliate or
  arbitrate between them? If anything as inconceivable as this were
  to happen, people would appoint a new government which would
  uphold agreements solemnly concluded by king and parliament. The
  situation is the same in some other countries.</p>

  <p>Will the church in all countries which have
  concluded such binding agreements decide to apply the biblical
  doctrines and thus support the Eisenach Resolution? If so, an
  essential gain will have been achieved for the holy. cause of
  peace.</p>

  <p>But let us now return to 1917. The Uppsala
  meeting in December, 1917, was intended to be only a preparation.
  A larger meeting was planned for the spring or winter of 1918. It
  was to include also the church representatives from the countries
  at war. It was to be held in Oslo. In this connection, I would
  like to quote from Bishop Tandberg's answer to my letters at the
  beginning of 1918: "I understand clearly that it is important for
  the sake of Christ's church that we should, during the present
  conflict in the world, unambiguously preach Christian unity which
  stands above all worldly disagreements. It is, therefore,
  desirable that prominent churchmen of different creeds should
  assemble in the near future and form a conference at which, in a
  spirit of concord, in prayer, and by serious negotiations, they
  can discuss what should be done in order to help virtue and
  fraternity triumph over the evil passions which have for years
  now made enemies of the greatest civilized nations of the world.
  Under the present conditions, an international church conference
  will undeniably have a full agenda. I am willing to sign the
  appeal which you sent me."</p>

  <p>Despite food rationing, Oslo was prepared
  to accommodate the representatives. The Bishop of Oslo wrote
  that, if Oslo were chosen, "I will do everything in my power to
  arrange the meeting in the most suitable way." He further
  testified to the warm interest of the King of Norway and the
  Prime Minister<sup><a href="#footnote22">22</a></sup> in an
  ecclesiastical world conference. Speaking of the Prime Minister,
  he said: "He would like to obtain a grant from Parliament for the
  meeting to be held in Oslo so that the Conference would bear an
  official stamp which would enhance its importance, without
  detracting from its character as a meeting called by private
  initiative."</p>

  <p>Parson Eug&egrave;ne Hanssen urged me to
  devote all my energy to ensure that the Conference be "held in
  such a way that its proclamations will be authoritative and
  worthy of the Evangelical church, and can thus be transmitted to
  the various Christian church communities. As representatives of
  the Gospel, our churches stand in an international pulpit,
  preaching an international message."</p>

  <p>Bishop St&oslash;ylen characterized the
  meeting in Uppsala as "a sign of spring in the dark winter, which
  stimulated a longing for more". He continued, on February 8,
  1918, with words truly worthy of a servant of the church: "It is
  to be hoped that these cruel times will not last too long, for it
  seems that anger is rising within the people, dominating their
  thoughts and turning them against all community order, a
  development which is understandable to me in view of the iniquity
  and brutality, both spoken and active, which pervade the
  community and which have reached a peak because of the fear of
  war. We seem to have a long way to go before we realize the great
  teachings of our Master."</p>

  <p>Although Evangelical churchmen from both
  sides, from Germany, England, and other countries, had assembled
  for three days in Bern in 1915<sup><a href=
  "#footnote23">23</a></sup>, together with representatives from
  neutral countries, the efforts to bring about the great
  international church council in Oslo were unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>After countless setbacks and difficulties,
  and after the unfortunate failure of the labor movement's efforts
  to bring about a common meeting, responsible patriots eventually
  managed to assemble in 1919 at Oud Wassenaar near The Hague for
  the first time since the World War<sup><a href=
  "#footnote24">24</a></sup>. With aching hearts, losses in their
  families, and destitution in their nations, and with
  understandable distrust evoked by opposition and falsehood, they
  still joined together in saying "Our Father" and "Forgive us our
  trespasses", and in brotherly consultation. Those who assembled
  were in fact Evangelical churchmen, most of them servants of the
  much decried people's churches and the so-called state churches.
  It was once more the Evangelical church, weakened though it was
  by discord and rightly criticized for its schisms, which was the
  first community or group of people in the world to bring together
  responsible men and women from both camps after the Great
  War.</p>

  <p>This was followed by the ecumenical
  revival's baptism of fire in Geneva in 1920<sup><a href=
  "#footnote25">25</a></sup>. The Spirit fought and was victorious.
  I shall not pause here to examine the tortuous path traced out
  during the next few years. The miracle occurred in 1925 in
  Stockholm<sup><a href="#footnote26">26</a></sup>. In all its
  history, the church had never before seen representatives from
  all over the Christian world united in sincere self-searching and
  in a common resolve which can be expressed by the prayer of St.
  Bridget: "Lord, show me the way and make me willing to take
  it!"</p>

  <p>After the Stockholm meeting, the Evangelical Lutheran World
  Convention was consolidated here in Oslo.</p>

  <p>The Continuation Committee founded in Stockholm, which now, in
  accordance with the new and extended constitution approved this
  year, represents the Ecumenical Council, has held important
  gatherings in Bern in 1926, in Winchester in 1927, and in Prague
  in 1928 where the Norwegian member of the Ecumenical Council,
  Professor Lyder Brun<sup><a href="#footnote27">27</a></sup>, put
  the seamen's cause before the meeting - a matter since raised
  also by the League of Nations, at Eisenach in 1929 and at
  Ch&ecirc;xbres in 1930. The so-called utopian idea has become a
  reality. The Ecumenical Council officially or semiofficially
  represents the larger part of Christendom; that is to say, two of
  the main divisions of the Holy Catholic (General) and Apostolic
  Church: the Greek and Russian Eastern Orthodox Church, and the
  Evangelical Western Church which, even in its creed, confesses to
  believing in and thus belonging to "The Holy (General) Catholic
  Church". The third main denomination, the Roman, has not
  considered it possible to take part officially in this ecumenical
  work because of the traditions of the Papal See and of the ever
  increasing demarcation and isolation resulting from the Vatican
  Concilium of 1870<sup><a href="#footnote28">28</a></sup>. All
  three are a continuation of the earliest Christendom. Each
  considers that it is following the work of the Master in the best
  and most faithful way. Critical examination may perhaps reveal
  which are the most deeply basic principles of revelation for
  each. The unifying factor for the Greek church lies in a
  language, for the Roman church in a city, and for the Evangelical
  church in a joyous and inspiring message. We possess encouraging
  testimonies from many Roman Catholic laymen, particularly those
  belonging to the intelligentsia, and also from Roman priests and
  theologians who follow our endeavors with sympathy and good
  wishes. It is true that the Pope's 1928 Encyclical of the Twelfth
  Day<a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> forbids Roman
  Catholics to take part in our ecumenical assemblies, these
  assemblies having been condemned. However, our endeavors to unite
  are not ignored in a steadily growing section of Roman Catholic
  literature. As regards a future rapprochement, some connections
  already exist and others are being established. Thoughts are - so
  far - free.</p>

  <p>The various church groups within Evangelical Christianity,
  such as Evangelical Lutherans, Reformists or Calvinists or
  Presbyterians, Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and the
  like, are not ruled by a common absolute government as are the
  Benedictines, Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits, Roman Catholic
  parish priests, orders of brotherhood, and various other groups
  (not always free of disagreements), and the nationally
  established Roman people's churches or state churches - all of
  which are ruled by the papal government. Nevertheless, our
  meetings have extensively clarified the differences between us
  and manifested better than we had dared to hope the essential
  spiritual and religious unity within the whole Evangelical
  church.</p>

  <p>The Ecumenical Council is as magnificent an achievement as the
  League of Nations. The seat of the latter is in Geneva, a city
  situated in an earthly paradise amid great Roman Catholic
  nations, its best traditions still inspired by the great genius
  and ideals of Calvin<sup><a href="#footnote30">30</a></sup>.
  Above the entrance to the hall where the Assembly of the League
  of Nations has up to now held its meetings, we can read the
  words: "Salle de la R&eacute;formation".</p>

  <p>Geneva is also the city which has conferred domiciliary rights
  on the Ecumenical Council. This conjunction calls to mind Adolf
  von Harnack's greeting to the Ecumenical Conference in 1925:
  "This council is the synthesis of the church's history."</p>

  <p>The one hundred members of the Ecumenical Council are divided
  into five sections. The president of the first, the Orthodox
  section, is, by virtue of his office, the ecumenical patriarch in
  Constantinople since he holds a spiritual authority acknowledged
  by the entire Orthodox Christianity. It was Constantinople which
  on its own initiative, and quite apart from our efforts, issued a
  missive in 1920 concerning "Koinonia ton Ekklesion", a church
  community or a church union<a href=
  "#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>. This aimed at enabling the
  churches to fulfill their duty of love in times of crisis and to
  promote peace regardless of the diverse creeds involved. Exactly
  the same thought had inspired our endeavors in the North and
  motivated the petition presented at the meeting of the World
  Alliance in Oud Wassenaar near The Hague in 1919. The patriarch
  of Constantinople carries out the duties of his presidency in the
  Ecumenical Council through his deputy, the metropolitan of
  Thyateira<a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>, who lives in
  London.</p>

  <p>I was succeeded as president of the European section, or
  rather of the continental and northern section, by the jurist Dr.
  Kapler<a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>, of Berlin, a most
  distinguished German churchman, elected not in his capacity of
  chairman of the German Church Union but by the European section
  of the Ecumenical Council. It was he who, after the great
  International Church Council of Copenhagen in 1922, expressed at
  the meeting of the Ecumenical Council at H&auml;lsingborg the
  aphorism later repeated many times: "Lehre scheidet, Dienst
  vereint." ("Doctrine separates, service unites.")</p>

  <p>We participate heart and soul in the holy task, initiated by
  the Protestant Episcopal church in America, of establishing faith
  and order, fraternal consultation, concord, and, as far as
  possible, unity in creed and church statutes. Mikael Hertzberg,
  an ardent adherent of this cause, took part in the great meeting
  in Lausanne in 1927<a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a>. He
  died shortly after seeing his aspirations fulfilled. I prayed
  today in the Capella Johannea, belonging to the Church of the
  Priests, which he founded.</p>

  <p>As we can see, doctrinal differences are being reduced.
  However, Christians should not wait for full agreement before
  they start practicing the duty of love imposed by the Master. The
  pure light of the Revelation is perceived differently by
  different eyes, and the church has been divided into many parts
  by human shortcomings, different historical conditions, and by
  the church's neglect and distortion of doctrines during certain
  periods of time. While we on the one hand pursue long-range
  discussions concerning our holy faith and the church ordinances,
  we must, on the other hand, follow <i>immediately</i> the command
  of our Master. On Judgment Day we will not be questioned about
  the propositions of the catechism or about the dogmas and
  ordinances of the church; we will simply be told: "Inasmuch as ye
  did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
  me."<a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a> Christ's preaching
  itself was concerned with a better interpretation of the will of
  God and with the emphasis of the supremacy of God. No result of
  the Stockholm meeting has been more obvious and noteworthy than
  the realization that, according to the Gospel, God must be first
  in people's hearts and must thus also rule over the people, over
  groups in society, and over the nations themselves.</p>

  <p>Resuming our survey from East to West, we
  come now to the British section comprising the ecumenically
  minded Christianity in Great Britain, Ireland, and the British
  Commonwealth, and in the Anglican church in all parts of the
  world, even outside the British Empire. As in the case of
  Orthodox Christianity, the president has been chosen by virtue of
  his office. The Archbishop of Canterbury holds the oldest and
  most widely recognized position in Anglo-Saxon Christianity. It
  was the present Archbishop of Canterbury<a href=
  "#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a> who expressed the principle of
  our peace work during the war: "God can never be an Ally, only
  the Supreme Lord., Bishop Woods, who has been the deputy for
  Canterbury since 1920, continues the great tradition of social
  concern connected with such Anglican names as Maurice, Kingsley,
  Westcott, Lightfoot, Scott Holland, and Gore<sup><a href=
  "#footnote37">37</a></sup>.<a href="#footnote37"></a></p>

  <p>The fourth section, the American, brings to
  the Ecumenical Council something of the strong active idealism
  which, in addition to other features, characterizes the New World
  and which we in Europe often misjudge or fail to understand. The
  president of the American section is Parkes Cadman<a href=
  "#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a>, formerly chairman of the North
  American Church Federation. Through his Sunday broadcasts, his
  voice has reached the ears - and we hope also the minds and
  hearts - of many more people than that of any other preacher in
  the history of the church.</p>

  <p>The chairman in Lausanne in 1927, Bishop
  Charles Brent<a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a> from
  Buffalo, now deceased, was also one of the main figures at the
  Ecumenical Conference in 1925. It was he who, after stressing in
  Stockholm his faith in world peace in the name of Christ, added:
  "I may be a fool, but if so, I am God's fool."</p>

  <p>The fifth section is made up of old and new
  churches in the Orient and elsewhere which do not belong to any
  of the four sections just mentioned. A president has not yet been
  elected. In the largest section, the European one, there are two
  vice-presidents. The first is the Bishop of Haderslev, Valdemar
  Ammundsen<a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a>, one of the
  experienced leaders of the ecumenical work and president of the
  World Alliance for International Friendship founded at Constance
  at the outbreak of the war, which now has committees in over
  thirty countries. The preliminaries for the Ecumenical Conference
  were initiated by this World Alliance for International
  Friendship whose devoted secretary-general, Lord
  Dickinson<a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a>, of London, is
  dedicating his life to its cause. The two organizations work
  closely together, sustained in large part by these two
  personalities.</p>

  <p>The second vice-president of the European
  section is a Frenchman, Professor Wilfred Monod, of Paris. It was
  he who declared in Stockholm that the voice of ecumenical
  Christianity was strong enough to appeal to the other great
  internationals:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"In communion with Chrysostom and Origen,
  with Pascal and St. Francis of Assisi, with Luther and
  Livingstone<a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>, let us first
  turn to our brothers separated from us, the Roman Catholics,
  whose seats among us have remained empty in the physical sense,
  but whose spiritual presence is deeply felt..</p>

  <p>Let us also turn to the founders of the
  noble International of Intellect, the scholars, philosophers,
  professors, and educators - the heirs of these proud martyrs of
  independent thinking who once laid the foundations of modern
  knowledge... The Church of Jesus Christ unanimously asserts that,
  though the methods may vary with the degree of certainty in
  arriving at valid conclusions, a single spirit must still rule
  the realm of knowledge - the spirit of humble acceptance of
  established facts and of loyal devotion to truth, which alone
  enlightens and liberates.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to the International of
  Labor, organized in behalf of the nameless workers who once
  included Jesus the carpenter... May they cease confusing the
  eternal Gospel with the church which today strives, as did John
  the Baptist, to be only "a voice", a voice testifying to the
  Savior.</p>

  <p>Let us turn League of Nations, this
  prodigious institution embodying only new concept that has
  emerged from World War. It is still weak like the Infant in
  Bethlehem's manger and Him threatened by Herod's assassins. But,
  Messiah, destined unfold banner which will gather together all
  peoples earth, regardless race, color, and religion...</p>

  <p>Finally, let us turn to the governments.
  Without entering the political arena, the Christian Church must
  assert itself as the indomitable prophet and interpreter here on
  earth of the moral Law, which is imposed on national communities
  just as it is on individual consciences...</p>

  <p>Let us follow the example of the first
  disciples and send forth messengers two by two from Stockholm to
  the cities and the towns, announcing like the prophet<a href=
  "#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a>: 'Yet forty days and Nineveh
  shall be overthrown!' Without national and international
  repentance, our civilization will perish!"</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In accordance with the new constitution,
  the four presidents act in turn for two years at a time.</p>

  <p>The task of this council is that originally
  planned, namely:</p>

  <p>(1) To be a mouthpiece for Christianity and
  to express the feelings of the Christian conscience. How sorely
  we lacked such a joint testimony during the World War! The Pope
  spoke more than once in a way which did express the reaction and
  desire of the Christian conscience. But he represents only a part
  of Christianity. The Ecumenical Council speaks for her two other
  main divisions. Perhaps the day will come when Roman Catholics
  will also be represented in the Ecumenical Council.</p>

  <p>In any case, organization is not the most
  important factor here. I had already suggested in my proposal in
  1919 and 1920 that this Ecumenical Council ought not to speak
  with an official external authority, but should inspire response
  and results from its words by the method spoken of by Paul the
  Apostle in II Cor. 4:2 when he says: "We, by manifestation of the
  truth, commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight
  of God." The truth has a covert or overt ally in the heart of man
  and in his deeds. One need not be the pope, nor a member of the
  Ecumenical Council, nor hold any office or distinguished position
  in the church for his voice to be heard - even more widely than
  the voice of any authority - if at a given moment he has the
  calling and ability to express what conscience and truth demand.
  However, the world being what it is, we cannot dispense with
  organizations. The future and authority of this Ecumenical
  Council does not depend on the individuals in it or on what
  offices they hold, but on its spiritual character and on what it
  says and does.</p>

  <p>We are not satisfied with merely bringing
  together those inspired by zeal for this noble endeavor. We want
  the churches to be officially or at least semiofficially
  represented - and this is truly difficult to bring about. Why
  struggle with the present church system, rigid as it has been for
  centuries and, if not immovable, at least very difficult to
  handle? The prophets, the Savior, and St. Paul were not called by
  any church. They were called by God, and they spoke on behalf of
  God. We must listen to them and their followers, even though it
  may be painful, humiliating, and even contrary to our thoughts
  and habits. But we must also take care that the voice of
  Christian faith, love, and hope be heard. In the preparations for
  the Stockholm Assembly and since then, we have been anxious not
  to form outside the churches any special establishment of chosen
  people, but to accept the churches as they are. We know that
  personal qualities and the Spirit are everything - at least the
  most important in God's realm. But we want the churches as such
  to take part for the simple reason that we believe we have
  discovered in the ecumenical revival something which has been
  neglected, namely the main substance of the preaching of Jesus
  Christ: the will of God, His supremacy, and also in this
  connection, the unity of Christianity, reached not through
  compromises and alliances but by immersing ourselves in the truth
  and experiencing the great universal wonder.</p>

  <p>Among the declarations issued by the
  Ecumenical Council are the pastoral letter from Bern on Christ
  the King, the testimony about the cause of the World War, the
  Eisenach Resolution, and the appeal to the conscience of the
  world concerning the cruel fight against religion in Russia.</p>

  <p>(2) In addition, this Ecumenical Council is
  called upon to be an organ of action. For the first time in the
  history of the church, the greater part of Christendom has been
  united in a common undertaking: the Social-Ethical Institute, for
  many years now active in Geneva.</p>

  <p>The Social-Ethical Institute has a
  scientific task. And is it not unbelievable and magnificent that
  the churches are united in a common task which is scientific in
  nature? That task is to determine the Gospel's relevance to and
  verdict on modern conditions such as industrialization and
  nationalism.</p>

  <p>We do not believe with Socrates that man
  does what is right because he knows it to be right, but we must
  agree with the philosopher in that man needs to know what is
  right before he acts. Man's understanding is partial, and the
  Savior said in his farewell speech, in the Gospel according to
  John, that he would send the spirit of truth to lead Christianity
  along the right path. The greatness of Christ is due in no small
  part to the fact that he did not merely issue certain rules and
  doctrines dependent on the special conditions of His time and the
  prevailing cultural atmosphere, which would soon have become
  obsolete; he gave Himself, His person, and a doctrine of
  goodwill, which will be forever valid and which cannot be
  circumvented by any shortcuts or shortsighted simplifications.
  This doctrine should be applied earnestly and with mental acumen
  in every age, and particularly in today's unparalleled
  socio-ethical revolution. This is the mission of the Institute.
  In addition, however, there are some purely practical tasks such
  as the exchange of help and research, and the collection and
  processing of material. A young French colleague came to us from
  the International Labor Office to deliver a greeting from the
  head of the Office: "We have the personnel; we ask you for
  leading ideas." Mankind in fact cannot do without them; it cannot
  manage on short-term purpose alone. Of the many active
  international commissions, I have mentioned only one; namely,
  that which has been given the task of formulating a code of
  ethics.</p>

  <p>We have some outstanding personalities in
  our movement, but the ecumenical revival should not be limited to
  one circle of priests and laymen, even though distinguished and
  increasing in numbers. It must force its way outward and become
  the property of society, a concern of all churches and all
  people. I can tell you from experience that there are at least
  two groups to whom hardly any Christian and spiritual question
  has been of more interest. I am thinking, on the one hand, of
  ordinary men, of the kind whose thoughts are candid, sincere, and
  free of conventional entanglements - and I could tell you about
  many. I have also had the privilege of talking to and hearing the
  opinions of many a statesman in connection with this question. I
  shall exclude those in the North, and mention Jonkheer van
  Karnebeek, Gustave Ador, Chuard, Frank B. Kellogg, Herbert
  Hoover, Charles Evans Hughes, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/index.html">Lord Robert Cecil</a>
  (Viscount of Chelwood), Ramsay MacDonald, Lord Parmoor, Hans
  Luther, Walter Simons, Paul von Hindenburg, Curtius, Thomas
  Masaryk, Benei, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1926/index.html">Aristide Briand</a>, Gaston
  Doumergue, and Albert Thomas. Without exception, all these men
  appreciated the weight and importance of this matter. Lloyd
  George once said that if the church communities of Great Britain
  were unanimous about a question, no government could oppose
  it<a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the duty of the church
  toward the cause of peace includes three essential tasks:</p>

  <p>(1) To inculcate the spirit of fraternity
  and truth into the heart of mankind.</p>

  <p>One of the bases of Christianity is the
  doctrine of our fraternity in Christ. Why should this doctrine
  not be inculcated as early and as generally as are the other
  Christian doctrines? Every elementary textbook in Christendom
  ought to contain something similar to the following, which
  appears in a modern catechism: "Just as law and justice prevent
  violence within the state, so shall they also rule between the
  states and prevent war. Christ's commandment to love one another
  must, therefore, be spread among all people. Therein lies the way
  to peace. All individuals and all nations should strive toward
  this end to the best of their ability." "The love of one's own
  people and one's country should not be defiled by unfriendly
  feelings against other people." Such inculcation is a duty even
  of the authors of history textbooks. As is widely known, the
  ecumenical movement has always included in its program
  cooperation with historians and teachers of all countries in
  expunging from textbooks everything that breeds contempt and
  hatred of another country, along with all untrue information
  concerning other nations. This subject was discussed at the
  International Congress of Historians in Oslo in 1928.</p>

  <p>(2) The church must itself realize and
  impress upon others the sanctity of wise and fixed ordinances and
  unconditional obligations which extend justice beyond the
  boundaries of nations, thereby substituting cooperation for
  previous self-assertion.</p>

  <p>Of the two people who have been honored
  this year by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament,
  one, already world famous, is associated with peaceful endeavors
  in politics and the other is a participant in the work of the
  church for peace, the supranational validity of the commandment
  of love and of law in the name of Christ. Here our Northern
  countries have had something to say. In 1920, Norway and Sweden
  suggested a move toward conciliation and arbitration. This was
  proposed at the first meeting of the League of Nations Assembly
  after consultations between their two governments and Denmark's.
  Later at the eighth regular session of the Assembly in 1927, the
  draft of an international agreement on arbitration was presented
  by the Norwegian delegate. A further draft, drawn up on the
  initiative of the Swedish foreign minister, was presented in
  December, 1927, to the secretary-general of the League of
  Nations. All these played a part in the creation of the General
  Act<a href="#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>, whose three chapters
  on conciliation, judicial settlement of disputes, and
  arbitration, along with a fourth chapter on provisions, build up
  to an impressive climax.</p>

  <p>The law should possess firm foundations
  embedded in the minds of the people. One of my correspondents,
  whose life's work is involved in the international administration
  of law, writes to me from The Hague: "Even if the available means
  were more effective than they are at present, experience shows
  that, despite all efforts, institutions run an increasing risk of
  losing their vitality and their absolute objectivity because
  governments unfortunately tend to relinquish future benefits for
  present ones. It is, therefore, only by the support of a movement
  like this that the idea of peace can be made fruitful. Only
  through contact with such a movement can the work for
  political-legal peace be prevented from running on the wrong
  track."</p>

  <p>"Man is defiled by that which comes from
  within him. For it is from within, from the hearts of men, that
  their evil thoughts arise." If peace is to become a reality on
  our earth, it must be founded in the hearts of the people. To
  whom should this task belong if not to the church, which calls
  itself the Prince of Peace and has as its watchword what is also
  a divine promise: "Glory to God in the highest and on earth
  peace." The human heart is fickle, and therefore peace must,
  according to the words of the prophets, be safeguarded by law and
  order, by a supranational judicial system which has the power to
  assert itself against nations endangering peace and which,
  without bias or compromise, holds justice to be the highest law.
  Nevertheless, any such legal system, however wise and strong,
  remains a mere shell if not supported by mankind's concern for
  peace and liberty. The people are - and should, through an
  expanding legal system, further develop into - the limbs of a
  single organism. They must cease to be antagonistic, suspiciously
  spying on each other. But if a body does not possess a soul, it
  differs little from a machine. In this instance, the soul is the
  love and justice of the Gospel, not the demon of selfishness.
  Consequently, all efforts toward peace should begin in our own
  hearts. How can people without discipline and self-control
  promote peace in the world?</p>

  <p>(3) It follows from the point just made
  that we must strip the armed forces of their previous role which
  has been fostered by our fear, our lust for power, and by our
  serving Mammon, and we must make them the safeguard of security,
  peace, and liberty, just as the police force is the safeguard
  within the state.</p>

  <p>While I was speaking at the peace assembly
  in the Engelbrekt Church<a href="#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a>
  on Armistice Day, November II, a friend in San Francisco, who had
  witnessed the world catastrophe, sat writing to me about the
  moment when the World War came to an end and about its
  commemoration. He used these words :</p>

  <p>"The world has not yet drunk its fill of
  blood sacrificed for human vanity, sin, envy, and tyranny. The
  cease-fire was not accompanied by trumpet blasts, banners, and
  jubilation, but limped its way from grave to grave, from line to
  line. We can still hear the death rattle of our wounded friends.
  Weapons have lost their splendor and fascination; human
  bankruptcy is complete; people are tired, worn out, only glad to
  have escaped death-humanity lays down its arms. This is not
  victory; this is defeat on all sides. Ragged, sick, hungry, and
  disillusioned, men wander aimlessly through devastated fields. In
  the silence of armistice they wend their way, thinking of those
  at home and those left out there. The great of the world have
  fallen, organized power is broken, old gods are sated with blood
  and hatred. Old clothes have to be burnt; the bloodstained
  uniform is no longer of use - it can no longer frighten children
  or disguise youth. Decorations are no longer envied as a proof of
  bravery; they are bonds, connections with a dying generation.
  Everyone fought, everyone was brave, everyone needed courage to
  fight. Now nothing is left. Things went too far. Mankind realized
  that the whole world had to find a new direction. The end came
  just before Advent. All Saints Day saw them struggling with
  death. Armistice Day saw men passing on in great numbers to those
  other lands which cannot be mapped by physics, mathematics, and
  medicine.</p>

  <p>Time goes by. The broken cannon which ended
  in a bush on the battlefield is no longer horrifying. It is
  covered in moss, and small flowers raise their wondering heads
  through the spokes of its wheels. The brasswork becomes as green
  with verdigris as the fields in the spring, and birds build their
  nests in the muzzle. Perhaps young couples seeking privacy sit
  down on the gun carriage and talk about their dreams, love, and
  future - words befitting the eternal melody of the world in
  spring, murmured around the tools of death. The weapons have
  forgotten the taste of blood, and death rattles are no longer
  heard, for those who uttered them sleep beneath the earth.
  Perhaps the moldering hearts of those who were taken from us now
  give life to the flower sprouting forth twelve years later. But
  the dream was tom from the heart so suddenly. The war was to
  teach hatred instead of love. The hand which wanted to caress was
  to be clenched instead, the lip which yearned to speak of good
  was to wither. Life was stolen and death awarded in its place.
  The flowers do not speak of revenge; they spring up from hearts
  warmly remembered; rooted in bitter reality, they grow in a new
  dream.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they are still here - not the great
  army of the slain but the multitude who sacrificed everything -
  those so far away, 'higher than thoughts can reach', but yet so
  near that they can whisper into our hearts without words. Were
  their sacrifices in vain? Do the fatherless, the widows, the
  brotherless now see a happier world, a more truthful world? Is
  there less hatred, less envy, less despair? Does the message of
  peace resound outside the portals of the church? Do we now
  stretch out our hands to one another more willingly? Have the
  creations of genius, which enable us to send words around the
  world in a few seconds and to use transport to break down
  distance - have these gifts of God bound us closer together than
  before?</p>

  <p>The question is not flung out from a great
  teacher to any particular pupil in the class; it creeps of itself
  into anxious and thoughtful hearts quietly pondering the duty of
  man and the future of our race.</p>

  <p>The flying colors and the rumbling drums
  are spread out beneath fresh winds and sunny skies. The clop of
  horses' hooves, the beat of drums, the blast of shiny trumpets go
  before. Men follow. Not those between thirty-five and fifty -
  they have no such desire. They are not taken in. But the growing
  ones, the young to whom new gods are to be given, new ideas, new
  dreams, new tasks - the youth that is to build a new world? Poor
  world!"</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So said my friend in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>By such matters are our faith and the
  endurance of love tested. We must work and not despair.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the resolution of the
  Ecumenical Council, the next Ecumenical Conference - that is to
  say, the next general examination of the peace mission of the
  church - is to be held in London in 1935<a href=
  "#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>. Will the obligation of the
  church to peace then be investigated more profoundly and more
  generally? Will the desire for brotherhood be stronger? The
  armaments of distrust and fear reduced? The supranational
  judicial system built on stronger foundations? Will the church be
  more united, and so better equipped to fulfill its duty toward
  peace?</p>

  <p>If efforts toward peace are to get
  anywhere, they must be more realistic than in the past. The
  question is not whether one is orthodox in conforming to some
  peace formula or other, but whether <i>one does something to
  promote peace</i>. No road to peace exists other than that of the
  narrow path whose name is conversion. All men of goodwill ought
  to unite in perceiving this. We must not allow ourselves to be
  lulled into any monistic peace dream. We must struggle to win
  peace, struggle against schism, against the mad measures of fear,
  against the ruthlessness of Mammon, against hatred and injustice.
  This fight must be directed primarily toward the primitive man
  within us. Impatient minds may perhaps find such a concept
  hopeless, pessimistic, and old-fashioned. But we must face
  reality. The noble and practical measures for world peace will be
  realized only to the extent to which the supremacy of God
  conquers the hearts of the people.</p>

  <p>May I here also cite what A. F. Ozanam
  wrote eighty years ago in <i>La Civilisation au cinqui&egrave;me
  si&egrave;cle</i><a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>: "It is
  often good to humble men, but never to drive them to despair. As
  Plato said, souls must never lose their wings, and, giving up
  hope of attaining a perfection declared impossible for them,
  throw themselves wholly into trivial pleasures. We must not
  forget that there are two doctrines of progress. The first,
  fostered by the sensualist schools, reinstates the passions; it
  promises people an earthly paradise at the end of a flower-strewn
  road, but gives them only an earthly hell at the end of a road of
  blood. The second, born of Christian inspiration, recognizes
  progress in the victory of the spirit over the flesh; it promises
  nothing but what is paid for by struggle. And this doctrine,
  which confines war within man, is the only one able to bring
  peace to the nations."</p>
