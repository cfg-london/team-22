  <h2>The Method of Direct Hydrogenation by Catalysis</h2>

  <p>I find it most moving to be speaking to you
  within these precincts, immortalized as they are by so many
  glories, and I should find it difficult to overcome my emotion if
  I were not aware of the kindness with which the Royal Swedish
  Academy welcomes those whom it has judged worthy of its
  world-famous rewards.</p>

  <p>I have to talk to you on the <i>general
  method of direct hydrogenation by catalysis</i>, which I
  established some dozen years ago in collaboration with Senderens
  and which I have continued to develop and generalize with the
  assistance of my devoted pupils, Mailhe and Murat.</p>

  <p>I have already on several occasions - in
  publications and lectures - given a detailed description of how
  this method is used in practice and I shall not inflict upon you
  an exhaustive technical account of the procedures, or the long
  list of the wide variety of processes which can be carried out
  with it.</p>

  <p>I prefer to describe how I came upon this
  new method, what its principal applications are at the present
  time and how its intimate mechanism can be explained
  theoretically.</p>

  <p><b>I</b></p>

  <p>The earlier methods of hydrogenation were
  almost all based on the use of what is known as <i>nascent
  hydrogen</i>, i.e. chemical systems which, when used alone, in
  the absence of a reducible substance, release hydrogen as well as
  heat energy. In the presence of transformable substances such
  systems will transmit to them a portion of the hydrogen
  supplied.</p>

  <p>These hydrogenating systems are well known.
  Some proceed in an alkaline medium, such as sodium or an amalgam
  of sodium in contact with water or with an alcohol (classical
  method of transforming aldehydes or acetones into corresponding
  alcohols; Bouveault's method whereby the ester of a fatty acid
  can be changed into the alcohol corresponding to this acid).</p>

  <p>Others, still more widely used, proceed in
  an acid medium, such as zinc, iron or tin reacting with dilute
  sulphuric, hydrochloric or acetic acid (method of preparing
  aniline from nitrobenzene, etc.). A still more powerful agent
  belongs to this group, namely a concentrated solution of
  hydroiodic acid, the use of which we owe to Berthelot. When
  heated to a high temperature in a sealed tube this solution
  brings about intense splitting of the hydroacid, the hydrogen of
  which may become fixed to an organic substance. However, the use
  of sealed tubes containing hydroiodic acid is very dangerous for
  the chemist, since the pressure of the free hydrogen liberated in
  the tube may exceed 100 atmospheres, and terrible accidents due
  to bursting of the tubes have been all too frequent. The use of
  these tubes also has another disadvantage, this time of a purely
  chemical nature; the presence of concentrated hydroiodic acid
  often causes isomerization of the reducible substance. Thus
  Berthelot, using benzene, produced not cyclohexane, which he had
  expected, but an isomer, methylcyclopentane.</p>

  <p>The direct use of gaseous hydrogen in
  hydrogenating processes had been quite exceptional and was
  confined to a small number of cases where the catalytic
  properties of finely divided platinum, sponge or black, had been
  used, properties which had proved so valuable in direct oxidation
  reactions. These few applications were the only ones discovered
  during the whole of the 19th century.</p>

  <p>In 1838 Kuhlmann transformed nitrogen oxide
  into ammonia in contact with platinum sponge; in 1852 Corenwinder
  succeeded in the same way in combining iodine with hydrogen.</p>

  <p>In 1863 Debus transformed hydrocyanic acid
  into methylamine with platinum black; however, this reaction is
  fugitive and soon ceases because cyanidation of the metal rapidly
  destroys its capacity to induce the reaction.</p>

  <p>In 1874 De Wilde found that by placing
  platinum black in a test-tube containing a suitable mixture of
  hydrogen and acetylene he could induce combination in the cold
  and produce ethylene or ethane, depending on the proportions of
  the initial substances.</p>

  <p>Such was the very rudimentary stage reached
  in direct hydrogenation when, more than fifteen years ago, I
  entered this field.</p>

  <p>Mond, Langer and Quincke had just isolated
  nickel carbonyl by the action of carbon monoxide on powdered
  nickel, which had been prepared by reduction of its oxide; iron
  had given an analogous compound. Thus the incomplete carbon
  monoxide molecule was being added to metals.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me that it might be possible
  to add metals to other incomplete gaseous'molecules, such as
  nitrogen oxide, in the same way. In collaboration with Senderens
  I tried to make this gas react with various metals which had been
  recently reduced from their oxides, but in no case did I observe
  anything other than oxidation of the metal. We were more
  fortunate with nitrogen peroxide, and in about 1894 we succeeded
  in inducing regular fixation to copper, cobalt, and nickel, which
  thus yielded true nitro metals.</p>

  <p>Moissan had just found, in his calcium
  carbide, an easy means of preparing pure acetylene, which has a
  very incomplete molecule, and he thought that this substance
  might, like nitrogen peroxide, become fixed to metals and yield
  addition products directly. But his attempts to bring this about
  in 1896 with Moureu produced a totally different, though very
  interesting, result. Acetylene, when brought into contact in the
  cold with freshly reduced nickel, cobalt or iron or even with
  platinum black, immediately decomposes with intense
  incandescence. Deposition of large quantities of carbon occurs
  together with evolution of gas - which Moissan thought to be
  hydrogen - and formation of liquid products, which appeared to
  him to be benzene accompanied by other aromatic hydrocarbons.</p>

  <p>He explained this curious reaction as being
  due to physical condensation of the acetylene in the pores of the
  metal, this condensation producing locally a temperature
  sufficiently high to break down part of the acetylene into
  hydrogen and carbon and to transform the rest into benzene and
  other hydrocarbons, as in the famous experiment of Berthelot.</p>

  <p>A more thorough examination would have
  changed this opinion; the condensed liquids are in reality very
  different from those yielded by simple polymerization of
  acetylene at dull-red heat; the gas evolved is not hydrogen but
  contains large proportions of ethane.</p>

  <p>Moissan, whose earlier work and
  inclinations had kept him well away from the field of organic
  chemistry, thought no more about this reaction, which he
  considered merely as a nice demonstration experiment. For me, on
  the other hand, it suggested great possibilities.</p>

  <p>My own ideas on the mechanism of catalytic
  phenomena were very different from those at one time commonly
  held, ideas which I no doubt owed to the influence of the
  illustrious teacher who had guided my first steps in chemistry
  nearly twenty years before - I refer, of course, to
  Berthelot.</p>

  <p>I thought and I still think (I shall be
  returning to this point later on) that the decisive cause of the
  catalytic activity of porous platinum is not a simple process of
  physical condensation producing a local rise in temperature but
  that it is a real chemical combination of the surface of the
  metal with the surrounding gas.</p>

  <p>I attributed the decomposition of the
  acetylene in the experiment of Moissan and Moureu to an affinity
  of the metal, either for the acetylene itself or for the
  constituents of the latter, carbon or hydrogen, which it is
  apparently capable of loosening from the endothermic molecule of
  this hydrocarbon.</p>

  <p>Having made certain that Moissan was not
  thinking of continuing the study of this reaction. I took it up
  myself, and first of all together with Senderens I made a similar
  test on ethylene.</p>

  <p>When a stream of ethylene is directed on to
  nickel, cobalt or iron, which has been freshly reduced and kept
  in the region of 300&deg;C, intense incandescence of the metal
  with deposition of large quantites of carbon due to breakdown of
  the ethylene occurs. However, the gas which leaves the apparatus
  is not hydrogen but consists mainly of ethane.</p>

  <p>This latter could arise only from
  hydrogenation of undecomposed ethylene, and no doubt this
  hydrogenation has been induced by the metal. In fact, if a
  mixture of ethylene and hydrogen is directed on to a column of
  reduced nickel, the ethylene is changed into ethane and the same
  metal can be used indefinitely to bring about the same
  transformation (June 1897).</p>

  <p>Thus, nickel appeared to us to possess a
  remarkable capacity to hydrogenate ethylene without itself being
  visibly modified, i.e. by acting as a catalyst.</p>

  <p>During 1898 I suffered a cruel bereavement
  which for many months made it quite impossible for me to do any
  useful work.</p>

  <p>In 1899 we succeeded in establishing that
  reduced nickel possesses the same hydrogenating activity towards
  acetylene, which, under similar conditions, is transformed into
  ethane, and the following year, in 1900, we found that reduced
  cobalt, iron and copper, as well as powdered platinum, possess a
  similar, though less vigorous, property.</p>

  <p>This catalytic hydrogenating power of
  nickel appeared to me so perfect that I then thought of using it
  for a major reaction, in which the various known hydrogenating
  agents had shown themselves ineffective, i.e. the hydrogenation
  of benzene.</p>

  <p>Decisive success came at the end of 1900
  when, with Senderens, I found that benzene can be totally changed
  into cyclohexane in contact with nickel at a temperature of about
  180&deg;C. After that I was absolutely confident of the general
  nature of the method, the principle of which we stated at the
  beginning of 1901:</p>

  <p>"Vapour of the substance together with an
  excess of hydrogen is directed on to freshly reduced nickel held
  at a suitable temperature (generally between 150 and
  200&deg;C)."</p>

  <p>This very simple process- which requires a
  minimum of equipment, is quite safe and usually needs but little
  supervision- then seemed to be applicable to a whole series of
  important cases, namely the transformation of unsaturated
  ethylenic or acetylenic hydrocarbons into saturated hydrocarbons,
  and the transformation of nitro derivatives into arnines.</p>

  <p>Completely confident of success I undertook
  the generalization of this method, another advantage of which
  seemed to be that in most cases it yielded only the desired main
  product, without by-products or isomerization, and consequently
  gave extremely high yields.</p>

  <p>During the period 1901 to 1905, together
  with Senderens, I showed that nickel is very suitable for the
  direct hydrogenation of nitriles into amines and, no less
  important, of aldehydes and acetones into corresponding alcohols.
  Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are both changed immediately
  into methane, which can therefore be synthesized with the
  greatest ease.</p>

  <p>Like benzene, the homologous aromatic
  hydrocarbons, toluene, xylenes, etc. fix directly six hydrogen
  atoms to produce the corresponding cyclic compounds; phenol is
  transformed into cyclohexanol, aniline into cyclohexylamine.
  Naphthalene and acenaphthene can also be usefully hydrogenated
  with nickel.</p>

  <p>Tetravalent terpenes, such as limonene,
  take four atoms of hydrogen whilst divalent terpenes (pinene,
  camphene) can fix only two, in accordance with the predictions
  made in the excellent work of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1910/index.html">Wallach</a>.</p>

  <p>From 1904 to 1911 together with my pupil
  Mailhe I continued to develop the method, applying it with
  success to the direct hydrogenation of the aromatic halogen
  derivatives, which return to hydrocarbons; to the hydrogenation
  of ally1 products and of unsaturated acids, which turn into
  saturated molecules without altering their functions; to the
  hydrogenation of oximes, amides, isocyanic esters, carbylamines,
  diketones and quinones, and to that of cresols, xylenols,
  etc.</p>

  <p>Hydrogenation of the aromatic nucleus in
  the diphenols, pyrogallol and finally in benzylamine was a more
  delicate matter, although here too we succeeded in producing the
  corresponding cyclohexane compounds.</p>

  <p>Some gaps still remained, and in
  collaboration with my assistant Murat I set out less than a year
  ago to fill these in. On several occasions, despite very great
  care, I had failed to bring about direct hydrogenation of benzoic
  acid and its esters. I could not bring myself to accept this
  ineffectiveness of the method, and by controlling its application
  in minute detail we succeeded, a few months ago, in producing
  hexahydrobenzoic esters very efficiently in this way.</p>

  <p>Recently, too, we have successfully
  returned to the hydrogenation of diphenyl, and where Eykman was
  able to obtain only phenylcyclohexane we obtained normal
  production of dicyclohexyl.</p>

  <p>As soon as it had been described, however,
  our method caught the imagination of many research workers both
  in France and abroad, and their efforts contributed towards an
  extension of its use. It would take too long to enumerate their
  individual works, but I must at least mention the names of
  Darzens, Brunel, Godchot, Leroux, Breteau, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/index.html">Willst&auml;tter</a>,
  Padoa and others, as well as those of my pupils Gaudion and
  Mignonac.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Two fundamental conditions are essential
  for the success of the method, namely purity of the substances
  and choice of a suitable temperature.</p>

  <p>Powdered nickel, which, as catalyst, is the
  most important agent in the reaction, is comparable in every way
  with a ferment and, as in the case of the living organisms which
  constitute ferments, infinitesimal doses of certain substances
  are sufficient to attenuate and even suppress altogether their
  functional activity. Traces of sulphur, bromine or iodine are
  true poisons for the <i>metal ferment</i>, which reduced nickel
  in fact is, and every care must be taken to ensure that these are
  not present in the metal itself, in the hydrogen (as a result of
  insufficient purification), or in the substance subjected to
  hydrogenation.</p>

  <p>Benzene from which every trace of thiophene
  has not been eliminated cannot be transformed into
  cyclohexane.</p>

  <p>A little bromine vapour which escaped in a
  large laboratory where there was some phenol in an unstoppered
  flask was sufficient to render this phenol totally incapable of
  hydrogenation.</p>

  <p>The temperature of the metal should also be
  carefully regulated since each hydrogenation process takes place
  profitably only within a well-defined temperature range.</p>

  <p>Enormous differences have, moreover, been
  observed in the facility with which the various hydrogenation
  processes are effected, some being easy, others very
  delicate.</p>

  <p>As typical easy hydrogenation processes I
  might mention those of the ethylenic hydrocarbons or of the nitro
  derivatives. These processes can be effected by more or less any
  nickel, even if somewhat poisoned, and they take place within
  very wide temperature ranges.</p>

  <p>Hydrogenations are much more difficult in
  the case of the aromatic nucleus, of phenol and still more of
  benzene, and this difficulty reaches its maximum in the case of
  diphenols, pyrogallol and above all benzoic esters. Here it is
  essential to use high-purity nickel, which has been prepared at a
  not too high temperature, and to keep the reaction temperature
  within strictly controlled limits. The use of heating apparatus
  fitted with temperature regulators is strongly recommended
  here.</p>

  <p><b>II</b></p>

  <p>Among the extremely numerous results
  already obtained from the method of direct hydrogenation by
  catalysis I shall confine myself to mentioning a few particularly
  interesting cases.</p>

  <p>(1) Direct hydrogenation of acetylene with
  nickel provided us, Senderens and me, with some very curious
  results, which differ a great deal with the conditions under
  which they are obtained.</p>

  <p>In the cold, in the presence of an excess
  of hydrogen, acetylene changes into ethane only. But if the
  temperature of the metal is raised to more than 200&deg;C, the
  metal causes the molecule to split up into CH groups,
  hydrogenation of which then yields, beside free methane,
  methylene and methyl groups, which unite in various ways, giving
  a certain quantity of a liquid whose fluorescence, odour, density
  and chemical composition are those of Pennsylvanian
  petroleum.</p>

  <p>By bringing acetylene alone into contact
  with nickel we get incandescence, as observed by Moissan, which
  breaks part of it down into carbon and hydrogen and changes the
  rest into aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene and its homologues;
  these last can, in turn, under the action of the nickel situated
  at a greater distance from them, be reduced by the hydrogen
  arising from the splitting and be transformed into cyclic
  hydrocarbons, and this transformation may be total if an excess
  of hydrogen is allowed to react beyond the point of
  incandescence. A liquid which in its properties and compositions
  is entirely similar to Baku petroleum is then obtained by
  condensation.</p>

  <p>By the same procedure, but with acetylene
  mixed with a certain proportion of hydrogen, an intermediate
  product, consisting of both straight-chain and cycle
  hydrocarbons, resembling Rumanian petroleum, is obtained.</p>

  <p>If the column of metal intended for
  hydrogenation of the products of incandescence is raised to a
  temperature of more than 300&deg;C, then a proportion of the
  aromatic hydrocarbons is retained and the liquid obtained is
  analogous to Galician petroleum.</p>

  <p>From these syntheses I have deduced a
  general theory on the natural production of mineral oils in the
  interior of the Earth; it confirms the earlier views of
  Mendeleeff and Berthelot and it has the advantage over other
  theories that it easily explains the diversity of the products
  while attributing to them a more or less similar origin.</p>

  <p>(2) By direct hydrogenation vapours of
  liquid fatty acids (oleic acid) can be transformed into solid
  acids (stearic acid); and it has been found that this reaction,
  which is very easy to bring about, can be used to advantage with
  the oils themselves, the catalyst metal being held in suspension
  in the presence of gaseous hydrogen, which changes them into
  solid fats. This is at present the basis of a great industry in
  Britain and Germany.</p>

  <p>(3) Continuous transformation of
  nitrobenzene into aniline can be induced conveniently by
  catalysis; here, copper is to be preferred to nickel because it
  never brings about hydrogenation of the aniline formed and is not
  very sensitive to accidental impurities.</p>

  <p>(4) Direct hydrogenation of ordinary
  acetone produces, with a very high yield and without any
  incidental disturbance, isopropyl alcohol, the cost of which is
  thus tremendously reduced. The classical method of hydrogenation
  by means of sodium amalgam and water gave only a very mediocre
  yield.</p>

  <p>(5) The hydrogenating action exerted by
  nickel on carbon monoxide can be used on a large scale for the
  production of methane or of gaseous mixtures rich in methane. By
  using water gas prepared at a suitable temperature, and with
  elimination of carbon dioxide, we can obtain at very low cost a
  gas of high calorific power and, because it no longer contains
  any trace of carbon monoxide, completely non-toxic.</p>

  <p>(6) The most valuable advantage of the
  method of hydrogenation is indisputably the fact that it enables
  the aromatic nucleus to be hydrogenated, since it is thus a very
  easy matter to prepare the whole series of cyclohexane compounds,
  which hitherto could be obtained only with great difficulty by
  expensive and complicated methods. This is the starting-point of
  an infinite number of syntheses of great theoretical and even
  practical interest, for with these processes it is possible to
  produce many artificial perfumes.</p>

  <p>Cyclohexanol and paramethylcyclohexanol,
  which are produced so easily by direct hydrogenation of phenol
  and paracresol, seem destined to play a useful role in the
  synthesis of rubber - a problem at present engaging so many
  research workers.</p>

  <p>How can we explain hydrogenation by
  catalysis? I assume that hydrogen acts upon the metal by very
  rapidly producing a compound on its surface. The hydride thus
  produced is readily and rapidly dissociated, and if it is placed
  in the presence of substances capable of using hydrogen it gives
  it up to them, at the same time regenerating the metal, which
  again produces the same effect, and so on.</p>

  <p>The distinction which I have made between
  several kinds of activity of nickel would suggest that there are
  several stages of combination. For instance, well-prepared and
  pure nickel might produce the perhydride NiH<sub>2</sub> which is
  capable of hydrogenating benzene. On the other hand, nickel
  prepared at too high a temperature or containing some impurities,
  would give only a poorer hydride, such as</p>

  <p>Ni &#8212; H<br>
  |<br>
  Ni &#8212; H</p>

  <p>which would be incapable of reacting with
  benzene, though active in respect of ethylenic hydrocarbons or
  nitro derivatives.</p>

  <p>If this theory is correct, it can be
  deduced that nickel and the other active metals (copper, cobalt,
  iron, platinum) must be capable not only of fixing free hydrogen,
  but must also take hydrogen from such substances as are capable
  of giving it up, and that consequently they must be
  <i>dehydrogenation catalysts</i>.</p>

  <p>This is in fact the case. At a temperature
  of between 250&deg; and 300&deg;C powdered copper very
  conveniently brings about dehydrogenation of primary alcohols
  into aldehydes and of secondary alcohols into acetones, and this
  is a very useful practical method of effecting this
  transformation.</p>

  <p>Thus the concept of a temporary compound
  prompted me to use finely divided metals, first as hydrogenation
  catalysts and then as dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>

  <p>For several years I have been carrying out,
  together with Mailhe, research inspired by the same idea.</p>

  <p>Some ten years ago Ipatief had pointed out
  that alumina readily splits alcohols into ethylenic hydrocarbons
  and water by catalysis. I have established that this property is
  also possessed by other oxides, especially blue tungsten oxide
  and thorium oxide. This latter can be used indefinitely for
  dehydrating an alcohol; when it has become fouled through
  prolonged use and its activity has thereby been reduced, all that
  is necessary is to oxidize it to restore all its original
  catalytic power.</p>

  <p>Here again I turn to the temporary
  formation of a compound for explanation. I liken the part played
  by thoria in respect of the alcohols to that of sulphuric acid in
  the classical mechanism, known as Williamson's method, for the
  production of diethyl ether or ethylene. I assume that a kind of
  alcohol thorinate, an ester comparable with the acid alcohol
  sulphate, is produced at the surface of the oxide and from this I
  deduce that this thorinate must, like the sulphate, react with
  various substances and thus induce, as a catalyst, various
  reactions with alcohols.</p>

  <p>My conjectures have proved correct. When in
  contact with thoria, and without any apparent modification in
  this latter substance, the vapours of the alcohols react directly
  with hydrogen sulphide to give thiols, with ammonia to give
  primary amines, with primary amines to give secondary amines,
  with phenols to give mixed oxides and with fatty acids to give
  esters of these acids; these reactions may find important
  industrial applications.</p>

  <p>The further I go the more confident I
  become in the potentialities of this hypothesis of a temporary
  compound formed by the catalyst with one of the gaseous elements
  of the system, whilst on the other hand I see no other plausible
  explanation of the very marked specific character of different
  catalysts of similar physical make-up.</p>

  <p>At the same temperature of 350&deg;C amyl
  alcohol vapour yields valeric aldehyde and hydrogen with copper,
  and amylene and water with thoria. True, in these cases the
  direction taken by the catalysis might be connected with the
  metallic or non-metallic nature of the catalyst, determining
  whether or not electromotive contact forces are to intervene; but
  such a differentiation could not be invoked in many cases. Thus,
  I have recently found, with Mailhe, that formic acid vapour
  breaks down at 250&deg;C only into carbon dioxide and hydrogen
  in the presence of zinc oxide, and only into water and carbon
  monoxide in the presence of titanium oxide. Here the two catalyst
  oxides have no physical dissimilarity, and such a complete
  reversal of the phenomenon can only be explained by the
  intervention of special chemical affinities operating at the
  surface of these catalysts.</p>

  <p>For the past fifteen years this idea of
  mine on the mechanism of catalysis has never left me, and it is
  to the inferences drawn from it that I owe all my useful results.
  I shall retain it until such time as I find it irreconcilable
  with observed and well-established facts.</p>

  <p>Theories cannot claim to be indestructible.
  They are only the plough which the ploughman uses to draw his
  furrow and which he has every right to discard for another one,
  of improved design, after the harvest. To be this ploughman, to
  see my labours result in the furtherance of scientific progress,
  was the height of my ambition, and now the Swedish Academy of
  Sciences has come, at this harvest, to add the most brilliant of
  crowns. Permit me once again to express to the Academy my deepest
  gratitude.</p>
