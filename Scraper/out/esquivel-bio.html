  <h1>Adolfo P&eacute;rez Esquivel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="esquivel.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Adolfo
  P&eacute;rez Esquivel</b> was born in Buenos Aires in 1931. After
  training as an architect and sculptor he was appointed Professor
  of Architecture. In 1974 he relinquished his teaching post in
  order to devote all his time and energy to the work of
  co-ordinating the activities of the various non-violent elements
  in Latin America. It was at a conference in Montevideo in 1968
  that the decision was made to set up a joint organisation
  covering all non-violent elements throughout Latin America. At a
  conference in 1974 it was decided to give the organisation a more
  permanent form, and P&eacute;rez Esquivel was appointed its
  Secretary-General. In 1976 he initiated an international campaign
  aimed at persuading the United Nations to establish a Human Rights
  Commission, and in this connection a document was drawn up
  recording breaches of human rights in Latin America. In the
  Spring of 1977 P&eacute;rez Esquivel was imprisoned without cause
  being shown. In May 1978 he was released, but with the obligation
  to report to the police as well as being subject to various
  restrictions. These have subsequently been allowed to lapse, and
  in 1980 he had an opportunity of visiting Europe.<br>
  <br>
  The organisation of which P&eacute;rez Esquivel is the leader,
  Servicio Paz y Justicia, is a well-established one. Latin America
  is divided into three regions, each with its own offices, and
  under these come the national organisations. Their activities are
  co-ordinated from P&eacute;rez Esquivel's office in Buenos
  Aires.<br>
  <br>
  The organisation is based on a Christian view of life, and enjoys
  close contact with clergy and bishops critical of present-day
  conditions in Latin America. The chief task of the movement is to
  promote respect for human rights, a phrase that is intended to
  include social and economic rights. On the practical level this
  means that Servicio provides assistance to the rural workers in
  their struggle for land, and to the trade unions in their
  struggle to protect the rights of their workers. This is done
  inter alia in the form of legal aid.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the opposition he has encountered, P&eacute;rez Esquivel
  insists that the struggle must only be waged with non-violent
  means.</p>
