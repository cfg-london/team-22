  <h1>John R. Vane - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="vane.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Tardebigg, Worcestershire, on
  the 29th March 1927, one of three children, with an elder sister
  and brother. My father, Maurice Vane, was a son of immigrants
  from Russia and my mother, Frances Vane, came from a
  Worcestershire farming family.<br>
  <br>
  We lived in a suburb of Birmingham where I attended the local
  state school from the age of five. I then went on to King Edward
  VI High School in Edgbaston, Birmingham. However, the war was
  beginning and the whole school was evacuated into the
  countryside, alongside Repton School in Derbyshire. The expected
  bombings did not take place, and early in 1940 the school moved
  back to Birmingham. The air raids then started, and for the next
  four years, my school and home life were coloured by the
  trappings of war. With my family, I spent nights in the air-raid
  shelter at the bottom of the garden and at school we firewatched
  and trained as (or pretended to be) young soldiers.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of 12, my parents gave me a chemistry set for
  Christmas and experimentation soon became a consuming passion in
  my life. At first, I was able to use a Bunsen burner attached to
  my mother's gas stove, but the use of the kitchen as a laboratory
  came to an abrupt end when a minor explosion involving hydrogen
  sulphide spattered the newly painted decor and changed the colour
  from blue to dirty green!<br>
  <br>
  Shortly afterwards, my father, who ran a small company making
  portable buildings, erected a wooden shed for me in the garden,
  fitted with bench, gas and water. This became my first real
  laboratory, and my chemical experimentation rapidly expanded into
  new fields.<br>
  <br>
  At High School I progressed through the pure sciences, and in
  1944 it seemed natural to move to the University of
  Birmingham (which was just across the road from the school)
  to study Chemistry. However, the enthusiasm with which I had
  approached experimentation in Chemistry in the garden shed was
  soon dampened, for at university experimentation was nonexistent.
  The only unknown in the practical class was the percentage yield
  in the chemical synthesis involved. It was, I suppose, at this
  stage that I began to realise that my interest lay not in
  chemistry but more in experimentation. Thus, when Maurice Stacey,
  the Professor of Chemistry, asked me what I wanted to do when I
  graduated, I said "anything but chemistry". Stacey then told me
  that he had received a letter that morning from Professor Harold
  Burn in Oxford asking whether he could recommend another young
  chemist (he had sent one the previous year) to go to Oxford to be
  trained in pharmacology. Without hesitation I grasped the
  opportunity and immediately went to the library to find out what
  pharmacology was all about! That brief exchange with Stacey
  reshaped my whole career.<br>
  <br>
  I went to Burn's department in 1946. I had no biological training
  of any sort and very little motivation. I found inspiration in
  working with him and caught his enthusiasm for pharmacology. If
  anyone can be said to have moulded the subject of pharmacology
  around the world, it is he. He did this through his particular
  style of research, through the lucidity of his writings, but most
  of all through the school which he founded. Young, impressionable
  scientists from various disciplines and older, less
  impressionable pharmacologists all came to work with him. His
  laboratory gradually became the most active and important centre
  for pharmacological research in the U.K. and the main school for
  training of young pharmacologists. It was his energy and
  inspiration that set my career into one of adventure in the
  fields of bioassay and pharmacology. It was Burn who reinforced
  for me the essence of experimentation and that is, never to
  ignore the unusual.<br>
  <br>
  After qualifying for a B.Sc. in pharmacology, I spent a few
  months in Sheffield University as a research worker in the
  pharmacology department but then went back to Oxford to the
  Nuffield Institute for Medical Research in order to study for a
  D. Phil. with Dr. Geoffrey Dawes. In 1951 I was awarded the
  Stothert Research Fellowship of The Royal Society and this
  enabled me to complete my doctorate in 1953. Oxford was also an
  important milestone for it was there that my wife and I made our
  first home, and it was there that my daughters Nicola and Miranda
  were born.<br>
  <br>
  In 1953, we all went to Newhaven, Connecticut where, at the
  invitation of Dr. Arnold Welch, who was then Chairman, I joined
  the Department of Pharmacology at Yale University as Assistant Professor in
  Pharmacology. That was a lively and bustling department, but
  after 2 years we returned to the U.K, where I started work with
  Professor W. D. M. Paton at the Institute of Basic Medical
  Sciences of the University of London in the Royal College of
  Surgeons of England. This was an unusual department, for the
  teaching was only for graduates, and was not time consuming, thus
  offering plenty of time for research. I stayed there for 18
  years, progressing from Senior Lecturer to Reader to Professor of
  Experimental Pharmacology. From 1961 to 1973, Professor G. V. R.
  Born, a close friend from my Oxford days, was the Chairman of the
  Department and we enjoyed a strong symbiotic relationship, each
  maintaining an active group of graduate students and research
  workers. Interestingly, our fields of research endeavour
  (platelets and prostaglandins) only coalesced in a significant
  way after we had both moved on.<br>
  <br>
  It was here that I developed, together with my group, the cascade
  superfusion bioassay technique for measurement of, dynamically
  and instantaneously, the release and fate of vasoactive hormones
  in the circulation or in the perfusion fluid of isolated organs.
  In the mid-1960's, our attention was focused on prostaglandins,
  leading in 1971 to the forging of the link between aspirin and
  the prostaglandins.<br>
  <br>
  In 1973, I was offered the position of Group Research and
  Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation. In making my
  decision, I was conscious that Henry Wellcome, seventy years
  before, had recruited <a href="../1936/index.html">Henry Dale</a>
  to work in (and soon to direct) the Wellcome Physiological
  Research Laboratories, the forerunners of the present Research
  and Development Directorate. When Henry Dale, then at Cambridge,
  first received the offer from Wellcome, he hesitated over
  accepting it. "Friends to whom I mentioned this approach" he
  said, "were almost unanimous in advising me to have nothing to do
  with it. I should be selling my scientific soul for a mess of
  commercial potage". Nevertheless, he accepted and had no regrets.
  I also found amongst a few of my friends a resistance to the idea
  of me entering into industrial science. It was as if to say that
  good science can only be promulgated in academia. Those friends
  were wrong; like Dale I accepted and had no regrets. I took with
  me from the Royal College of Surgeons a nucleus of colleagues,
  and this has expanded over the last few years into a
  Prostaglandin Research department under the leadership of Dr.
  Salvador Moncada. It was in this department that prostacyclin was
  discovered and its pharmacology developed.</p>
