  <h1>Gerhard Domagk - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="domagk.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Gerhard
  Johannes Paul Domagk</b> was born on October 30, 1895, at Lagow,
  a beautiful, small town in the Brandenburg Marches. Until he was
  fourteen he went to school in Sommerfeld, where his father was
  assistant headmaster. His mother, Martha Reimer, came from
  farming stock in the Marches, where she lived in Sommerfeld until
  1945 when she was expelled from her home; she died from
  starvation in a refugee camp.<br>
  <br>
  Domagk himself was, from the age of 14, at school in Silesia
  until he reached the upper sixth form. He then became a medical
  student at Kiel and, when the 1914-1918 War broke out, he served
  in the Army, and in December 1914 was wounded. Later he was sent
  to join the Sanitary Service and served in, among other places,
  the cholera hospitals in Russia. During this time he was
  decisively impressed by the helplessness of the medical men of
  that time when they were faced with cholera, typhus, diarrhoeal
  infections and other infectious diseases. He was especially
  strongly influenced by the fact that surgery had little value in
  the treatment of these diseases and even amputations and other
  forms of radical treatment were often followed by severe
  bacterial infections, such as gas gangrene.<br>
  <br>
  In 1918 he resumed his medical studies at Kiel and in 1921 he
  took his State Medical Examinations and graduated. He undertook
  laboratory work under Max B&uuml;rger on creatin and creatinin,
  and later metabolic studies and analysis under Professors
  Hoppe-Seyler and Emmerich.<br>
  <br>
  In 1923 he moved to Greifswald and there became, in 1924,
  University Lecturer in Pathological Anatomy. In 1925 he held the
  same post in the University of M&uuml;nster and in 1958 became
  professor of this subject. During the years 1927-1929 he was,
  however, given leave of absence from the University of
  M&uuml;nster to do research in the laboratories of the I.G.
  Farbenindustrie, at Wuppertal. In 1929 a new research institute
  for pathological anatomy and bacteriology was built by the I.G.
  Farbenindustrie and there, in 1932, Domagk made the discovery for
  which his name is so well known, the discovery that earned him
  the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1939, namely, the
  fact that a red dye-stuff, to which the name &laquo;prontosil
  rubrum&raquo; was given, protected mice and rabbits against lethal
  doses of staphylococci and haemolytic streptococci. Prontosil was
  a derivative of sulphanilamide
  (<i>p</i>-aminobenzenesulphonamide) which the Viennese chemist,
  Gelmo, had synthesized in 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Domagk was, however, not satisfied that prontosil, so effective
  in mice, would be equally effective in man, but it so happened
  that his own daughter became very ill with a streptococcal
  infection, and Domagk, in desperation, gave her a dose of
  prontosil. She made a complete recovery, but Domagk omitted
  mentioning the recovery of his daughter from the report on the
  effect of the drug, waiting until 1935 when results were
  available from clinicians who had tested the new drug on
  patients. During subsequent years much work was done in various
  countries on this class of antibacterial compound and some
  thousands of derivatives of sulphanilamide have been produced and
  tested for their antibacterial properties. Domagk's work has thus
  given to medicine, and also to surgery, a whole new series of
  weapons that are effective against many infectious
  diseases.<br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the antibacterial action of the sulphonamides
  was not, however, Domagk's only contribution to chemotherapy. He
  also discovered the therapeutic value of the quaternary ammonium
  bases and he also extended, in collaboration with Klarer and
  Mietzsch, his work on the sulphonamides. Later, he attacked the
  problem of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, developing for this
  the thiosemicarbazones (Conteben) and isonicotinic acid hydrazide
  (Neoteben). His work has undoubtedly resulted in more effective
  control of many infectious diseases which nowadays have lost the
  terrors they formerly caused. The supreme aim of chemotherapy is,
  in Domagk's opinion, the cure and control of carcinoma and he was
  convinced that this will be, in the future, achieved.<br>
  <br>
  Domagk held honorary doctorates of the Universities of Bologna, M&uuml;nster,
  Cordoba,
  Lima,
  Buenos Aires,
  and Giessen. He was made Knight of the Order of Merit in
  1952, was awarded the Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Health of
  Spain in 1955. Other honours and distinctions bestowed upon him
  were: Paul Ehrlich Gold Medal and Paul Ehrlich Prize, University
  of Frankfurt (1956); Foreign Member of the British Academy of
  Science and of the Royal Society (1959); Honorary Member of the German
  Dermatological Society (1960); Japanese Order of Merit of the
  Rising Sun (1960).<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 Domagk married Gertrud Str&uuml;be. They had three sons
  and one daughter.<br>
  <br>
  Retiring to his old university of M&uuml;nster, when laboratory
  work was no longer possible for him, he had devoted himself to
  the experimental (chemotherapeutic) study of carcinoma and to the
  dissemination of modern knowledge about it among the students and
  others interested in it. His recreation was painting.</p>

  <p>Dr Domagk died on April 24, 1964.</p>
