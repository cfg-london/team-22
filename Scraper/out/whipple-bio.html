  <h1>George H. Whipple - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="whipple.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>George
  Hoyt Whipple</b> was born on August 28, 1878, in Ashland, New
  Hampshire, U.S.A., the son of Dr. Ashley Cooper Whipple and his
  wife Frances Hoyt. His paternal grandfather and his father, both
  physicians, were born and bred in New Hampshire.<br>
  <br>
  Whipple was educated at Andover Academy and then went to Yale University, where
  he took his A.B.degree in 1900. Subsequently he went to Johns Hopkins
  University, where he took his M.D. degree in 1905.<br>
  <br>
  In 1905 he was appointed Assistant in Pathology at the Johns
  Hopkins Medical School and, although he spent a year as
  pathologist to the Ancon Hospital, Panama, he remained at Johns
  Hopkins University until 1914, being successively Assistant,
  Instructor, Associate and Associate Professor in Pathology.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 he was appointed Professor of Research Medicine at the
  University of California Medical School, and Director of the
  Hooper Foundation for Medical Research at that University, being
  Dean of the Medical School during the years 1920 and 1921. In
  1921 he was appointed Professor of Pathology and Dean of the
  School
  of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of
  Rochester.<br>
  <br>
  Whipple's main researches were concerned with anaemia and the
  physiology and pathology of the liver. For a year he worked under
  General William Gorgas and Dr. S. T. Darling on anaemia caused by
  parasitic infections and especially on the lesions found in the
  intestinal tract in people suffering from these infections. He
  also studied the histology of the tissues in patients suffering
  from blackwater fever.<br>
  <br>
  When he went to Johns Hopkins University as an assistant in the
  Department of Pathology, Whipple worked under William H. Welch on
  pigments related to liver necrosis caused by chloroform
  anaesthesia, his aim being to gather information about repair and
  regeneration of the liver cells. This problem was studied in the
  dog, and Whipple found that the liver cells had an almost
  limitless power of regeneration. He then became interested in
  jaundice, which is always associated with chloroform poisoning
  and injury to the liver. He studied the route by which the bile
  pigments pass into the blood and thus produce jaundice of various
  parts of the body and he found that the lympathic system was of
  little importance in transporting them. He then studied, by means
  of bile fistulas and other means, the bile pigments and their
  production outside the liver, and in this work he collaborated
  with C. W. Hooper.<br>
  <br>
  After his appointment at the Hooper Foundation, Whipple continued
  his work with bile fistulas, and soon found that a better
  understanding of the production of haemoglobin was needed if the
  metabolism of bile pigments was to be understood. In
  collaboration with C. W. Hooper and Mrs. Robscheit-Robbins, he
  did experiments on short-term anaemia in dogs due to loss of
  blood, and further work was done on this subject and on diets
  consisting of liver in relation to the regeneration of blood. In
  Rochester, however, he decided to use anaemias due to blood loss
  which were uniformly sustained and were long maintained, and to
  study the effects on these of various factors in diets added to
  the rations. This work showed that the most effective addition to
  the diets was raw liver itself. For this work on the therapeutic
  value of liver in the treatment of pernicious anaemia he was
  awarded, together with <a href="minot-bio.html">George R.
  Minot</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/index.html">William P. Murphy</a>, the
  Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  Whipple has, in addition to the researches just described, worked
  on tuberculosis, pancreatitis, chloroform poisoning in animals,
  the metabolism of pigments and iron, the constituents of the
  bile, and the regeneration of plasma protein, and he has studied
  protein metabolism by means of lysine labelled with
  <sup>14</sup>C, and also vitamin B<sub>12</sub> labelled with
  <sup>60</sup>Co, and its distribution and functions in the body.
  He has also made studies of the stroma of red blood cells.<br>
  <br>
  Among the many honours and distinctions he received are honorary
  doctorates of several American Universities as well as of the
  Universities of
  Athens and Glasgow; the Popular Science Monthly Gold Medal and
  Annual Award in 1930 (with Dr. Minot), and the William Wood
  Gerhard Gold Medal of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia,
  in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He is also a
  Corresponding Member of the Association of Physicians in Vienna
  and of the Royal Society of Physicians in Budapest, and of the
  European Society of Haematology, and a Foreign Corresponding
  Member of the British Medical Association. He is an Honorary
  Member of the Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland,
  and of the American Philosophical Society and the Society of
  Experimental Biology and Medicine. He was, from 1936-1953, a
  member of the Board of Scientific Directors of the Rockefeller
  Institute, a member of the Board of Trustees of this
  Foundation from 1939-1953, Vice-Chairman of its Board of Trustees
  from 1953-1960, and in 1960 he was appointed Trustee
  Emeritus.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 Whipple married Katherine Ball Waring of Charleston,
  South Carolina. He has one son George Hoyt (b. 1917) and one
  daughter Barbara (b. 1921), and seven grandchildren.</p>
