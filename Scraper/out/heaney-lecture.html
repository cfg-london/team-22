  <h2><br>Crediting Poetry</h2>

  <p>When I first encountered the name of the
  city of Stockholm, I little thought that I would ever visit it,
  never mind end up being welcomed to it as a guest of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/heaney-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish Academy</a> and the
  Nobel Foundation. At the time I am thinking of, such an outcome
  was not just beyond expectation: it was simply beyond conception.
  In the nineteen forties, when I was the eldest child of an
  ever-growing family in rural Co. Derry, we crowded together in
  the three rooms of a traditional thatched farmstead and lived a
  kind of den-life which was more or less emotionally and
  intellectually proofed against the outside world. It was an
  intimate, physical, creaturely existence in which the night
  sounds of the horse in the stable beyond one bedroom wall mingled
  with the sounds of adult conversation from the kitchen beyond the
  other. We took in everything that was going on, of course - rain
  in the trees, mice on the ceiling, a steam train rumbling along
  the railway line one field back from the house - but we took it
  in as if we were in the doze of hibernation. Ahistorical,
  pre-sexual, in suspension between the archaic and the modern, we
  were as susceptible and impressionable as the drinking water that
  stood in a bucket in our scullery: every time a passing train
  made the earth shake, the surface of that water used to ripple
  delicately, concentrically, and in utter silence.<br>
  <br>
  But it was not only the earth that shook for us: the air around
  and above us was alive and signalling too. When a wind stirred in
  the beeches, it also stirred an aerial wire attached to the
  topmost branch of the chestnut tree. Down it swept, in through a
  hole bored in the corner of the kitchen window, right on into the
  innards of our wireless set where a little pandemonium of burbles
  and squeaks would suddenly give way to the voice of a BBC
  newsreader speaking out of the unexpected like a <i>deus ex
  machina.</i> And that voice too we could hear in our bedroom,
  transmitting from beyond and behind the voices of the adults in
  the kitchen; just as we could often hear, behind and beyond every
  voice, the frantic, piercing signalling of morse code.<br>
  <br>
  We could pick up the names of neighbours being spoken in the
  local accents of our parents, and in the resonant English tones
  of the newsreader the names of bombers and of cities bombed, of
  war fronts and army divisions, the numbers of planes lost and of
  prisoners taken, of casualties suffered and advances made; and
  always, of course, we would pick up too those other, solemn and
  oddly bracing words, "the enemy" and "the allies". But even so,
  none of the news of these world-spasms entered me as terror. If
  there was something ominous in the newscaster's tones, there was
  something torpid about our understanding of what was at stake;
  and if there was something culpable about such political
  ignorance in that time and place, there was something positive
  about the security I inhabited as a result of it.<br>
  <br>
  The wartime, in other words, was pre-reflective time for me.
  Pre-literate too. Pre-historical in its way. Then as the years
  went on and my listening became more deliberate, I would climb up
  on an arm of our big sofa to get my ear closer to the wireless
  speaker. But it was still not the news that interested me; what I
  was after was the thrill of story, such as a detective serial
  about a British special agent called Dick Barton or perhaps a
  radio adaptation of one of Capt. W.E. Johns's adventure tales
  about an RAF flying ace called Biggles. Now that the other
  children were older and there was so much going on in the
  kitchen, I had to get close to the actual radio set in order to
  concentrate my hearing, and in that intent proximity to the dial
  I grew familiar with the names of foreign stations, with Leipzig
  and Oslo and Stuttgart and Warsaw and, of course, with
  Stockholm.<br>
  <br>
  I also got used to hearing short bursts of foreign languages as
  the dial hand swept round from BBC to Radio Eireann, from the
  intonations of London to those of Dublin, and even though I did
  not understand what was being said in those first encounters with
  the gutturals and sibilants of European speech, I had already
  begun a journey into the wideness of the world beyond. This in
  turn became a journey into the wideness of language, a journey
  where each point of arrival - whether in one's poetry or one's
  life turned out to be a stepping stone rather than a destination,
  and it is that journey which has brought me now to this honoured
  spot. And yet the platform here feels more like a space station
  than a stepping stone, so that is why, for once in my life, I am
  permitting myself the luxury of walking on air.</p>

  <center>
    *
  </center>

  <p>I credit poetry for making this space-walk
  possible. I credit it immediately because of a line I wrote
  fairly recently instructing myself (and whoever else might be
  listening) to "walk on air against your better judgement". But I
  credit it ultimately because poetry can make an order as true to
  the impact of external reality and as sensitive to the inner laws
  of the poet's being as the ripples that rippled in and rippled
  out across the water in that scullery bucket fifty years ago. An
  order where we can at last grow up to that which we stored up as
  we grew. An order which satisfies all that is appetitive in the
  intelligence and prehensile in the affections. I credit poetry,
  in other words, both for being itself and for being a help, for
  making possible a fluid and restorative relationship between the
  mind's centre and its circumference, between the child gazing at
  the word "Stockholm" on the face of the radio dial and the man
  facing the faces that he meets in Stockholm at this most
  privileged moment. I credit it because credit is due to it, in
  our time and in all time, for its truth to life, in every sense
  of that phrase.</p>

  <center>
    *
  </center>

  <p>To begin with, I wanted that truth to life
  to possess a concrete reliability, and rejoiced most when the
  poem seemed most direct, an upfront representation of the world
  it stood in for or stood up for or stood its ground against. Even
  as a schoolboy, I loved John Keats's ode "To Autumn" for being an
  ark of the covenant between language and sensation; as an
  adolescent, I loved Gerard Manley Hopkins for the intensity of
  his exclamations which were also equations for a rapture and an
  ache I didn't fully know I knew until I read him; I loved Robert
  Frost for his farmer's accuracy and his wily down-to-earthness;
  and Chaucer too for much the same reasons. Later on I would find
  a different kind of accuracy, a moral down-to-earthness to which
  I responded deeply and always will, in the war poetry of Wilfred
  Owen, a poetry where a New Testament sensibility suffers and
  absorbs the shock of the new century's barbarism. Then later
  again, in the pure consequence of Elizabeth Bishop's style, in
  the sheer obduracy of Robert Lowell's and in the barefaced
  confrontation of Patrick Kavanagh's, I encountered further
  reasons for believing in poetry's ability - and responsibility -
  to say what happens, to "pity the planet," to be "not concerned
  with Poetry."<br>
  <br>
  This temperamental disposition towards an art that was earnest
  and devoted to things as they are was corroborated by the
  experience of having been born and brought up in Northern Ireland
  and of having lived with that place even though I have lived out
  of it for the past quarter of a century. No place in the world
  prides itself more on its vigilance and realism, no place
  considers itself more qualified to censure any flourish of
  rhetoric or extravagance of aspiration. So, partly as a result of
  having internalized these attitudes through growing up with them,
  and partly as a result of growing a skin to protect myself
  against them, I went for years half-avoiding and half- resisting
  the opulence and extensiveness of poets as different as Wallace
  Stevens and Rainer Maria Rilke; crediting insufficiently the
  crystalline inwardness of Emily Dickinson, all those forked
  lightnings and fissures of association; and missing the visionary
  strangeness of <a href="../1948/index.html">Eliot.</a> And these
  more or less costive attitudes were fortified by a refusal to
  grant the poet any more license than any other citizen; and they
  were further induced by having to conduct oneself as a poet in a
  situation of ongoing political violence and public expectation. A
  public expectation, it has to be said, not of poetry as such but
  of political positions variously approvable by mutually
  disapproving groups.<br>
  <br>
  In such circumstances, the mind still longs to repose in what
  Samuel Johnson once called with superb confidence "the stability
  of truth", even as it recognizes the destabilizing nature of its
  own operations and enquiries. Without needing to be theoretically
  instructed, consciousness quickly realizes that it is the site of
  variously contending discourses. The child in the bedroom,
  listening simultaneously to the domestic idiom of his Irish home
  and the official idioms of the British broadcaster while picking
  up from behind both the signals of some other distress, that
  child was already being schooled for the complexities of his
  adult predicament, a future where he would have to adjudicate
  among promptings variously ethical, aesthetical, moral,
  political, metrical, sceptical, cultural, topical, typical,
  post-colonial and, taken all together, simply impossible. So it
  was that I found myself in the mid-nineteen seventies in another
  small house, this time in Co. Wicklow south of Dublin, with a
  young family of my own and a slightly less imposing radio set,
  listening to the rain in the trees and to the news of bombings
  closer to home-not only those by the Provisional IRA in Belfast
  but equally atrocious assaults in Dublin by loyalist
  paramilitaries from the north. Feeling puny in my predicaments as
  I read about the tragic logic of Osip Mandelstam's fate in the
  1930s, feeling challenged yet steadfast in my noncombatant status
  when I heard, for example, that one particularly sweetnatured
  school friend had been interned without trial because he was
  suspected of having been involved in a political killing. What I
  was longing for was not quite stability but an active escape from
  the quicksand of relativism, a way of crediting poetry without
  anxiety or apology. In a poem called "Exposure" I wrote then:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If I could come on meteorite!<br>
    Instead, I walk through damp leaves,<br>
    Husks, the spent flukes of autumn,<br>
    <br>
    Imagining a hero<br>
    On some muddy compound,<br>
    His gift like a slingstone<br>
    Whirled for the desperate.<br>
    <br>
    How did I end up like this?<br>
    I often think of my friends'<br>
    Beautiful prismatic counselling<br>
    And the anvil brains of some who hate me<br>
    <br>
    As I sit weighing and weighing<br>
    My responsible <i>tristia</i>.<br>
    For what? For the ear? For the people?<br>
    For what is said behind-backs?<br>
    <br>
    Rain comes down through the alders,<br>
    Its low conducive voices<br>
    Mutter about let-downs and erosions<br>
    And yet each drop recalls<br>
    <br>
    The diamond absolutes.<br>
    I am neither internee nor informer;<br>
    An inner &eacute;migr&eacute;, a grown long-haired<br>
    And thoughtful; a wood-kerne<br>
    <br>
    Escaped from the massacre,<br>
    Taking protective colouring<br>
    From bole and bark, feeling<br>
    Every wind that blows;<br>
    <br>
    Who, blowing up these sparks<br>
    For their meagre heat, have missed<br>
    The once in a lifetime portent,<br>
    The comet's pulsing rose.<br>
    (from North)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In one of the poems best known to students
  in my generation, a poem which could be said to have taken the
  nutrients of the symbolist movement and made them available in
  capsule form, the American poet Archibald MacLeish affirmed that
  "A poem should be equal to/not true." As a defiant statement of
  poetry's gift for telling truth but telling it slant, this is
  both cogent and corrective. Yet there are times when a deeper
  need enters, when we want the poem to be not only pleasurably
  right but compellingly wise, not only a surprising variation
  played upon the world, but a re-tuning of the world itself. We
  want the surprise to be transitive like the impatient thump which
  unexpectedly restores the picture to the television set, or the
  electric shock which sets the fibrillating heart back to its
  proper rhythm. We want what the woman wanted in the prison queue
  in Leningrad, standing there blue with cold and whispering for
  fear, enduring the terror of Stalin's regime and asking the poet
  Anna Akhmatova if she could describe it all, if her art could be
  equal to it. And this is the want I too was experiencing in those
  far more protected circumstances in Co. Wicklow when I wrote the
  lines I have just quoted, a need for poetry that would merit the
  definition of it I gave a few moments ago, as an order "true to
  the impact of external reality and ... sensitive to the inner
  laws of the poet's being."</p>

  <p>The external reality and inner dynamic of
  happenings in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1974 were
  symptomatic of change, violent change admittedly, but change
  nevertheless, and for the minority living there, change had been
  long overdue. It should have come early, as the result of the
  ferment of protest on the streets in the late sixties, but that
  was not to be and the eggs of danger which were always incubating
  got hatched out very quickly. While the Christian moralist in
  oneself was impelled to deplore the atrocious nature of the IRA's
  campaign of bombings and killings, and the "mere Irish" in
  oneself was appalled by the ruthlessness of the British Army on
  occasions like Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972, the minority
  citizen in oneself, the one who had grown up conscious that his
  group was distrusted and discriminated against in all kinds of
  official and unofficial ways, this citizen's perception was at
  one with the poetic truth of the situation in recognizing that if
  life in Northern Ireland were ever really to flourish, change had
  to take place. But that citizen's perception was also at one with
  the truth in recognizing that the very brutality of the means by
  which the IRA were pursuing change was destructive of the trust
  upon which new possibilities would have to be based.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, until the British government caved in to the
  strong-arm tactics of the Ulster loyalist workers after the
  Sunningdale Conference in 1974, a well-disposed mind could still
  hope to make sense of the circumstances, to balance what was
  promising with what was destructive and do what <a href=
  "../1923/index.html">W.B. Yeats</a> had tried to do half a
  century before, namely, "to hold in a single thought reality and
  justice." After 1974, however, for the twenty long years between
  then and the ceasefires of August 1994, such a hope proved
  impossible. The violence from below was then productive of
  nothing but a retaliatory violence from above, the dream of
  justice became subsumed into the callousness of reality, and
  people settled in to a quarter century of life-waste and spirit-
  waste, of hardening attitudes and narrowing possibilities that
  were the natural result of political solidarity, traumatic
  suffering and sheer emotional self-protectiveness.</p>

  <p>One of the most harrowing moments in the
  whole history of the harrowing of the heart in Northern Ireland
  came when a minibus full of workers being driven home one January
  evening in 1976 was held up by armed and masked men and the
  occupants of the van ordered at gunpoint to line up at the side
  of the road. Then one of the masked executioners said to them,
  "Any Catholics among you, step out here". As it happened, this
  particular group, with one exception, were all Protestants, so
  the presumption must have been that the masked men were
  Protestant paramilitaries about to carry out a tit-for-tat
  sectarian killing of the Catholic as the odd man out, the one who
  would have been presumed to be in sympathy with the IRA and all
  its actions. It was a terrible moment for him, caught between
  dread and witness, but he did make a motion to step forward.
  Then, the story goes, in that split second of decision, and in
  the relative cover of the winter evening darkness, he felt the
  hand of the Protestant worker next to him take his hand and
  squeeze it in a signal that said no, don't move, we'll not betray
  you, nobody need know what faith or party you belong to. All in
  vain, however, for the man stepped out of the line; but instead
  of finding a gun at his temple, he was thrown backward and away
  as the gunmen opened fire on those remaining in the line, for
  these were not Protestant terrorists, but members, presumably, of
  the Provisional IRA.</p>

  <p>It is difficult at times to repress the
  thought that history is about as instructive as an abattoir; that
  Tacitus was right and that peace is merely the desolation left
  behind after the decisive operations of merciless power. I
  remember, for example, shocking myself with a thought I had about
  that friend who was imprisoned in the seventies upon suspicion of
  having been involved with a political murder: I shocked myself by
  thinking that even if he were guilty, he might still perhaps be
  helping the future to be born, breaking the repressive forms and
  liberating new potential in the only way that worked, that is to
  say the violent way - which therefore became, by extension, the
  right way. It was like a moment of exposure to interstellar cold,
  a reminder of the scary element, both inner and outer, in which
  human beings must envisage and conduct their lives. But it was
  only a moment. The birth of the future we desire is surely in the
  contraction which that terrified Catholic felt on the roadside
  when another hand gripped his hand, not in the gunfire that
  followed, so absolute and so desolate, if also so much a part of
  the music of what happens.<br>
  <br>
  As writers and readers, as sinners and citizens, our realism and
  our aesthetic sense make us wary of crediting the positive note.
  The very gunfire braces us and the atrocious confers a worth upon
  the effort which it calls forth to confront it. We are rightly in
  awe of the torsions in the poetry of Paul Celan and rightly
  enamoured of the suspiring voice in <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Samuel Beckett</a> because these are
  evidence that art can rise to the occasion and somehow be the
  corollary of Celan's stricken destiny as Holocaust survivor and
  Beckett's demure heroism as a member of the French Resistance.
  Likewise, we are rightly suspicious of that which gives too much
  consolation in these circumstances; the very extremity of our
  late twentieth century knowledge puts much of our cultural
  heritage to an extreme test. Only the very stupid or the very
  deprived can any longer help knowing that the documents of
  civilization have been written in blood and tears, blood and
  tears no less real for being very remote. And when this
  intellectual predisposition co-exists with the actualities of
  Ulster and Israel and Bosnia and Rwanda and a host of other
  wounded spots on the face of the earth, the inclination is not
  only not to credit human nature with much constructive potential
  but not to credit anything too positive in the work of art.<br>
  <br>
  Which is why for years I was bowed to the desk like some monk
  bowed over his prie-dieu, some dutiful contemplative pivoting his
  understanding in an attempt to bear his portion of the weight of
  the world, knowing himself incapable of heroic virtue or
  redemptive effect, but constrained by his obedience to his rule
  to repeat the effort and the posture. Blowing up sparks for
  meagre heat. Forgetting faith, straining towards good works.
  Attending insufficiently to the diamond absolutes, among which
  must be counted the sufficiency of that which is absolutely
  imagined. Then finally and happily, and not in obedience to the
  dolorous circumstances of my native place but in despite of them,
  I straightened up. I began a few years ago to try to make space
  in my reckoning and imagining for the marvellous as well as for
  the murderous. And once again I shall try to represent the import
  of that changed orientation with a story out of Ireland.<br>
  <br>
  This is a story about another monk holding himself up valiantly
  in the posture of endurance. It is said that once upon a time St.
  Kevin was kneeling with his arms stretched out in the form of a
  cross in Glendalough, a monastic site not too far from where we
  lived in Co. Wicklow, a place which to this day is one of the
  most wooded and watery retreats in the whole of the country.
  Anyhow, as Kevin knelt and prayed, a blackbird mistook his
  outstretched hand for some kind of roost and swooped down upon
  it, laid a clutch of eggs in it and proceeded to nest in it as if
  it were the branch of a tree. Then, overcome with pity and
  constrained by his faith to love the life in all creatures great
  and small, Kevin stayed immobile for hours and days and nights
  and weeks, holding out his hand until the eggs hatched and the
  fledglings grew wings, true to life if subversive of common
  sense, at the intersection of natural process and the glimpsed
  ideal, at one and the same time a signpost and a reminder.
  Manifesting that order of poetry where we can at last grow up to
  that which we stored up as we grew.</p>

  <center>
    *
  </center>

  <p>St. Kevin's story is, as I say, a story out
  of Ireland. But it strikes me that it could equally well come out
  of India or Africa or the Arctic or the Americas. By which I do
  not mean merely to consign it to a typology of folktales, or to
  dispute its value by questioning its culture bound status within
  a multi-cultural context. On the contrary, its trustworthiness
  and its travel-worthiness have to do with its local setting. I
  can, of course, imagine it being deconstructed nowadays as a
  paradigm of colonialism, with Kevin figuring as the benign
  imperialist (or the missionary in the wake of the imperialist),
  the one who intervenes and appropriates the indigenous life and
  interferes with its pristine ecology. And I have to admit that
  there is indeed an irony that it was such a one who recorded and
  preserved this instance of the true beauty of the Irish heritage:
  Kevin's story, after all, appears in the writings of Giraldus
  Cambrensis, one of the Normans who invaded Ireland in the twelfth
  century, one whom the Irish-language annalist Geoffrey Keating
  would call, five hundred years later, "the bull of the herd of
  those who wrote the false history of Ireland." But even so, I
  still cannot persuade myself that this manifestation of early
  Christian civilization should be construed all that simply as a
  way into whatever is exploitative or barbaric in our history,
  past and present. The whole conception strikes me rather as being
  another example of the kind of work I saw a few weeks ago in the
  small museum in Sparta, on the morning before the news of this
  year's Nobel Prize in literature was announced.<br>
  <br>
  This was art which sprang from a cult very different from the
  faith espoused by St. Kevin. Yet in it there was a representation
  of a roosted bird and an entranced beast and a self-enrapturing
  man, except that this time the man was Orpheus and the rapture
  came from music rather than prayer. The work itself was a small
  carved relief and I could not help making a sketch of it; but
  neither could I help copying out the information typed on the
  card which accompanied and identified the exhibit. The image
  moved me because of its antiquity and durability, but the
  description on the card moved me also because it gave a name and
  credence to that which I see myself as having been engaged upon
  for the past three decades: "Votive panel", the identification
  card said, "possibly set up to Orpheus by local poet. Local work
  of the Hellenistic period."</p>

  <center>

  </center>

  <p>Once again, I hope I am not being
  sentimental or simply fetishizing - as we have learnt to say -
  the local. I wish instead to suggest that images and stories of
  the kind I am invoking here do function as bearers of value. The
  century has witnessed the defeat of Nazism by force of arms; but
  the erosion of the Soviet regimes was caused, among other things,
  by the sheer persistence, beneath the imposed ideological
  conformity, of cultural values and psychic resistances of a kind
  that these stories and images enshrine. Even if we have learned
  to be rightly and deeply fearful of elevating the cultural forms
  and conservatisms of any nation into normative and exclusivist
  systems, even if we have terrible proof that pride in an ethnic
  and religious heritage can quickly degrade into the fascistic,
  our vigilance on that score should not displace our love and
  trust in the good of the indigenous per se. On the contrary, a
  trust in the staying power and travel-worthiness of such good
  should encourage us to credit the possibility of a world where
  respect for the validity of every tradition will issue in the
  creation and maintenance of a salubrious political space. In
  spite of devastating and repeated acts of massacre, assassination
  and extirpation, the huge acts of faith which have marked the new
  relations between Palestinians and Israelis, Africans and
  Afrikaners, and the way in which walls have come down in Europe
  and iron curtains have opened, all this inspires a hope that new
  possibility can still open up in Ireland as well. The crux of
  that problem involves an ongoing partition of the island between
  British and Irish jurisdictions, and an equally persistent
  partition of the affections in Northern Ireland between the
  British and Irish heritages; but surely every dweller in the
  country must hope that the governments involved in its governance
  can devise institutions which will allow that partition to become
  a bit more like the net on a tennis court, a demarcation allowing
  for agile give-and-take, for encounter and contending,
  prefiguring a future where the vitality that flowed in the
  beginning from those bracing words "enemy" and "allies" might
  finally derive from a less binary and altogether less binding
  vocabulary.</p>

  <p>When the poet W.B. Yeats stood on this
  platform more than seventy years ago, Ireland was emerging from
  the throes of a traumatic civil war that had followed fast on the
  heels of a war of independence fought against the British. The
  struggle that ensued had been brief enough; it was over by May,
  1923, some seven months before Yeats sailed to Stockholm, but it
  was bloody, savage and intimate, and for generations to come it
  would dictate the terms of politics within the twenty-six
  independent counties of Ireland, that part of the island known
  first of all as the Irish Free State and then subsequently as the
  Republic of Ireland.<br>
  <br>
  Yeats barely alluded to the civil war or the war of independence
  in his Nobel speech. Nobody understood better than he the
  connection between the construction or destruction of state
  institutions and the founding or foundering of cultural life, but
  on this occasion he chose to talk instead about the Irish
  Dramatic Movement. His story was about the creative purpose of
  that movement and its historic good fortune in having not only
  his own genius to sponsor it, but also the genius of his friends
  John Millington Synge and Lady Augusta Gregory. He came to Sweden
  to tell the world that the local work of poets and dramatists had
  been as important to the transformation of his native place and
  times as the ambushes of guerrilla armies; and his boast in that
  elevated prose was essentially the same as the one he would make
  in verse more than a decade later in his poem "The Municipal
  Gallery Revisited". There Yeats presents himself amongst the
  portraits and heroic narrative paintings which celebrate the
  events and personalities of recent history and all of a sudden
  realizes that something truly epoch-making has occurred: " 'This
  is not', I say,/'The dead Ireland of my youth, but an Ireland/The
  poets have imagined, terrible and gay.' " And the poem concludes
  with two of the most quoted lines of his entire oeuvre:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">Think where man's glory most begins and
    ends,<br>
    And say my glory was I had such friends.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And yet, expansive and thrilling as these
  lines are, they are an instance of poetry flourishing itself
  rather than proving itself, they are the poet's lap of honour,
  and in this respect if in no other they resemble what I am doing
  in this lecture. In fact, I should quote here on my own behalf
  some other words from the poem: "You that would judge me, do not
  judge alone/This book or that." Instead, I ask you to do what
  Yeats asked his audience to do and think of the achievement of
  Irish poets and dramatists and novelists over the past forty
  years, among whom I am proud to count great friends. In literary
  matters, Ezra Pound advised against accepting the opinion of
  those "who haven't themselves produced notable work," and it is
  advice I have been privileged to follow, since it is the good
  opinion of notable workers and not just those in my own
  country-that has fortified my endeavour since I began to write in
  Belfast more than thirty years ago. The Ireland I now inhabit is
  one that these Irish contemporaries have helped to imagine.<br>
  <br>
  Yeats, however, was by no means all flourish. To the credit of
  poetry in our century there must surely be entered in any
  reckoning his two great sequences of poems entitled "Nineteen
  Hundred and Nineteen" and "Meditations in Time of Civil War", the
  latter of which contains the famous lyric about the bird's nest
  at his window, where a starling or stare had built in a crevice
  of the old wall. The poet was living then in a Norman tower which
  had been very much a part of the military history of the country
  in earlier and equally troubled times, and as his thoughts turned
  upon the irony of civilizations being consolidated by violent and
  powerful conquerors who end up commissioning the artists and the
  architects, he began to associate the sight of a mother bird
  feeding its young with the image of the honey bee, an image
  deeply lodged in poetic tradition and always suggestive of the
  ideal of an industrious, harmonious, nurturing commonwealth:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The bees build in the crevices<br>
    Of loosening masonry, and there<br>
    The mother birds bring grubs and flies.<br>
    My wall is loosening; honey-bees,<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br>
    <br>
    We are closed in, and the key is turned<br>
    On our uncertainty; somewhere<br>
    A man is killed, or a house burned,<br>
    Yet no clear fact to be discerned:<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br>
    <br>
    A barricade of stone or of wood;<br>
    Some fourteen days of civil war;<br>
    Last night they trundled down the road<br>
    That dead young soldier in his blood:<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br>
    <br>
    We had fed the heart on fantasies,<br>
    The heart's grown brutal from the fare;<br>
    More substance in our enmities<br>
    Than in our love; O honey-bees,<br>
    Come build in the empty house of the stare.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have heard this poem repeated often, in
  whole and in part, by people in Ireland over the past twenty-five
  years, and no wonder, for it is as tender minded towards life
  itself as St. Kevin was and as tough-minded about what happens in
  and to life as Homer. It knows that the massacre will happen
  again on the roadside, that the workers in the minibus are going
  to be lined up and shot down just after quitting time; but it
  also credits as a reality the squeeze of the hand, the actuality
  of sympathy and protectiveness between living creatures. It
  satisfies the contradictory needs which consciousness experiences
  at times of extreme crisis, the need on the one hand for a truth
  telling that will be hard and retributive, and on the other hand,
  the need not to harden the mind to a point where it denies its
  own yearnings for sweetness and trust.<br>
  <br>
  It is a proof that poetry can be equal to and true at the same
  time, an example of that completely adequate poetry which the
  Russian woman sought from Anna Akhmatova and which William
  Wordsworth produced at a corresponding moment of historical
  crisis and personal dismay almost exactly two hundred years
  ago.</p>

  <p>When the bard Demodocus sings of the fall
  of Troy and of the slaughter that accompanied it, Odysseus weeps
  and Homer says that his tears were like the tears of a wife on a
  battlefield weeping for the death of a fallen husband. His epic
  simile continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the sight of the man panting and dying
    there,<br>
    she slips down to enfold him, crying out;<br>
    then feels the spears, prodding her back and shoulders,<br>
    and goes bound into slavery and grief.<br>
    Piteous weeping wears away her cheeks:<br>
    but no more piteous than Odysseus' tears,<br>
    cloaked as they were, now, from the company.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Even to-day, three thousand years later, as
  we channel-surf over so much live coverage of contemporary
  savagery, highly informed but nevertheless in danger of growing
  immune, familiar to the point of overfamiliarity with old
  newsreels of the concentration camp and the gulag, Homer's image
  can still bring us to our senses. The callousness of those spear
  shafts on the woman's back and shoulders survives time and
  translation. The image has that documentary adequacy which
  answers all that we know about the intolerable.<br>
  <br>
  But there is another kind of adequacy which is specific to lyric
  poetry. This has to do with the "temple inside our hearing" which
  the passage of the poem calls into being. It is an adequacy
  deriving from what Mandelstam called "the steadfastness of speech
  articulation," from the resolution and independence which the
  entirely realized poem sponsors. It has as much to do with the
  energy released by linguistic fission and fusion, with the
  buoyancy generated by cadence and tone and rhyme and stanza, as
  it has to do with the poem's concerns or the poet's truthfulness.
  In fact, in lyric poetry, truthfulness becomes recognizable as a
  ring of truth within the medium itself. And it is the
  unappeasable pursuit of this note, a note tuned to its most
  extreme in Emily Dickinson and Paul Celan and orchestrated to its
  most opulent in John Keats, it is this which keeps the poet's ear
  straining to hear the totally persuasive voice behind all the
  other informing voices.<br>
  <br>
  Which is a way of saying that I have never quite climbed down
  from the arm of that sofa. I may have grown more attentive to the
  news and more alive to the world history and world-sorrow behind
  it. But the thing uttered by the speaker I strain towards is
  still not quite the story of what is going on; it is more
  reflexive than that, because as a poet I am in fact straining
  towards a strain, seeking repose in the stability conferred by a
  musically satisfying order of sounds. As if the ripple at its
  widest desired to be verified by a reformation of itself, to be
  drawn in and drawn out through its point of origin.<br>
  <br>
  I also strain towards this in the poetry I read. And I find it,
  for example, in the repetition of that refrain of Yeats's, "Come
  build in the empty house of the stare," with its tone of
  supplication, its pivots of strength in the words "build" and
  "house" and its acknowledgement of dissolution in the word
  "empty". I find it also in the triangle of forces held in
  equilibrium by the triple rhyme of "fantasies" and "enmities" and
  "honey-bees", and in the sheer in-placeness of the whole poem as
  a given form within the language. Poetic form is both the ship
  and the anchor. It is at once a buoyancy and a steadying,
  allowing for the simultaneous gratification of whatever is
  centrifugal and whatever is centripetal in mind and body. And it
  is by such means that Yeats's work does what the necessary poetry
  always does, which is to touch the base of our sympathetic nature
  while taking in at the same time the unsympathetic nature of the
  world to which that nature is constantly exposed. The form of the
  poem, in other words, is crucial to poetry's power to do the
  thing which always is and always will be to poetry's credit: the
  power to persuade that vulnerable part of our consciousness of
  its rightness in spite of the evidence of wrongness all around
  it, the power to remind us that we are hunters and gatherers of
  values, that our very solitudes and distresses are creditable, in
  so far as they, too, are an earnest of our veritable human
  being.</p>
