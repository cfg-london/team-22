<h1>Barack H. Obama - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="obama.jpg" class="bio-img">Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States.</p>
<p>His story is the American story &ndash; values from the heartland, a middle-class
  upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of
  getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in
  service to others.</p>
<p>With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was
  born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather,
  who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way
  up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.</p>
<p>After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and
  student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a
  group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of
  local steel plants.</p>
<p>He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned
  to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional
  law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.</p>
<p>President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering
  belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the
  Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years,
  cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and
  their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass
  groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous
  weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending
  online.</p>
<p>He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4,
  2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the
  proud parents of two daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.</p>
