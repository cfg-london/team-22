  <h2>Pernicious Anemia</h2>

  <p>During the twenty-year period following
  1849, in which year Thomas Addison first described the diseased
  condition, which he designated as "idiopathic" anemia, reports of
  similar cases were published by such men as Barclay, Wilks,
  Bristowe, Lebert, Habershon, and others.</p>

  <p>Further interest was aroused, both on the
  Continent and in America, by Biermer's discussion of a group of
  patients with severe anemia of varying etiology, in a paper
  published in 1872. As a designation for these cases he suggested
  "progressive pernicious" anemia, a name which became more
  generally used than "idiopathic" anemia, suggested by Addison.
  Biermer also called attention to the frequency of retinal
  hemorrhages and the occurrence of fever in his cases.</p>

  <p>Even as early as 1878, Eichhorst published
  a 375-page monograph on Progressive Pernicious Anemia, and five
  years later Laache of Christiania published his monograph on
  anemia, which consisted of 256 printed pages together with many
  graphs and plates illustrating the blood changes. He described
  particularly the presence in the blood of large, deeply coloured
  corpuscles. Quincke had previously called attention to the
  variations in shape of the red blood corpuscles - the
  poikilocytosis.</p>

  <p>Even these early papers had presented the
  clinical picture of pernicious anemia essentially as we see it
  today. Various theories as to the etiology were discussed but
  perhaps the one of most interest, when viewed in the light of
  knowledge available since the era of liver therapy, is that
  presented in 1880 by Fenwick in his book <i>Atrophy of the
  Stomach</i>. Fenwick wrote: "indeed most of the symptoms are not
  the immediate result of the atrophy of the stomach, but arise
  from the deficiency of the blood produced by it" And again: "it
  will be readily conceded that the anemia that accompanies atrophy
  of the stomach is the result of the imperfect secretion of the
  gastric juice consequent upon it".</p>

  <p>Since the earliest use of liver in the
  treatment of pernicious anemia, however, new fields of
  observation have been made available both in the clinic and in
  the laboratory. We have been allowed the thrill of watching the
  patient through a few days of depression following the
  institution of liver therapy until remission occurs with its
  often sudden and almost unbelievable sense of well-being
  simultaneously with the maximum increase of the reticulocytes or
  new red blood cells. Then we have followed this remission through
  to completion, until the blood becomes normal, with a normal red
  blood cell level - that is 5,000,000 or more cells per cubic
  millimeter of blood. Perhaps even more dramatic has been the
  improvement in the disturbances of locomotion resulting from
  nerve damage. But all of this has been described in our early
  papers, so that further details need not here be recited.</p>

  <p>Observations of the patients at intervals
  in the office or hospital blood clinic, and attention to the
  important details of treatment have made it possible for us to
  regularly maintain our patients in a state of economic efficiency
  and with reasonably good health. Forty-two of the forty-five
  patients originally treated and discussed in our first paper of
  1926 have been kept under observation. Of this number,
  thirty-one, or approximately three fourths, are living and well
  after almost ten years of treatment. Eleven have died from
  various causes other than pernicious anemia.</p>

  <p>The problem which, during the past few
  years, has particularly interested me, as a practitioner of
  medicine, has been the practical one of making treatment more
  bearable for the victim of pernicious anemia, who must
  necessarily continue treatment indefinitely in order to maintain
  a satisfactory state of health. For this purpose treatment must
  be simplified, its efficiency increased and its cost decreased.
  Definite progress has been made in this direction through the
  development of a liver extract for parenteral use. At the Peter
  Bent Brigham Hospital we have, for over three years, used an
  extract of uniform potency for intramuscular injection which is
  so concentrated that 3 cubic centimeters is prepared from 100
  grams of liver, and represents the potency of fifty times the
  amount of liver from which it is prepared. Or, in other words,
  the injection intramuscularly of 3 cubic centimeters prepared
  from 100 grams of liver is equivalent in its effect to that of
  5,000 grams of whole liver when taken perorally.</p>

  <p>Because of the concentration of the extract
  and its uniform and high potency, it is possible to bring about
  improvement most rapidly and with confidence, to maintain a
  normal blood level and state of health with infrequent
  injections, perhaps three cubic centimeters every two to four
  weeks, and at a minimum of expense to the patient. A rough
  comparison of dosage and cost of treatment by the various means
  may be of interest. It is estimated that 5,000 grams of whole
  liver, 84 vials of liver extract for peroral use (prepared from
  8,400 grams of liver) and 3 cubic centimeters or 1 vial of liver
  extract for intramuscular injection (prepared from 100 grams of
  liver) will have essentially similar effects. The liver may cost
  $5.50, the liver extract for peroral use $17.00 and the liver
  extract for intramuscular use $1.17, a striking difference.</p>

  <p>Not only has this liver extract for
  intramuscular injection proved its value for pernicious anemia;it
  has also, which is perhaps of even greater importance, displayed
  its ability to stimulate the production of leucocytes. The fact
  that the granulocytes may be practically doubled in number within
  from six to eight hours after a single injection, recommends its
  use in many of those diseased states accompanied by
  granulocytopenia, such as pneumonia, influenza, agranulocytosis
  of Schultz, and even in some instances post-operatively.</p>

  <p>Again, we find it effective in enhancing
  the rate of hemoglobin formation in the hypochromic anemias
  treated with iron. Perhaps its effects here is in producing the
  stroma or envelope in which the hemoglobin may be more quickly
  and normally stored.</p>

  <p>So there will continue to be found more and
  more uses for this highly potent material and, with even greater
  concentration in the near future, it will further lighten for the
  patient the burden of continued treatment. During the next few
  years many important problems in the general field of the blood
  dyscrasias will also be solved as a direct result of the
  introduction of liver therapy for pernicious anemia.</p>

  <p>Rather than enlarge further upon the
  details and results of the treatment of pernicious anemia, I
  shall now present, with your permission, a motion picture which
  will illustrate many points more clearly than I could discuss
  them here.</p>
