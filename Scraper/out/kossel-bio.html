  <h1>Albrecht Kossel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kossel.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ludwig Karl
  Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel</b> was born in Rostock on
  September 16, 1853. He was the eldest son of the merchant and
  Prussian consul Albrecht Kossel and his wife Clara,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeppe. He attended the secondary school in
  Rostock and went, in the autumn of 1872, to the newly founded
  University of Strassburg in order to study medicine. He was
  especially influenced by the lectures and practical teaching of
  de Bary, Waldeyer, Kundt, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1905/index.html">Baeyer</a> and especially
  by Hoppe-Seyler.<br>
  <br>
  Part of his studies were carried out in the University of his
  hometown Rostock where he passed in 1877 the state medical
  examination and in 1878 the degree of Doctor of Medicine was
  conferred on him. In the autumn of 1877 he took an assistantship
  in Hoppe-Seyler's Institute of Physical Chemistry in Strassburg
  and in 1881 he qualified as Lecturer of Physiological Chemistry
  and Hygiene. In 1883 E. du Bois-Reymond called him to become
  Director of the Chemical Division of the Institute of Physiology
  in Berlin in place of E. Baumann who had gone to Freiburg and
  here, in 1887, he became Extraordinary Professor in the Medical
  Faculty. In April 1895 he moved to Marburg in
  Hessen as Ordinary Professor of Physiology and Director of the
  Institute of Physiology there. Here he worked until the spring of
  1901. Then he was called to the Chair in Heidelberg formerly held
  by K&uuml;hne and before him by Helmholtz. In 1907 he was
  appointed &laquo;Geheimer Hofrat&raquo; (Privy Councillor) and in
  this year also he presided as Chairman over the Seventh
  International Congress of Physiology in Heidelberg. In 1908-1909
  he was Prorector of this University.<br>
  <br>
  Albrecht Kossel was an honorary doctor of the Universities of
  Cambridge,
  Dublin, Ghent, Greifswald, St. Andrews and Edinburgh, and a member of various Academies,
  among which are the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1910/kossel-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/en/" target="_blank">Royal
  Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> and the Royal Society of Sciences
  of Uppsala.<br>
  <br>
  Kossel's field of work was physiological chemistry, especially
  the chemistry of tissues and cells; his activities as a teacher
  in the University, however, extended to general physiology, which
  in his time was in most German universities still not separated
  from physiological chemistry. He began his investigations into
  the constitution of the cell nucleus at the end of the seventies,
  and in the nineties he turned more and more to the study of the
  proteins, the alterations in proteins during transformation into
  peptone, the effects of a phenetol diet on the urine, the
  peptonic components of the cells, the simplest proteins, etc.
  Working on fish-roe he studied the protamines and hexone bases.
  In 1896 he discovered histidine, then worked out the classical
  method for the quantitaive separation of the hexone bases. With
  his distinguished English pupil H. D. Dakin he investigated
  arginase, the ferment which hydrolyses arginine into urea and
  ornithine, and later he discovered agmatine in herring roe and
  devised a method for preparing it.<br>
  <br>
  Kossel was active in securing the foundation of separate chairs
  of physiology and medical chemistry in German universities so
  that these subjects would develop. His works were published
  chiefly in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r physiologische Chemie</i>,
  which after the deaths of Hoppe-Seyler and E. Baumann came under
  his direction.<br>
  <br>
  Among his important publications may be mentioned:
  <i>Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Nukleine und ihre
  Spaltungsprodubte</i> (Investigations into the nucleins and their
  cleavage products), 1881; <i>Die Gewebe des menschlichen
  K&ouml;rpers und ihre mikroskopische Untersuchung</i> (The
  tissues in the human body and their microscopic investigation),
  1889-1891, in two volumes, with Behrens and Schieerdecker; and
  the <i>Leitfaden f&uuml;r medizinisch-chemische Kurse</i>
  (Textbook for medical-chemical courses), 1888, since reprinted
  several times. He was also the author of <i>Die Probleme der
  Biochemie</i> (The problems of biochemistry), 1908; <i>Die
  Beziehungen der Chemie zur Physiologie</i> (The relationships
  between chemistry and physiology), which was a contribution to
  <i>Kultur der Gegenwart</i>, 1913.<br>
  <br>
  Kossel had one daughter and one son, Walther (1888-1956), who
  became a prominent Professor of Theoretical Physics at Kiel until
  he moved to the corresponding position at the Danzig Institute of
  Technology (1932-1945), and in 1947 became Professor at
  T&uuml;bingen University.<br>
  <br>
  Albrecht Kossel died on July 5, 1927.</p>
