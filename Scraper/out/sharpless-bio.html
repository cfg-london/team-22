  <h1>K. Barry Sharpless - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sharpless.jpg" class="bio-img">From
  6th through 12th grades I attended a Quaker school on the
  Philadelphia city line. Twice a week the entire school attended
  Quaker Meeting, silent gatherings except when someone received a
  personal call to speak.</p>

  <p>I never got a call, but nonetheless my head
  was full: I thought about fishing and boats. Or else I thought
  about when next I could get from Philadelphia to our cottage on
  the New Jersey Shore in order to go out fishing in a boat.
  Beneath my picture in one high school yearbook it says, "I'm
  going to the Shore".</p>

  <p>While I had an overwhelming passion for
  fishing, school I merely enjoyed and I never planned to be a
  scientist. In fact, passion, not planning, is the engine driving
  all my thought and action. The almost unimaginably good fortune
  of my youth was that other people made such very, very good plans
  and choices for me.</p>

  <p>My parents selected the excellent Friends
  Central School where, fortuitously, Clayton Farraday was both a
  science teacher and the school's beloved Mr. Chips. The
  counselors there decided, wisely, that I should attend a college
  rather than a large university, and I departed Philadelphia for
  Dartmouth
  College in the fall of 1959. Though literature courses there
  were my favorites, I was a pre-medical student solely because my
  parents always hoped that I'd become an MD like my father.
  Pre-meds majored in chemistry or biology, and between the two I
  leaned toward chemistry. I didn't get really interested, however,
  until I had two semesters of organic my sophomore year from a
  young chemistry professor who chose me to do research in his lab.
  When I graduated Dartmouth a few years later, in 1963, the same
  prof called my next move, a PhD in organic chemistry instead of
  medical school. He even chose the graduate school I attended and
  my research supervisor there. Such a strong intervention in a
  student's life is no doubt unusual, but the precipitating events
  were unusual, too.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, colleges have the best
  undergraduate teaching, and universities, whose labs are filled
  by graduate and post-graduate students, have the best research.
  When I arrived at Dartmouth College in 1959, the chemistry
  department had a graduate program, which meant great teachers who
  were just as good at research. However, the program was small,
  and only a master's degree was awarded, so consequently
  professors were perpetually hungry for more manpower for their
  labs, more "hands". Undergraduates who performed well in lab
  courses were actively recruited to do "real" graduate- level
  research.</p>

  <p>Thomas A. Spencer, a brand-new assistant
  professor of chemistry, arrived at Dartmouth when I did, and I
  was part of his research group for three years. Because Tom was
  (and still is) so smart and such a good chemist, he could
  recognize not just talent, but the potential to do something
  significant; because Tom was also born a great teacher, he was
  obliged to give a swift kick to my comfortable obliviousness.
  Fishing, now in the form of working all summer on charter boats,
  continued as my abiding passion, which meant I continued to need
  a wise person to make good decisions for me. If some variables in
  my adult life were changed, I might still have made it onto these
  pages, but it never would have happened without Tom Spencer.</p>

  <p>Since some family background and
  professional activities (and lots more about fishing) are in the
  Nobel lecture that follows, and since the standard biographical
  folderol is most easily found online at www.scripps.edu/ chem/sharpless/, I hope to provide
  a more interesting read with the highly subjective and largely
  unorthodox personal information that follows.</p>

  <p>I met my future wife, Jan Dueser, at a
  beach party at San Gregorio, west across the foothills from
  Stanford
  University. I was a first-year graduate student, and she was
  a Stanford sophomore and, on that day, my roommate's date. I
  admired her touch football form, and she entrusted me with her
  delicate wristwatch, which I lost in the sand. We were married
  about a year-and-a-half later, on April 28, 1965, my 24th
  birthday, at the Palo Alto courthouse. David Schooley, a fellow
  chemistry grad student and now a professor at University of
  Nevada, Reno, was our best man.</p>

  <p>Jan and I practiced with dogs before we had
  children; chemists still ask about our first, the black and
  enormous Lionel, a regular laboratory and classroom visitor at
  MIT. Our
  daughter Hannah (whose nickname "Pippi", comes from "pipette",
  not from Miss Longstocking) was born in 1976, and is a middle
  school teacher in Boston. To chemists who've attended my
  seminars, she is permanently six years old, the familiar Alice in
  Wonderland who gazes at the huge book of Looking Glass Sugars.
  William ("Will") and Isaac ("Ike") followed Hannah at two-year
  intervals. Both of our sons are still college undergraduates.
  None of our children has much interest in science, and I'm sorry,
  but not disappointed, that that is so.</p>

      "Fishing">
    

    
      My passion for chemistry was preceded by
      a passion for fishing.
    
  </p>

  <p>With no children at home any more, dogs
  are, once again, our companions of choice - for play, for
  exercise and for hanging out with in bed. I haven't gone fishing
  for probably over thirty years, but the ocean is still programmed
  into me like the birth stream of a salmon. One of the glories of
  moving to Scripps in 1990 has been seeing the Pacific Ocean every
  day, and, when its temperature reaches 70&deg; (July or August),
  swimming in it every day as well. In windy New England I
  wind-surfed and we loved our little catamaran; San Diego's
  sail-less ocean vistas still seem weird.</p>

  <p>My most important award, the greatest honor
  I've ever received, and the grandest and most memorable occasions
  I've ever witnessed, are, of course, benefits of sharing the 2001
  Nobel Prize in Chemistry. But other honors have peerless
  characteristics as well, notably:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The heaviest object in our bank deposit box is the 1995 King
    Faisal Prize for Science medal; the most beautiful one is the
    1988 Prelog Medal from the Swiss Federal Institute of
    Technology (ETH). Its exquisite relief rendering of Old Vlado's
    profile rivals the most beautiful portraits found on coins from
    antiquity, and the gold has a gorgeous, pliant, velvety warmth
    that has to be seen to be believed (by appointment only). A
    friend once asked, quite appropriately, if the portrait was of
    Alexander the Great.<br>
    <br>
    Three unique objects, and I treasure each one, celebrate the
    day in 1995 when I received an honorary doctorate from Stockholm's Royal
    Institute of Technology. My only top hat, frequently
    brought out for guests to admire, bears the Institute's seal;
    my only ring, always admired when I wear it, is a heavy gold
    band surrounded by a garland of leaves and acorns in deep
    relief. These two I share with all the Institute's doctoral
    recipients, but I also have a large brass cannon shell casing,
    fired during the cannon salute that accompanied the conferring
    of the degree and the ceremonial placing of the hat on my head.
    The shell sits on my desk at home.<br>
    <br>
    Only one award commemoration of mine is lettered on real
    vellum, and it is the largest one, as well: in both English and
    Hebrew the 1998 Harvey Science and Technology Prize of the
    Israel
    Institute of Technology, Haifa's Technion, is
    proclaimed.<br>
    <br>
    In the category "news received most delightfully", the winner
    is&#8230; an April, 1984, telephone call Jan took in a
    Jacksonville, Florida, hotel room all five of us were sharing
    while I attended a meeting. On the line from Washington, D.C.
    was my MIT colleague George B&uuml;chi, the most generous and
    thoughtful colleague I have ever known. George said he was
    calling because it was announced just minutes before that I had
    been elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences. When Jan replied
    that she'd pass the message on, George said, no, she must go
    immediately to the meeting room and give me the message. Our
    children were too young to be left alone, especially since the
    meeting room was next to a swimming pool. I was giving my talk
    when I saw Jan and the three children, and all of them on
    tiptoes, enter the room and move along the back in the
    semi-darkness. She was looking for a familiar face, and she
    whispered the message when she found one. I stopped talking as
    Jan's informant walked to the front of the room and asked for
    the lights to be brought up so he could make an important
    announcement. Why the audience was so enthusiastic I wasn't
    quite sure. Not only did I not know I'd been nominated, I
    didn't even know one had to be nominated. I thought the
    National Academy was something like a high-level appointed
    government advisory committee. Learning otherwise was a
    wonderful surprise.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Inaugural events always have special
  significance and vivid memories; these "firsts" mean a lot to
  me:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Receiving the first Paul Janssen Prize for Creativity in
    Organic Synthesis, presented by HRH Prince (now King) Albert of
    Belgium. Security forces were everywhere that day in 1986, and
    I asked Prince Albert if having to travel with such a large
    group wasn't inconvenient. No, he replied, all those soldiers
    were required because I was an American - he didn't need
    them.<br>
    <br>
    Being Texas A &amp; M's first Barton Lecturer, 1997. Nothing is
    dearer me than having been selected by Sir Derek, my
    career-long scientific role model and mentor, to deliver the
    first edition of a lectureship endowed in his honor, the only
    Barton Lecture to take place before his death in 1998.<br>
    <br>
                Launching the University of Sydney's Cornforth 
                Foundation for Chemistry (which honors both Rita and Kappa) 
                with the inaugural <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1975/index.html">Cornforth</a> 
                lecture in 2002. Like Sir Derek, Sir John is one of our gods; 
                I stand awed at having participated in these events honoring them.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And, finally, if I had a crown, its jewels
  would be the 75-or-so former Sharpless Group members who are
  research professors. The training received in the group is
  neither predictable nor quantifiable; likewise, it is not
  intended to produce a product that, for example, industry wants.
  Since nothing original is intentionally discovered by scientists
  who cannot tolerate (indeed, they should welcome it) a high
  degree of uncertainty, group membership does not guarantee
  results. Because of the nature of our research, however, group
  members preselect themselves and possess a remarkably high degree
  of independence of thought as well as scientific motives tilted
  toward discovery, not reward. As a group, they hold superior
  standards for judging the significance of research, and I share
  with all them all of the glory that is a Nobel Prize.</p>
