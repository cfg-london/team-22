  <h1>Jos&eacute; Echegaray - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="eizaguirre.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Jos&eacute; de Echegaray</b> (1833-1916), son of a professor of
  Greek, was born in Madrid. He went to an engineering school,
  studied economics, and had a distinguished career in the Spanish
  Government. He was successively Minister of Public Works and
  Finance Minister. At the height of his career he turned to the
  stage, a passion that dated back to his youth. A mathematician,
  engineer, and administrator, he built his plays with the same
  regard for exactitude and duty that inspired his public life.
  Conflicts involving duty are at the heart of most of his plays,
  and he upheld the idea with uncompromising severity. His exalted
  romanticism appears in his choice of subjects. Like his great
  predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, Echegaray was a prolific
  playwright. His most famous plays were: <i>La esposa del
  vengador</i> (1874) [The Avenger's Wife]; <i>En el pu&ntilde;o de
  la espada</i> (1875) [The Sword's Handle]; <i>En el pilar y en la
  cruz</i> (1878) [The Stake and the Cross], a play defending the
  freedom of thought, which aroused much controversy; <i>Conflicto
  entre dos deberes</i> (1882) [Conflict of Duties], the title of
  which is programmatic for Echegaray's entire work; <i>O locura
  &oacute; santidad</i> (1877) [<i>Madman or Saint</i>]; and <i>El
  gran Galeoto</i> (1881) [<i>Great Galeoto</i> ].</p>
