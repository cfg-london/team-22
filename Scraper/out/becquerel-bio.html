  <h1>Henri Becquerel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="becquerel.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Antoine Henri Becquerel</b>
  was born in Paris on December 15, 1852, a member of a
  distinguished family of scholars and scientists. His father,
  Alexander Edmond Becquerel, was a Professor of Applied Physics
  and had done research on solar radiation and on phosphorescence,
  while his grandfather, Antoine C&eacute;sar, had been a Fellow of
  the Royal Society and the inventor of an electrolytic method for
  extracting metals from their ores. He entered the Polytechnic in
  1872, then the government department of Ponts-et-Chauss&eacute;es in
  1874, becoming ing&eacute;nieur in 1877 and being promoted to
  ing&eacute;nieur-en-chef in 1894. In 1888 he acquired the degree of
  docteur-&egrave;s-sciences. From 1878 he had held an appointment as
  an Assistant at the Museum of Natural History, taking over from
  his father in the Chair of Applied Physics at the Conservatoire
  des Arts et Metiers. In 1892 he was appointed Professor of
  Applied Physics in the Department of Natural History at the Paris
  Museum. He became a Professor at the Polytechnic in 1895.<br>

  Becquerel's earliest work was concerned with the plane
  polarization of light, with the phenomenon of phosphorescence and
  with the absorption of light by crystals (his doctorate thesis).
  He also worked on the subject of terrestrial magnetism. In 1896,
  his previous work was overshadowed by his discovery of the
  phenomenon of natural radioactivity. Following a discussion with
  Henri Poincar&eacute; on the radiation which had recently been
  discovered by R&ouml;ntgen (X-rays) and which was accompanied by
  a type of phosphorescence in the vacuum tube, Becquerel decided
  to investigate whether there was any connection between X-rays
  and naturally occurring phosphorescence. He had inherited from
  his father a supply of uranium salts, which phosphoresce on
  exposure to light. When the salts were placed near to a
  photographic plate covered with opaque paper, the plate was
  discovered to be fogged. The phenomenon was found to be common to
  all the uranium salts studied and was concluded to be a property
  of the uranium atom. Later, Becquerel showed that the rays
  emitted by uranium, which for a long time were named after their
  discoverer, caused gases to ionize and that they differed from
  X-rays in that they could be deflected by electric or magnetic
  fields. For his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity Becquerel
  was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, the
  other half being given to Pierre and Marie Curie for their study
  of the Becquerel radiation.<br>
  <br>
  Becquerel published his findings in many papers, principally in
  the Annales de Physique et de Chimie and the Comptes Rendus de
  l'Academie des Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  He was elected a member of the Academie des Sciences de France in
  1889 and succeeded Berthelot as Life Secretary of that body. He
  was a member also of the Accademia dei Lincei and of the Royal
  Academy of Berlin, amongst others. He was made an Officer of the
  Legion of Honour in 1900.<br>
  <br>
  He was married to Mlle. Janin, the daughter of a civil engineer.
  They had a son Jean, b. 1878, who was also a physicist: the
  fourth generation of scientists in the Becquerel family.</p>

  <p>Antoine Henri Becquerel died at Le Croisic
  on August 25, 1908.</p>
