  <h1>Theodor W. H&auml;nsch - Biographical</h1>
 
<p><img src="hansch.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on October 30, 1941. My
 parents had moved there from their native Breslau a few years earlier.
 As far as I can tell, I am the only academic in our family. My
 father Karl H&auml;nsch was a businessman engaged in the export
 of farming machinery, while my mother Marta raised her three children
 as a house wife. My younger brother Julius entered the book printing
 business, and my sister Lucia married a fellow physics graduate
 student and now helps run a small electronics engineering company.</p>
   
    
 <p>Growing up during and after the second world war left some vivid
 memories. I can still see our family huddled together in the basement
 bomb shelter of our home in Heidelberg listening to the piercing
 sound of air raid sirens. After the war, our family had lost its
 estate in Breslau, and we had to share our small ground floor
 apartment in Heidelberg with some war refugees as subtenants. Without
 childhood diversions such as television, my brother and I gained
 a strong sense of independence and adventure by playing in the
 bombed ruins at the nearby railway station or exploring the many
 hiking trails on the slopes of the Gaisberg and K&ouml;nigstuhl.
 My father had long been disillusioned with the Nazi political leadership
 and raised us as rebels in spirit, distrusting any official authority.</p>
    
 <p>My father also kindled my early interest in science. During the
 first world war, volunteering at a pharmacy, he became interested
 in medicine and chemistry. In Heidelberg we lived at Bunsenstrasse
 10, in the house that had once belonged to the chemist Robert Bunsen.
 When I was about six years old, I asked my father what Bunsen had
 done to have a street named after him. On the next day he brought
 home a Bunsen burner which we connected to the gas stove in the
 kitchen. With a sprinkle of table salt, the blue flame turned to
 a bright yellow. My father explained that this is the characteristic
 color emitted by sodium atoms that are excited in the flame. It
 was obvious to me that I had to find out more about light and atoms.
 A little later, my father took me to visit the metallurgical laboratory
 of the Heinrich Lanz AG in Mannheim, where I was impressed by
 researchers in white lab coats who allowed me to look into their
 fancy microscopes. At a time when other boys dreamt about steering
 steam locomotives, I started to see myself as a future scientist.</p>
    
 <p>In 1952, I entered the Helmholtz Gymnasium in Heidelberg, then
 located at the Kettengasse in the old town below the castle. Although
 the school emphasized modern languages and science, my father enrolled
 me in a rather small class with Latin as the first language to
 maintain my option of studying medicine. During the later years
 we enjoyed some remarkable teachers. Dr. Mampel, our physics and
 chemistry teacher, gave me free reign of the school's collection
 of demonstration apparatus, and Dr. Biser, a Kaplan at the nearby
 Jesuitenkirche, who later became an eminent religious philosopher,
 turned the obligatory religious studies into a fascinating course
 on Western philosophy.</p>
    
 <p>Early on, my interest in science dominated my activities outside
 school. I eagerly read popular science and science fiction books
 from the public library until I learned how to check out textbooks
 from the University library. I also liked doing experiments with
 my own hands. Intrigued by the world of chemistry, I started to
 spend my weekly allowance in pharmacies willing to sell substances
 like fuming nitric acid or white phosphorous to a young boy who
 stored his growing collection of chemicals in the bedroom of his
 parents. After an intimidating accident with bomb-making materials,
 my interests moved from chemistry to physics and electronics. Around
 1957, I acquired an old cold cathode X-ray tube which I operated
 at home after winding a large Ruhmkorff-style induction coil. I
 also built a transistorized Geiger counter to perform experiments
 with a radioactive sample of 0.1 millicurie of Mesothorium which
 I had bought at a factory for radioactive luminous paint. To calibrate
 the Geiger counter, I went to the nuclear physics laboratory of
 Professor Otto Haxel at the University of Heidelberg, where an
 assistant was very kind and willing to introduce me to the real
 world of physics research. At that time, I set my sights on becoming
 a nuclear physicist and university professor.</p>
 
 <p><b>Study at the University of Heidelberg<br>
 </b>After the Abitur in 1961, I enrolled
   at the University of Heidelberg as a physics student. During the first two
   years most of my energy went to the study of mathematics. The lectures on
   physics and chemistry seemed like entertaining diversions by comparison. I
   was awed by the power and elegance of pure mathematical reasoning. But after
 a while I realized how much the complexity of an abstract formalism
 can sometimes distract from true physical insights. Since then
 I have acquired a compulsion to always try and construct the simplest
 possible intuitive model to &quot;understand&quot; a physics
 phenomenon. Such models have often helped me to perform quick order
 of magnitude estimates and to rapidly weed out half-baked ideas.
 Playing around with intuitive concepts I frequently arrive at interesting
 ideas only to find out that the results have been worked out long
 ago and are well known. But every once in a while I have experienced
 the immense joy that comes with some entirely new insight or invention.</p>
 <p>After the Vordiplom in 1963, I enrolled in the Betatron laboratory
 of Professor Hans Kopfermann for the Grosspraktikum, an initial
 laboratory project of about six months. Unfortunately, Professor
 Kopfermann had died just before I could begin work on my assignment,
 the construction of a transistorized fast linear gate for a semiconductor
 detector of alpha particles which I quickly completed. In the spring
 of 1964, I attended my first meeting of the German Physical Society.
 Listening to different talks in a nuclear and particle physics
 session describing the work of large teams working at big machines,
 I lost some of my enthusiasm for this kind of research.</p>
    
 <p>Instead, I became intrigued by the growing excitement about lasers
 which had been invented a few years earlier. In the neighboring
 Institute of Applied Physics at Albert-&Uuml;berle-Strasse, Professor
 Christoph Schmelzer had started to design a linear accelerator
 for heavy ions that was later realized at the GSI in Darmstadt. 
 Since he felt that lasers might help to synchronize the phases
 of the individual resonators, he had hired Dr. Peter Toschek, a
 former student of Professor Wolfgang Paul in Bonn, as an assistant
 to set up a laser group in Heidelberg. Visiting this laboratory
 I was awed by the sight of a helium neon laser with its glowing
 discharge tube emitting an intense collimated beam of red laser
 light that produced an otherworldly speckle pattern. I sensed a
 large unexplored new world, and I instantly decided to switch fields.
 Fortunately Peter Toschek accepted me into his group so that I
 could pursue my two years of diploma research on gas lasers. Since
 commercial lasers were not yet available, we had to build everything
 ourselves, including the glass discharge tubes with their electrodes
 and Brewster windows, the gas filling stations, the high voltage
 power supplies, and even the dielectric mirrors and their adjustable
 mounts. In hindsight, this was excellent training for a budding
 experimentalist. My adviser was a scholar of high intellectual
 standards who made sure that we kept track of every single publication
 in the emerging field of lasers and quantum electronics. In my
 diploma research, I studied saturation effects in the gas laser
 medium by observing the light emitted spontaneously to the side.
 In the end I was able to determine a number of previously unknown
 radiative transition rates in the neon atom.</p>
    
 <p>After receiving my physics diploma degree in 1966, I continued
 to study laser saturation phenomena in my thesis research. I had
 become intrigued by the sharp central Lamb dip, a drop in laser
 power, that Ali Javan had first observed when scanning the frequency
 of a single mode gas laser across the Doppler-broadened gain profile.
 The Lamb dip allowed a new kind of nonlinear Doppler-free high
 resolution spectroscopy, albeit limited to the study of laser transitions
 or to the &quot;inverted Lamb dips&quot; produced by molecular
 absorption lines in accidental coincidence.</p>
    
 <p>In my own experiments, I studied the cross saturation of two
 coupled laser transitions in neon that share the same lower level.
 Soon, I observed strange line asymmetries that could not be understood
 within a hole burning model. I tentatively ascribed the observed
 phenomena to Raman-like two photon transitions and the dynamic
 Stark effect. After laboring for considerable time as a theorist
 I was able to explain the observations quantitatively with a semiclassical
 model that relied on the density matrix formalism to account for
 quantum interference effects in coupled three-level systems. This
 work, published in 1970 with Peter Toschek, is still cited frequently
 today, because it laid the groundwork for the understanding of
 phenomena such as lasers without inversion, electromagnetically
 induced transparency, and slow light. In January of 1969, I received
 my doctor degree from the University of Heidelberg (Dr. rer. nat., &quot;summa
 cum laude&quot;), and I continued to work in Heidelberg for another
 year as an assistant of Professor Schmelzer. Aspects of coherence
 and quantum interference have remained a recurring theme in my
 later research, with intuitive insights from classical wave optics
 often guiding my thoughts and ideas.</p>
 
 <p><b>At Stanford University<br>
 </b>In March 1970, I left Germany to join the laboratory
   of Professor
   <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/index.html">Arthur L. Schawlow</a> at
   Stanford University as a NATO postdoctoral fellow. I had first met Art Schawlow,
   co-inventor of the laser, at a summer school at Carberry Tower in Scotland
   in 1969, and I was immediately captivated by his warmth, his keen mind, and
   his contagious sense of humor. Fortunately, Art agreed to take me on
 as a postdoc.</p>

</p>
 <p>On my way to California, I stopped at the east coast to visit
 Ali Javan at MIT and Bill Bennett at Yale University. I also arranged
 a visit to the famous Bell laboratories at Holmdel. There, Charles
 Shank and Herwig Kogelnik showed me a small pulsed dye laser, pumped
 by a nitrogen laser made by AVCO. At a repetition frequency of
 100 Hz, the beam looked almost continuous to the eye, and the color
 could be changed by simply tilting the angle of a diffraction grating.
 This was a far cry from the few pulses per minute that I had obtained
 playing with a simple home-built flashlamp-pumped dye laser at
 Heidelberg, following the discovery of lasing in organic dye solutions
 by Peter Sorokin and Fritz Sch&auml;fer in 1966.</p>
    
 <p>When I arrived at Stanford, I told Art Schawlow about the interesting
 experiments at Bell Laboratories, and I proposed that I would like
 to try and make a nitrogen laser pumped dye laser so highly monochromatic
 that it could be used for Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy
 of gaseous absorption lines. When Art asked me how I would go about
 it, I explained that I would try holographic diffraction gratings,
 Lyot filters, etalons, or whatever else was necessary to restrict
 laser action to a single longitudinal mode. Art and I had already
 discovered that we shared a strong passion for clever gadgets.
 Art was sufficiently intrigued by my proposal to let me purchase
 an AVCO nitrogen laser, using funds from a post-Sputnik era Army
 contract. The nitrogen laser arrived in July of 1970 and immediately
 proved to be an irresistible toy. During the next six months we
 enjoyed some very entertaining experiments, ranging from edible
 lasers to dye laser image amplifiers.</p>
    
 <p>Soon, I found the intellectual atmosphere at Stanford quite exhilarating.
 I was surrounded by legendary scientists such as <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1952/index.html">Felix
 Bloch</a> or
 <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1961/index.html">Robert Hofstadter</a>, and I could discuss laser science with some
 heroes of my graduate student years, including Tony Siegman, Steve
 Harris, and Robert Byer. At the heart of budding Silicon Valley
, one could sense a &quot;can do&quot; atmosphere that seemed
 immensely liberating. Art kept pointing out that one did not have
 to know everything about a field in order to discover something
 new. If our German approach to research had resembled well-planned
 agriculture, the work at Stanford could be compared to game hunting.
 With my instinctive aversion against organized planning, I enjoyed
 this atmosphere tremendously. At least, we did not have to be afraid
 of research results that made all planning obsolete. We soon found
 ourselves at the heart of a revolution in laser spectroscopy that
 brought plenty of such results.</p>

 <p>Towards the end of 1970, I began to focus my efforts increasingly
 on the goal of making a widely tunable dye laser highly monochromatic.
 Like other experimenters before me, I was working with a rather
 small beam diameter inside the dye laser cavity. Suddenly, I realized
 that the spectral resolving power must be limited if only a small
 number of grating lines is illuminated. I happened to carry a small
 Zeiss monocular telescope in my pocket, which I often used to read
 the small print of slides or transparencies from the back of a
 lecture room. Quickly I mounted this telescope as a beam expander
 inside the cavity to fill the grating area more efficiently, and
 instantly I observed a dramatic improvement in the laser line width.
 With a larger beam expanding telescope and an additional etalon
 inside the cavity, the spectral width of the pulsed dye laser could
 be reduced to an unprecedented 0.0004 nm, and an additional external
 filter etalon soon permitted the first experiments on Doppler-free
 saturation spectroscopy of atomic resonance lines. To this end,
 I devised a scheme for saturation spectroscopy outside the laser
 cavity that was highly immune to the intensity fluctuations of
 our still primitive dye lasers. The technique became later known
 as H&auml;nsch-Bord&eacute; method, since Christian Bord&eacute; in
 Paris had independently pursued similar ideas.</p>
    
 <p>When Art Schawlow saw the first Doppler-free spectra of the sodium
 D lines which I had left on his desk after an exhilarating night,
 he suggested that we should do the same with the red Balmer-alpha
 line of atomic hydrogen. This line had been at the center of attention
 of atomic spectroscopists in the 1930s, because of suspected discrepancies
 from the predictions of the relativistic Dirac theory. With Issah
 S. Shahin, a graduate student from Jordan, we quickly set up an
 old-fashioned Wood-style hydrogen gas discharge tube, and soon
 we were able to resolve single fine structure components of the
 red Balmer line for the first time so that we could observe the
 2S Lamb shift directly in the optical spectrum. A few years later,
 the first laser measurement of the Rydberg constant improved the
 accuracy of this important fundamental constant by an order of
 magnitude. This was the beginning of a long quest for ever higher
 resolution and measurement precision in optical spectroscopy of
 the simple hydrogen atom which permits unique confrontations between
 experiment and fundamental theory. This pursuit has culminated
 in the invention of the femtosecond laser frequency comb, a tool
 that is revolutionizing precision measurements of time and frequency,
 as recounted in my Nobel Lecture.</p>
    
 <p>When word about the new tunable laser and its powers spread,
 an unending series of visitors began to file through our unpretentious
 little laboratory, and an article describing the dye laser soon
 became a &quot;citation classic.&quot; This experience taught
 me that a simple and imperfect proof-of-principle experiment can
 sometimes find a much wider resonance than a complex experiment
 of intimidating perfection. In 1973, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/index.html">Art
 </a>Schawlow and I were named &quot;California
 Scientists of the Year&quot; by the California Museum of Science
 and Industry in Los Angeles for this work. At the same ceremony,
 William Hewlett and David Packard were honored as &quot;California
 Industrialists of the Year&quot;. With such recognition, it became
 easy for me to clinch tenure as Associate Professor at Stanford.
 Soon, I received offers of full professorships from the University
 of Heidelberg, Yale University, and Harvard University. In the
 end, I decided to remain at Stanford, accepting a promotion to
 full professor in 1975, and I continued to work close to Art Schawlow
 for another 11 years before returning to my native Germany in 1986.
 Our early work with hydrogen was prominently cited when Art Schawlow
 received the Nobel Prize for laser spectroscopy in 1981.</p>
    
 <p>Many of my other highly cited papers from the Stanford years
 describe relatively simple experiments such as ultrasensitive fluorescence
 spectroscopy with the power to detect the light from single atoms,
 sensitive intracavity absorption spectroscopy with a multimode
 dye laser, the first demonstration of continuous wave Doppler-fee
 two-photon spectroscopy, and the experiments with my student <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/index.html">Carl
 Wieman</a> on Doppler-free polarization spectroscopy. Even the roots
 of the laser frequency comb can be traced to the exhilarating seventies
 at Stanford. With my student Jim Eckstein and visiting Lindeman
 Fellow Allister Fergusson we used the comb of regularly spaced
 longitudinal modes of a mode-locked sub-picosecond dye laser to
 measure some fine structure intervals of atomic sodium.</p>
    
 <p>Discussing possible ways to increase the interaction time of
 hydrogen atoms with a laser beam, Art Schawlow and I came up with
 the idea of laser cooling of atomic gases in early 1974. Vladilen
 Letokhov in Troisk was one of the first to start experiments with
 one-dimensional radiation pressure cooling of a sodium atomic beam.
 It took ten more years until <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/index.html">Steve
 Chu</a> and his team at Bell Laboratories
 realized &quot;optical molasses&quot;, demonstrating 3-dimen-sional
 Doppler cooling as envisioned in our original proposal. Considering
 the dramatic subsequent developments, Art and I have often regretted
 that we did not immediately follow up our proposal with our own
 experiments. However, we did not know how to laser cool hydrogen
 atoms, and there were many other interesting things to do that
 seemed much easier. Art still remembered some unhappy experiences
 with atomic beam machines during his thesis research at the University
 of Toronto and advised against any experiments involving serious
 vacuum. In 1978, my former thesis adviser Peter Toschek and his
 group were the first to demonstrate the related method of laser
 cooling of trapped ions that had been proposed in 1975 by <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/index.html">Hans
 Dehmelt</a> and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/">David Wineland</a>.</p>
    
 <p>At Stanford in the mid-seventies, one could smell the beginning
 microcomputer revolution, ignited by the early microprocessors
 introduced by the nearby Intel Corporation. After soldering together
 my own IMSAI computer from a kit and advancing from binary programming
 by flipping switches to assembly language, I became an avid visitor
 of the weekly meetings of the Stanford Hombrew Computer Club, where
 Bill Gates sold rolls of punched paper tape with 4k and 8k versions
 of ALTAIR BASIC. Steve Jobs, the later founder of Apple Computer
 came to my undergraduate classes on electricity and magnetism.
 In 1976, Art Schawlow and I bought one of the first Apple I Computers,
 a bare printed circuit board, at the Mountain View Byte Shop. Both
 Art and I succumbed to the microcomputer fever, spending a forbidding
 amount of personal money on a growing collection of computers and
 peripherals, so that our offices started to look like space mission
 control centers. Art sometimes joked about our role as early adopters: &quot;The
 pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their backs.&quot; Around
 1980, Art and I even started a small mail-order software business,
 selling a little graphics program Autoplot written in BASIC for
 the Radio Shack TRS80 computer. Sales were brisk until the hardware
 became obsolete.</p>
    
 <p>My long exposure to the challenging intellectual climate at the
 Stanford Physics Department played an important role in shaping
 my own academic values. I witnessed an Assistant Professor who
 ruined his chance for tenure by writing a book reviewing science
 rather than pursuing original research. I could easily live with
 such priorities because doing research is what I love most. For
 the same reason, I have always resisted trading academic freedom
 for the power that comes with administrative and management responsibilities,
 even though I am grateful to colleagues who shoulder such burdens.</p>
    
 <p><b>At  Munich and Garching<br>
 </b>In 1978, Professor Herbert Walther at the University
   of Munich invited me to spend a sabbatical in Germany with an Alexander von
 Humboldt Senior US Scientist Award. Herbert had played a key role
 in promoting laser science in Germany. Since 1976, he was directing
 a Project Group for Laser Science in Garching that became the Max-Planck
 Institute of Quantum Optics in 1981. A few years later he helped
 to organize a very tempting lure to make me return to my native
 Germany. In March 1986, after agonizing over the decision for
 almost two years, I accepted an offer to join the Ludwig-Maximilians
 University of Munich as a Professor of Experimental Physics and
 to build a new Division of Laser Spectroscopy at the Max-Planck-Institute
 that was just about to move into an attractive new building at
 the southern end of the Garching research campus. The University
 laboratories which I inherited from my predecessor, Professor Josef
 Brandm&uuml;ller, where located downtown, at Schellingstrasse 4,
 in the Max-Vorstadt, surrounded by bookstores and small restaurants.
 Since I felt that the downtown location would make it easier to
 attract graduate students, I decided to set up laboratories at
 both locations.</p>
 <p>With considerably more space, positions for assistants and graduate
 students, and ample start-up funds at my disposal, it was obvious
 that I could pursue many more projects than before, but I could
 no longer maintain my Stanford style of closely working with a
 small group of graduate students, getting intimately involved in
 every detail of one or two hot experiments. At first, this adjustment
 felt rather painful. I had to rely much more on the initiative
 and judgement of my students and postdocs, resigning to the expectation
 that they would make expensive mistakes. Fortunately, I have been
 able to attract some exceptionally gifted young coworkers, sometimes
 with an energy, patience, and discipline that far exceeds my own.
 The best young people blossom if they feel free to follow their
 own ideas. Therefore, I try to guide my students in rather subtle
 ways, letting them arrive at their own insights, goals, and research
 plans during our discussions, while I show enthusiasm and excitement
 when they move in a promising direction. Once the fire is lit it
 tends to become self-sustaining, and I am rather proud that more
 than thirty of my former students and postdocs are now Professors
 at universities around the world, running their own laboratories.
 Since I did not want to give up my own hands-on experimental work,
 I established my own small &quot;toy&quot; laboratory at the
 University, equipped to set up improvised laser and optics experiments
 quickly, to explore crazy new ideas and to stay abreast of ever
 advancing technologies.</p>

    Karl Ludwig Kompa, Herbert Walther, Siegbert Witkowsky and me at the new Max-Planck-Institut of Quantum Optics in Garching in 1986.
  
</p>
 <p>Shortly before moving to Munich in April 1986, I had met <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/index.html">Gerd
 Binnig</a>, the co-inventor of the scanning tunneling microscope, at
 the laboratory of Cal Quate at Stanford. Gerd told me that he was
 planning to move to Munich to set up an IBM physics group as an
 advance guard for an envisioned new IBM research laboratory. Since
 I was intrigued by the possibility of combining tunneling microscopy
 and laser spectroscopy, I offered Gerd to set up shop for a few
 years at our downtown university laboratory. In October of 1986,
 we could help celebrate the Physics Nobel Prize to Gerd Binnig
 and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/index.html">Heinrich Rohrer</a>.
 Even though IBM soon abandoned the plans for a Munich laboratory, Gerd and his
 group stayed with us for the next ten years. During this time we pursued some
 serious research on scanning microscopy ourselves, including studies of biomolecules
 on graphite surfaces with Wolfgang Heckl, and a proof-of-principle
 demonstration of an aperturte-less scanning optical near field
 microscope with Johannes Pedarnig. Unfortunately, the combination
 of tunneling microscopy and laser spectroscopy did not advance
 as easily as hoped. When Gerd Binnig returned to the IBM R&uuml;schlikon
 laboratory in 1996, scanning microscopy had evolved into a large
 worldwide enterprise and we would have had to concentrate considerable
 resources to compete effectively. Instead, we decided to abandon
 our microscopy research.</p>
    
 <p>At that time the quantum physics of ultracold atoms had become
 an important focus of our research. With Andreas Hemmerich we were
 the first to demonstrate and explore two- and three-dimensional
 optical lattices bound by light in the early 1990s. With Tilman
 Esslinger, we explored new tricks for laser cooling below the recoil
 limit. After Immanuel Bloch joined us as a graduate student in
 1997, we realized Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of rubidium
 atoms in a novel magnetic QUIC trap in February of 1998, as only
 the second group outside the USA. We later exploited the high
 magnetic stability of our small trap in the first continuous wave
 atom laser that dominated German science news in 1999.</p>
    
 <p>In the same year, Markus Greiner joined our group as a diploma
 student. He constructed a new BEC apparatus transporting cold atoms
 magnetically from a magneto-optical trap into a high vacuum glass
 cell where BEC can be achieved without the need for any further
 laser cooling. Continuing his work as a Ph.D. student, Markus Greiner
 used the unobscured optical access to load the Bose-Einstein condensate
 into a three-dimensional optical dipole force lattice potential
 formed at the intersection of three orthogonal far-detuned standing
 wave laser fields. In 2001, he and Immanuel Bloch were the first
 to demonstrate a reversible quantum phase transition from a wave-like
 superfluid atomic state to a particle-like Mott insulator crystal,
 by simply adjusting the height of the lattice potential wells,
 as theoretically predicted in 1998 by Dieter Jaksch and Peter Zoller.
 This realization of a strongly correlated quantum gas has triggered
 an avalanche of work at the interface between atomic physics and
 condensed matter physics, with the prospect of quantum simulators
 for elusive phenomena ranging from antiferromagnetism to high Tc
 superconductivity.</p>
    
 <p>Starting around 1994, we have also been exploring microscopic
 magnetic traps for the manipulation of cold paramagnetic atoms.
 Such traps can produce large field gradients and field curvatures
 without the need for strong currents. From the beginning I was
 intrigued by the prospect of tayloring complex magnetic potentials
 with lithographically fabricated circuit patterns, combining traps,
 wave guides, and other atom optical elements to create a quantum
 laboratory on a chip. Discussing such ideas with some of my coworkers
 in a Schwabing restaurant, I sketched a proposal for a conveyor
 belt for cold atoms onto a napkin. Graduate student Wolfgang H&auml;nsel
 soon modeled the magnetic fields on his computer and concluded
 that such a device might work. In 1996, Dr. Jakob Reichel had joined
 our laboratory after receiving his doctorate with Christoph Salomon
 and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/index.html">Claude Cohen-Tannoudji</a> at the ENS in Paris. Together with
 Wolfgang H&auml;nsel, and later joined by Peter Hommelhoff, he
 set out to realize such an atom motor chip. With the mirror-MOT
 we found an effective method for loading cold atoms into microscopic
 traps, and soon we could demonstrate a working conveyer belt for
 atoms. In June 2001, we were the first to achieve Bose-Einstein
 condensation entirely on a microfabricated atom chip. More recently,
 Philip Treutlein has demonstrated long atomic coherence times close
 to the chip surface, raising the prospects for accurate atomic
 clocks and for quantum information processing on a chip.</p>
    
 <p>One fascinating line of research at the MPQ until today has been
 pursuit of precision laser spectroscopy of the simple hydrogen
 atom. Numerous graduate students have advanced the state of the
 art during their thesis research in Garching, starting in the late
 1980s with Reinald Kallenbach, Claus Zimmermann, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler,
 and Martin Weitz. With a beam of cold hydrogen atoms and a highly
 stabilized continuous laser source of 243 nm, we could greatly
 improve the resolution of the sharp 1S-2S two-photon resonance.
 Thanks to the efforts of Thomas Udem we later learned to build
 optical frequency interval dividers which made it possible to measure
 the optical frequency of the ultraviolet 1S-2S resonance against
 the infrared frequency of a transportable methane-stabilized He-Ne
 laser. This intermediate reference was shuttled to the PTB in Braunschweig
 many times for calibration with an elaborate harmonic laser frequency
 chain. These experiments led to a new Rydberg constant, tests of
 QED, such as a precise measurement of the Lamb shift of the 1S
 ground state, and accurate determinations of the rms charge radius
 of the proton and the structure radius of the deuteron. Krzysztof
 Pachucky, Savely Karshenboim and Ulrich Jentschura have provided
 essential theoretical support.</p>
    
 <p>Starting in 1997, our efforts to measure the frequency of laser
 light led to the vastly simplified approach of the femtosecond
 laser frequency comb, as recounted in my Nobel Lecture. In a proof-of-principle
 experiment in the fall of 1998, we used a commercial mode-locked
 femtosecond laser with a comb spanning 70 THz to compare the frequency
 of a blue dye laser directly with the microwave frequency of a
 commercial cesium atomic clock in our own laboratory. In June of
 1999, we reached a precision of 14 decimal digits in a comparison
 of the 1S-2S frequency with the transportable cesium fountain clock
 built at BNM SYRTE in Paris. A second such measurement in February
 2003, took advantage of an even simpler octave spanning laser frequency
 comb synthesizer as first demonstrated in late 1999 in Boulder, 
 CO and at Garching. Frequency comparisons of this kind allow
 sensitive searches for possible slow variations of fundamental
 constants.</p>
    
 <p>Our laboratory has long been a partner of the ATRAP collaboration,
 one of two international teams working at CERN with the goal of
 applying precision laser spectroscopy to anti-hydrogen, searching
 for conceivable differences between matter and antimatter.</p>
    
 <p>Over the years, I have enjoyed the hospitality of many universities
 around the world hosting me as a visiting professor or lecturer.
 I am particularly grateful to Professor Salvatore Califano and
 Massimo Inguscio at the University of Florence, Italy, who gave
 me the opportunity to participate in the creation of the European
 Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy (LENS) and to teach a course
 on laser spectroscopy to Ph.D. students at the University of Florence
 in the enchanting hills of Arcetri. A serendipitous experiment
 with Dr. Marco Bellini at LENS in February of 1997, on the coherence
 of white light continuum pulses produced with an amplified femtosecond
 laser was actually the crucial step that convinced me that an octave-spanning
 optical frequency comb synthesizer could be realized.</p>
    
 <p>During my Stanford years, I had enjoyed the liberating climate
 of entrepreneurship that was omnipresent in the heart of Silicon
 Valley. Fortunately the old aversion between academia and industry
 is now waning in Germany, and in 2001, my former students Ronald
 Holzwarth and Michael Mei have taken the risk of starting a spin-off
 company, Menlo Systems GmbH, to develop commercial frequency comb
 synthesizers. The name has been inspired by Menlo Park in New Jersey
 where Thomas Alva Edison invented the light bulb.</p>
    
 <p>Sometimes people comment on my growing collection of prizes and
 awards, wondering if I am pursuing research in order to win still
 more prizes. The honest answer is that I like prizes to reassure
 our sponsors that their money is being spent well. Prizes are also
 important as recognition and source of pride and motivation for
 our team. However, the most important reward for me has always
 been the joy that comes from new insights, discoveries, and inventions.</p>
