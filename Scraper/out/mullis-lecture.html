  <h2>The Polymerase Chain Reaction</h2>

  <p>In 1944 <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Erwin Schroedinger</a>,
  stimulated intellectually by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">Max Delbr&uuml;ck</a>,
  published a little book called <i>What is Life?</i> It was an
  inspiration to the first of the molecular biologists, and has
  been, along with Delbr&uuml;ck himself, credited for directing
  the research during the next decade that solved the mystery of
  how "like begat like."</p>

  <p>Max was awarded this Prize in 1969, and
  rejoicing in it, he also lamented that the work for which he was
  honored before all the peoples of the world was not something
  which he felt he could share with more than a handful. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1969/index.html">Samuel Beckett</a>'s
  contributions in literature, being honored at the same time,
  seemed to Max somehow universally accessible to anyone. But not
  his. In his lecture here Max imagined his imprisonment in an
  ivory tower of science.</p>

  <p>"The books of the great scientists," he
  said, "are gathering dust on the shelves of learned libraries.
  And rightly so. The scientist addresses an infinitesimal audience
  of fellow composers. His message is not devoid of universality
  but it's universality is disembodied and anonymous. While the
  artist's communication is linked forever with it's original form,
  that of the scientist is modified, amplified, fused with the
  ideas and results of others, and melts into the stream of
  knowledge and ideas which forms our culture. The scientist has in
  common with the artist only this: that he can find no better
  retreat from the world than his work and also no stronger link
  with his world than his work."</p>

  <p>Well, I like to listen to the wisdom of Max
  Delbr&uuml;ck. Like my other historical hero, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Richard Feynman</a>, who
  also passed through here, Max had a way of seeing directly into
  the core of things and clarifying it for the rest of us.</p>

  <p>But I am not convinced with Max that the
  joy of scientific creation must remain completely mysterious and
  unexplainable, locked away from all but a few esoterically
  informed colleagues. I lean toward Feynman in this matter. I
  think Feynman would have said, if you can understand it, you can
  explain it.</p>

  <p>So I'm going to try to explain how it was
  that I invented the polymerase chain reaction. There's a bit of
  it that will not easily translate into normal language. If that
  part weren't of some interest to more than a handful of people
  here, I would just leave it out. What I will do instead is let
  you know when we get to that and also when we are done with it.
  Don't trouble yourself over it. It's esoteric and not crucial. I
  think you can understand what it felt like to invent PCR without
  following the details.</p>

  <p>In 1953, when <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Jim Watson and Francis
  Crick</a> published the structure of DNA, Schroedinger's little
  book and I were eight years old. I was too young to notice that
  mankind had finally understood how it might be that "like begat
  like." The book had been reprinted three times. I was living in
  Columbia S.C., where no one noticed that we didn't have a copy.
  But my home was a few blocks away from an undeveloped wooded area
  with a creek, possums, racoons, poisonous snakes, dragons, and a
  railroad track. We didn't need a copy. It was a wilderness for me
  and my brothers, an unknown and unregimented place to grow up.
  And if we got bored of the earth, we could descend into the
  network of storm drains under the city. We learned our way around
  that dark, subterranean labyrinth. It always frightened us. And
  we always loved it.</p>

  <p>By the time Watson and Crick were being
  honored here in Stockholm in 1962, I had been designing rockets
  with my adolescent companions for three years. For fuel, we
  discovered that a mixture of potassium nitrate and sugar could be
  very carefully melted over a charcoal stove and poured into a
  metal tube in a particular way with remarkable results. The tube
  grew larger with our successive experiments until it was about
  four feet long. My mother grew more cautious and often her head
  would appear out of an upstairs window and she would say things
  that were not encouraging. The sugar was reluctantly furnished
  from her own kitchen, and the potassium nitrate we purchased from
  the local druggist.</p>

  <p>Back then in South Carolina young boys
  seeking chemicals were not immediately suspect. We could even buy
  dynamite fuse from the hardware with no questions asked. This was
  good, because we were spared from early extinction on one
  occasion when our rocket exploded on the launch pad, by the very
  reliable, slowly burning dynamite fuses we could employ, coupled
  with our ability to run like the wind once the fuse had been lit.
  Our fuses were in fact much improved over those which Alfred
  Nobel must have used when he was frightening his own mother. In
  one of our last experiments before we became so interested in the
  maturing young women around us that we would not think deeply
  about rocket fuels for another ten years, we blasted a frog a
  mile into the air and got him back alive. In another, we
  inadvertently frightened an airline pilot, who was preparing to
  land a DC-3 at Columbia airport. Our mistake.</p>

  <p>At Dreher High School, we were allowed
  free, unsupervised access to the chemistry lab. We spent many an
  afternoon there tinkering. No one got hurt and no lawsuits
  resulted. They wouldn't let us in there now. Today, we would be
  thought of as a menace to society. If I'm not mistaken, Alfred
  Nobel for a time was not allowed to practice his black art on
  Swedish soil. Sweden, of course, was then and still is a bit
  ahead of the United States in these matters.</p>

  <p>I never tired of tinkering in labs. During
  the summer breaks from Georgia Tech, Al Montgomery and I built an
  organic synthesis lab in an old chicken house on the edge of town
  where we made research chemicals to sell. Most of them were
  noxious or either explosive. No one else wanted to make them,
  somebody wanted them, and so their production became our domain.
  We suffered no boredom and no boss. We made enough money to buy
  new equipment. Max Gergel, who ran Columbia Organic Chemicals
  Company, and who was an unusually nice man, encouraged us and
  bought most of our products, which he resold. There were no
  government regulators to stifle our fledgling efforts, and it was
  a golden age, but we didn't notice it. We learned a lot of
  organic chemistry.</p>

  <p>By the time I left Georgia Tech for
  graduate school in biochemistry at the University of California
  at Berkeley, the genetic code had been solved. DNA did not yet
  interest me. I was excited by molecules. DNA before PCR was long
  and stringy, not really molecular at all. Six years in the
  biochemistry department didn't change my mind about DNA, but six
  years of Berkeley changed my mind about almost everything
  else.</p>

  <p>I was in the laboratory of Joe Neilands who
  provided his graduate students with a place to work and very few
  rules. I'm not even sure that Joe knew any rules except the high
  moral ground of social responsibility and tolerance. Not knowing
  that the department did have rules, I took astrophysics courses
  instead of molecular biology, which I figured I could learn from
  my molecular biologist friends. I published my first scientific
  paper in <i>Nature</i>, in 1968. It was a sophomoric
  astrophysical hypothesis called "The Cosmological Significance of
  Time Reversal." I think <i>Nature</i> is still embarrassed about
  publishing it, but it was immensely useful to me when it came
  time for my qualifying examination. The committee would decide
  whether or not I would be allowed to take a Ph. D, without having
  taken molecular biology. And my paper in <i>Nature</i>, helped
  them to justify a "yes." In retrospect, the membership of that
  committee is intriguing.</p>

  <p>Don Glaser, who received this Prize in
  physics in 1960 at age 34, would later be one of the founders of
  Cetus Corporation, where I was working when I invented PCR. Henry
  Rapaport, who discovered psoralens would be the scientific
  advisor to my department at Cetus, and would co-author two
  patents with me. Alan Wilson, now sadly passed away, would be the
  first researcher outside of Cetus to employ PCR. And Dan Koshland
  would be the editor of Science when my first PCR paper was
  rejected from that journal and also the editor when PCR was three
  years later proclaimed Molecule of the Year. I passed. None of
  us, I think, as we walked out of that room, had any conscious
  inkling of the way things would turn out among us.</p>

  <p>In Berkeley it was a time of social
  upheaval and Joe Neilands was the perfect mentor to see his
  people through it with grace. We laughed a lot over tea at four
  every afternoon around a teakwood table that Joe had brought from
  home and oiled once a month. Our lab had an ambience that was
  special. I decided to become a neurochemist. Joe was the master
  of microbial iron transport molecules. It wasn't done like that
  in most labs, where the head of the lab would prefer that you
  help advance his career by elaborating on some of his work. Not
  so with Neilands. As long as I wrote a thesis and got a degree,
  he didn't care what else I did, and I stayed in his lab happily,
  following my own curiosity even if it carried me into music
  courses, for as long as Joe thought we could get away with it.
  The department was paying me a monthly stipend from the NIH, and
  eventually, Joe knew, I would have to leave.</p>

  <p>After six years I headed east with a Ph. D.
  and confidence in my education. My wife of a few months went to
  Kansas to go to medical school and I followed her there. That was
  1972.</p>

  <p>I had made no professional plans that would
  work in Kansas, so I decided to become a writer. I discovered
  pretty quickly that I was far too young. I didn't know anything
  yet about tragedy, and my characters were flat. I didn't know how
  to describe a mean spririt in terms someone else could
  believe.</p>

  <p>So I had to get a job as a scientist. I
  found one at the medical school working with two pediatric
  cardiologists and a pathologist. It was a very fortunate
  accident. For one thing pediatricians are always the nicest
  doctors, and for another thing these doctors were very special:
  Leone Mattioli, whose wife could cook, Agostino Molteni and
  Richard Zakheim. For two years I did medical research, learned
  how to appreciate Old World values from two Italians and a New
  York Jew, and learned human biology for the first time.</p>

  <p>Marriage over, I returned to Berkeley,
  working for a time in a restaurant and then at the University of
  California at San Francisco killing rats for their brains. I saw
  Max Delbr&uuml;ck talk, but I don't think I understood the
  significance of who he was, nor was I influenced to go into
  molecular biology by him. I was working on the enkephalins.</p>

  <p>But then there was a seminar describing the
  synthesis and cloning of a gene for somatostatin. That impressed
  me. For the first time I realized that significant pieces of DNA
  could be synthesized chemically and that they were likely to be
  very exciting. I started studying DNA synthesis in the library.
  And I started looking for a job making DNA molecules.</p>

  <p>Cetus hired me in the fall of 1979. I
  worked long hours and enjoyed it immensely. DNA synthesis was
  much more fun than killing rats, and the San Francisco Bay Area
  was a good place to be doing it. There were a number of
  biotechnology companies and several academic groups working on
  improving the synthesis methods for DNA. Within two years, there
  was a machine in my lab from Biosearch of San Rafael, California,
  turning out oligonucleotides much faster than the molecular
  biologists at Cetus could use them. I started playing with the
  oligonucleotides to find out what they could do.</p>

  <p>The lab next door to me was run by Henry
  Erlich and was working on methods for detecting point mutations.
  We had made a number of oligonucleotides for them. I started
  thinking about their problem and proposed an idea of my own which
  they ended up calling oligomer restriction. It worked as long as
  the target sequence was fairly concentrated, like a site on a
  purified plasmid, but it didn't work if the site was relatively
  rare, like a single copy gene in human DNA.</p>

  <p>I apologize to those of you who just got
  lost, but I do have to say a few things now that are going to be
  difficult. I will get back to the story in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>The oligomer restriction method also relied
  on the fact that the target of interest contained a restriction
  site polymorphism, which kept it from being universally
  applicable to just any point mutation. I started thinking about
  doing some experiments wherein an oligonucleotide hybridized to a
  specific site could be extended by DNA polymerase in the presence
  of only dideoxynucleoside triphosphates. I reasoned that if one
  of the dideoxynucleoside triphosphates in each of four aliquots
  of a reaction was radioactive then a analysis of the aliquots on
  a gel could indicate which of the dideozynucleoside triphosphates
  had added to the hybridized oligonucleotide and therefore which
  base was adjacent to the three prime end of the oligonucleotide.
  It would be like doing Sanger sequencing at a single base
  pair.</p>

  <p>On human DNA, it would not have worked
  because the oligonucleotide would not have specifically bound to
  a single site. On a DNA as complex as human DNA it would have
  bound to hundreds or thousands of sites depending on the sequence
  involved and the conditions used. What I needed to make this work
  was some method of raising the relative concentration of the
  specific site of interest. What I needed was PCR, but I had not
  considered that possibility. I knew the difference numerically
  between five thousand base pairs as in a plasmid and three
  billion base pairs as in the human genome, but somehow it didn't
  strike me as sharply as it should have. My ignorance served me
  well. I kept on thinking about my experiment without realizing
  that it would never work. And it turned into PCR.</p>

  <p>One Friday night I was driving, as was my
  custom, from Berkeley up to Mendocino where I had a cabin far
  away from everything off in the woods. My girlfriend, Jennifer
  Barnett, was asleep. I was thinking. Since oligonucleotides were
  not that hard to make anymore, wouldn't it be simple enough to
  put two of them into the reaction instead of only one such that
  one of them would bind to the upper strand and the other to the
  lower strand with their three prime ends adjacent to the opposing
  bases of the base pair in question. If one were made longer than
  the other then their single base extension products could be
  separated on a gel from each other and one could act as a control
  for the other. I was going to have to separate them on a gel
  anyway from the large excess of radioactive
  nucleosidetriphosphate. What I would hope to see is that one of
  them would pick up one radioactive nucleotide and the other would
  pick up its complement. Other combinations would indicate that
  something had gone wrong. It was not a perfect control, but it
  would not require a lot of effort. It was about to lead me to
  PCR.</p>

  <p>I liked the idea of a control that was
  nearly free in terms of cost and effort. And also, it would help
  use up the oligonucleotides that my lab could now make faster
  than they could be used.</p>

  <p>As I drove through the mountains that
  night, the stalks of the California buckeyes heavily in blossom
  leaned over into the road. The air was moist and cool and filled
  with their heady aroma.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by my progress on the thought
  experiment I continued to think about it and about things that
  could possibly go wrong. What if there were deoxynucleoside
  triphosphates in the DNA sample, for instance? What would happen?
  What would happen, I reasoned, is that one or more of them would
  be added to the oligonucleotide by the polymerase prior to the
  termination of chain elongation by addition of the
  dideoxynucleoside triphosphate, and it could easily be the wrong
  dideoxynucleoside triphosphate and it surely would result in an
  extension product that would be the wrong size, and the results
  would be spurious. It would not do. I needed a way to insure that
  the sample was free from contamination from deoxynucleoside
  triphosphates. I could treat the sample before the extension
  reaction with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme would
  degrade any triphosphates present down to nucleosides which would
  not interfere with the main reaction, but then I would need to
  "deactivate the phosphatase before adding the dideoxynucleoside
  triphosphates and everyone knew at that time that BAP, as we
  called it, was not irreversibly denaturable by heat. The reason
  we knew this was that the renaturation of heat denatured BAP had
  been demonstrated in classic experiments that had shown that a
  protein's shape was dictated by it's sequence. In the classical
  experiments the renaturation had been performed in a buffer
  containing lots of zinc. What had not occurred to me or
  apparently many others was that BAP could be irreversibly
  denatured if zinc was omitted from the buffer, and that zinc was
  not necessary in the buffer if the enzyme was only going to be
  used for a short time and had its own tightly bound zinc to begin
  with. There was a product on the market at the time called matBAP
  wherein the enzyme was attached to an insoluble matrix which
  could be filtered out of a solution after it had been used. The
  product sold because people were of the impression that you could
  not irreversibly denature BAP. We'd all heard about, but not
  read, the classic papers.</p>

  <p>This says something about the arbitrary way
  that many scientific facts get established, but for this story,
  it's only importance is that, had I known then that BAP could be
  heat denatured irreversibly, I may have missed PCR. As it was, I
  decided against using BAP, and tried to think of another way to
  get rid of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. How about this, I
  thought? What if I leave out the radioactive dideoxynucleoside
  triphosphates, mix the DNA sample with the oligonucleotides, drop
  in the polymerase and wait? The polymerase should use up all the
  deoxynucleoside triphosphates by adding them to the hybridized
  oligonucleotides. After this was complete I could heat the
  mixture, causing the extended oligonucleotides to be removed from
  the target, then cool the mixture allowing new, unextended
  oligonucleotides to hybridize. The extended oligonucleotides
  would be far outnum- bered by the vast excess of unextended
  oligonucleotides and therefore would not rehybridize to the
  target to any great extent. Then I would add the
  dideoxynucleoside triphosphate mixtures, and another aliquot of
  polymerase. And now things would work.</p>

  <p>But what if the oligonucleotides in the
  original extension reaction had been extended so far they could
  now hybridize to unextended oligonucleotides of the opposite
  polarity in this second round. The sequence which they had been
  extended into would permit that. What would happen?</p>

  <p>EUREKA!!!! The result would be exactly the
  same only the signal strength would be doubled.</p>

  <p>EUREKA again!!!! I could do it
  intentionally, adding my own deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which
  were quite soluble in water and legal in California.</p>

  <p>And again, EUREKA!!!! I could do it over
  and over again. Every time I did it I would double the signal.
  For those of you who got lost, we're back! I stopped the car at
  mile marker 46,7 on Highway 128. In the glove compartment I found
  some paper and a pen. I confirmed that two to the tenth power was
  about a thousand and that two to the twentieth power was about a
  million, and that two to the thirtieth power was around a
  billion, close to the number of base pairs in the human genome.
  Once I had cycled this reaction thirty times I would be able to
  the sequence of a sample with an immense signal and almost no
  background.</p>

  <p>Jennifer wanted to get moving. I drove on
  down the road. In about a mile it occurred to me that the
  oligonucleotides could be placed at some arbitrary distance from
  each other, not just flanking a base pair and that I could make
  an arbitrarily large number of copies of any sequence I chose and
  what's more, most of the copies after a few cycles would be the
  same size. That size would be up to me. They would look like
  restriction fragments on a gel. I stopped the car again.</p>

  <p>"Dear Thor!," I exclaimed. I had solved the
  most annoying problems in DNA chemistry in a single lightening
  bolt. Abundance and distinction. With two oligonucleotides, DNA
  polymerase, and the four nucleosidetriphosphates I could make as
  much of a DNA sequence as I wanted and I could make it on a
  fragment of a specific size that I could distinguish easily.
  Somehow, I thought, it had to be an illusion. Otherwise it would
  change DNA chemistry forever. Otherwise it would make me famous.
  It was too easy. Someone else would have done it and I would
  surely have heard of it. We would be doing it all the time. What
  was I failing to see? "Jennifer, wake up. I've thought of
  something incredible."</p>

  <p>She wouldn't wake up. I had thought of
  incredible things before that somehow lost some of their sheen in
  the light of day. This one could wait till morning. But I didn't
  sleep that night. We got to my cabin and I starting drawing
  little diagrams on every horizontal surface that would take pen,
  pencil or crayon until dawn, when with the aid of a last bottle
  of good Mendocino county cabernet, I settled into a perplexed
  semiconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Afternoon came, including new bottles of
  celebratory red fluids from Jack's Valley Store, but I was still
  puzzled, alternating between being absolutely pleased with my
  good luck and clever brain, and being mildly annoyed at myself
  and Jennifer Barnett, for not seeing the flaw that must have been
  there. I had no phone at the cabin and there were no other
  biochemists besides Jennifer and me in Anderson Valley. The
  conundrum which lingered throughout the week-end and created an
  unprecedented desire in me to return to work early was
  compelling. If the cyclic reactions which by now were symbolized
  in various ways all over the cabin really worked, why had I never
  heard of them being used? If they had been used, I surely would
  have heard about it and so would everybody else including
  Jennifer, who was presently sunning herself by the pond taking no
  interest in the explosions that were rocking my brain.</p>

  <p>Why wouldn't these reactions work?</p>

  <p>Monday morning I was in the library. The
  moment of truth. By afternoon it was clear. For whatever reasons,
  there was nothing in the abstracted literature about succeeding
  or failing to amplify DNA by the repeated reciprocal extension of
  two primers hybridized to the separate strands of a particular
  DNA sequence. By the end of the week I had talked to enough
  molecular biologists to know that I wasn't missing anything
  really obvious. No one could recall such a process ever being
  tried.</p>

  <p>However, shocking to me, not one of my
  friends or colleagues would get excited over the potential for
  such a process. True. I was always having wild ideas, and this
  one maybe looked no different than last week's. But it WAS
  different. There was not a single unknown in the scheme. Every
  step involved had been done already. Everyone agreed that you
  could extend a primer on a DNA template, everyone knew you could
  melt double stranded DNA. Everyone agreed that what you could do
  once, you could do again. Most people didn't like to do things
  over and over, me in particular. If I had to do a calculation
  twice, I preferred to write a program instead. But no one thought
  it was impossible. It could be done, and there was always
  automation. The result on paper was so obviously fantastic, that
  even I had little irrational lapses of faith that it would really
  work in a tube, and most everyone who could take a moment to talk
  about it with me, felt compelled to come up with some reason why
  it wouldn't work. It was not easy in that post-cloning, pre-PCR
  year to accept the fact that you could have all the DNA you
  wanted. And that it would be easy.</p>

  <p>I had a directory full of untested ideas in
  the computer. I opened a new file and named this one polymerase
  chain reaction. I didn't immediately try an experiment, but all
  summer I kept talking to people in and out of the company. I
  described the concept around August at an in-house seminar. Every
  Cetus scientist had to give a talk twice a year. But no one had
  to listen. Most of the talks were dry descriptions of labor
  performed and most of the scientists left early without
  comment.</p>

  <p>One or two technicians were interested, and
  on the days when she still loved me, Jennifer, thought it might
  work. On the increasingly numerous days when she hated me, my
  ideas and I suffered her scorn together.</p>

  <p>I continued to talk about it, and by late
  summer had a plan to amplify a 400-bp fragment from Human Nerve
  Growth Factor, which Genentech had cloned and published in
  <i>Nature</i>. I would start from whole human placental DNA from
  Sigma. taking a chance that the cDNA sequence had derived from a
  single exon. No need for a cDNA library. No colonies, no nothing.
  It would be dramatic. I would shoot for the moon. Primers were
  easy to come by in my lab, which made oligonucleotides for the
  whole company. I entered the sequences I wanted into the computer
  and moved them to the front of the waiting list.</p>

  <p>My friend Ron Cook, who had founded
  Biosearch, and produced the first successful commercial DNA
  synthesis machine, was the only person I remember during that
  summer who shared my enthusiasm for the reaction. He knew it
  would be good for the oligonucleotide business. Maybe that's why
  he believed it. Or maybe he's a rational chemist with an intact
  brain. He's one of my best friends now, so I have to disqualify
  myself from claiming any really objective judgement regarding
  him. Perhaps I should have followed his advice, but then things
  would have worked out differently and I probably wouldn't be here
  on the beach in La Jolla writing this, which I enjoy. Maybe I
  would be rich in Tahiti. He suggested one night at his house that
  since no one at Cetus had taken it seriously, I should resign my
  job, wait a little while, make it work, write a patent, and get
  rich. By rich he wasn't imagining $300000000. Maybe one or two.
  The famous chemist Albert Hofmann was at Ron's that night. He had
  invented LSD in 1943. At the time he didn't realize what he had
  done. It only dawned on him slowly, and then things worked their
  way out over the years like no one would have ever predicted, or
  could have controlled by forethought and reason.</p>

  <p>I responded weakly to Ron's suggestion. I
  had already described the idea at Cetus, and if it turned out to
  be commercially successful they would have lawyers after me
  forever. Ron was not sure that Cetus had rights on my ideas
  unless they were directly related to my duties. I wasn't sure
  about the law, but I was pretty happy working at Cetus and
  assumed innocently that if the reaction worked big time I would
  be amply rewarded by my employer.</p>

  <p>The subject of PCR was not yet party
  conversation, even among biochemists, and it quickly dropped.
  Albert being there was much more interesting, even to me. He had
  given a fine talk that afternoon at Biosearch.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, my problems with Jennifer were not
  getting any better. That night was no exception to the trend. I
  drove home alone feeling sad and unsettled, not in the mood for
  leaving my job, or any big change in what was left of stability
  in my life. PCR seemed distant and very small compared to our
  very empty house.</p>

  <p>In September I did my first experiment. I
  like to try the easiest possibilities first. So one night I put
  human DNA and the nerve growth factor primers in a little
  screw-cap tube with an O-ring and a purple top. I boiled for a
  few minutes, cooled, added about 10 units of DNA polymerase,
  closed the tube and left it at 37&deg;. It was exactly midnight
  on the ninth of September. I poured a cold Becks into a 400-ml
  beaker and contemplated my notebook for a few minutes before
  leaving the lab.</p>

  <p>Driving home I figured that the primers
  would be extended right away, and I hoped that at some finite
  rate the extension products would come unwound from their
  templates, be primed and re-copied, and so forth. I did not
  relish the idea of heating, cooling, adding polymerase over and
  over again, and held this for a last resort method of
  accomplishing the chain reaction. I was thinking of DNA:DNA
  interactions as being reversible with all the ramifications
  thereof. I wasn't concerned about the absolute rate of
  dissociation, because I didn't care how long the reaction took as
  long as nobody had to do anything. I assumed there would always
  be some finite concentration of single strands, which would be
  available for priming by a relatively high concentration of
  primer with pseudo-first order kinetics.</p>

  <p>For a reaction with the potential which I
  dreamed of for this one, especially in light of the absence of
  anything else that could do the same thing, time was only a very
  secondary consideration. Would it work at all was important. The
  next most important thing was, would it be easy to do? Then came
  time.</p>

  <p>At noon the next day I went to the lab to
  take a 12-hour sample. There was no sign by ethidium bromide of
  any 400-bp bands. I could have waited another hundred years as I
  had no idea what the absolute rates might be. But I succumbed
  slowly to the notion that I couldn't escape much longer the
  unpleasant prospect of cycling the reaction between single
  stranded temperatures and double stranded temperatures. This also
  meant adding the thermally unstable polymerase after every

  <p>For three months I did sporadic experiments
  while my life at home and in the lab with Jennifer was crumbling.
  It was slow going. Finally, I retreated from the idea of starting
  with human DNA, I wasn't even absolutely sure that the Genentech
  sequence from <i>Nature</i> that I was using was from a single
  exon. I settled on a target of more modest proportions, a short
  fragment from pBR322, a purified plasmid. The first successful
  experiment happened on December 16th. I remember the date. It was
  the birthday of Cynthia, my former wife from Kansas City, who had
  encouraged me to write fiction and bore us two fine sons. I had
  strayed from Cynthia eventually to spend two tumultuous years
  with Jennifer. When I was sad for any other reason, I would also
  grieve for Cynthia. There is a general place in your brain, I
  think, reserved for "melancholy of relationships past." It grows
  and prospers as life progresses, forcing you finally, against
  your grain, to listen to country music.</p>

  <p>And now as December threatened Christmas,
  Jennifer, that crazy, wonderful woman chemist, had dramatically
  left our house, the lab, headed to New York and her mother, for
  reasons that seemed to have everything to do with me but which I
  couldn't fathom. I was beginning to learn tragedy. It differs a
  great deal from pathos, which you can learn from books. Tragedy
  is personal. It would add strength to my character and depth
  someday to my writing. Just right then, I would have preferred a
  warm friend to cook with. Hold the tragedy lessons. December is a
  rotten month to be studying your love life from a distance.</p>

  <p>I celebrated my victory with Fred Faloona,
  a young mathematician and a wizard of many talents whom I had
  hired as a technician. Fred had helped me that afternoon set up
  this first successful PCR reaction, and I stopped by his house on
  the way home. As he had learned all the biochemistry he knew
  directly from me he wasn't certain whether or not to believe me
  when I informed him that we had just changed the rules in
  molecular biology. "Okay, Doc, if you say so." He knew I was more
  concerned with my life than with those cute little purple-topped
  tubes.</p>

  <p>In Berkeley it drizzles in the winter.
  Avocados ripen at odd times and the tree in Fred's front yard was
  wet and sagging from a load of fruit. I was sagging as I walked
  out to my little silver Honda Civic, which never failed to start.
  Neither Fred, empty Becks bottles, nor the sweet smell of the
  dawn of the age of PCR could replace Jenny. I was lonesome.</p>
