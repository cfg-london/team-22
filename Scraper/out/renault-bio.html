  <h1>Louis Renault - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="renault.jpg" class="bio-img">Although his
  active participation in efforts to solve the problems of
  international law brought him honor and respect from around the
  world, <b>Louis Renault</b> (May 21, 1843-February 8, 1918) was,
  in his own words<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, &laquo;a
  professor at heart&raquo;. Born at Autun in the
  Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire district of France, he received his love of
  learning as a heritage from his Burgundian father, a bookseller
  by vocation and bibliophile by avocation. Intellectually gifted,
  Renault was first in his class at the Coll&egrave;ge d'Autun,
  taking prizes in philosophy, mathematics, and literature before
  going on to the University of Dijon for his bachelor's degree in
  literature. For seven years, from 1861 to 1868, he studied law in
  Paris, receiving three degrees, the highest of them the doctoral
  and all of them with extraordinary honors.<br>
  <br>
  In 1868 he began the career in the academic world which he never
  deserted. Twenty-five years old in 1868, he returned to Dijon as
  lecturer in Roman and then in commercial law. He joined the
  Faculty of Law of the University of Paris as an acting professor
  of criminal law in 1873, but he found his true field the next
  year when the opportunity arose to fill a temporary vacancy in
  international law. Although at first loath to change his primary
  field of interest, he continued in the new milieu and so
  distinguished himself in the next seven years by his teaching and
  by his publication of some fifty notes and articles and a book,
  <i>Introduction &agrave; l'&eacute;tude du droit international</i>,
  that he was offered the chair of international law in 1881.<br>
  <br>
  Renault's scholarly output during his lifetime was extensive,
  making him the outstanding French authority on international law.
  He delivered countless lectures, wrote dozens of reports,
  published upwards of 200 notes and articles, most of them in law
  reviews and political science journals, and produced several
  books, of which the most important, in collaboration with his
  colleague, Charles Lyon-Caen, is the nine-volume <i>Trait&eacute;
  de droit commercial</i> (1889-1899). Devoted to teaching as well
  as to research, he lectured for some years, concurrently with his
  appointment at the University of Paris, at the School of
  Political Sciences and at two of the military schools; he
  directed 252 doctoral theses<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; he
  taught many students who later held important diplomatic posts in
  France and abroad.<br>
  <br>
  Prior to 1890, Renault had participated in the solving of
  practical problems of international law, notably those of
  proprietary rights in literature and art and of the regulations
  governing submarine cables, but in the following years, having
  been appointed a legal consultant to the Foreign Office by
  Minister Alexandre Ribot, he became the &laquo;one authority in
  international law upon whom the Republic relied&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For the next twenty years he was a
  French representative at innumerable international conferences
  held in Europe, figuring prominently in conferences on
  international private law, international transport, military
  aviation, naval affairs, circulation of obscene literature,
  abolition of white slavery, commercial paper used in
  international transactions, revision of the Red Cross Convention
  of 1864. In recognition of this and other services, Renault was
  accorded the titular rank of Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy
  Extraordinary in 1903.<br>
  <br>
  When the Hague Tribunal was opened to conduct cases of
  international arbitration, Renault was named one of its panel of
  twenty-eight arbiters. Voluntarily selected more times than any
  other member of the panel in the first fourteen years of the
  tribunal's existence, Renault was involved in six of the court's
  thirteen cases: the Japanese House Tax case between Japan on the
  one hand and Germany, France, and Great Britain on the other
  (1905); the Casablanca case between Germany and France (1909);
  the Savarkar case between France and Great Britain (1911); the
  Canevaro case between Italy and Peru (1912); the Carthage case
  between France and Italy (1913); and the Manouba case between
  France and Italy (1913).<br>
  <br>
  At the first Hague Peace Conference of 1899, Renault was the
  reporter for the Second Commission, which was concerned with
  various questions governing naval warfare, and the principal
  drafter of the Final Act - the &laquo;summary&raquo; - of the
  Conference. A dominant figure at the second Hague Peace
  Conference in 1907, he was the reporter for the Conventions
  relating to the opening of hostilities, to the application of the
  Geneva Convention to naval warfare, to the creation of an
  international prize court, and to the defining of the rights and
  duties of neutral nations in naval war, as well as being on the
  drafting committee for the Final Act, which he presented.<br>
  <br>
  The recipient of many honors for his accomplishments as teacher,
  scholar, judge, and diplomat, Renault was named to the Legion of
  Honor and to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in
  France, awarded decorations by nineteen foreign nations and
  honorary doctorates by several universities, and chosen to be
  president of the Academy of International Law created at The
  Hague in 1914.<br>
  <br>
  Renault never retired. After teaching his last class on February
  6, 1918, he went to his villa in Barbizon for a brief holiday,
  was taken ill, and died on the morning of February 8.</p>
