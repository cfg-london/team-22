  <h2>Diabetes and Insulin</h2>

  <p>Gentlemen. I very deeply appreciate the
  honour which you have conferred upon me in awarding the Nobel
  Prize for 1923 to me and Professor J.J.R. Macleod. I am fully
  aware of the responsibility which rests upon me to deliver an
  address in which certain aspects of the work on insulin may be
  placed before you. This I propose to do today and I regret that
  an earlier opportunity has not been afforded me of satisfying
  this obligation.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Diabetes and insulin</h4>

  <p>Since von Mering and Minkowski proved that
  removal of the pancreas produced severe and fatal diabetes in
  dogs, physiologists and clinicians have frequently endeavored to
  obtain from the pancreas an internal secretion which would be of
  value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Beginning with
  Minkowski himself, many observers tried various forms of extracts
  of the pancreas. Among the extractives used were water, saline,
  alcohol, and glycerin. The extracts thus obtained were
  administered by mouth, subcutaneously, intravenously, or by
  rectum, both to experimental animals and humans suffering from
  diabetes. Little or no improvement was obtained and any favorable
  results were overshadowed by their toxic effects. In 1908,
  Zuelzer tried alcoholic extracts on six cases of diabetes
  mellitus and obtained favorable results, one case of severe
  diabetes becoming sugar-free. His extracts were then tried by
  Forschbach in Minkowski's clinic with less favorable results, and
  the investigation was abandoned by this group of workers. Rennie
  found that the islet cells existed separate from the acinar cells
  in certain boney fishes and in conjunction with Fraser, extracts
  of the principal islet cells were tried both on animals and on
  the human. Their results, however, were not sufficiently
  convincing to warrant clinical application. The problem of the
  extraction of the antidiabetic principle from the pancreas was
  then taken up for the most part by physiologists among whom were
  Scott, Paulesco, Kleiner, and Murlin.</p>

  <p>While these efforts were being made by the
  physiologists, valuable knowledge was being gained on
  carbohydrate metabolism. Lewis and Benedict, Folin and Wu,
  Schaffer and Hartman, and Ivar Bang had elaborated methods
  whereby the percentage of sugar in a small sample of blood might
  be accurately estimated. At the same time a vast amount of
  knowledge was accumulating on basal metabolism. Special attention
  was being given to the relative importance of the various
  foodstuffs, and emphasis was being put on dietetic treatment of
  diabetes. Guelpa, von Noorden, Allen, Joslin, and Woodyatt, had
  elaborated systems of diabetic diet.</p>

  <p>On October 30th, 1920, I was attracted by
  an article by Moses Baron, in which he pointed out the similarity
  between the degenerative changes in the acinus cells of the
  pancreas following experimental ligation of the duct, and the
  changes following blockage of the duct with gallstones. Having
  read this article, the idea presented itself that by ligating the
  duct and allowing time for the degeneration of the acinus cells,
  a means might be provided for obtaining an extract of the islet
  cells free from the destroying influence of trypsin and other
  pancreatic enzymes.</p>

  <p>On April 14th, 1921, I began working on
  this idea in the Physiological Laboratory of the University of
  Toronto. Professor Macleod allotted me Dr. Charles Best as an
  associate. Our first step was to tie the pancreatic ducts in a
  number of dogs. At the end of seven weeks these dogs were
  chloroformed. The pancreas of each dog was removed and all were
  found to be shrivelled, fibrotic, and about one-third the
  original size. Histological examination showed that there were no
  healthy acinus cells. This material was cut into small pieces,
  ground with sand, and extracted with normal saline. This extract
  was tested on a dog rendered diabetic by the removal of the
  pancreas. Following the intravenous injection, the blood sugar of
  the depancreatized dogs was reduced to a normal or subnormal
  level, and the urine became sugar-free. There was a marked
  improvement in the general clinical condition as evidenced by the
  fact that the animals became stronger and more lively, the
  broken-down wounds healed more kindly, and the life of the animal
  was undoubtedly prolonged.</p>

  <p>The beneficial results obtained from this
  first type of extract substantiated the view that trypsin
  destroyed the antidiabetic principle and suggested the idea that
  by getting rid of the trypsin, an active extract might be
  obtained. The second type of extract was made from the pancreas
  of dogs in which acinus cells had been exhausted of trypsin by
  the long-continued injection of secretin. Although many of the
  extracts made in this manner produced marked lowering of blood
  sugar and improvement in the general clinical condition it was
  not always possible to completely exhaust the gland; consequently
  toxic effects frequently resulted.</p>

  <p>The third type of extract used in this
  series of experiments was made from the pancreas of foetal calves
  of less than four months development. Laguesse had found that the
  pancreas of new-born contained comparatively more islet cells
  than the pancreas of the adult. Since other glands of internal
  secretion are known to contain their active principle as soon as
  they are differentiated in their embryological development, it
  occurred to me that trypsin might not be present since it is not
  used till after the birth of the animal. Later I found that
  Ibrahim had shown that trypsin is not present till seven or eight
  months of intrauterine development. Foetal extracts could be
  prepared in a much more concentrated solution than the former two
  varieties of extract. It produced marked lowering of blood sugar,
  urine became sugar free and there was marked clinical
  improvement. Its greatest value however was that the abundance in
  which it could be obtained enabled us to investigate its chemical
  extraction.</p>

  <p>Up to this time saline had been used as an
  extractive. We now found that alcohol slightly acidified
  extracted the active principle, and by applying this method of
  extraction to the whole adult beef pancreas, active extracts
  comparatively free from toxic properties were obtained.</p>

  <p>Since all large-scale production methods
  for the preparation of insulin today have the acid-alcohol
  extraction as the first step in the process, it may be well to
  elaborate on the methods of preparation at this stage. Insulin
  was prepared by the extraction of fresh glands with faintly acid
  alcohol. The concentration of alcohol in the original experiments
  varied from 40 to 60 per cent. The alcoholic solution of pancreas
  was filtered and the filtrate concentrated by evaporation of the
  alcohol and water <i>in vacuo</i> or in a warm air current.
  Lipoid material was removed by extracting the residue with
  toluene or ether. The resulting product was the original whole
  gland extract. We were able to show that the active material
  contained in this extract was practically insoluble in 95%
  alcohol.</p>

  <p>The extracts prepared in this way were
  tried on depancreatized dogs and in all cases the blood sugar was
  lowered. In one early case hypoglycaemic level was reached and
  the dog died from what we now know to be a hypo-glycaemic
  reaction.</p>

  <p>It had been known that depancreatized dogs
  were unable to store glycogen in the liver, and that glycogen
  disappears in three or four days after pancreatectomy. We found
  that by the administration of glucose and extract, the diabetic
  dog was enabled to store as much as 8% to 12% glycogen. Diabetic
  dogs seldom live more than 12 to 14 days. But with the daily
  administration of this whole gland extract we were able to keep a
  depancreatized dog alive and healthy for ten weeks. At the end of
  this time the dog was chloroformed and a careful autopsy failed
  to reveal any islet tissue.</p>

  <p>The extract at this time was sufficiently
  purified to be tested on three cases of diabetes mellitus in the
  wards of the Toronto General Hospital. There was a marked
  reduction in blood sugar and the urine was rendered sugar-free.
  However the high protein content rendered the continuous use
  undesirable, due to formation of sterile abscesses.</p>

  <p>At this stage in the investigation,
  February 1922, Professor Macleod abandoned his work on anoxaemia
  and turned his whole laboratory staff on the investigation of the
  physiological properties of what is now known as insulin.</p>

  <p>Dr. Collip took up the biochemical
  purification of the active principle and ran the scale of
  fractional precipitation with 70-95% alcohol and succeeded in
  obtaining a more improved end product. But unfortunately his
  method was not applicable to large-scale production. Dr. Best
  then took up the large-scale production and contributed greatly
  to the establishment of the principles of production and
  purification. This work was carried out in the Connaught
  Laboratories under Prof. Fitzgerald who is kind enough to be here
  today.</p>

  <p>It had been found that the final product
  obtained by the earlier methods was not sufficiently pure for
  prolonged clinical use, and efforts were made to secure a better
  product. The benzoic acid method of Maloney and Findlay which
  depends upon the fact that insulin is absorbed from watery
  solutions by benzoic acid was successfully used in Connaught
  Laboratories for several months.</p>

  <p>Professor Shaffer of Washington University,
  St. Louis, and his collaborators, Somogyi and Doisy, introduced a
  method of purification which is known as the isoelectric process.
  This method depends upon the fact that if a watery solution of
  insulin is adjusted to approximately pH 5 a precipitate settles
  out which contains much of the potent material and relatively few
  impurities. Dudley has found that insulin was precipitated from
  water solutions by picric acid and he made use of this fact to
  devise a very ingenious method for the 'purification of the
  active material.</p>

  <p>Best and Scott who are responsible for the
  preparation of insulin in the Insulin Division of the Connaught
  Laboratories have tested all the available methods and have
  appropriated certain details from many of these; several new
  procedures which have been found advantageous have been
  introduced by them. The yield of insulin obtained by Best and
  Scott at the Connaught Laboratories, by a preliminary extraction
  with dilute sulphuric acid followed by alcohol, is 1,800 to 2,200
  units per kg of pancreas.</p>

  <p>The present method of preparation is as
  follows. The beef or pork pancreas is finely minced in a large
  grinder and the minced material is then treated with 5 cc of
  concentrated sulphuric acid, appropriately diluted, per pound of
  glands. The mixture is stirred for a period of three or four
  hours and 95 per cent alcohol is added until the concentration of
  alcohol is 60 to 70 per cent. Two extractions of the glands are
  made. The solid material is then partially removed by
  centrifuging the mixture and the solution is further clarified by
  filtering through paper. The filtrate is practically neutralized
  with NaOH. The clear filtrate is concentrated <i>in vacuo</i> to
  about 1/15 of its original volume. The concentrate is then heated
  to 50&deg;C which results in the separation of lipoid and other
  materials, which are removed by filtration. Ammonium sulphate (37
  g per 100 cc) is then added to the concentrate and a protein
  material containing all the insulin floats to the top of the
  liquid. The precipitate is skimmed off and dissolved in hot acid
  alcohol. When the precipitate has completely dissolved, 10
  volumes of warm alcohol are added. The solution is then
  neutralized with NaOH and cooled to room temperature, and kept in
  a refrigerator at 5&deg;C for two days. At the end of this time
  the dark-coloured supernatant alcohol is decanted off. The
  alcohol contains practically no potency. The precipitate is dried
  <i>in vacuo</i> to remove all trace of the alcohol. It is then
  dissolved in acid water, in which it is readily soluble. The
  solution is made alkaline with NaOH to pH 7.3 to 7.5. At this
  alkalinity a dark-coloured precipitate settles out, and is
  immediately centrifuged off. This precipitate is washed once or
  twice with alkaline water of pH 9.0 and the washings are added to
  the main liquid. It is important that this process be carried out
  fairly quickly as insulin is destroyed in alkaline solution. The
  acidity is adjusted to pH 5.0 and a white precipitate readily
  settles out. Tricresol is added to a concentration of 0.3% in
  order to assist in the iso-electric precipitation and to act as a
  preservative. After standing one week in the ice chest, the
  supernatant liquid is decanted off and the resultant liquid is
  removed by centrifuging. The precipitate is then dissolved in a
  small quantity of acid water. A second iso-electric precipitation
  is carried out by adjusting the acidity to a pH of approximately
  5.0. After standing overnight the resultant precipitate is
  removed by centrifuging. The precipitate, which contains the
  active principle in a comparatively pure form, is dissolved in
  acid water and the hydrogenion concentration adjusted to pH 2.5.
  The material is carefully tested to determine the potency and is
  then diluted to the desired strength of 10, 20, 40, or 80 units
  per cc. Tricresol is added to secure a concentration of 0.1 per
  cent. Sufficient sodium chloride is added to make the solution
  isotonic. The insulin solution is passed through a Mandler
  filter. After passing through the filter the insulin is retested
  carefully to determine its potency. There is practically no loss
  in berkefelding. The tested insulin is poured into sterile glass
  vials with aseptic precautions and the sterility of the final
  product thoroughly tested by approved methods.</p>

  <p>The method of estimating the potency of
  insulin solutions is based on the effect that insulin produces
  upon the blood sugar of normal animals. Rabbits serve as the test
  animal. They are starved for twenty-four hours before the
  administration of insulin. Their weight should be approximately 2
  kg. Insulin is distributed in strengths of 10, 20, 40, and 80
  units per cc. The unit is one third of the amount of material
  required to lower the blood sugar of a 2-kg rabbit which has
  fasted twenty-four hours from the normal level (0.118 per cent)
  to 0.045 per cent over a period of five hours. In a moderately
  severe case of diabetes, one unit causes about 2.5 grams of
  carbohydrate to be utilized. In earlier and milder cases, as a
  rule, one unit has a greater effect, accounting for three to five
  grams of carbohydrate.</p>

  <p>With the improvement in the quality of
  insulin, the increased knowledge of its physiological action and
  the increased quantities at our disposal, we were now prepared
  for more extensive clinical investigation. In May 1922 a clinic
  was established in association with Dr. Gilchrist, at Christie
  Street Hospital for Returned Soldiers. Following this, a clinic
  was established in the Toronto General Hospital in association
  with Drs. Campbell and Fletcher, and at Toronto Hospital for Sick
  Children in association with Dr. Gladys Boyd. In general the
  routine followed in all these clinics was as follows.</p>

  <p>After a careful history had been taken, the
  patient was given a complete physical examination. Special
  attention was directed to the finding of foci of possible
  infection. The teeth, tonsils, accessory sinuses, chest and
  digestive system were examined clinically, as well as by X-ray.
  Special consideration was given to biliary tract infection,
  constipation, and chronic appendicitis. If any source of septic
  absorption was located it was appropriately treated, since such
  conditions may lower carbohydrate tolerance. If indicated the eye
  grounds were examined for a possible diabetic retinitis or
  neuro-retinitis.</p>

  <p>The daily routine urinalysis included the
  volume of the twenty-four hour specimen, the specific gravity,
  the reaction, and tests for albumen by heat or nitric acid. The
  acetone bodies were estimated by means of the Rothera and ferric
  chloride tests. Sugar determinations were done by means of the
  Benedict qualitative and quantitative solutions. In addition to
  the above, the blood sugars were estimated by means of the
  Schaffer-Hartman method and the respiratory quotients with the
  Douglas bag and Haldane gas-analysis apparatus.</p>

  <p>At first the patient continued on the same
  diet as that previous to his admission to hospital in order to
  obtain some idea of the severity of his case, and to avoid
  complications from sudden change of diet. Coma will be discussed
  separately. On the second or third day he was placed upon a diet,
  the caloric value of which was calculated on his basal
  requirement. This was determined from Dubois' chart and
  Aub-Dubois' table. It has been estimated by Marsh, Newburgh, and
  Holly that the body requires two-thirds of a gram of protein per
  kilogram of body weight per day (1 kilo=2.2 pounds) in order to
  maintain nitrogenous equilibrium. The remaining calories must be
  supplied by carbohydrate and fats in a ratio that will prevent
  the production of ketone bodies.</p>

  <p>The patient remained on this basal
  requirement diet at least a week. During this time, blood sugar
  was estimated before, and three hours after, breakfast, in order
  to determine the fasting level and the effect of food. The
  quantity of sugar excreted was estimated daily, and this amount
  subtracted from the available carbohydrate ingested gives
  approximately the utilization. The available carbohydrate
  includes 58 per cent of the protein, 10 per cent of the fat, and
  the total carbohydrate in the diet. It may be noted that when a
  patient was placed upon a diet in which the protein, fat and
  carbo-hydrates were balanced, that the amount of sugar excreted
  soon approached a fairly constant amount, whereas if the diet was
  not well-adjusted to the patient's requirements, there was wide
  variation in the amounts of sugar excreted.</p>

  <p>If a patient became sugar-free and blood
  sugar normal on a basal requirement diet, the caloric intake was
  gradually increased until sugar appeared in the urine. The
  tolerance was thus ascertained. If a patient remained sugar-free
  and had a normal blood sugar when on a diet containing five
  hundred calories above his basal requirement he was not
  considered sufficiently severe for insulin treatment, since five
  hundred calories over and above the basal requirement are
  sufficient for daily activities. If, however, he was unable to
  metabolize this amount, insulin treatment was commenced.</p>

  <p>Diabetes mellitus is due to a deficiency of
  the internal secretion of the pancreas. The main principle of
  treatment is, therefore, to correct this deficiency. If it is
  found that the patient is unable to keep sugar-free on a diet
  that is compatible with an active, useful life, sufficient
  insulin is administered to meet this requirement.</p>

  <p>In severe cases insulin was administered
  subcutaneously three times a day, from one-half to three-quarters
  of an hour before meals. This was done so that the curve of
  hypoglycaemia produced by the insulin was superimposed on the
  curve of hyperglycaemia produced by the meal. In rare cases a
  small fourth dose was given at bed time to control nocturnal
  glycosuria. The less severe cases could be satisfactorily treated
  on a morning and evening dose or a single dose before
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>When the insulin treatment was established,
  if sugar was present in the twenty-four hour specimen of urine,
  the dosage was gradually raised till the patient became
  sugar-free. If he was not receiving sufficient food for
  maintenance, diet and dosage of insulin were gradually raised. If
  small quantities of urinary sugar persist, it was desirable to
  find out at what period of the day this was excreted. In order to
  do this, each specimen in the twenty-four hours was analysed
  separately. An increase in the dose previous to the appearance of
  glycosuria will prevent its occurrence.</p>

  <p>In severe cases it was found preferable to
  give the largest dose of insulin in the morning, and reduced
  doses throughout the day. For example, a patient may receive
  fifteen units in the morning, ten units at noon, and ten units at
  night. If three equal doses are given there may be morning
  glycosuria and evening hypoglycaemia, whereas the extremes of
  blood sugar causing these conditions may be prevented by the
  above distribution.</p>

  <p>The effect of the same dosage of extract on
  different individuals was found to vary considerably. Five
  patients, whose weights varied from forty-six to sixty-seven
  kilograms, each received two cubic centimetres of the same lot of
  insulin, and in four hours the blood sugars had decreased 0.012%,
  0.044%, 0.128%, 0.146%, and 0.0180% respectively. It was found,
  however, that one patient would persistently give marked
  decreases in blood sugar after insulin, while in another the fall
  in blood sugar was persistently less. In our experience, the more
  marked decreases in blood sugar occurred in the milder cases.</p>

  <p>The blood sugars of some of the patients
  were followed throughout the twenty-four hours and it was found
  that it was possible to gauge the dosage of insulin so as to keep
  the blood sugar within normal limits and still avoid the dangers
  of hypoglycaemia.</p>

  <p>Coincident with the maintenance of the
  blood sugar at normal level the cardinal symptoms of the disease
  disappear. The patient loses the irritating thirst and dryness of
  the mouth and throat, and does not desire the large amounts of
  fluid with which he had previously tried to combat these
  symptoms. The lowered fluid intake diminishes the polyuria and
  from a twenty-four hour excretion of three to five litres the
  output falls to normal. The appetite which has been voracious is
  now satisfied with a normal meal, the carbohydrate of which is
  utilized, and the patient loses the persistent craving for
  food.</p>

  <p>We found that when a patient was given too
  large a dose of insulin there was a marked reaction, and the
  hypoglycaemia which developed gave rise to symptoms which were
  very similar to those observed in animals. The reaction began in
  from one and a half to six hours after the patient received the
  overdose. The average time was three to four hours. The interval
  varied with the individual, the dosage, and the food ingested.
  The first warning of hypo-glycaemia was an unaccountable anxiety
  and a feeling of impending trouble associated with restlessness.
  This was frequently followed by profuse perspiration. The
  development of this symptom was not affected by atmospheric
  conditions. It appeared while the patient was in a frosty outside
  atmosphere, or in a heated room, and was independent of physical
  or mental activity. At this time there was usually a very great
  desire for food. No particular foodstuff was desired, but bulk of
  any kind seemed to give satisfaction. At times the appetite is
  almost unappeasable.</p>

  <p>At this stage of the reaction the patient
  noticed a certain sensation as of clonic tremor in the muscles of
  the extremities. This could be controlled at first. Coordination,
  however, was impaired for the more delicate movements. Coincident
  with this there was a marked pallor of the skin with a rise in
  pulse rate to one hundred or one hundred and twenty beats per
  minute, and a dilatation of the pupils. The blood pressure during
  this period fell about fifteen to twenty-five millimetres of
  mercury, and the patient felt faint. The ability to do physical
  or mental work was greatly impaired. In a severe reaction there
  was often a considerable degree of aphasia, the patient having to
  grope for words. The memory for names and figures became quite
  faulty.</p>

  <p>The onset of hypoglycaemic symptoms depends
  not only on the extent, but also on the rapidity of fall in blood
  sugar. The level at which symptoms occur is slightly higher in
  the diabetic with marked hyperglycaemia than in a patient whose
  blood sugar is normal. When the blood sugar is suddenly reduced
  from a high level premonitory symptoms may occur with a blood
  sugar between the normal levels of 0.100% and 0.080%, while the
  more marked symptoms of prostration, perspiration, and in
  coordination develop between 0.080% and 0.042%. As a patient
  becomes accustomed to a normal blood sugar the threshold of these
  reactions becomes lower. One patient who formerly had premonitory
  symptoms of hypoglycaemia at 0.096% now has no reaction at
  0.076%, but symptoms commence between this level and 0.062%.</p>

  <p>The ingestion of carbohydrate, in the form
  of orange juice (four to eight ounces), or of glucose, relieves
  these symptoms in from one-quarter to one-half hour. If the
  reaction is severe, or if coma or convulsions occur, epinephrin
  or intravenous glucose should be given. The former acts in from
  three to ten minutes, but in order that the symptoms should not
  recur, glucose must be given by mouth as soon as the patient has
  sufficiently recovered. The patients were warned that when these
  reactions occurred they were to obtain carbohydrate
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"Fats only burn in the fire of
  carbohydrate." The ability of the severe diabetic to burn glucose
  is markedly impaired, therefore the excess of fat is incompletely
  oxidized, giving rise to ketone bodies. These appear in the blood
  and urine as acetone, diacetic and hetaoxybutyric acids. Insulin
  causes increased carbohydrate metabolism, and consequently fats
  are completely burned. This is substantiated by the fact that
  acetone and sugar disappear from the urine almost simultaneously
  following adequate amounts of insulin. When insulin is
  discontinued in these cases, acetone bodies and sugar reappear in
  the urine.</p>

  <p>Since the Rothera test is exceedingly
  delicate (sensitive to 1 part of aceto-acetic acid in 30,000),
  patients on a high fat diet may be sugar-free and still show
  traces of acetone bodies. A comparison with the ferric-chloride
  test (which is sensitive to only 1 part in 7,000) is, therefore,
  desirable. The persistence of ketone bodies in amounts which can
  be determined by the ferric-chloride test necessitates either an
  increase in the carbohydrate or a decrease in fat of the
  diet.</p>

  <p>When the production of acetone bodies is
  more rapid than the excretion they accumulate in the blood,
  giving rise to air hunger, drowsiness, and coma. The need of
  insulin is then imperative. After its administration, the
  utilization of carbohydrate by the body gives complete combustion
  of the fats. When a patient was admitted to hospital in coma the
  blood-sugar tests and a urinalysis were done as soon as possible.
  (The urine was obtained by catheterization if necessary.) While
  these tests were being carried out, the large bowel was evacuated
  with copious enemata. If the blood sugar was high and acetone
  present in large amounts in the urine, from thirty to fifty units
  of insulin were given subcutaneously. Blood and urinary sugar
  were frequently estimated because of the danger of hypoglycaemia.
  To prevent this, from thirty to fifty grams of glucose in ten per
  cent solution were given intravenously. If the patient was
  profoundly comatose, the insulin was administered intravenously
  with the glucose.</p>

  <p>The patient usually regained consciousness
  in from three to six hours. From this time on, fluids and glucose
  were administered by mouth if retained. The patient was urged to
  take at least two hundred cubic centimeters of fluid per hour. In
  from eight to ten hours, the ketone bodies were markedly reduced.
  On the following day protein was given every four hours as the
  white of one egg in two hundred cubic centimetres of orange
  juice. In two to three days, when ketone bodies had disappeared
  from the urine, fat was cautiously added, and the patient was
  slowly raised to a basal requirement diet. He was then treated as
  an ordinary diabetic. During the period of coma the patient was
  kept warm and toxic materials eliminated from the bowel by
  purgation and repeated enemata. A large amount of fluid was given
  to dilute the toxic bodies and promote their elimination. This
  was administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or per rectum. If
  signs of circulatory failure developed these were treated by
  appropriate stimulation.</p>

  <p>Striking results were obtained with the
  above procedure. However, it was found that the longer the period
  of untreated coma the more grave was the prognosis and the slower
  the recovery if it occurred. Cases complicated by severe
  infection, gangrene, pneumonia, or intestinal intoxication may
  recover from acidosis and coma, but succumb to the
  complication.</p>

  <p>Marked lipaemia was present in three cases.
  This disappeared in the course of a week to ten days after the
  patient was placed on insulin and on a diet in which the fat was
  restricted. The urine of one patient became acetone-free while
  lipaemia persisted.</p>

  <p>The severe diabetic, whose ability to burn
  carbohydrate is markedly impaired, has a persistently low
  respiratory quotient, from 0.7 to 0.8, which is but little raised
  by the ingestion of glucose: when glucose and insulin are given
  together, the respiratory quotient is markedly increased, showing
  that carbohydrate is being metabolized. The highest values have
  been obtained when pure glucose was used with insulin. Less
  extensive rises have been secured when the patient, while on a
  mixed diet, received insulin.</p>

  <p>All the patients gained in weight on the
  additional calories. There was an increase in sexual vigour and
  there was a greater ability to do mental and physical work.
  Nearly all of the patients have returned to their former
  employment, and while still under supervision, they administer
  their own insulin and arrange their own diets with satisfactory
  results.</p>

  <p>All diabetics who have not an adequate
  knowledge of the dietetic treatment of their disease should be
  admitted to hospital in order that they may receive instruction
  in the preparation of their calculated and weighed diet - that
  they may learn the qualitative tests for sugar and acetone in the
  urine - that their carbohydrate tolerance may be accurately
  determined; and that the use of insulin, if required, may be
  safely instituted. Mild cases, especially if over fifty years of
  age, can be controlled by diet. Cases that cannot be adequately
  controlled by dietetic treatment alone should be given sufficient
  insulin to enable them to attain to a diet on which they may
  "carry on".</p>

  <p>One of the commonest complications of
  diabetes, especially in untreated patients over fifty, is
  gangrene. It is often associated with varying degrees of
  sclerosis of the leg arteries, which makes it extremely difficult
  to obtain healing. This may be accomplished by the use of
  insulin, but when permanent impairment has occurred it is
  advisable to amputate. Amputation is also advisable when an
  infection is so severe that the life of the patient is in
  jeopardy. Treatment of these cases is difficult because, due to
  the infection, there is a marked variation in the daily
  production of insulin by their own pancreas. But with careful
  treatment they can be rendered free from acetone and sugar, and
  their general condition improved. Operation is then performed
  preferably under nitrous oxide and oxygen anaesthetic. If the
  blood sugar is maintained normal, and acidosis is prevented, the
  wound heals kindly, provided that the amputation has been high
  enough to assure a good blood supply. For varying periods after
  the operation, the patient remains on insulin treatment. In
  nearly all cases at the end of three or four weeks, mild
  hypoglycaemic reactions indicate an overdose of insulin. It is
  then necessary to increase the diet or decrease the insulin. In
  some cases the tolerance improves sufficiently to warrant the
  discontinuance of insulin.</p>

  <p>Diabetic patients requiring major
  operations, such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and
  tonsillectomy, or removal of teeth, are first rendered sugar- and
  acetone-free, unless the severity of symptoms demand immediate
  attention. Patients formerly considered bad surgical risks, if
  given proper dietetic treatment with insulin may be protected
  from the acidosis, hyperglycaemia, and glycosuria which otherwise
  usually result from the anaesthetic. In the diabetic, infections
  such as boils and carbuncles, and also intercurrent infections
  such as bronchitis, influenza, and fevers are favorably
  influenced by the normal blood sugar and increased metabolism
  which the administration of insulin permits. In the diabetic with
  tuberculosis, insulin allows the administration of proper
  nourishment to combat the tubercle infection.</p>

  <p>During the past year and a half I have not
  been in active practice but have remained associated with the
  clinics. I have also kept in personal touch with the first
  fifteen patients who received insulin treatment. These patients
  were all extremely severe diabetics for whom diet had done its
  best. Of these fifteen patients, seven were children under
  fifteen years. It has been possible through the intelligent
  co-operation of the parents to continue a proper balance between
  diet and insulin dosage, and to maintain six of the seven
  children sugar-free. None of these have had to return to
  hospital, and all have gained in tolerance, and require from
  one-half to one-third less insulin than when they first began
  treatment. They have all gained in height and weight, and for the
  most part have developed into healthy normal children. The one
  child whose diet and insulin has not been properly controlled has
  been back in hospital repeatedly and is steadily losing in
  tolerance. Of the remaining eight cases there were four women and
  three men whose ages ranged from twenty-five to thirty-five
  years. The weight of the women varied from seventy-four to
  seventy-nine pounds. Two of the women, although they have gained
  to normal or overweight and now have no symptoms of disease, have
  not shown any increase in tolerance, due, perhaps, to the fact
  that they have not kept sugar-free. All the others, both men and
  women, have been able to reduce their dose of insulin from
  two-thirds to one-fifth of the original requirement. The one
  remaining case was admitted for amputation. She had had diabetes
  for six years, and at the time of admission, her blood sugar was
  0.350%, and large amounts of acetone and sugar were being
  excreted in the urine. She was rendered sugar- and acetone-free
  by means of insulin before the operation was performed.
  Amputation was done at the middle third of the thigh. The stump
  was entirely healed in three weeks. Within six weeks of her
  operation, insulin was discontinued and her diet was increased
  without the return of diabetic symptoms. It is now three years
  since her operation and she is sugar-free on a liberal diet
  without insulin.</p>

  <p>It may be of interest to mention a few
  cases in greater detail to further illustrate the improvement in
  carbohydrate tolerance following insulin treatment.</p>

  <p>Case 1: male, aged 29 years, had suffered
  from chronic appendicitis. The urine of the patient in December,
  1916, was sugar-free. About the middle of March, 1917, he
  suddenly developed polyuria, polyphagia, and polydipsia, and lost
  fourteen pounds in weight in a fortnight. There was marked
  weakness. Urinary sugar was discovered to be as high as eight per
  cent at this time. On April 4th, the patient was placed on Allen
  treatment, and slowly regained a tolerance of about two hundred
  grams available carbohydrate. He returned to his army duties in
  September 1917, and was able to carry on uninterruptedly until
  March, 1919. His tolerance had decreased during this time to
  about one hundred and fifty grams. Following discharge from the
  army in March, 1919, the course of the patient was slowly
  downhill until October, 1921, when a particularly severe form of
  influenza shattered his tolerance. Up to this time the patient
  was maintained practically sugar-free, but following the attack
  of influenza, his tolerance fell to about sixty-six grams of
  available carbohydrate. He began to lose weight rapidly. Thirst,
  hunger, and polyuria returned. His strength diminished and, owing
  to mental and physical lassitude, he found it impossible to
  continue his work. Glycosuria became persistent and acetone
  bodies made their appearance, and steadily increased. A distinct
  odour of acetone was at times distinguishable in the patient's
  breath.</p>

  <p>On February 11th, 1922, this patient was
  taken to the Physiology Department of the University of Toronto,
  and the respiratory quotient was found to be 0.74, and unchanged
  by the ingestion of thirty grams of pure glucose. Then 5 cc of
  insulin were given subcutaneously, and within two hours the
  patient's respiratory quotient had risen to 0.90. The urine was
  sugar-free and he had shaken off his mental and physical torpor.
  Following this experiment, the patient did not again receive
  insulin until May 15th as the product was being further improved.
  Since the latter date, the patient has been constantly on
  insulin.</p>

  <p>During the first six months of insulin
  treatment it was impossible to maintain him sugar-free, although
  he received about 120 units per day. However, he gained in weight
  and his clinical condition improved. About January, 1923, with
  the improvement in the quality of insulin, the patient became
  sugar-free and has remained sugar-free with the exception of one
  or two occasions. During the first nine months he required no
  reduction in the dose of insulin, but since that time, on the
  average of every two months, he has had a series of hypoglycaemic
  reactions which necessitated the reduction of the dose. One
  exception to this occurred in June, 1924, at which time
  appendectomy was performed following a mild attack of
  appendicitis. An increased dose was required to maintain him
  sugar-free during this period. At the present time he requires
  but 20 units of insulin, or one-sixth of his original
  requirement. His diet has been practically constant during the
  whole period of observation. All symptoms attributable to
  diabetes have long since disappeared. He has gained twenty-five
  pounds in weight and apart from the necessity of taking insulin
  and controlling his diet he leads an active normal life.</p>

  <p>This case is a striking example of the fact
  that it is only in cases who are maintained sugar-free over long
  periods of time that an improvement in tolerance is obtained with
  a consequent reduction in the dose of insulin.</p>

  <p>Case 2: female, age 15 years. In the autumn
  of 1918, the patient had polydipsia and polyuria, and complained
  of weakness. During the winter she suffered from pains in the
  legs and back, and from insomnia. In March, 1919, these symptoms
  became more severe. The appetite became excessive and there was
  some pruritus. The weight by this time had fallen from
  seventy-five pounds to sixty-two pounds. Glycosuria was
  discovered and she was placed under the care of Dr. F.M. Allen,
  to whom we are very much indebted for complete record of the case
  from April, 1919, till August, 1922. During this period the diet
  was controlled so as to maintain the urine free from sugar.
  Despite this careful dietetic regime the patient's condition
  became progressively worse.</p>

  <p>When she came under my care on August 16th,
  1922, the examination showed: patient emaciated; skin dry; slight
  edema of ankles; hair brittle and thin; abdomen prominent; marked
  weakness. The patient was brought on a stretcher and weighed
  forty-five pounds. Nothing of note in the respiratory,
  cardiovascular, digestive, or nervous system.</p>

  <p>At this time she was receiving a diet of
  protein 50 g, fat 71 g, carbohydrate 20 g (919 calories). Insulin
  treatment was started immediately. At this early stage, the unit
  of insulin had not been worked out, and it is therefore difficult
  to accurately estimate the dosage she received. The diet was
  increased daily so that, at the end of two weeks, she was
  receiving protein 63 g, fat 208 g, carbohydrate 97 g (2512
  calories). This diet was continued up to January 1st, 1923.
  Insulin was given 15 to 30 minutes before the morning and evening
  meals. A sufficient amount was given to maintain the urine free
  of sugar. Each specimen of urine was examined and the dose was
  increased slightly if traces of sugar appeared. When
  hypoglycaemia occurred, orange juice or glucose candy was given.
  Between August 16th and January 1st, the urine was sugar-free,
  except on ten occasions when traces of sugar appeared, and on two
  other occasions when less than 2 g was excreted. Acetone was
  absent from the urine.</p>

  <p>On this treatment the patient gained
  rapidly in strength, and was soon able to take vigorous exercise.
  Her weight increased from 45 to 105 pounds in the first six
  months. The diet included such foodstuffs as cereals, bread,
  potato, rice, corn, tapioca, corn starch, and even honey.</p>

  <p>At present (June 1925) she is in the best
  of health, and to use her own words "never felt better in all my
  life". She has grown four inches and weighs 134 pounds. Her
  present diet which is only approximate because she has dispensed
  with the weighing of food, is 125 g carbohydrate, 50 g protein,
  50 g fat. This diet is practically the same as that of December,
  1922. The insulin required to maintain her sugar-free has been
  reduced about one-third.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gladys Boyd, who is now in charge of
  the diabetics at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, has
  been able to follow a number of cases of children under insulin
  treatment. She has estimated the insulin requirement per 10 g of
  carbohydrate in a number of cases, and in general her results
  show a decided increase in tolerance in all cases in which
  glycosuria and hypergly-caemia are adequately controlled. To
  illustrate - Case 1, which required 6.9 units per 10 g
  carbohydrate in March, 1923, only required 2.6 units in January,
  1924. Case 2, which required 7.8 units per 10 g in January, 1925,
  in June 1925 required only 2.8 units. Case 3, which required 6.5
  units per 10 g in April, 1922, required only 3.7 units in
  January, 1925.</p>

  <p>From a review of the work, Dr. Boyd has
  found that all the patients had had hyperglycaemia or even
  glycosuria at times, but if such occurrences were only transitory
  and infrequent, improvement in tolerance occurred. Even short
  periods of rest to the pancreas by means of balanced diet and
  insulin resulted in improvement in tolerance. Two of our earliest
  cases, Fanny Z. and Elsie N. are the only exceptions to this
  rule. Fanny is to all appearances in the best of health with a
  blood sugar of 0.3% to 0.4%. She has been admitted in coma four
  times. During her stay in hospital she improves but does as she
  chooses on discharge. Her tolerance is becoming less all the
  time. Elsie keeps in touch with us but is looked after by another
  physician. He purposely allows her to have glycosuria at night.
  She is fine physically, but requires much more insulin than
  formerly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Boyd has also found that in those cases
  who can handle sufficient food without insulin, although the
  disease has been kept under control there has not been such
  striking increase in tolerance.</p>

  <p>The best evidence that there is
  regeneration of the pancreas with insulin treatment is provided
  by Drs. Boyd and Robinson. The following is the case reported by
  them.</p>

  <p><i>Clinical history</i>: B. N., white,
  male, aged 9 years. <i>Family history</i>: Father and one
  maternal uncle have diabetes. Diabetes diagnosed in this child
  when he was two years old. He was placed on a suitable Allen
  diet, which was strictly adhered to, and for a time did well
  except for recurrent attacks of dysentery, which lowered his
  tolerance. Failure to gain in stature or weight in any way
  commensurate with his age was noted and the general condition
  became worse each year until he was more or less a chronic
  invalid with increasingly frequent attacks of acidosis during the
  last year before starting insulin.</p>

  <p>He was admitted to the Hospital for Sick
  Children, Toronto, the end of December, 1922. At this time he was
  an emaciated dwarf, more or less drowsy and unhappy. His weight
  was thirty pounds, and his height thirty-nine inches. His
  tolerance to carbohydrate had decreased until he was unable to
  utilize 15 g of such food. Insulin treatment was started at once
  and his diet increased to a diet suitable for a boy of his age.
  Sufficient insulin was given to keep him sugar-free and his blood
  sugar normal. He was discharged on an adequate diet plus insulin.
  Progress, both in general condition and in improvement of
  pancreatic function, was steady. His tolerance to carbohydrate
  trebled in the year, as shown either by the fact that 30 units of
  insulin controlled the disease as adequately as go units a year
  before, or, stated in another way, without insulin he could now
  handle 54 g carbohydrate instead of 15. From a chronic invalid in
  1922 he became "the leader of the gang", in 1923. He was killed
  by fracturing his skull when sleigh riding. He lived for about
  three hours after receiving the injury and an immediate
  post-mortem examination was made. The pancreas was removed within
  thirty minutes of death.</p>

  <p>From this clinical history one might expect
  the pancreas to show marked degeneration. However, on section
  there was little sign of degeneration, but on the other hand
  there was strong evidence to support the view of active
  regeneration both of acinar and islet tissue. These regenerative
  changes were more marked in the periphery and smaller lobules of
  the pancreas than in the central area.</p>

  <p>The acinar cells were found to he actively
  proliferating in cords and clusters forming small lobules in some
  areas, and were in close association with newly formed
  functioning ducts.</p>

  <p>The islets were greatly increased in
  number, particularly in the periphery, there being about four
  times as many per field as in the central area. These cells were
  large but might be overlooked with an ordinary stain. However,
  they could be identified as islet cells by Bowie's special
  granule-stain. This stain also demonstrated that these cells were
  almost entirely beta cells and were probably concerned in the
  increased carbohydrate tolerance. On the other hand, those islets
  in the central areas showed an increased number of cells all in
  an active state of nutrition, but closely packed together. The
  special stain showed a normal ratio of alpha and beta cells.</p>

  <p>These sections were studied by Bensley,
  Opie, Allen, and others, who concurred in the opinion of Drs.
  Boyd and Robinson.</p>

  <p>Dr. F.M. Allen, Morristown N. J., after
  using insulin for three years states as his belief, "That there
  has been improvement of tolerance in some cases beyond what was
  possible without insulin". "This observation is trustworthy only
  in cases where prolonged strict control of symptoms by diet was
  previously employed. On the other hand, the marked increase of
  tolerance is limited to a minority of cases and has not proved to
  be continuous in any of them. In other words the improvement
  always stops short of a cure. There is certainly no decline of
  tolerance with the passage of time, provided the case is kept
  under proper control."</p>

  <p>This summary is the belief of the most
  conservative of the outstanding clinicians in the United States
  engaged in diabetic work on a large scale.</p>

  <p>Dr. E.P. Joslin, Boston, Mass., who has one
  of the largest diabetic clinics in the world, has also found
  that, "The diabetic who is able to reduce his insulin is the
  diabetic who is absolutely faithful to diet and restricts gain in
  weight to a moderate degree."</p>

  <p>Joslin and his associates have carefully
  analysed the gain in weight and height of their thirty-two
  diabetic children under fifteen years of age. Their conclusions
  are:<br>
  (I) The gain in weight of the diabetic child treated with insulin
  resembles that of the normal child, but the diabetic child is
  still under weight for his age, though often not for his
  height.<br>
  (2) The increase in height of the diabetic child treated with
  insulin, though occasionally normal, is usually below that of the
  normal child. So far he has not grown tall like the normal child,
  either at the expense of growing thin or while being well
  nourished.</p>

  <p>Of the 130 children treated with insulin,
  120 are still living, while of the 164 who did not receive
  insulin, there are 152 dead. Of the 120 still living, 40% have
  either not increased or have actually decreased their insulin.
  Dr. Joslin believes that if the 60% who have had to increase
  their insulin had received similar treatment, they too would have
  been able to reduce their insulin.</p>

  <p>Sixteen children under ten years of age who
  have taken insulin under Dr. Joslin's care for an average of two
  years, are all alive, and now their duration of life is more than
  three times the duration of life of diabetic children of similar
  age treated by Dr. Joslin prior to 1915.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the severity of the disease,
  it has been found that by carefully adjusting the <i>diet and the
  dose of insulin, all patients may be maintained sugar-free</i>.
  Since this is possible, it is to be strongly advocated, because
  we have abundant evidence for the belief that there is
  regeneration of the islet cells of the pancreas when the strain
  thrown upon them by a high blood sugar is relieved. The
  <i>increase in tolerance</i> is evidenced by the
  <i>decreasing-dosage of artificially administered insulin. In
  fact, in some moderately severe cases</i>, the tolerance has
  increased sufficiently that they no longer require insulin.</p>

  <p>Diabetes mellitus may be considered
  fundamentally as a <i>disordered metabolism, primarily of
  carbohydrates</i>, and <i>secondarily of protein and fat</i>. It
  is indisputably proven that for normal metabolism of carbohydrate
  in the body, adequate amounts of insulin are essential. It
  follows, therefore, that the treatment consists in giving just
  sufficient insulin to make up for the deficiency in the patient's
  pancreas.</p>

  <p>Insulin enables the severe diabetic to burn
  carbohydrate, as shown by the rise in the respiratory quotient
  following the administration of glucose and insulin. It permits
  glucose to be stored as glycogen in the liver for future use. The
  burning of carbohydrate enables the complete oxidation of fats,
  and acidosis disappears. The normality of blood sugar relieves
  the depressing thirst, and consequently there is a diminished
  intake and output of fluid. Since the tissue cells are properly
  nourished by the increased diet, there is no longer the constant
  calling for food, hence <i>hunger pain</i> of the severe diabetic
  is replaced by <i>normal appetite</i>. On the increased caloric
  intake, the patients <i>gain rapidly in strength and weight</i>.
  With the relief of the symptoms of his disease, and with the
  increased strength and vigor resulting from the increased diet,
  <i>the pessimistic, melancholy diabetic becomes optimistic and
  cheerful</i>.</p>

  <p>Insulin is not a cure for diabetes; it is a
  treatment. It enables the diabetic to burn sufficient
  carbohydrates, so that proteins and fats may be added to the diet
  in sufficient quantities to provide energy for the economic
  burdens of life.</p>
