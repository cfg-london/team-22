  <h1>Torsten N. Wiesel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wiesel.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born in
  Uppsala Sweden in 1924, the youngest of five children. My father,
  Fritz S. Wiesel, was chief psychiatrist and head of Beckomberga
  Hospital, a mental institution located on the outskirts of
  Stockholm. We were brought up by my mother, Anna-Lisa (b.
  Bentzer), at the hospital and were sent by bus to Whitlockska
  Samskolan, a coeducational private school in the city. I was a
  rather lazy, mischievous student, interested mainly in sports. My
  election as president of the high school's athletic association
  was my only memorable achievement during that period. Suddenly,
  at the age of 17, I became a serious student and I did reasonably
  well as a medical student. My curiosity about the workings of the
  nervous system was stimulated by the lectures of Carl Gustaf
  Bernhard and Rudolf Skoglund, my professors in neurophysiology.
  Because of my background I was also interested in psychiatry, and
  I spent one year while I was a medical student working with
  patients in different mental hospitals.<br>
  <br>
  When my studies were completed I returned to Professor
  Bernhards's laboratory at the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1981/wiesel-autobio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Karolinska Institute</a> in 1954 to do basic
  neurophysiological research. The following year I had the good
  fortune to be invited to the United States as a postdoctoral
  fellow in Dr. Stephen Kuffler's laboratory at the Wilmer Institute,
  Johns Hopkins Medical School. Dr. Kuffler had just published
  his now classical study of the receptive field arrangements of
  cat retinal ganglion cells. This was an important extension of
  the pioneering work of Drs. <a href=
  "../1967/index.html">Hartline</a> and <a href=
  "../1967/index.html">Granit</a>, for which they received the 1967
  Nobel Prize. <a href="index.html">David Hubel</a> joined the
  laboratory in 1968, and the two of us decided to explore the
  receptive field properties of cells in the central visual
  pathways. This marked the beginning of our twenty year
  collaboration.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959 Dr. Kuffler was invited to become a professor of
  pharmacology at Harvard Medical School, and he brought a group of
  young and enthusiastic investigators with him from Johns Hopkins
  Medical School. The effectiveness of this group of
  neuroscientists in research and teaching, and the foresight of
  Dr. Ebert, then the Dean of the Medical School, led to the
  formation of the Department of Neurobiology with Stephen Kuffler
  as the chairman. In addition to David Hubel and myself, the
  original group of emigres from Johns Hopkins included Edwin
  Furshpan and David Potter; together with Edward Kravitz we became
  the original faculty of the new department. David and I now had
  the opportunity to continue our work in a stimulating
  environment. Our collaboration continued until the late
  seventies. In the past several years I worked with Charles
  Gilbert, a young investigator in the Department. In 1973 I was
  asked to be head of the Department of Neurobiology. Dr. Kuffler,
  who meant so much to all of us, continued his work as a
  University Professor until he died suddenly in 1980. My only
  regret is that he could not join David and me in the celebration
  of the Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  I was married to Teeri Stenhammar 1956-1970 and Ann Yee
  1973-1981. My daughter Sara Elisabeth was born in 1975. Aside
  from my work my interests lie in the arts and in world
  affairs.</p>
