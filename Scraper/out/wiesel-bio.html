  <h1>Elie Wiesel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wiesel.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Elie Wiesel</b> was born in 1928 in
  the town of Sighet, now part of Romania. During World War II, he,
  with his family and other Jews from the area, were deported to
  the German concentration and extermination camps, where his
  parents and little sister perished. Wiesel and his two older
  sisters survived. Liberated from Buchenwald in 1945 by advancing
  Allied troops, he was taken to Paris where he studied at the
  Sorbonne and worked as a journalist.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958, he published his first book, <i>La Nuit</i>, a memoir of
  his experiences in the concentration camps. He has since authored
  nearly thirty<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> books some of which
  use these events as their basic material. In his many lectures,
  Wiesel has concerned himself with the situation of the Jews and
  other groups who have suffered persecution and death because of
  their religion, race or national origin. He has been outspoken on
  the plight of Soviet Jewry, on Ethiopian Jewry and on behalf of
  the State of Israel today<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  Wiesel has made his home in New York City, and is now a United
  States citizen. He has been a visiting scholar at Yale University, a
  Distinguished Professor of Judaic Studies at the City College of New
  York, and since 1976 has been Andrew W. Mellon Professor in
  the Humanities at Boston University where he teaches "<i>Literature of
  Memory</i>." Chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial
  Council from 1980 - 1986, Wiesel serves on numerous boards of
  trustees and advisors.</p>
