  <h1>Leo Esaki - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="esaki.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Leo Esaki</b> was born in Osaka,
  Japan in 1925. Esaki completed work for a B.S. in Physics in 1947
  and received his Ph.D in 1959, both from the University of Tokyo. Esaki is an IBM Fellow and has
  been engaged in semiconductor research at the IBM Thomas J.
  Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York, since 1960.
  Prior to joining IBM, he worked at the Sony Corp. where his
  research on heavily-doped Ge and Si resulted in the discovery of
  the Esaki tunnel diode; this device constitutes the first quantum
  electron device. Since 1969, Esaki has, with his colleagues,
  pioneered "designed semiconductor quantum structures" such as
  man-made superlattices, exploring a new quantum regime in the
  frontier of semiconductor physics.<br>
  <br>
  The Nobel Prize in Physics (1973) was awarded in recognition of
  his pioneering work on electron tunneling in solids. Other awards
  include the Nishina Memorial Award (1959), the Asahi Press Award
  (1960), the Toyo Rayon Foundation Award for the Promotion of
  Science and Technology (1960), the Morris N. Liebmann Memorial
  Prize from IRE (1961), the Stuart Ballantine Medal from the
  Franklin Institute (1961), the Japan Academy Award (1965), the
  Order of Culture from the Japanese Government (1974), the
  American Physical Society 1985 International Prize for New
  Materials for his pioneering work in artificial semiconductor
  superlattices, the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1991 for contributions
  to and leadership in tunneling, semiconductor superlattices, and
  quantum wells. Dr. Esaki holds honorary degrees from Doshisha
  School, Japan, the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain, the
  University of Montpellier, France, Kwansei Gakuin University,
  Japan and the University of Athens, Greece. Dr. Esaki is a
  Director of IBM-Japan, Ltd., on the Governing Board of the
  IBM-Tokyo Research Laboratory, a Director of the Yamada Science
  Foundation and the Science and Technology Foundation of Japan. He
  serves on numerous international scientific advisory boards and
  committees, and is an Adjunct Professor of Waseda University,
  Japan. Currently he is a Guest Editorial writer for the Yomiuri
  Press. Dr. Esaki was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences in May 1974, a member of the Japan Academy on
  November 12, 1975, a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
  Engineering (USA) on April 1, 1977, a member of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft
  on March 17, 1989, and a foreign member of the American
  Philosophical Society in April of 1991.</p>
