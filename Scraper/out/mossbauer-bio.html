  <h1>Rudolf M&ouml;ssbauer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mossbauer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Rudolf Ludwig
  M&ouml;ssbauer</b> was born in Munich on the 31st of January
  1929, the son of Ludwig M&ouml;ssbauer and his wife Erna,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ernst. He was educated at the "Oberschule"
  (non-classical secondary school) in Munich-Pasing and left after
  matriculating in I948. After working for one year in industrial
  laboratories, he started reading physics at the Technical
  University (Technische Hochschule) in Munich in 1949 and passed
  his intermediate degree examinations in 1952. During the years
  1953 and 1954 he completed his thesis at the Laboratory for
  Applied Physics at the Technical University in Munich, at the same
  time acting as assistant lecturer at its Institute of
  Mathematics. From 1955 to 1957 he worked on his thesis for the
  doctorate and carried out a series of investigations at the
  Institute for Physics of the Max Planck Institute for Medical
  Research in Heidelberg, in the course of which he carried out the
  first experimental observation of the phenomenon of Recoilless
  Nuclear Resonance Absorption. In January 1958 he received his
  degree under Professor Maier-Leibnitz at the Technical University
  in Munich. In 1958, again at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, he
  provided the direct experimental evidence of the existence of
  Recoilless Nuclear Resonance Absorption. For the year 1959 he was
  appointed scientific assistant at the Technical University in
  Munich.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> He accepted an invitation by the California Institute of
  Technology in Pasadena, U.S.A., in 1960 and there continued his
  investigations of gamma absorption, at first as Research Fellow
  and later as Senior Research Fellow. He was appointed Professor
  of Physics at the California Institute of Technology in 1961.<br>
  <br>
  From the year 1953 onwards his main work was directed towards the
  study of absorption of gamma rays in matter, in particular the
  study of nuclear resonance absorption. This led to the discovery
  of Recoilless Nuclear Resonance Absorption and its theoretical
  interpretation. During the last few years he has been
  investigating problems of nuclear physics and of solid state
  physics by applying already previously established methods.<br>
  <br>
  His work in the field of Recoilless Nuclear Resonance Absorption
  has been rewarded by the following prizes: Prize of the Research
  Corporation New York (1960); R&ouml;ntgen Prize of the University of
  Giessen (1961); Elliot Cresson Medal, Franklin Institute
  (1961).<br>
  <br>
  He is married to Elisabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pritz, and has a daughter, Susi.<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
