  <h2>Interaction among Virus, Cell, and Organism</h2>

  <p>An organism is an integrated system of
  interdependent structures and functions. An organism is
  constituted of cells, and a cell consists of molecules which must
  work in harmony. Each molecule must know what the others are
  doing. Each one must be capable of receiving messages and must be
  sufficiently disciplined to obey. You are familiar with the laws
  which control regulation. You know how our ideas have developed
  and how the most harmonious and sound of them have been fused
  into a conceptual whole which is the very foundation of biology
  and confers on it its unity.</p>

  <p>For the philosopher, order is the entirety
  of repetitions manifested, in the form of types or of laws, by
  perceived objects. Order is an intelligible relation. For the
  biologist, order is a sequence in space and time. However,
  according to Plato, all things arise out of their opposites.
  Order was born of the original disorder, and the long evolution
  responsible for the present biological order necessarily had to
  engender disorder.</p>

  <p>An organism is a molecular society, and
  biological order is a kind of social order. Social order is
  opposed to revolution, which is an abrupt change of order, and to
  anarchy, which is the absence of order.</p>

  <p>I am presenting here today both revolution
  and anarchy, for which I am fortunately not the only one
  responsible. However, anarchy cannot survive and prosper except
  in an ordered society, and revolution becomes sooner or later the
  new order. Viruses have not failed to follow the general law.
  They are strict parasites which, born of disorder, have created a
  very remarkable new order to ensure their own perpetuation.</p>

  <p>For very many years, a group of eminent
  researchers have devoted their activity to the study of viral
  order. My own work simply prolongs a long chain of discoveries
  and ideas. I intend to discuss certain aspects of the relations
  between virus and cell and between virus and organism, and
  specifically the interaction between viral and cellular
  metabolism. I shall attempt to trace the development and
  evolution of the concepts, their ontogeny and phylogeny.</p>

  <p>In this development one man has played a
  decisive role. By the logic of his thinking, by the rigor of his
  method, and in the selection of his followers, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">Max Delbr&uuml;ck</a> has
  profoundly influenced the evolution of contemporary virology and
  of molecular biology. One of his followers, Hershey, in 1952, was
  responsible for a fundamental discovery: bacteriophages reproduce
  themselves from their sole genetic material. This strange
  property, which seemed to be a singularity of the bacteriophage,
  quickly became a general property of the viruses and even more
  than a property, a characteristic. Actually, any organized
  particle reproducing itself only from its own genetic material is
  and can only be a virus. Thus, thanks to Hershey, the category
  "virus" could be separated from the category "microbe", so that
  it became possible to distinguish the viruses by their essential
  difference, that is, to define them. This was also the discovery
  which has governed all interpretation &amp;data with regard to
  the various aspects of viral development and all of the evolution
  of fundamental virology.</p>

  <p>A molecule of nucleic acid can reproduce
  itself, express its potentialities, and give rise to virions,
  only within a cell. Here it finds whatever it lacks: enzymes,
  building blocks, a source of energy, and ribosomes. The virus is
  necessarily an intracellular parasite.</p>

  <p>The genetic material of a virus has thus
  entered the cell. The cellular and viral molecules will confront
  each other, and the fate of the two partners will be decided. Two
  extreme cases may present themselves. Either the virus will
  multiply in the cell or else the cell will enslave the virus.
  Quite naturally, investigation was first directed toward the
  total war, which offers greater attraction for the combative
  intellect than peaceful coexistence.</p>

  <p>When the genetic material of a highly
  virulent bacteriophage penetrates a bacterium, the bacterial
  chromosome is disintegrated and the bacterium consequently
  becomes incapable of producing messengers and bacterial proteins.
  The DNA of the bacteriophage synthesizes its own messengers with
  the aid of ribonucleotides synthesized by its host and of the
  enzymes of its host. The messengers of the bacteriophage will
  establish themselves on the bacterial ribosomes. With the aid of
  the activated transfer RNA and of the bacterial enzymes, the
  proteins of the bacteriophage are synthesized. Some of these
  proteins are enzymes necessary, for example, for the manufacture
  of specific constituents of the phages such as
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Others are enzymes necessary for the
  replication of the bacteriophage DNA. Still others are structural
  proteins of the virion. One of the last to be formed is
  endolysine, which destroys the wall of the bacterium, provokes
  its rupture, and ensures the liberation of the virions. When we
  examine the kinetics of production of the various proteins, we
  find that each is formed in a given period of the evolutionary
  cycle. Everything takes place as if a system of sequential
  repression and derepression was acting.</p>

  <p>As far as we know, the bacteriophage itself
  controls its own regulation. The bacterium infected by a virulent
  bacteriophage has become a virus factory which cannot be stopped
  except by its own disintegration. A bacterium has no control over
  the development of a virulent bacteriophage. But this is an
  extreme case. The relations between virus and bacterium do not
  always have this dramatic character.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact bacteriophages exist
  which do not kill all the bacteria which they infect. Some
  infected bacteria survive and perpetuate the ability to produce
  bacteriophages. These are lysogenic bacteria. Their investigation
  has profoundly modified our ideas on the relations between cell
  and virus. As so often happens, the hypotheses and theoretical
  concepts preceded the facts. Let us therefore begin with the
  theory.</p>

  <p>In 1923, Duggar and Armstrong proposed the
  bold idea that viruses are not small bacteria but rebellious
  genes that have escaped from the chains of coordination. In 1925
  and again in 1928 this idea was taken up and developed by Eugene
  Wollman. To him the transmission of properties from one bacterium
  to another was the result of the transmission by the external
  environment of certain genes endowed with a relative stability,
  and the viruses were compared to lethal genes. Today we know that
  the viruses and the chromosomes of their host cell may have
  important nucleotide sequences in common. It would be difficult
  to assume that such common structural characteristics could be
  the result of chance. Many virologists believe that viruses
  originated by mutation from cellular elements, that is, from
  normal structures. The virus, this element of disorder, arose
  from cellular order. Plato is justified, and the ideas of Duggar
  and Armstrong and those of Eugene Wollman now seem prophetic
  visions.</p>

  <p>These ideas were bitterly opposed for a
  long time. In papers published between 1925 and 1940, very often
  a passion shows through whose violence astonishes us. The
  scientific discussions frequently recall the invectives of the
  heroes of Homer. It is my impression that the scientific mind
  today is much better prepared for the acceptance of new ideas,
  and we must also say that new ideas are in general firmly
  grounded in experimental data.</p>

  <p>Let us return to the past and attempt to
  determine how our knowledge and our ideas on viruses and
  lysogeny, as well as our concepts of the relations between cell
  and virus, have evolved.</p>

  <p>Already in 1915, Twort had thought that the
  bacteriophagy might be due to a virus. This was also the opinion
  of d'H&eacute;relle: bacteriophages are viruses which kill the
  bacteria. Lysogeny came to confuse the bacteriologists.
  D'H&eacute;relle at first denied the lysogeny. Later, he became
  convinced that he had discovered it. None of this is important,
  but the bacteria producing bacteriophages posed a curious
  problem.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1919/index.html">Jules Bordet</a> wrote in
  1925: "The faculty for producing bacteriophages is incorporated
  in the heredity of the lysogenic bacteria. It is inherent in the
  normal physiology of the bacterium." Nevertheless, it is of
  interest to note that the great immunologist did not conceive
  that heredity might be linked to a structure. For Bordet,
  heredity was the perpetuation of an individual physiology. The
  bacteriophage is not a materialized hereditary property, and
  Bordet affirmed in 1931: "The invisible virus of d'H&eacute;relle
  does not exist. The intense lytic activity represents a
  pathological exaggeration of a normal function of the bacterium."
  It seems strange to us today that such an eminent mind could have
  conceived of specific functions independent of any specific
  structure.</p>

  <p>In 1929 lysogeny underwent a revival.
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/index.html">Sir Macfarlane
  Burnet</a> and his collaborator Margot MacKie began to
  investigate lysogenic Salmonellas. These Australian authors noted
  that only 0.1 percent of the bacteria contain bacteriophages.
  However, since all possess the property of producing
  bacteriophages, they must contain a specific <i>Anlage</i>
  coordinated in the hereditary constitution of the bacterium. The
  bacteriophage is "liberated" only if the bacterium is
  "activated". In the thinking of Burnet, this liberation probably
  corresponds to an unmasking, for he wrote in 1934: "We are forced
  to admit that each lysogenic bacterium encloses one or several
  particles of a bacteriophage which multiply by binary division
  with the bacterium."</p>

  <p>Everybody at that time believed that
  viruses were small microbes. A small microbe would necessarily
  have to reproduce itself by division. What, then, was the
  significance of this noninfectious phase? It might not represent
  anything important. We know of many organisms, specifically the
  protozoa, which go through a noninfectious stage during their
  cycle of evolution. Burnet had discovered the noninfectious phase
  of the bacteriophage in the lysogenie bacterium. In 1937 Eugene
  and Elisabeth Wollman noted that immediately after infection the
  bacteriophages passes through a noninfectious stage. This was
  confirmed in 1948 by Doermann, a follower of Max Delbr&uuml;ck,
  who for the first time methodically investigated the complete
  cycle of a bacteriophage.</p>

  <p>However, Wollman understood that the
  bacteriophage particle, the virion, is not the direct descendant
  of the infecting particle. An infectious and a non-infectious
  phase necessarily would have to alternate. In a nonlysogenic
  bacterium, this alternation should take place in each bacterial
  cycle. In each division, each lysogenic bacterium <i>should</i>
  liberate <i>one</i> bacteriophage.</p>

  <p>In 1938, Northrop started with the idea
  that bacteriophages are proteins and decided on a parallel
  investigation of the kinetics of the production of enzymes and
  that of the production of bacteriophages in a lysogenic
  bacterium. He concluded from his experiments that the
  bacteriophage, like the enzymes, is produced during the normal
  growth of the bacterium. At this point an important remark is
  necessary. Whether, in a bacterial population, one bacterium in a
  hundred produces one hundred bacteriophages or whether each of
  the bacteria produces one, the overall kinetics will remain the
  same. In 1949, the new school of American virologists, to which
  virology owes so much, condemned lysogeny. In nature, no problems
  exist but only solutions. The solution, the lysogenic bacterium,
  was enslaved as a typing tool for the identification of the
  bacterial families. Like those wisps of cloud that a breath of
  wind dispels, the problem was blown away from the temple of
  science and a smell of sulfur was left floating in the air.
  Lysogeny had become a heresy.</p>

  <p>However, a few heretics survived - and
  among them Jacques Monod, who played a decisive role in my
  decision to return to the problem of lysogeny. I decided to
  operate with individual bacteria.</p>

  <p>Here I must make a confession. I was led to
  this decision because I do not like either mathematics or
  statistics. I began my career as a protozoologist. I like to see
  things, not calculate probabilities.</p>

  <p>Consequently, I took a lysogenic bacterium
  and immersed it in a drop of culture medium. The bacterium
  divided, the daughters were separated, and at each division a
  specimen was taken from the medium. One bacterium thus divided 19
  times without liberating bacteriophages, and the daughter
  bacteria were still lysogenic.</p>

  <p>When we subject lysogenic bacteria to
  lysis, we note that they do not enclose any bacteriophage.
  Lysogeny is consequently perpetuated in a noninfectious form. We
  were then in 1950 - and Hershey's discovery dates from 1952.
  However, I did not like the idea that noninfectious virions might
  exist. The noninfectious phase should be something different from
  a virion. The term "prophage" was therefore proposed, and it
  seemed that the world eagerly awaited its coming. In spite of its
  French origin, the Greek word was rapidly and unanimously
  adopted.</p>

  <p>By giving a name to an unknown particle, we
  confer on it the dignity of a problem. The problem of the
  prophage had been posed, and now the history of lysogeny began
  again.</p>

  <p>The prophage and the bacteria live in
  equilibrium. However, in a large population of lysogenic
  bacteria, we always find bacteriophages. How and why? Should we
  consider the problem as statisticians? Should we calculate the
  probability that a bacterium will produce bacteriophages within a
  given time? Should we content ourselves with a formula which
  would express the state of health of the population in terms of
  Greek symbols? I have already said that I do not have a
  statistical soul, that my mind tends to the concrete, and that I
  like to observe because I like to see. Accordingly, I again
  observed isolated bacteria. Some of them multiplied normally.
  Others multiplied for a time and then the descendants underwent
  lysis. And each of the bacteria which were lysed liberated
  bacteriophages. All this happened as if, in some drops of the
  medium, the development of the bacteriophage had been induced.
  This was my conclusion and I published it, to my regret. I now
  had to show that induction was not a fanciful hypothesis but a
  reality.</p>

  <p>With Louis Siminovitch and Niels Kjeldgaard
  we went to work on an enterprise that was hard and discouraging
  because it seemed fruitless for a long time. After a year of
  effort, our faith was finally vindicated. Bacteria were
  irradiated by ultraviolet radiation. For an interval of 45
  minutes, they continued to grow, but then they began to undergo
  lysis. In the process, each of them liberated some hundred
  bacteriophages. Induction had been discovered. And since
  induction affected 99.9 percent of the population, any
  statistical analysis was obviated. I was saved.</p>

  <p>It thus appeared that the development of
  the prophage into bacteriophage is a mortal disease. The prophage
  is a potentially lethal factor. Irradiation forces it to express
  its potentialities.</p>

  <p>For a long time, it was believed that such
  lethal agents as ultraviolet radiation or X-rays kill the cell
  because they destroy an essential structure. This concept seemed
  perfectly natural. It was in harmony with concepts in regard to
  death. After all, it is simple to consider death as the result of
  the suppression of some indispensable function. However, because
  every theory is a generalization, the risk in a theoretical
  concept increases with the fraction of truth it contains.
  Biological theories explain the various phenomena of life either
  in terms of disappearance of structure or of function, or in
  terms of the development of new' structures. Our minds are tuned
  to a mode that we might call positive or negative. It is
  apparently difficult to make the transition from one to the other
  or to realize that the two modes are not necessarily
  incompatible. Radiations sometimes kill by provoking alterations
  in or disappearance of structures. Sometimes, too, it permits a
  potentially lethal gene to express 01 to effect new syntheses,
  whether this concerns a bacterial protein or a virus, and thus to
  engender disease and death. Radiation may trigger lethal
  syntheses.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, induction was only a stage in
  our knowledge of the lysogenic bacteria. Induction, like the
  prophage, raised a whole series of new problems. Their
  investigation quickly surpasses the specific cases of the
  bacteriophage and of lysogeny and merged with the fundamental
  problems of molecular biology.</p>

  <p>First of all, what is the nature of
  prophage? The use of radioactive molecules showed that the
  prophagc is a deoxyribonucleic acid. It is the genetic material
  of the bacteriophage, a conclusion in harmony with the
  discoveries of Hershey.</p>

  <p>Next, where is the prophage located? The
  discovery of sexualtity in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the
  investigation of the bacteriophage lambda made it possible to
  answer this question, and in a general way. The prophage is
  attached to the bacterial chromosome. It is localized on the
  chromosome at a well-defined point, the receptor, which is unique
  and specific for each type of bacteriophage.</p>

  <p>A temperate bacteriophage infects a
  nonlysogenic bacterium under conditions in which the bacterium
  will survive. The genetic material of the bacteriophage then
  penetrates the cytoplasm, explores the bacterial chromosome,
  recognizes the receptor, and pairs with it. Recognition and
  pairing can only be the consequence of structural homology - that
  is, of common nudeotide sequences. The DNA of the temperate
  bacteriophage is a circular - that is, closed - structure. The
  sector of the bacteriophage that is homologous with the bacterial
  chromosome opens, the bacterial chromosome also opens, and thus
  the genetic material of the bacteriophage is inserted, like a
  bacterial gene, into the bacterial chromosome. It becomes an
  integral part of the chromosome and behaves as if it were a
  bacterial gene. It will be reproduced by the system of enzymes
  which reproduces the chromosome of the bacteria. It happens
  sometimes that the prophage, when it detaches, wins out by taking
  with it some bacterial genes. These bacterial genes will be
  reproduced by the enzymes which provide for the autonomous
  multiplication of the bacteriophage.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, in 1953, it occurred to
  me that the properties and activity of a molecule or of a
  particle might not be dependent only on its structure but also on
  its geographic situation, and I wrote: "The position is the
  fourth dimension of the prophage". My friends chided me for this
  formula by saying that it was devoid of meaning, and at the time
  they were perhaps right. I still believe that, under its somewhat
  esoteric and fanciful aspect, it has a profound significance.</p>

  <p>In a bacterium, the DNA-RNA polymerase
  synthesizes RNA on a DNA matrix and not on an RNA matrix.
  However, <i>in vitro</i>, the same enzyme is able to utilize RNA
  as matrix. It is likely that, in a bacterium, the DNA-RNA
  polymerase is at the locus of its activity and not where it would
  have an opportunity to engage in actions reproved by molecular
  morals. In a normal cell, each molecule is at the place where it
  should be and not elsewhere, and that is why each of them does
  what it should do and not something else. We must then ask
  whether certain diseases of cellular metabolism are not provoked
  by molecular incursion into foreign territory. Molecular
  societies obey the same laws as more complex societies.</p>

  <p>Let us go back to the lysogenic bacteria.
  Now then, the prophage is reproduced by bacterial enzymes. Why
  does the lysogenic bacterium not produce bacteriophages? We
  believe today that at least one of the genes of the prophage
  expresses itself and produces a repressor. This repressor
  attaches itself to an operator gene and blocks the expression of
  the structural gene that determines the formation of the enzymes
  necessary for autonomous reproduction of the bacteriophage. A
  lysogenic bacterium produces virions if it is derepressed, and
  here we are again entangled in the problem of induction.</p>

  <p>In addition to such physical agents as
  ultraviolet and various other kinds of radiation, we know of many
  chemical inducers, such as the organic peroxides, ethyleneimines,
  and mitomycin. All inducers have in common the property of
  disturbing the metabolism of nucleic acids. According to
  Goldthwait and Jacob, the final product of the change might be a
  derivative of adenine. The product will attach itself to the
  active repressor and thus bring about an allosteric modification.
  The active repressor will become an inactive aporepressor. An
  operon being derepressed, a structural gene can express itself,
  and a new enzyme is produced which assures the autonomous
  multiplication of the viral genetic material and permits the
  expression of all of the genes that regulate viral
  structures.</p>

  <p>The vegetative phase takes its course,
  virions are formed, and the bacterium explodes and dies.</p>

  <p>Thus the inducing agents act by
  inactivating the repressor. Now, then, the repressor is
  responsible for immunity. This is why, under the action of
  inducers, the immunity of the lysogenic bacteria to the
  superinfective homologous phage is lost.</p>

  <p>When a nonlysogenic bacterium is infected
  by a temperate phage, it will either undergo lysis or become
  lysogenic. The conditions of the environment here decide the
  evolution of the genetic material of the bacteriophage; that is,
  they decide the fate of the bacterium. In order to be effective,
  these conditions must begin to operate within 7 minutes after
  infection. The fate of the bacterium - virus system manifestly
  depends on whether a repressor or the key enzyme responsible for
  autonomous multiplication is formed first.</p>

  <p>The repressor is produced by a regulator
  gene and acts on an operator gene. It is obvious that either gene
  is susceptible to mutation. A regulator gene, under the influence
  of mutation, will give a repressor incapable of inhibiting a
  given operator. An operator, as a result of mutation, may become
  insensitive to a given repressor. In the last analysis, the fate
  of a bacterium infected by a bacteriophage thus depends on the
  genetic constitution of the bacteriophage, on the genetic
  constitution of the bacterium, and on the metabolism of the
  bacterium which is in turn controlled by the environment.
  Moreover, the genetic material of the bacteriophage may confer on
  the bacterium not only the power of producing bacteriophages in
  the absence of infection but also other properties, such as the
  capability of synthesizing a toxin like diphtheria toxin or the
  synthesis of a new antigen which will modify the structure of the
  bacterial wall.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, through the infection
  the lysogenic bacterium has become a new organism, a cell-virus
  system whose fate will depend on the bacterial metabolism, which
  itself depends on the environment.</p>

  <p>Any valid proposition, however singular it
  may appear, is necessarily the particular expression of a general
  law. Since generalization is one of the most productive heuristic
  methods, we shall attempt to express the relations between
  bacteriophage and bacterium in such a way that the generality on
  which they depend will be included in the expression. Here, then,
  is this general expression : the course of the viral cycle is
  dependent on allosteric proteins whose structure and activity are
  controlled by the metabolism of the host cell.</p>

  <p>This general proposition shares at the same
  time both in the strictness of a law and the weakness of a
  hypothesis. We shall now have to abandon the heights of
  theoretical conception and descend into the underworld of
  disease.</p>

  <p>We know that herpetic infections are
  frequently latent. The infected individual does not present any
  symptoms of disease. However, under the influence of a great
  number of factors, the disease erupts. The variety of the
  effectors is astonishing, as will be seen from the following list
  of those promoting the outbreak of herpes:</p>

  <p>Local hyperpyrexia<br>
  Artificial fever<br>
  Febrile disorders (malaria, pneumonia, brucellosis, typhoid
  fever)<br>
  Local ultraviolet radiation<br>
  Hormone treatments<br>
  Menstruation<br>
  Unbalanced diet<br>
  Leukemia<br>
  Administration of proteins foreign to the system<br>
  Anaphylactic shock<br>
  Lesions of the Gasserian ganglion<br>
  Section of the trigeminal nerve<br>
  Emotion</p>

  <p>During the latent infections not only are
  there no symptoms, but it is not possible to detect the virus. We
  do not know in which form it is present, and to say that the
  virus is masked simply masks our ignorance. When the lesions
  develop, the virus appears in abundance. Actually, it is the
  viral multiplication which is responsible for the disease. During
  the latent infection, the viral cycle is blocked. The agents
  which trigger the disease thus induce the viral development of
  which the disease is the consequence. We can therefore assume
  that all these agents, in spite of their diversity, provoke by
  different mechanisms the same modification of cellular
  metabolism, and precisely that modification which will be
  responsible for triggering viral multiplication.</p>

  <p>And here we become entangled in a new
  hypothesis, according to which the development of an animal virus
  is controlled in a positive or negative man - same modification
  of cellular metabolism, and - precisely that modification which
  will be responsible for triggering viral multiplication.</p>

  <p>Some experimental data will be welcome.
  Guanidine inhibits the development of certain viruses, and in
  particular that of the poliovirus. At concentrations which are
  inhibiting for the virus, however, guanidine does not observably
  influence metabolism and cellular growth. Guanidine consequently
  is a specific inhibitor of the poliovirus. How does it act? Does
  it act at the level of the nucleic acid, as some seem to think?
  Sensitivity to guanidine may disappear upon mutation. A
  structural gene is a sequence of several hundred nucleotides, and
  a point mutation is the substitution of one nucleotide for an
  other. It is difficult to conceive that the presence, at some
  particular locus, of a nucleotide already abundantly represented
  along a long chain could modify the properties of the chain so
  that, for example, a difference of temperature of one-tenth of
  one degree or the presence of 0.0002 M guanidine would notably
  affect the structure and function of the molecule.</p>

  <p>Let us therefore assume that guanidine does
  not act directly on the nucleic acid. The hypothesis proposed by
  us a few years ago is the following. Guanidine, like temperature,
  affects the tertiary or quaternary structure of a protein. Today
  we would state that it is responsible for an allosteric
  modification.</p>

  <p>What is this protein?</p>

  <p>In the presence of guanidine, viral RNA is
  not synthesized, and it has been believed that guanidine acts in
  some manner on the viral RNA-replicase. This was a logical
  conclusion. However, we became aware that methionine and choline
  neutralize the inhibiting effects of guanidine. A number of
  experiments have led us to believe that the guanidine must block
  the activity of a virus-determined transmethylase. The simplest
  hypothesis is that this enzyme methylates the viral RNA.</p>

  <p>The DNA of the polyoma virus contains
  5-methylcytosine, and so does that of bacteriophage lambda.
  Methionine intervenes in the modification induced by the host of
  this bacteriophage. However, we do not know the physiological
  significance of such methylation. Investigation of the poliovirus
  has afforded an indication that methylation in certain cases may
  well control the course of the viral cycle. Such methylation
  would be effected by a virus-determined enzyme which is sentitive
  to guanidine and to cellular metabolites possessing a guanyl
  group. Thus the evolution of viral proteins, like the evolution
  of proteins in general, should terminate in the development of
  sites capable of accepting specific effectors, inhibitors and
  anti-inhibitors, which are cellular metabolites. I should like to
  draw attention to this conclusion.</p>

  <p>A cell becomes cancerous under the action
  of a virus. The virus has introduced into the normal cell its
  genetic material, which brings with it new functions, and these
  functions are the cause of the malignancy. It is reasonable to
  assume that a viral protein carries the phenotypical
  responsibility of the malign transormation.</p>

  <p>If the functions of the oncogenic viruses,
  like the functions of other viruses, depend on specific
  effectors, we may hope some day to convert a malignant cell into
  a phenotypically normal one.</p>

  <p>This leads us to remark on methodology. It
  would seem that we have so far been occupied in finding
  substances which specifically kill the malignant cell in the
  culture to the exclusion of normal cells or which specifically
  prevent the malignant cell from multiplying. The experiments are
  generally made in environments which may contain anti-effectors,
  as is the case for the couple methionine/guanidine. A change in
  methodology might perhaps be profitable.</p>

  <p>There is also another obvious theoretical
  possibility. Instead of attempting to repress the viral
  functions, we might attempt to intensify them in such a manner
  that the virus whose cycle is blocked develops and kills the host
  cell.</p>

  <p>The search for specific effectors of the
  viral functions and of the viral development is empirical at the
  moment. Such research must be developed and extended. Our
  ignorance of the nature of the factors which govern the relations
  among oncogenic virus and the cells should not incline us to
  pessimism but should instead be a stimulant. We should declare
  war on oncogenic viruses and carry it to victory.</p>

  <p>The experimental data and concepts
  discussed here encompass a vast field. There are very many who
  have made important contributions to this domain. It would have
  been impossible to do each of them justice within a lecture of 30
  minutes. I have mentioned some names, and my selection has
  necessarily been arbitrary. I would have liked to and I should
  cite, among others, T.F. Anderson, L. Astrachan and E. Volkin, L.
  Barksdale, G. Bertani, A. Campbell, S.S. Cohen, V.J. Freeman,

  Putnam, G. Stent, Elie Wollman, and N.D. Zinder. The bibliography
  concerning bacteriophages will be found in the excellent book by
  G. Stent, <i>Molecular Biology of Bacteria Viruses</i> (Freeman,
  San Francisco, 1963) and the no less excellent treatise of W.
