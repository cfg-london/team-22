  <h1>Ben R. Mottelson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mottelson.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Chicago, Illinois,
  on July 9, 1926, the second of three children of Goodman
  Mottelson and Georgia Mottelson (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Blum). My father held a
  university degree in engineering. My childhood home was a place
  where scientific, political and moral issues were freely and
  vigorously discussed. I attended primary school and high school
  in the village of La Grange, Illinois.<br>
  <br>
  Graduating from high school during the second world war, I was
  sent by the U.S. Navy to Purdue University for officers training (V12
  program) and remained there to receive a Bachelor of Science
  degree in 1947. My graduate studies were at Harvard University
  and my PhD work on a problem in nuclar physics was directed by
  Professor <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Julian Schwinger</a> and completed in 1950.<br>
  <br>
  Receiving a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard University
  I chose to spend the year (1950-51) at the Institute for Theoretical
  Physics in Copenhagen (later the Niels Bohr Institute) where
  so much of modern physics had been created and where there were
  such special traditions for international cooperation. A
  fellowship from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission permitted me to
  continue my work in Copenhagen for two more years after which I
  held a research position in the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear
  Research) theoretical study group that was formed in Copenhagen.
  With the founding of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Atomic Physics in
  Copenhagen (1957) I received a position as professor which I
  have held since. The spring term of 1959 was spent as visiting
  professor in the University of California at Berkeley.<br>
  <br>
  The close scientific collaboration with Aage
  Bohr was begun in
  1951 and has continued ever since. We feel that in this
  cooperation we have been able to exploit possibilities that lie
  in a dialogue between kindred spirits that have been attuned
  through a long period of common experience and jointly developed
  understanding. The lectures that are published in this volume
  attempt a discussion of the main influences that we have built on
  and the viewpoints that have been developed in this
  collaboration. It has been our good fortune to work closely
  together with colleagues at the Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita, including
  the many outstanding scientists who have come from all parts of
  the world and have so enriched the scientific atmosphere and
  personal contacts.<br>

 Married Nancy Jane Reno, 1948 (dec. 1975); 3 children, Malcolm Graham (1950), 
 Daniel John (1953), Martha (1954). Married Britta Marger Siegumfeldt, 1983.*</p>
