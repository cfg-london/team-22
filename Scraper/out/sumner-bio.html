  <h1>James B. Sumner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sumner.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>James Batcheller Sumner</b> was born
  at Canton, Mass., on Nov. 19, 1887, as the son of Charles Sumner
  and Elizabeth Rand Kelly. His ancestors were Puritans who came
  from Bicester, England, in 1636 and settled in Boston. His father
  owned a large country estate, while his grandfather had a farm
  and also a cotton factory. Young Sumner attended the Eliot
  Grammar School for a few years and then was sent to Roxbury Latin
  school. At school he was bored by almost every subject except
  physics and chemistry. He was interested in fire-arms and often
  went hunting. While grouse hunting at the age of 17, he was
  accidentally shot in the left arm by a companion; as a
  consequence, his arm had to be amputated just below the elbow.
  Having been left-handed, he then had to learn to do things with
  his right hand. The loss of his arm made him exert every effort
  to excel in all sorts of athletic sports, such as tennis, skiing,
  skating, billiards, and clay-pigeon shooting.<br>
  <br>
  In 1906 Sumner entered Harvard College; he graduated in 1910,
  having specialized in chemistry. After a short interval of
  working in the cotton knitting factory owned by his uncle, a type
  of work that did not interest him in the least, he accepted a
  teaching post at Mt.
  Allison College, Sackville, New Brunswick. This was followed
  by an assistantship in chemistry at Worcester Polytechnic
  Institute, Worcester, Mass., in 1911, from which he resigned in
  1912 in order to study biochemistry with Professor Otto Folin at
  Harvard
  Medical School. Although Folin advised him to take up Law,
  since he thought that a one-armed man could never make a success
  of chemistry, Sumner persisted and obtained his Ph.D. degree in
  June, 1914. A few months later while travelling in Europe he was
  stranded in Switzerland for about a month by the outbreak of
  World War I. During this time he received a cable inviting him to
  be Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at Cornell Medical
  School, Ithaca, N.Y., a post which he held until 1929, when
  he was made full Professor of Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Sumner's research work at Cornell first centered around
  analytical methods; despite hard work he was unable to obtain any
  interesting results. He then decided to isolate an enzyme in pure
  form, an ambitious aim never achieved by anyone up till then, but
  a type of research suited to his scanty apparatus and very small
  laboratory staff. In particular, he worked with urease.<br>
  <br>
  For many years his work was unsuccessful, but in spite of
  discouragement from colleagues who doubted whether any enzyme
  could ever be isolated in pure form he continued. In 1921, when
  his research was still in its early stages, he had been granted
  an American-Belgian fellowship and decided to go to Brussels to
  work with Jean Effront, who had written several books on enzymes.
  The plan fell through, however, because Effront thought Sumner's
  idea of isolating urease was ridiculous. Back in Ithaca, he
  resumed his work until finally, in 1926, he succeeded ("I went to
  the telephone and told my wife that I had crystallized the first
  enzyme", he wrote in an autobiographical note). His isolation and
  crystallization of urease met with mixed response; it was ignored
  or disbelieved by most biochemists, but it brought him a full
  professorship in 1929.<br>
  <br>
  Gradually, recognition came. In 1937, he was given a Guggenheim
  Fellowship; he went to Uppsala and worked in the laboratory of
  Professor <a href="../1926/index.html">The Svedberg</a> for five
  months. He was awarded the Scheele Medal in Stockholm in the same
  year. When Northrop, of the Rockefeller Institute, obtained
  crystalline pepsin, and subsequently other enzymes, it became
  clear that Sumner had devised a general crystallization method
  for enzymes. The opponents gradually admitted Sumner's and
  Northrop's claims - <a href=
  "../1915/index.html">Willst&auml;tter</a> last of all - and the
  crowning recognition came in 1946 when the Nobel Prize was
  awarded to Sumner and Northrop. In 1948, Sumner was elected to
  the National
  Academy of Sciences (USA).<br>
  <br>
  Sumner was married three times: in 1915 he married Bertha Louise
  Ricketts whom he later divorced. They had six children, one of
  whom died at an early age. In 1931 he married Agnes Paulina
  Lundkvist, and finally in 1943 Mary Morrison Beyer. He died of
  cancer on August 12, 1955.</p>
