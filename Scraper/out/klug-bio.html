  <h1>Aaron Klug - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="klug.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  1926 to Lazar and Bella (n&eacute;e Silin) Klug in Zelvas,
  Lithuania, but remember nothing of the place, because I was
  brought to South Africa as a child of two and grew up there. My
  father was trained as a saddler, but in fact as a young man
  worked in his father's business of rearing and selling cattle, so
  he grew up in the countryside. He had a traditional Jewish
  education and secular schooling, and though not a conventionally
  well educated man, he had some gift for writing, and had a number
  of articles published in the newspapers of the capital, for which
  he acted as what would now be called a stringer. Shortly after I
  was born he emigrated to Durban, where members of my mother's
  family had settled at the turn of the century, and the rest of
  the family followed soon thereafter.<br>
  <br>
  Durban was then a relatively sleepy town in subtropical
  surroundings. It was a fine place for a boy - there was the beach
  and the bush and school was not too taxing. I went to a good
  school, Durban High School, which was run on traditional English
  lines, with a curriculum somewhat adapted to South African
  circumstances. We had some good masters particularly in History
  and English. However, by the standards of to-day, there were few
  challenges other than Advanced Latin Prose Composition in the 6th
  Form. The philosophy of the school was quite simple - the bright
  boys specialised in Latin, the not so bright in science and the
  rest managed with geography or the like. There was a good library
  but it was the playing fields that kept one out of mischief. I
  did not feel a particularly strong call to any one subject, but
  read voraciously and widely and began to find science
  interesting. It was the book called <i>Microbe Hunters</i> by
  Paul de Kruif, well known in its time, which influenced me to
  begin medicine at university as a way into microbiology.<br>
  <br>
  At the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, I took the
  pre-medical course and, in my second year, I took, among other
  subjects, biochemistry, or physiological chemistry as it was then
  called, which stood me in good stead in later years when I came
  to face biological material. However, I felt the lack of a deeper
  foundation, and moved to chemistry and this in turn led me to
  physics and mathematics. So finally I took a science
  degree.<br>
  <br>
  I had by then decided that I wanted to do research in physics and
  I went to the University of Cape Town which was then offering
  scholarships which enabled one to do an M.Sc. degree, in return
  for demonstrating in laboratory classes. The University lay in a
  beautiful site on the slopes of Table Mountain, which one climbed
  at week-ends. I was lucky to find as Professor there, R.W. James,
  the X-ray crystallographer, who had brought to Cape Town the
  traditions of the Bragg school at Manchester. He was an excellent
  teacher and I used to attend his undergraduate lectures as well
  as those in the M.Sc. course. From him I acquired a feeling for
  optics, and a knowledge of Fourier theory, and I remember
  particularly certain optical experiments on rather abstruse
  phenomena such as external and internal conical refraction which
  fascinated me. After taking my M.Sc. degree, I stayed on and
  worked on the X-ray analysis of some small organic compounds, in
  the course of which I developed a method of using molecular
  structure factors for solving crystal structures, and taught
  myself some quantum chemistry to calculate bond lengths and so
  on. During this time, I developed a strong interest, broadly
  speaking, in the structure of matter, and how it was organised. I
  had now acquired a good knowledge of X-ray diffraction, not only
  through my own work, but through having helped James check the
  proofs of his fine book - <i>The Optical Principles of the
  Diffraction of X-rays</i> - still a standard work. James wrote
  beautifully and fully and took great pains to make everything
  clear.<br>
  <br>
  Supported by an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship and also by a
  research studentship to Trinity College, I went to Cambridge in 1949.
  Cambridge was the place for someone from the Colonies or the
  Dominions to go on to, and it was to the Cavendish Laboratory
  that one went to do physics. I wanted to work on some form of
  "unorthodox" X-ray crystallography, for example protein
  structure, but the MRC Unit where <a href=
  "../1962/index.html">Perutz and Kendrew</a> were working was
  full, and Bragg, then the Cavendish Professor, had closed down a
  project on order - disorder phenomena in alloys, which interested
  me. I finally found myself a research student of D.R. Hartree,
  who had been a colleague of both Bragg and James at Manchester.
  He suggested to me a theoretical problem left over from his work
  during the war on the cooling of steel through the
  austenite-pearlite transition, and I learned a fair amount of
  metallurgy in order to understand the physical basis of the
  phenomenon. It turned out however in the end that it was not
  special crystallographic insight that was called for - the course
  of the transition was in practice governed by the diffusion of
  the latent heat and I ended up using numerical methods to solve
  the partial differential equations for heat flow in the presence
  of a phase transition. I learned a good deal during this time,
  particularly in computing and solid state physics, and the idea
  of nucleation and growth in a phase change had its echo when I
  came later to think about the assembly of tobacco mosaic
  virus.<br>
  <br>
  After taking my Ph.D., I spent a year in the Colloid Science
  department in Cambridge, working with F.J.W. Roughton, who had
  asked Hartree for someone to help him tackle the problem of
  simultaneous diffusion and chemical reaction, such as occurs when
  oxygen enters a red blood cell. The methods I had developed for
  the problem in steel were applicable here, and I was glad to put
  them to use on an interesting new problem. The quantitative data
  came from experiments in which thin layers of blood were exposed
  to oxygen or carbon monoxide. In the course of my stay there, I
  also showed how one could analyse the experimental kinetic curves
  for the reaction of haemoglobin with carbon dioxide or oxygen by
  simulations in the computer, and so fit the rate constants.<br>
  <br>
  This work made me more and more interested in biological matter,
  and I decided that I really wanted to work on the X-ray analysis
  of biological molecules. I obtained a Nuffield Fellowship to work
  in J.D. Bernal's department in Birkbeck College in London and I moved there
  at the end of 1953. I joined a project on the protein
  ribonuclease, but shortly afterwards met Rosalind Franklin, who
  had moved to Birkbeck earlier and had begun working on tobacco
  mosaic virus. Her beautiful X-ray photographs fascinated me and I
  was also able to interpret some pictures which had apparently
  anomalous curved layer lines in terms of the splitting which
  occurs when the helical parameters are non-rational. From then on
  my fate was sealed. I took up the study of tobacco mosaic virus,
  and in four short years, together with Kenneth Holmes and John
  Finch, who had joined us as research students, we were able to
  map out the general outline of the structure of tobacco mosaic
  virus. This work was done partly in parallel with that of Donald
  Caspar, then at Yale, but he spent 1955 - 56 in Cambridge, and I
  formed an association with him which continued across the
  Atlantic for many years. It was during this time that I met
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick</a>
  and we published a paper together on diffraction by helical
  structures. I was fortunate to work with him again later, and so
  be able to learn, as he once wrote of Bragg, from watching the
  way he went about a problem.<br>
  <br>
  Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 and, supported by an N.I.H. grant,
  Finch, Holmes and I continued the work on viruses, now extended
  to spherical viruses. We were joined soon after by Reuben
  Leberman, a biochemist. In 1962 we moved to the newly built MRC
  Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge which, under the
  leadership of Perutz, was to house the original unit from the
  Cavendish Laboratory (Perutz, Kendrew, Crick and, later,
  Brenner), enlarged by Sanger's group from the Biochemistry
  Department and Hugh Huxley from University College London. I was
  thus privileged to join the laboratory at this stage in its
  expansion and so be able to take advantage of, and to help build
  up, its unique environment of intellectual and technological
  sophistication. The rest of my scientific career is largely a
  matter of record and much of this is dealt with in the lecture
  that follows.<br>
  <br>
  However, I should perhaps add that during the 20 years I have
  been back in Cambridge, I have been actively involved in the
  teaching of undergraduates, as well as of course supervising
  research students. I am still a Director of Studies in Natural
  Science at my College, Peterhouse, and under the tutorial or - as
  it is called in Cambridge - supervision, system, I teach
  undergraduates myself. I like teaching and the contact with young
  minds keeps one on one's toes, but increasing responsibilities
  have forced me to shed much of it in recent years.<br>

  Before I came to Cambridge I married Liebe Bobrow whom I had met
  in Cape Town. She trained in modern dance at the Jooss-Leeder
  School in London and later became a choreographer and coordinator
  for the Cambridge Contemporary Dance Group. More recently she has
  directed and acted in the theatre. We have two sons, Adam and
  David, born in 1954 and 1963. Adam, after studying History and
  Economics at Oxford and the London School of Economics, is now
  doing research in Econometrics. David is a second year student of
  Physics.</p>
