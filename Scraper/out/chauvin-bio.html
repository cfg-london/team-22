  <h1>Yves Chauvin - Biographical</h1>
  


          
      
<p><img src="chauvin.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on 10 October 1930 in Menin (Menen in Flemish) in
 western Flanders, on the border between Belgium and France. My
 parents were French. To be more precise, they were not only both
 from the Tours region, but also descended from long-established
 families in the little village of Beaumont-la-Ronce. I used to
 spend my holidays there in my grandparents' large family
 house, with my numerous cousins. When I die, I am going to be buried
 in the village cemetery. My grandmother was fond of painting and
 playing the piano. She had been given lessons by Emmanuel Chabrier,
 who used to spend the summer months in nearby Membrolle. He said
 in his correspondence that he did not much care for his pupils
 on the whole and my grandmother found him very strict. Most of
 my ancestors were small farmers. My father was an electrical engineer.
 After three years of military service and quite a difficult time
 in the First World War, he was sent by the company that had taken
 him on after his demobilisation to Ypres and then Menin, to work
 on rebuilding (building) the electricity network in this war-ravaged
 province. I remember him always being very motivated and working
 very long hours. He was sent to war again in 1939 and taken prisoner.
 There were 5 brothers and sisters in the family and we had quite
 a strict upbringing. From my bedroom, I looked out over our large
 garden (roses and vegetables) and the Lys river, which at that
 particular point separates France from Belgium and was where the
 flax was retted in tanks then dried in little bundles in a field
 (what a foul smell!). I watched the barges go past, towed by horses
 or even by men. It was a fascinating sight: the man pulling the
 rope remained bent over and unmoving for several minutes before
 the barge started to move. I also remember Vauban's fortifications
 in this land of invasions, and the smell of roasted chicory ...
 I still have many paintings of Flanders that my father bought from
 contemporary painters &ndash; somewhat classical, but not devoid
 of charm. I went to pre-school in Flanders and then the French
 primary school, which meant that I crossed the border every day.
 I then continued my secondary and higher education in various towns.
 During the war, I managed to come through the bombings unscathed,
 though sometimes only just. The war taught me to eat what there
 was; I am still not a fussy eater, although I do enjoy good food.
 To be perfectly truthful, I was not a very brilliant student, even
 at chemistry school. I chose chemistry rather by chance, because
 I firmly believed (and still do) that you can become passionately
 involved in your work whatever it is. Various circumstances, mainly
 to do with my military service, prevented me from doing a PhD and
 I have often regretted it, though you do need to choose the &quot;right&quot; supervisor
 in the &quot;right&quot; discipline &ndash; no easy task when
 you are totally inexperienced.</p>
           
 <p>So I took a job in industry, but the fact that process development
 consisted primarily of copying what already existed, with no possibility
 of exploring other fields, prompted me to resign. Furthermore,
 I discovered that this was a very common attitude among managers.
 They are afraid of anything new: &quot;Do what everyone else does
 and change as little as possible: at least we know it will work.&quot; It
 is the opposite of my way of thinking, which, I must admit, is
 a bit of an obsession! I have often got into arguments about it.
 My motto is more, &quot;If you want to find something new, look
 for something new!&quot; There is a certain amount of risk in
 this attitude, as even the slightest failure tends to be resounding,
 but you are so happy when you succeed that it is worth taking the
 risk.</p>
           
 <p>The whole contradiction of research (whether applied or fundamental)
 generally lies in the fact that we have to start out with the knowledge
 handed down by our predecessors, but be able to depart from it &quot;at
 the right time.&quot;</p>
           
 <p>I joined Institut Fran&ccedil;ais du P&eacute;trole in 1960 and
 managed to focus my work on what I thought would be most interesting.
 I got married the same year and over the course of time we had
 two sons and five grandsons.</p>
           
 <p>The oil industry essentially uses heterogeneous catalysis: cracking,
 reforming, hydrodesulphurization, hydrogenation, etc., but that
 was not what interested me. I have always tried to avoid areas
 that have been perfected with time. At the time, nothing much was
 being done in France on coordination chemistry, organometallics
 or homogeneous catalysis by transition metals and I was fascinated
 by the achievements in Italy (<a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1963/index.html">G.
 Natta</a>), Great Britain (J. Chatt),
 Germany (at the Max-Planck-Institute in M&uuml;lheim) and the United
 States. As a result, I unwittingly became the French specialist
 in these disciplines, which brought me into contact with both the
 positive and the unwieldy aspects of the various commissions at
 the CNRS. I spent the best part of my time on applied chemistry,
 which was what I had been employed for and which I was quite happy
 about. This was how I came to develop two homogeneous catalysis
 processes. The first one, which uses a nickel-based catalyst, was
 called &quot;Dimersol&quot; and exists in 2 basic versions.</p>

</p>
   <p>The &quot;gasoline&quot; version (Figure 1) consists of dimerising
 propene to high-octane isohexenes. There is, quite often, an excess
 of propene, especially in oil refineries that do not have petrochemicals,
 as in the United States. There are currently 35 plants in operation
 (including 18 in the USA ), with a combined annual output of 3.5
 million tonnes. It was the first and only time that coordination
 catalysis had been used in refining.</p>

 <p>The &quot;chemical&quot; version of the process (Figure 2)
 consists of dimerising n-butenes to isooctenes, basic inputs for
 plasticizers, using the &quot;oxo&quot; reaction. Current production
 levels stand at 400,000 tonnes a year.</p>

</p>
 <p>The second process I developed, and which uses a titanium-based
 catalyst, was called &quot;Alphabutol.&quot; It consists of dimerising
 ethylene to 1-butene (Figure 3), the co-monomer of low-density
 linear polyethylene. The benefits of such a process were not evident
 to begin with and stem from a number of causes. There are currently
 20 plants operating worldwide, with a combined output of 400,000
 tonnes a year. However, others are under construction, which will
 take total output to over 0.5 million tonnes a year.</p>

 <p>While there are obvious drawbacks to not having done a PhD (especially
 when you supervise them!), the advantage is that at least your
 mind is free to focus on whatever presents itself. At the time,
 I was working on batteries and, in particular, the non-aqueous
 electrolytes used to extend their electrochemical window. I thought
 it would be a good idea to try to use these electrolytes, which
 belong to the class of ionic liquids, as catalyst solvents. These
 liquids feature very low vapour pressure and virtual non-solubility
 in hydrocarbons, paving the way for a biphasic catalysis. The mixture
 of alkylimidazolium chloride and aluminium chloride forms a liquid
 with a very low melting point (below ambient temperature) (Figure
 4). It proved to be a first-rate solvent for nickel-based dimerisation
 catalysts (&quot;Dimersol&quot; catalysts). The diagram for this
 process, called &quot;Difasol,&quot; is shown in Figure 5. The
 reaction volume required for a biphasic system is 10 times smaller
 than for a homogeneous system (important for safety: refineries
 do not like to have large volumes in reaction because they are
 potential &quot;bombs,&quot; especially at start-up); likewise
 for nickel consumption. This new process, dealt with in a PhD project
 in 1990, will see the light of day thanks to the inventiveness
 and determination of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Olivier-Bourbigou, who
 took over from me in the laboratory.</p>

 <p>What applied chemistry has taught me is the need for absolute
 solidarity between the research laboratory and the &quot;downstream&quot; side
 (pilot testing, marketing, setting up industrial plant): same enthusiasm,
 same determination, especially when everything goes wrong!</p>
           
 <p>There is no difference between fundamental research and applied
 research. Although this is my view, based on personal taste and
 the areas I have worked in, it is not necessarily true for others.
 The PhD either led to, or were derived from processes. I have spoken
 so much about &quot;processes&quot; because they took up about
 three-quarters of my working time. However, I also took an interest
 in other aspects of coordination chemistry, such as palladium catalysis,
 rhodium catalysis, asymmetric amino-acid synthesis, and so on.
 After retiring in 1995, I was invited to work in J.-M. Basset's
 laboratory in Lyon, which allows me to pursue a reasonable level
 of activity.</p>
