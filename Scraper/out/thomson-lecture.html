  <h2>Electronic Waves</h2>

  <p>Ever since last November, I have been
  wanting to express in person my gratitude to the generosity of
  Alfred Nobel, to whom I owe it that I am privileged to be here
  today, especially since illness prevented me from doing so at the
  proper time. The idealism which permeated his character led him
  to make his magnificent foundation for the benefit of a class of
  men with whose aims and viewpoint his own scientific instincts
  and ability had made him naturally sympathetic, but he was
  certainly at least as much concerned with helping science as a
  whole, as individual scientists. That his foundation has been as
  successful in the first as in the second, is due to the manner in
  which his wishes have been carried out. The Swedish people, under
  the leadership of the Royal Family, and through the medium of the
  Royal Academy of Sciences, have made the Nobel Prizes one of the
  chief causes of the growth of the prestige of science in the eyes
  of the world, which is a feature of our time. As a recipient of
  Nobel's generosity I owe sincerest thanks to them as well as to
  him.</p>

  <p>The goddess of learning is fabled to have
  sprung full-grown from the brain of Zeus, but it is seldom that a
  scientific conception is born in its final form, or owns a single
  parent. More often it is the product of a series of minds, each
  in turn modifying the ideas of those that came before, and
  providing material for those that come after. The electron is no
  exception.</p>

  <p>Although Faraday does not seem to have
  realized it, his work on electrolysis, by showing the unitary
  character of the charges on atoms in solution, was the first
  step. Clerk Maxwell in 1873 used the phrase a "molecule of
  electricity" and von Helmholtz in 1881 speaking of Faraday's work
  said "If we accept the hypothesis that elementary substances are
  composed of atoms, we cannot well avoid concluding that
  electricity also is divided into elementary portions which behave
  like atoms of electricity." The hypothetical atom received a name
  in the same year when Johnstone Stoney of Dublin christened it
  "electron", but so far the only property implied was an electron
  charge.</p>

  <p>The last year of the nineteenth century saw
  the electron take a leading place amongst the conceptions of
  physics. It acquired not only mass but universality, it was not
  only electricity but an essential part of all matter. If among
  the many names associated with this advance I mention that of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a> I
  hope you will forgive a natural pride. It is to the great work of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a> that we owe
  the demonstration of the connection between electrons and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck's</a> quantum
  which gave the electron a dynamics of its own. A few years later,
  Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck, following on an earlier suggestion by
  A.H. Compton showed that it was necessary to suppose that the
  electron had spin. Yet even with the properties of charge, mass,
  spin and a special mechanics to help it, the electron was unable
  to carry the burden of explaining the large and detailed mass of
  experimental data which had accumulated. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/index.html">L. de Broglie</a>, working
  originally on a theory of radiation, produced as a kind of
  by-product the conception that any particle and in particular an
  electron, was associated with a system of waves. It is with these
  waves, formulated more precisely by Schr&ouml;dinger, and
  modified by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a> to cover the idea
  of spin, that the rest of my lecture will deal.</p>

  <p>The first published experiments to confirm
  de Broglie's theory were those of Davisson and Germer, but
  perhaps you will allow me to describe instead those to which my
  pupils and I were led by de Broglie's epoch-making
  conception.</p>

  <p>A narrow beam of cathode rays was
  transmitted through a thin film of matter. In the earliest
  experiment of the late Mr. Reid this film was of celluloid, in my
  own experiment of metal. In both, the thickness was of the order
  of 10<sup>-6</sup> cm. The scattered beam was received on a
  photographic plate normal to the beam, and when developed showed
  a pattern of rings, recalling optical halos and the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1936/index.html">Debye</a>-Scherrer rings
  well known in the corresponding experiment with X-rays. An
  interference phenomenon is at once suggested. This would occur if
  each atom of the film scattered in phase a wavelet from an
  advancing wave associated with the electrons forming the cathode
  rays. Since the atoms in each small crystal of the metal are
  regularly spaced, the phases of the wavelets scattered in any
  fixed direction will have a definite relationship to one another.
  In some directions they will agree in phase and build up a strong
  scattered wave, in others they will destroy one another by
  interference. The strong waves are analogous to the beams of
  light diffracted by an optical grating. At the time, the
  arrangement of the atoms in celluloid was not known with
  certainty and only general conclusions could be drawn, but for
  the metals it had been determined previously by the use of
  X-rays. According to de Broglie's theory the wavelength
  associated with an electron is <i>h/mv</i> which for the
  electrons used (cathode rays of 20 to 60,000 volts energy) comes
  out from 8 X 10<sup>-9</sup> to 5 X 10<sup>-9</sup> cm. I do not
  wish to trouble you with detailed figures and it will be enough
  to say that the patterns on the photographic plates agreed
  quantitatively, in all cases, with the distribution of strong
  scattered waves calculated by the method I have indicated. The
  agreement is good to the accuracy of the experiments which was
  about 1%. There is no adjustable constant, and the patterns
  reproduce not merely the general features of the X-ray patterns
  but details due to special arrangements of the crystals in the
  films which were known to occur from previous investigation by
  X-rays. Later work has amply confirmed this conclusion, and many
  thousands of photographs have been taken in my own and other
  laboratories without any disagreement with the theory being
  found. The accuracy has increased with the improvement of the
  apparatus, perhaps the most accurate work being that of v.
  Friesen of Uppsala who has used the method in a precision
  determination of <i>e</i> in which he reaches an accuracy of I in
  1,000.</p>

  <p>Before discussing the theoretical
  implications of these results there are two modifications of the
  experiments which should be mentioned. In the one, the electrons
  after passing through the film are subject to a uniform magnetic
  field which deflects them. It is found that the electrons whose
  impact on the plate forms the ring pattern are deflected equally
  with those which have passed through holes in the film. Thus the
  pattern is due to electrons which have preserved unchanged the
  property of being deflected by a magnet. This distinguishes the
  effect from anything produced by X-rays and shows that it is a
  true property of electrons. The other point is a practical one,
  to avoid the need for preparing the very thin films which are
  needed to transmit the electrons, an apparatus has been devised
  to work by reflection, the electrons striking the diffracting
  surface at a small glancing angle. It appears that in many cases
  the patterns so obtained are really due to electrons transmitted
  through small projections on the surface. In other cases, for
  example when the cleavage surface of a crystal is used, true
  reflection occurs from the Bragg planes.</p>

  <p>The theory of de Broglie in the form given
  to it by Schr&ouml;dinger is now known as wave mechanics and is
  the basis of atomic physics. It has been applied to a great
  variety of phenomena with success, but owing largely to
  mathematical difficulties there are not many cases in which an
  accurate comparison is possible between theory and experiment.
  The diffraction of fast electrons by crystals is by far the
  severest numerical test which has been made and it is therefore
  important to see just what conclusions the excellent agreement
  between theory and these experiments permits us to draw.</p>

  <p>The calculations so far are identical with
  those in the corresponding case of the diffraction of X-rays. The
  only assumption made in determining the directions of the
  diffracted beams is that we have to deal with a train of wave of
  considerable depth and with a plane wave-front extending over a
  considerable number of atoms. The minimum extension of the wave
  system sideways and frontways can be found from the sharpness of
  the lines. Taking v. Friesen's figures, it is at least 225 waves
  from back to front over a front of more than 200 &Aring; each
  way.</p>

  <p>But the real trouble comes when we consider
  the physical meaning of the waves. In fact, as we have seen, the
  electrons blacken the photographic plate at those places where
  the waves would be strong. Following Bohr, Born, and
  Schr&ouml;dinger, we can express this by saying that the
  intensity of the waves at any place measures the
  <i>probability</i> of an electron manifesting itself there. This
  view is strengthened by measurements of the relative intensities
  of the rings, which agree well with calculations by Mott based on
  Schr&ouml;dinger's equation. Such a view, however successful as a
  formal statement is at variance with all ordinary ideas. Why
  should a particle appear only in certain places associated with a
  set of waves? Why should waves produce effects only through the
  medium of particles? For it must be emphasized that in these
  experiments each electron only sensitizes the photographic plate
  in one minute region, but in that region it has the same powers
  of penetration and photographic action as if it had never been
  diffracted. We cannot suppose that the energy is distributed
  throughout the waves as in a sound or water wave, the wave is
  only effective in the one place where the electron appears. The
  rest of it is a kind of phantom. Once the particle has appeared
  the wave disappears like a dream when the sleeper wakes. Yet the
  motion of the electron, unlike that of a Newtonian particle, is
  influenced by what happens over the whole front of the wave, as
  is shown by the effect of the size of the crystals on the
  sharpness of the patterns. The difference in point of view is
  fundamental, and we have to face a break with ordinary mechanical
  ideas. Particles have not a unique track, the energy in these
  waves is not continuously distributed, probability not
  determinism governs nature.</p>

  <p>But while emphasizing this fundamental
  change in outlook, which I believe to represent an advance in
  physical conceptions, I should like to point out several ways in
  which the new phenomena fit the old framework better than is
  often realized. Take the case of the influence of the size of the
  crystals on the sharpness of the diffracted beams, which we have
  just mentioned. On the wave theory it is simply an example of the
  fact that a diffraction grating with only a few lines has a poor
  resolving power. Double the number of the lines and the sharpness
  of the diffracted beams is doubled also. However if there are
  already many lines, the angular change is small. But imagine a
  particle acted on by the material which forms the slits of the
  grating, and suppose the forces such as to deflect it into one of
  the diffracted beams. The forces due to the material round the
  slits near the one through which it passes will be the most
  important, an increase in the number of slits will affect the
  motion but the angular deflection due to adding successive slits
  will diminish as the numbers increase. The law is of a similar
  character, though no simple law of force would reproduce the wave
  effect quantitatively.</p>

  <p>Similarly for the length of the wave train.
  If this were limited by a shutter moving so quickly as to let
  only a short wave train pass through, the wave theory would
  require that the velocity of the particle would be uncertain over
  a range increasing with the shortness of the wave train, and
  corresponding to the range of wavelengths shown by a Fourier
  analysis of the train. But the motion of the shutter might well
  be expected to alter the velocity of a particle passing through,
  just before it closed.</p>

  <p>Again, on the new view it is purely a
  matter of chance in which of the diffracted beams of different
  orders an electron appears. If the phenomenon were expressed as
  the classical motion of a particle, this would have to depend on
  the initial motion of the particle, and there is no possibility
  of determining this initial motion without disturbing it
  hopelessly. There seems no reason why those who prefer it should
  not regard the diffraction of electrons as the motion of
  particles governed by laws which simulate the character of waves,
  but besides the rather artificial character of the law of motion,
  one has to ascribe importance to the detailed initial conditions
  of the motion which, as far as our present knowledge goes, are
  necessarily incapable of being determined. I am predisposed by
  nature in favour of the most mechanical explanations possible,
  but I feel that this view is rather clumsy and that it might be
  best, as it is certainly safer, to keep strictly to the facts and
  regard the wave equation as merely a way of predicting the result
  of experiments. Nevertheless, the view I have sketched is often a
  help in thinking of these problems. We are curiously near the
  position which Newton took over his theory of optics, long
  despised but now seen to be far nearer the truth than that of his
  rivals and successors.</p>

  <p>"Those that are averse from assenting to
  any new Discoveries, but such as they can explain by an
  Hypothesis, may for the present suppose, that as Stones by
  falling upon water put the Water into an undulating Motion, and
  all Bodies by percussion excite vibrations in the Air: so the
  Rays of Light, by impinging on any refracting or reflecting
  Surface, excite vibrations in the refracting or reflecting Medium
  or Substance, much after the manner that vibrations are
  propagated in the Air for causing Sound, and move faster than the
  Rays so as to overtake them; and that when any Ray is in that
  part of the vibration which conspires with its Motion, it easily
  breaks through a refracting Surface, but when it is in the
  contrary part of the vibration which impedes its Motion, it is
  easily reflected; and, by consequence, that every Ray is
  successively disposed to be easily reflected, or easily
  transmitted, by every vibration which overtakes it. But whether
  this Hypothesis be true or false I do not here consider."</p>

  <p>Although the experiments in diffraction
  confirm so beautifully the de Broglie-Schr&ouml;dinger wave
  theory, the position is less satisfactory as regards the extended
  theory due to Dirac. On this theory the electron possesses
  magnetic properties and the wave requires four quantities instead
  of one for its specification. This satisfies those needs of
  spectroscopy which led to the invention of the spinning electron.
  It suggests however that electronic waves could be polarized and
  that the polarized waves might interact with matter in an
  anisotropic manner. In fact detailed calculations by Mott
  indicate that if Dirac electrons of 140 kV energy are scattered
  twice through 90&deg; by the nuclei of gold atoms the intensity
  of the scattered beam will differ by 16% according to whether the
  two scatterings are in the same or in opposite directions.
  Experiments by Dymond and by myself have established
  independently that no effect of this order of magnitude exists,
  when the scattering is done by gold foils. While there is a
  slight possibility that the circumnuclear electrons, or the
  organization of the atoms into crystals might effect the result,
  it seems very unlikely. Some of the theorists have arrived at
  results conflicting with Mott, but I understand that their work
  has been found to contain errors. At present there seems no
  explanation of this discrepancy which throws doubt on the
  validity of the Dirac equations in spite of their success in
  predicting the positive electron.</p>

  <p>I should be sorry to leave you with the
  impression that electron diffraction was of interest only to
  those concerned with the fundamentals of physics. It has
  important practical applications to the study of surface effects.
  You know how X-ray diffraction has made it possible to determine
  the arrangement of the atoms in a great variety of solids and
  even liquids. X-rays are very penetrating, and any structure
  peculiar to the surface of a body will be likely to be
  overlooked, for its effect is swamped in that of the much greater
  mass of underlying material. Electrons only affect layers of a
  few atoms, or at most tens of atoms, in thickness, and so are
  eminently suited for the purpose. The position of the beams
  diffracted from a surface enables us, at least in many cases, to
  determine the arrangement of the atoms in the surface. Among the
  many cases which have already been studied I have only time to
  refer to one, the state of the surface of polished metals. Many
  years ago Sir George Beilby suggested that this resembled a
  supercooled liquid which had flowed under the stress of
  polishing. A series of experiments by electron diffraction
  carried out at the Imperial College in London has confirmed this
  conclusion. The most recent work due to Dr. Cochrane has shown
  that though this amorphous layer is stable at ordinary
  temperature as long as it remains fixed to the mass of the metal,
  it is unstable when removed, and recrystalizes after a few hours.
  Work by Professor Finch on these lines has led to valuable
  conclusions as to the wear on the surfaces of cylinders and
  pistons in petrol engines.</p>

  <p>It is in keeping with the universal
  character of physical science that this single small branch of it
  should touch on the one hand on the fundamentals of scientific
  philosophy and on the other, questions of everyday life.</p>
