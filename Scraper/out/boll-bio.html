  <h1>Heinrich B&ouml;ll - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="boll.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born December 21, 1917 in Cologne, on
  the Rhine, the son of the sculptor and cabinet-maker, Viktor
  B&ouml;ll, and his wife, Maria, n&eacute;e Hermanns. Between 1924
  and 1928 I attended elementary school in K&ouml;ln Raderthal, and
  from 1928 to 1937, the state-run Kaiser-Wilhelm classical
  secondary school in Cologne. In spring 1937 I began as an
  apprentice bookseller (publishers, retail trade, antiquarian) for
  the Matth. Lempertz company in Bonn. I left this apprenticeship
  in spring 1938, started my first attempts to write, gave private
  lessons, read a great deal. During autumn 1938 I was conscripted
  into the national labour service, and released in spring 1939
  after completing a six-month term of compulsory service. Because
  the completion of labour service was a precondition for
  permission to study at the university, I was able to begin my
  studies of Germanistics and Classical Philology during the summer
  term of 1939. Late in the summer of 1939 I was conscripted into
  the German Army shortly before the outbreak of the war. I took
  part in the Second World War; in autumn 1940, briefly in France,
  from 1941 to 1942 (after a severe case of typhus), in the
  replacement units in Germany, from early 1942 until summer 1943,
  along the English Channel coast in France, between summer 1943
  and autumn 1944, in the Soviet Union, Romania and Hungary, from
  spring 1945 on, for a few weeks in western Germany, where I was
  taken prisoner by the Americans, and interned until October 1945
  in a camp in France, and then for a few weeks in October/November
  1945, in an English camp in Belgium.<br>

  As early as December 1945, I accompanied my wife and a few
  relatives in their return from evacuation in the countryside to
  Cologne, where over the years we settled down in a destroyed
  house. I started to write again, while simultaneously working on
  repairing the destroyed house, I started my studies again -
  merely formally, because proof of occupation was necessary to
  obtain a food rationing card. From 1946 to 1949 I published short
  stories, and in 1949 my first book, a novella, called <i>Der Zug
  war p&uuml;nktlich</i>, was published. After a first invitation
  to a meeting of the "Gruppe 47" in 1951, I met many German
  postwar writers with whom I afterwards became friends. I owe
  particular thanks, and hereby give them, to Hans Werner Richter,
  Alfred Andersch and many others that I cannot name in detail.
  Even if there occurred brief or permanent controversies during,
  or after, these meetings, the Gruppe 47 liberated many German
  authoresses and authors out of their isolation in a destroyed and
  fragmented postwar Germany. In 1942 I married Annemarie Cech, who
  has been irreplaceable, not only as my wife and companion, and
  not only as fellow experiencer and fellow sufferer in the fascist
  drama during the Nazi reign in Germany, but also for her critical
  awareness for language.<br>

  Our first child, Christoph, died in October 1945. Our sons
  Raimund, Ren&eacute; and Vincent were born in 1947, 1948 and 1950
  in the rubble of Cologne and grew up there.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1950 and 1951 I worked as a temporary employee in the
  Cologne Bureau of Statistics. From summer 1951 on I have lived as
  a freelance writer with a fixed postal address in Cologne, but
  with a continually shifting place of work.</p>
