  <h1>Stanley B. Prusiner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="prusiner.jpg" class="bio-img">My history is not atypical of many
  Americans: born in the midwest, educated in the East, and now
  living in the West. My early years were shared between Des
  Moines, Iowa and Cincinnati, Ohio. Shortly after I was born on
  May 28, 1942 in Des Moines, my father, Lawrence, was drafted into
  the United States Navy. I was named for my father's younger
  brother who died of Hodgkin's disease at the age of 24. We moved
  to Boston briefly where my father enrolled in Naval officer
  training school before being sent to the south Pacific. He served
  as a communications officer for the remainder of World War II on
  an island called Eniwetok where the first hydrogen bomb was
  detonated a decade later.<br>
  <br>
  During my father's absence, my mother, Miriam, and I lived in
  Cincinnati where her mother, Mollie Spigel, also lived. Prior to
  moving to Cincinnati, Mollie had lived in Norfolk, Virginia,
  where she raised three children after her husband Benjamin was
  killed at age 50 in a traffic accident. Besides many special
  memories of my maternal grandmother, I have many fond
  reminiscences of my paternal grandfather, Ben, who emigrated to
  the United States in 1896 as a young boy from Moscow. He grew up
  in Sioux City, Iowa, as did my father with many other Russian
  Jews. Shortly after the end of World War II, we returned to Des
  Moines where I attended primary school and my brother, Paul, was
  born. In 1952, we moved back to Cincinnati with the hope that my
  father would be able to find a much better job as an architect.
  In Cincinnati, he practiced architecture for the next 25 years,
  which enabled him to provide a very comfortable home for his
  family.<br>
  <br>
  During my time at Walnut Hills High School, I studied Latin for
  five years, which was to help me immensely later in the writing
  of scientific papers. But I found high school rather
  uninteresting and was most fortunate to be accepted by the
  University of
  Pennsylvania where I majored in Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  The intellectual environment of the University of Pennsylvania
  was extraordinary - there were so many internationally renowned
  scholars who were invariably receptive to the intrusions of
  undergraduate students even before the days of student
  evaluations of the faculty. The small size of the undergraduate
  student body undoubtedly contributed to the accessibility of the
  faculty. Besides numerous science courses, I had the opportunity
  to study philosophy, the history of architecture, economics, and
  Russian history in courses taught by extraordinarily
  knowledgeable professors. Although I was among the smallest of
  the heavyweight crew team members and thus had no chance of
  rowing in the varsity boat, I greatly enjoyed the many hours that
  I spent at this wonderful sport.<br>
  <br>
  During the summer of 1963 between my junior and senior years, I
  began a research project on hypothermia in the Department of
  Surgery with Sidney Wolfson. I quickly became fascinated by the
  project and continued working on it throughout my senior year. I
  decided to remain at Penn for Medical School largely because of
  the wonderful experience of doing research with Sidney Wolfson.
  During the second year of medical school, I decided to ask
  Britton Chance if he would allow me to study the surface
  fluorescence of brown adipose tissue in Syrian golden hamsters as
  they arose from hibernation. Chance had reported that the surface
  fluorescence of other organs reflected the oxidation-reduction
  state of those tissues. As anticipated, large changes in the
  fluorescence of brown fat were found during non-shivering
  thermogenesis.<br>
  <br>
  My research on brown fat allowed me to spend much of the fourth
  year of medical school at the Wenner-Gren Institute in Stockholm
  working with Olov Lindberg on the metabolism of isolated brown
  adipocytes. This was an exciting time and I began to consider
  seriously a career in biomedical research. Early in 1968, I
  returned to Philadelphia to complete my medical studies and to
  contemplate my options. The previous spring, I had been given a
  position at the NIH once I completed an internship in medicine. It
  was the height of the Vietnam war with 500,000 young Americans
  trying to control the spread of Communism in southeast Asia. But
  I was facing an internship at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF)
  that would require me to work every other night for an entire
  year, a prospect about which I was not enthusiastic. The
  privilege of serving in the US Public Health Service at the NIH
  clearly outweighed the unpleasant prospects of an internship.
  Although the workload was awesome, I managed to survive because
  San Francisco was such a nice place to live. During that year, I
  met my wife, Sandy Turk, who was teaching mathematics to high
  school students.<br>
  <br>
  At the NIH, I worked in Earl Stadtman's laboratory where I
  studied glutaminases in <i>E. coli.</i> My three years at the NIH
  were critical in my scientific education. I learned an immense
  amount about the research process: developing assays, purifying
  macromolecules, documenting a discovery by many approaches, and
  writing clear manuscripts describing what is known and what
  remains to be investigated. As the end of my time at the NIH
  began to near, I examined postdoctoral fellowships in
  neurobiology but decided a residency in Neurology was a better
  route to developing a rewarding career in research. The residency
  offered me an opportunity to learn about both the normal and
  abnormal nervous system.<br>
  <br>
  In July 1972, I began a residency at the University of California
  San Francisco in the Department of Neurology. Two months later, I
  admitted a female patient who was exhibiting progressive loss of
  memory and difficulty performing some routine tasks. I was
  surprised to learn that she was dying of a "slow virus" infection
  called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) which evoked no response
  from the body's defenses. Next, I learned that scientists were
  unsure if a virus was really the cause of CJD since the causative
  infectious agent had some unusual properties. The amazing
  properties of the presumed causative "slow virus" captivated my
  imagination and I began to think that defining the molecular
  structure of this elusive agent might be a wonderful research
  project. The more that I read about CJD and the seemingly related
  diseases - kuru of the Fore people of New Guinea and scrapie of
  sheep - the more captivated I became.<br>
  <br>
  Over the next two years I completed an abbreviated residency
  while reading every paper that I could find about slow virus
  diseases. In time, I developed a passion for working on these
  disorders. As I plotted out a course of action, the task became
  more and more daunting. The tedious, slow, and very expensive
  assays in mice for the scrapie agent had restricted progress and
  I had no clever idea about how to circumvent the problem. I did
  think that after working with the scrapie agent for some time
  that I might eventually be able to develop such an assay.<br>
  <br>
  Since both Sandy and I liked living in San Francisco, I accepted
  the offer of an assistant professor position from Robert Fishman,
  the Chair of Neurology, and began to set up a laboratory to study
  scrapie in July 1974. Although many people cautioned me about the
  high risk of studies on scrapie due to the assay problems, such
  warnings did not dull my enthusiasm. To gain a base of research
  support from the NIH, I initially wrote grant proposals on
  glutamate metabolism in the choroid plexus. Such proposals were
  dull but were readily funded because I had worked on glutaminases
  earlier. Eventually, I managed to gain modest NIH support for my
  scrapie studies but this was not without considerable difficulty.
  To rebut the disapproval of my first NIH application on scrapie,
  I set up a collaboration with William Hadlow and Carl Eklund who
  were working at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton,
  Montana. They taught me an immense amount about scrapie and
  helped me initiate studies on the sedimentation behavior of the
  scrapie agent.<br>
  <br>
  I had anticipated that the purified scrapie agent would turn out
  to be a small virus and was puzzled when the data kept telling me
  that our preparations contained protein but not nucleic acid.
  About this time, I was informed by the Howard Hughes Medical
  Institute (HHMI) that they would not renew their support and
  by UCSF that I would not be promoted to tenure. When everything
  seemed to be going wrong, including the conclusions of my
  research studies, it was the unwavering, enthusiastic support of
  a few of my closest colleagues that carried me through this very
  trying and difficult period. Fortunately, the tenure decision was
  reversed and I was able to continue my work. Although my work was
  never supported by HHMI again, I was extremely fortunate to
  receive much larger funding from the R. J. Reynolds Company
  through a program administered by Fred Seitz and Macyln McCarty
  and shortly thereafter from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation
  under the direction of Walter Burke. While the vast majority of
  my funding always came from the NIH, these private sources were
  crucial in providing funds for the infrastructure which was the
  thousands of mice and hamsters that were mandatory.<br>
  <br>
  As the data for a protein and the absence of a nucleic acid in
  the scrapie agent accumulated, I grew more confident that my
  findings were not artifacts and decided to summarize that work in
  an article that was eventually published in the spring of 1982.
  Publication of this manuscript, in which I introduced the term
  "prion", set off a firestorm. Virologists were generally
  incredulous and some investigators working on scrapie and CJD
  were irate. The term prion derived from protein and infectious
  provided a challenge to find the nucleic acid of the putative
  "scrapie virus." Should such a nucleic acid be found, then the
  word prion would disappear! Despite the strong convictions of
  many, no nucleic acid was found; in fact, it is probably fair to
  state that Detlev Riesner and I looked more vigorously for the
  nucleic acid than anyone else.<br>
  <br>
  While it is quite reasonable for scientists to be skeptical of
  new ideas that do not fit within the accepted realm of scientific
  knowledge, the best science often emerges from situations where
  results carefully obtained do not fit within the accepted
  paradigms. At times the press became involved since the media
  provided the naysayers with a means to vent their frustration at
  not being able to find the cherished nucleic acid that they were
  so sure must exist. Since the press was usually unable to
  understand the scientific arguments and they are usually keen to
  write about any controversy, the personal attacks of the
  naysayers at times became very vicious. While such scorn caused
  Sandy considerable distress, she and my two daughters, Helen and
  Leah, provided a loving and warm respite from the torrent of
  criticism that the prion hypothesis engendered. During the winter
  of 1983, I herniated a disc in my lumbar spine while skiing and
  this slowed the pace of my work for much of the year. After a
  laminectomy, I began swimming regularly, which brought relaxation
  and a much needed quiet time to my life.<br>
  <br>
  Just prior to my back problem, the protein of the prion was found
  in my laboratory and the following year, a portion of the amino
  acid sequence was determined by Leroy Hood. With that knowledge,
  molecular biological studies of the prions ensued and an
  explosion of new information followed. I collaborated with
  Charles Weissmann on the molecular cloning of the gene encoding
  the prion protein (PrP) and with George Carlson and David
  Kingsbury on linking the PrP gene to the control of scrapie
  incubation time in mice. About the same time, we succeeded in
  producing antibodies that provided an extremely valuable tool
  that allowed us to discover the normal form of PrP. In a very
  important series of studies, the antibodies were used by Stephen
  DeArmond to study the pathogenesis of prion disease in transgenic
  mice. Steve brought the much needed talents of an outstanding
  neuropathologist to these studies. As more data accumulated, an
  expanding edifice in support of the prion concept was
  constructed. Ruth Gabizon dispersed prions into liposomes and
  purified scrapie infectivity on columns with PrP antibodies.
  Karen Hsiao discovered a mutation in the PrP gene that caused
  familial disease and reproduced the disease in transgenic mice
  while Michael Scott produced transgenic mice abrogating the prion
  species barrier and later artificial prions from chimeric PrP
  transgenes. Indeed, no experimental findings that might overturn
  the prion concept were reported from any laboratory. By the early
  1990s, the existence of prions was coming to be accepted in many
  quarters of the scientific community, but the mechanism by which
  normal PrP was converted into the disease-causing form was still
  obscure. When Fred Cohen and I began to collaborate on PrP
  structural studies, I was again extremely fortunate. Fred brought
  an extraordinary set of skills in protein chemistry and
  computational biology to investigations of PrP structures.<br>
  <br>
  As prions gained wider acceptance among scientists, I received
  many scientific prizes. The first major recognition of my work
  was accorded by neurologists with many other awards coming soon
  thereafter. But the most rewarding aspect of my work has been the
  numerous wonderful friends that I have made during an extensive
  series of collaborative studies. It has been a special privilege
  to work with so many talented scientists including numerous
  postdoctoral fellows and technical associates who have taught me
  so much. Besides the many collaborators who have contributed
  their scientific skills to advancing the study of prions, I have
  had many colleagues who have contributed indirectly to my work by
  being supportive of the special needs that such a project has
  demanded.</p>
