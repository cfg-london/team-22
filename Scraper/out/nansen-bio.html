  <h1>Fridtjof Nansen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nansen.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fridtjof
  Nansen</b> (October 10, 1861-May 13, 1930) was born at Store
  Fr&oslash;en, near Oslo. His father, a prosperous lawyer, was a
  religious man with a clear conception of personal duty and moral
  principle; his mother was a strongminded, athletic woman who
  introduced her children to outdoor life and encouraged them to
  develop physical skills. And Nansen's athletic prowess was to
  prove of the utmost importance to his career. He became expert in
  skating, tumbling, and swimming, but it was his expertise in
  skiing that was to play such a large role in his life. Not
  massively built, Nansen was tall, supple, strong, hard. He
  possessed the physical endurance to ski fifty miles in a day and
  the psychological self-reliance to embark on long trips, with a
  minimum of gear and only his dog for company.<br>
  <br>
  In school Nansen excelled in the sciences and in drawing and,
  upon entering the University of Oslo in 1881, decided to major in
  zoology. In the next fifteen years he united his athletic
  ability, his scientific interests, his yearning for adventure,
  and even his talent for drawing in a series of brilliant
  achievements that brought him international fame.<br>
  <br>
  In 1882 he shipped on the sealer <i>Viking</i> to the east coast
  of Greenland. On this trip of four and a half months, the
  scientist in him made observations on seals and bears which,
  years later, he updated and turned into a book; but at the same
  time the adventurer became entranced by this world of sea and
  ice.<br>
  <br>
  Obtaining the post of zoological curator at the Bergen Museum
  later that year, Nansen spent the next six years in intensive
  scientific study, punctuating his work with visits to some of the
  great laboratories on the Continent and once by an extraordinary
  trek across Norway from Bergen to Oslo and back on skis. In 1888
  he successfully defended his dissertation on the central nervous
  system of certain lower vertebrates for the doctorate at the
  University of Oslo.<br>
  <br>
  For a long time Nansen had been evolving a plan to cross
  Greenland, whose interior had never been explored. He decided to
  cross from the uninhabited east to the inhabited west; in other
  words, once his party was put ashore, there could be no retreat.
  In 1926, explaining his philosophy to the students at St. Andrews in his
  rectorial address, Nansen said that a line of retreat from a
  proposed action was a snare, that one should burn his boats
  behind him so that there is no choice but to go forward. The
  party of six survived temperatures of -45&deg; C, climbed to
  9,000 feet above sea level, mastered dangerous ice, exhaustion,
  and privation to emerge on the west coast early in October of
  1888 after a trip of about two months, bringing with them
  important information about the interior.<br>
  <br>
  In the next four years, Nansen served as curator of the
  Zootomical Institute at the University of Oslo, published several
  articles, two books, <i>The First Crossing of Greenland</i>
  (1890) and <i>Eskimo Life</i> (1891), and planned a scientific
  and exploratory foray into the Arctic. Basing his plan on the
  revolutionary theory that a current carried the polar ice from
  east to west, Nansen put his ship, the <i>Fram</i> [Forward], an
  immensely strong and cunningly designed ship, into the ice pack
  off Siberia on September 22, 1893, from which it emerged
  thirty-five months later on August 13, 1896, into open water near
  Spitzbergen. Nansen was not aboard.<br>
  <br>
  Realizing that the ship would not pass over the North Pole,
  Nansen and one companion, with thirty days' rations for
  twenty-eight dogs, three sledges, two kayaks, and a hundred days'
  rations for themselves, had set out in March of 1895 on a
  400-mile dash to the Pole. In twenty-three days they traveled 140
  miles over oceans of tumbled ice, getting closer to the Pole than
  anyone had previously been. Turning back, they made their way
  southwest to Franz Josef Land, wintered there in 1895-1896,
  started south again in May, reached Vardo, Norway, the same day
  the <i>Fram</i> reached open water and were reunited with the
  crew on August 21 at Troms&oslash;.<br>
  <br>
  The voyage was a high adventure but it was also a scientific
  expedition, the <i>Fram</i> serving as an
  oceanographic-meteorological-biological laboratory. Holding a
  research professorship at the University of Oslo after 1897,
  Nansen published six volumes of scientific observations made
  between 1893 and 1896. Continuing thereafter to break new ground
  in oceanic research, he was appointed professor of oceanography
  in 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Nansen interrupted his research in 1905 to urge the independence
  of Norway from Sweden and, after the dissolution of the Union,
  served as his country's minister to Great Britain until May of
  1908. In the next few years he led several oceanographic
  expeditions into polar regions, but once the world was plunged
  into war in 1914 and exploration was halted, he became
  increasingly interested in international political affairs.<br>
  <br>
  For almost a year in 1917-1918, as the head of a Norwegian
  delegation in Washington, D. C., Nansen negotiated an agreement
  for a relaxation of the Allied blockade to permit shipments of
  essential food. In 1919, he became president of the Norwegian
  Union for the League of Nations and at the Peace Conference in
  Paris was an influential lobbyist for the adoption of the League
  Covenant and for recognition of the rights of small nations. From
  1920 until his death he was a delegate to the League from
  Norway.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1920, the League of Nations asked Nansen to
  undertake the task of repatriating the prisoners of war, many of
  them held in Russia. Moving with his customary boldness and
  ingenuity, and despite restricted funds, Nansen repatriated
  450,000 prisoners in the next year and a half.<br>
  <br>
  In June, 1921, the Council of the League, spurred by the <a href=
  "../1963/index.html">International Red Cross</a> and other
  organizations, instituted its High Commission for Refugees and
  asked Nansen to administer it. For the stateless refugees under
  his care Nansen invented the &laquo;Nansen Passport&raquo;, a
  document of identification which was eventually recognized by
  fifty-two governments. In the nine-year life of this Office,
  Nansen ministered to hundreds of thousands of refugees -
  Russian,Turkish, Armenian, Assyrian, Assyro-Chaldean - utilizing
  the methods that were to become classic: custodial care,
  repatriation, rehabilitation, resettlement, emigration,
  integration.<br>
  <br>
  The Red Cross in 1921 asked Nansen to take on yet a third
  humanitarian task, that of directing relief for millions of
  Russians dying in the famine of 1921-1922. Help for Russia, then
  suspect in the eyes of most of the Western nations, was hard to
  muster, but Nansen pursued his task with awesome energy. In the
  end he gathered and distributed enough supplies to save a
  staggering number of people, the figures quoted ranging from
  7,000,000 to 22,000,000.<br>
  <br>
  In 1922 at the request of the Greek government and with the
  approval of the League of Nations, Nansen tried to solve the
  problem of the Greek refugees who poured into their native land
  from their homes in Asia Minor after the Greek army had been
  defeated by the Turks. Nansen arranged an exchange of about
  1,250,000 Greeks living on Turkish soil for about 500,000 Turks
  living in Greece, with appropriate indemnification and provisions
  for giving them the opportunity for a new start in life.<br>
  <br>
  Nansen's fifth great humanitarian effort, at the invitation of
  the League in 1925, was to save the remnants of the Armenian
  people from extinction. He drew up a political, industrial, and
  financial plan for creating a national home for the Armenians in
  Erivan that foreshadowed what the United Nations Technical
  Assistance Board and the International Bank of Development and
  Reconstruction have done in the post-World War II period. The
  League failed to implement the plan, but the <a href=
  "../1938/index.html">Nansen International Office for Refugees</a>
  later settled some 10,000 in Erivan and 40,000 in Syria and
  Lebanon.<br>
  <br>
  Nansen died on May 13, 1930, and was buried on May 17, Norway's
  Constitution Day.</p>
