  <h2>Fraternity among Nations</h2>

  <p>In the fundamental clauses of the Nobel
  testament concerning the Peace Prize, it is stated that it should
  be awarded to the men or women who have sought to work for
  "fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of
  standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace
congresses".</p>

  <p>"Fraternity among nations" is placed first.
  It sets forth the great goal itself. The other points cover some
  of the prerequisites and methods of attaining this end, expressed
  in the light of the striving and longing which prevailed at the
  time the testament was drawn up. The formulation itself mirrors a
  particular epoch in history. Fraternity among nations, however,
  touches the deepest desire of human nature. It has stood as an
  ideal for some of the most highly developed minds for a
  millennium; yet in spite of all the progress of civilization,
  nobody can step forward today and claim with any certainty that
  this goal will be reached in the near future. However unnoticed
  before, the clefts and gulfs lying between nations were fully
  exposed and deepened even further by the World War<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. And the courageous work of
  bridging these gaps across the broken world has scarcely been
  begun.</p>

  <p>No matter how far off this high goal may
  appear to be, no matter how violently shattered may be the
  illusion entertained at times by many of us that any future war
  between highly civilized nations is as inconceivable as one
  between the Scandinavian brothers, we may be certain of one
  thing: that for those who cherish humanity, even after its
  relapse into barbarism these past years, the only road to follow
  is that of the imperishable ideal of the fraternity of
  nations.</p>

  <p>I am sure that I do not, in this
  connection, have to deal in any detail with the subject of
  nationalism and internationalism. The sort of internationalism
  which rejects the sovereignty of a nation within its own borders
  and which aims ultimately at its complete obliteration in favor
  of a cosmopolitan unity, has never been other than a caricature
  of the true international spirit. Even when supported by
  quotations out of context - for example, by the well-known words
  of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i><a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, "The worker has no fatherlands, or
  by those of Gustave Herv&eacute; who, before becoming violently
  nationalistic during the war, exhorted French workers to plant
  the French flag on a dunghill<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> - even then, such ideas have found
  no real roots in the spirit of people anywhere.</p>

  <p>The kind of support encouraged by such
  modes of expression has always arisen basically from confusing
  the fatherland itself with the social conditions which happened
  to prevail in it. How often, recalls Jaur&egrave;s<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> in his book <i>The New Host
  [L'Arm&eacute;e nouvelle]</i>, have the socially and politically
  privileged believed or pretended to believe that their own
  interests coincided with those of the fatherland: "The customs,
  traditions, and the primitive instinct of solidarity which
  contribute to the formation of the concept of patriotism, and
  perhaps constitute its physiological basis, often appear as
  reactionary forces. The revolutionaries, the innovators, the men
  who represent a higher law have to liberate a new and superior
  nation from the grip of the old... When the workers curse their
  native country, they are, in reality, cursing the social
  maladjustments which plague it, and this apparent condemnation is
  only an expression of the yearning for the new nation."</p>

  <p>Who can now deny, after the experiences of
  the World War, that this view was correct! The contradiction
  between nationalism and internationalism, which appears so stark
  when seen in the light of a warped and one-sided exposition of
  the duties and significance of each,. is in reality non-existent.
  "The same workers," wrote this great man, "who now misuse
  paradoxical phrases and hurl their hatred against the very
  concept of a fatherland, will rise up to a man the day their
  national independence is in danger." Prophetic words, confirmed
  on both sides of the battlefront; yet, it had actually been
  supposed, before any issue was at stake, that the countries on
  both sides could be invaded with impunity.</p>

  <p>It is precisely this deeply rooted feeling
  for the importance of the nation that later becomes the basis and
  starting point for true internationalism, for a humanity built
  not of stateless atoms but of sovereign nations in a free
  union.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As a result of the World War and of a peace
  whose imperfections and risks are no longer denied by anyone, are
  we not even further away from the great aspirations and hopes for
  peace and fraternity than we were one or two decades ago?</p>

  <p>I have already mentioned that recent years
  have brought with them much disillusionment concerning what has
  so far been achieved by humanity. But it is possible that, in the
  days ahead, these years we have lived through may eventually be
  thought of simply as a period of disturbance and regression.</p>

  <p>The signs of renewal are far too numerous
  and promising to allow of despair. Never since the dawn of
  history, with its perpetual wars between wild tribes, never up to
  the present day throughout the unfolding of the ages, during
  which wars and devastation have occurred with such frequency and
  with interruptions for only such short periods of peace and
  recovery, never has our race experienced such a concentrated
  period of disturbance or such devastation of a large part of the
  world as that which began in 1914.</p>

  <p>Yet in spite of the unique extent of the
  devastation, we should not forget that this hard labor
  constituted the birthpangs of a <i>new Europe</i>. Three great
  military monarchies based essentially on a feudal order have
  collapsed<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> and been replaced
  by states whose constitutions assert more strongly than ever
  before the principles of nationality and of a people's right to
  self-determination. We must remember that the people for whom
  this change represents a first taste of freedom and a new and
  brighter future did not allow their resolution to falter, no
  matter how great the suffering by which they bought this
  independence. On our own eastern frontiers where we have
  witnessed with joy the birth of a free Finland<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>; down along the Baltic coast with
  its three new Baltic states<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>;
  throughout the newly risen Poland, land of martyrs of
  freedom<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>; in Czechoslovakia,
  the fatherland of John Huss and Comenius<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>; and in all of southeast Europe's
  more or less reconstituted states - in all of these, we have rich
  additions, for each of them will now enjoy a great opportunity to
  develop nationally, to the ultimate benefit of all that part of
  the world which we can call our own!</p>

  <p>I do not overlook the fact that the
  appearance of these new, free nations in the European political
  community not only celebrates the return of the prodigal son but
  also creates new sources of friction here and there. There is all
  the more reason, therefore, to concentrate on the other great
  benefit which has resulted from the past years of darkness: the
  beginning development of a <i>League of Nations</i> in which
  disputes between members are to be solved by legal methods and
  not by the military superiority of the stronger.</p>

  <p>It is a commonplace that the League of
  Nations is not yet-what its most enthusiastic protagonists
  intended it to be. The absence of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html">President Wilson's</a> own
  country<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> and of the great,
  though vanquished, nations, Germany and Russia<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>, so obviously circumscribes its
  ability to fulfill its task that when its critics speak of the
  League as a League of the Victorious Powers, they do so with some
  justification. Even with its faults, which can and must be
  remedied if our civilization is to survive, the League of Nations
  is succeeding - for the first time after a huge military
  catastrophe - in opening perspectives of a durable peace and of
  justice between the free and independent nations of the world,
  both large and small.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable to see how Alfred Nobel's
  fundamental ideas reappear in the Covenant of the League of
  Nations. I have already quoted from his testament, with reference
  to the road leading toward fraternity among nations; namely,
  reduction in armaments and promotion of peace congresses. The
  reduction of armaments is positively enjoined throughout Article
  8, although in cautious terms. And the annual meetings of the
  League's Assembly are in effect official peace congresses binding
  on the participating states to an extent that most statesmen a
  quarter of a century ago would have regarded as utopian. But the
  similarities in their respective lines of thought go even
  further. In her lecture here in Oslo in 1906, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1905/index.html">Bertha von Suttner</a>
  quoted<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> from a private
  communication addressed to her by Alfred Nobel: "It could and
  should soon come to pass that all states pledge themselves
  collectively to attack an aggressor. That would make war
  impossible and would force even the most brutal and unreasonable
  Power to appeal to a court of arbitration, or else keep quiet. If
  the Triple Alliance included every state instead of only three,
  then peace would be assured for centuries."</p>

  <p>Here we encounter the idea of
  <i>sanctions</i> in an acutely sharp form. Article 16 of the
  Covenant fortunately contains a considerably toned down version
  of it. Last year, the Assembly of the League, as a result of the
  initiative taken by the Scandinavian nations, further limited and
  clarified all the provisions of the clause prescribing the duty
  of states to participate in sanctions. But Nobel's basic idea has
  been realized. The whole collective force of the League is to be
  turned against the aggressor, with more or less pressure
  according to the need. Without envisaging any supranational
  organization, for which the time is not yet ripe, the present
  approach is as analogous as circumstances permit to that of an
  earlier age when the state first exercised authority over
  individual leaders unaccustomed to recognizing any curbs on their
  own wills.</p>

  <p>These last observations about a League
  comprising all states instead of only a few, should encourage us
  even today to remain firm in the demand which we small, so-called
  neutral countries should make at Geneva and everywhere: the
  demand that the League of Nations become <i>universal</i> in
  order truly to fulfill its task.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>No nation is so great as to be able to
  afford, in the long run, to remain outside an increasingly
  universal League of Nations. However, in the nature of things,
  the <i>smaller</i> states have a special reason for doing all
  they can to promote its existence and development.</p>

  <p>The equality among all members of the
  League, which is provided in the statutes giving each state only
  one vote, cannot of course abolish the actual material inequality
  of the powers concerned. The great powers which, from various
  motives, direct the development of the world toward good or evil,
  either forging the links of a higher concept of humanity or
  pandering to the greed of the few, will always exert an influence
  far greater than their individual votes, regardless of any
  permanent support they may or may not receive from the votes of
  dependent states. A formally recognized equality does, however,
  accord the smaller nations a position which they should be able
  to use increasingly in the interest of humanity as a whole and in
  the service of the ideal. The prerequisite is merely that they
  try as far as possible to act in <i>unison</i>.</p>

  <p>We here in the North have for many years
  had a natural tendency to feel that when our representatives come
  together at an international meeting, we embark on the quest of
  mutual understanding and support. In this quest, there has truly
  been no desire on the part of any one of us to encroach upon the
  freedom of the others to use their own ways of thinking in
  arriving at the opinions they wish to hold. No one who has shared
  this experience, however, has failed to sense that considerable
  strength arose out of our coalition. It has, moreover,
  fortunately been the rule, at any rate recently, that the views
  of the spokesmen for our three peoples have essentially
  coincided.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the nature of European
  problems has not infrequently extended our agreement beyond the
  confines of the North. Other nations, not involved in the World
  War, have held very similar views on the measures to be taken to
  ensure better times. This identity of views has of itself led to
  the creation of a considerable coalition of powers who were
  neutral during the war. At Geneva, the neutral states were often
  in agreement concerning the preliminaries for Genoa, and Genoa
  itself was marked by a quite natural mutual exchange of
  ideas<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>. This unity of
  approach to the problem confronting us had become so much a
  matter of course in other conferences of powers, that the
  "neutrals", as we were still called, were specially represented
  in the most important subcommittee.</p>

  <p>As long as the problem of world
  reconstruction remains the center of interest for all nations,
  blocs having similar attitudes will form and operate even within
  the League itself. There is no reason why agreement on particular
  points should not be both possible and advantageous to the
  so-called neutrals and to one or more of the blocs, either
  existing or in the process of formation, within the League of
  Nations. With Finland and with the Baltic states we in the North
  have strong cultural affinities; the states of the Little
  Entente<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> often advance
  views that differ from the unilateral ones of the great powers;
  and the representatives of the South American nations are
  likewise evincing a strong tendency to act together. All in all,
  the League of Nations is not inevitably bound, as some maintain
  from time to time, to degenerate into an impotent appendage of
  first one, then another of the competing great powers. If we all
  do our best to work for that real peace and reconciliation
  between peoples which it is our first duty to promote within the
  League of Nations, then the power to command attention will be
  available to us, even though, as small nations, we are so
  isolated and powerless that individually we can exert little
  influence on the great powers in world politics.</p>

  <p>Allow me one other observation. The League
  of Nations is not the only organization, albeit the most
  official, which has inscribed the maintenance of peace through
  law on its banner. Before the war there were many who were more
  or less ignorant of the international labor movement but who
  nevertheless turned to it for salvation when the threat of war
  arose. They hoped that the workers would never permit a war.</p>

  <p>We now know that this hope was futile. The
  World War broke out with such elemental violence, and with such
  resort to all means for leading or misleading public opinion,
  that no time was available for reflection and consideration. But
  after all those horrors, does it follow that the present
  sentiment of the workers against war, now more widely held, will
  exhibit the same impotence in every new situation? To be sure,
  the political International is at present weakened by the split
  which Bolshevism has caused in the ranks of labor
  everywhere<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>, but the
  trade-union International at Amsterdam<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> is stronger than ever before. Its
  twenty million workers are a force to be reckoned with, and their
  propaganda against war and the danger of war continues
  ceaselessly among the masses. Some years hence it may well turn
  out that when the question is asked, Who has in the recent past
  done most for the cause of peace in the spirit of Alfred Nobel?
  The answer may be: The Amsterdam International.</p>

  <p>Let us return, however, to the League of
  Nations. To create an organization which is in a position to
  protect peace in this world of conflicting interests and
  egotistic wills is a frighteningly difficult task. But the
  difficulties must not hold us back. I conclude with a few lines
  from James Bryce<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>, which
  could be said to epitomize the testament of this venerable
  champion of peace and humanity:</p>

  <p>"The obstacles are not insuperable. But
  whatever they may be, we must tackle them head on, for they are
  much less than the dangers which will continue to menace
  civilization if present conditions continue any longer. The world
  cannot be left where it is at present. If the nations do not try
  to annihilate war, then war will annihilate them. Some kind of
  common action by all states who set a value on peace is a
  compelling necessity, and instead of shrinking from the
  difficulties, we must recognize this necessity and then go
  forward."</p>
