  <h1>Glenn T. Seaborg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="seaborg.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Glenn Theodore Seaborg</b> was born in Ishpeming,
  Michigan, on April 19, 1912. At the age of 10 he moved with his
  family to California, in 1929 he graduated at David Starr Jordan
  High School in Los Angeles as valedictorian of his class.<br>
  <br>
  He entered the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1929, and
  received the degree of Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of
  California, Berkeley, in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he was the
  personal laboratory assistant of the late G. N. Lewis, with whom
  he published a number of scientific papers. In 1939, Dr. Seaborg
  was appointed an instructor in chemistry at the University of
  California, Berkeley, where he was promoted to Assistant
  Professor in 1941, and to Professor of Chemistry in 1945. In
  1946, he also took responsibility for direction of nuclear
  chemical research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, operated
  for the Atomic Energy Commission by the University of California;
  from 1954 to 1961, he was Associate Director of LRL. In the same
  year, he was appointed by President Truman to be a member of the
  AEC's first General Advisory Committee, a post he held until
  1950. In 1958, he was appointed Chancellor of the University of
  California at Berkeley. In that capacity he served until his
  appointment by President Kennedy to the Atomic Energy Commission
  in 1961, when he was designated Chairman of the Commission. His
  term of office expires in 1968. From 1959 to 1961, he was also a
  member of the President's Science Advisory Committee. Dr. Seaborg
  was given a leave of absence from the University of California
  from 1942-1946, during which period he headed the plutonium work
  of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago
  Metallurgical Laboratory. He was co-discoverer of plutonium and
  all further transuranium elements through element 102.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the discovery of transuranium elements, Dr.
  Seaborg and his colleagues are responsible for the identification
  of more than 100 isotopes of elements throughout the Periodic
  Table. He is also author of the actinide concept of heavy element
  electronic structure. In this connection, Dr. Seaborg
  demonstrated that the heavy elements form a "transition" series
  of actinide elements in a manner analogous to the rare-earth
  series of lanthanide elements. The concept demonstrated how the
  heavy elements fit into the Periodic Table and thus demonstrated
  their relationships to the other elements.<br>
  <br>
  The body of information assembled in Dr. Seaborg's laboratory has
  made it possible to predict the radioactive characteristics of
  many isotopes of elements still to be found. Under Dr. Seaborg's
  leadership, also, whole new bodies of methodology and
  instrumentation have been developed and have become a cornerstone
  of modern nuclear chemistry. Dr. Seaborg is the author of
  approximately 200 scientific papers, including a number of
  comprehensive reviews and compilations in scientific
  publications. He is also author and co-author of several books on
  chemistry and the elements.<br>
  <br>
  Honours include: in 1947 named as one of America's 10 outstanding
  young men by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce; 1947 recipient
  of the American Chemical Society's Award in Pure Chemistry; 1948
  John Ericsson Gold Medal by the American Society of Swedish
  Engineers; 1948 Nichols Medal of the New York Section of the
  American Chemical Society; 1953 John Scott Award and Medal of the
  City of Philadelphia; 1957 Perkin Medal of the American Section
  of the Society of Chemical Industry; 1959 Atomic Energy
  Commission's Enrico Fermi Award for his outstanding work in the
  field of nuclear chemistry and for his leadership in scientific
  and educational affairs; in 1962, named Swedish American of the
  Year by Vasa Order of America, Stockholm; 1963 Franklin Medal of
  the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Seaborg is an Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Society of
  London and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of
  the American Institute of Chemists, the New York Academy of
  Sciences, the California Academy of Sciences, the American
  Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement
  of Science. He is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences,
  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society of
  Arts of England, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering
  Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Honorary degrees awarded to Dr. Seaborg include Doctor of Science
  degrees from the University of Denver, 1951; Gustavus Adolphus
  College, 1954; Northwestern University, 1954; University of Notre
  Dame, 1961; Ohio State University, 1961; Florida State
  University, 1961; University of Maryland, 1961; Temple University,
  1962; Tulane University, 1962; Drexel Institute of Technology,
  1962; Georgetown University, 1962; University of the State
  of New York, 1962; Mundelein College, 1963; and Trinity College,
  1963; the degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of
  Michigan, 1958; and University of Massachusetts, 1963; the degree
  of Doctor of Humane Letters from Northern Michigan College, 1962;
  the degree of Doctor of Public Service from George Washington
  University, 1962; and the degree of Doctor of Public
  Administration from the University of Puget Sound, 1963.<br>
  <br>
  In 1942, Dr. Seaborg married Helen L. Griggs, then secretary to
  the late Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence (Nobel Laureate for Physics
  1939). They have six children: Peter (b. 1946), Lynne (b. 1947),
  David (b. 1949), Stephen (b. 1951), John Eric (b. 1954), and
  Dianne (b. 1959). His chief hobby is golf, but he also follows
  other sports with interest. From 1953-1958 he served as the
  University of California (Berkeley) Faculty Athletic
  Representative.</p>
