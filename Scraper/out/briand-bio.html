  <h1>Aristide Briand - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="briand.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Aristide
  Briand</b> (March 28, 1862-March 7, 1932), while at the height of
  his influence within the League of Nations, attended a dinner in
  Geneva where the guests were given menu cards on which was
  printed a cartoon depicting the statesmen of the world smashing a
  statue of Mars while Briand, alone, talked to the god of war
  trying to convince him to commit suicide<sup><a href=
  "#not_1">1</a></sup>. The cartoon caught not only Briand's main
  objective in public life - the elimination of war in
  international relations - but also his method: his penchant for
  personal diplomacy, his renowned persuasiveness, and his habit of
  attacking the heart of a problem rather than its symbols or
  symptoms.<br>
  <br>
  Born in Brittany, Briand was endowed with a heritage containing
  something of the peasant, something of the aristocrat, and a good
  deal of the Breton. His father, a prosperous innkeeper, sent him
  to school in Saint-Nazaire and then to the Nantes Lyc&eacute;e.
  There he was warmly befriended by Jules Verne, then rising to
  fame as a novelist and inventor. In <i>A Long Vacation</i>, a
  novel for youngsters, Verne describes a thirteen-year-old boy
  named &laquo;&raquo; Briant, he says, was audacious, quick at
  repartee, a good chap, somewhat untidy, &laquo; intelligent but so
  unwilling to waste good time studying that he was usually in the
  last quarter of his form. Occasionally he would spurt into a
  period of concentrated work, and then his quick understanding and
  remarkable memory helped him outstrip the
  rest.&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_2">2</a></sup>. Throughout his life
  Briand read little but listened intently, never prepared a speech
  but was, by common acknowledgment, the leading French orator of
  his generation; he understood everything, so it was said, but
  knew nothing.<br>
  <br>
  Although Briand studied law and established a practice, he
  preferred the profession of journalism to that of law. He wrote
  for <i>Le Peuple, La Lanterne, La Petite R&eacute;publique</i>, and
  collaborated with Jean Jaur&egrave;s in founding
  <i>L'Humanit&eacute;</i>, a socialist paper. A supporter of the
  labor-union movement, Briand emerged as a leader in the French
  Socialist Party after a speech at a congress of workingmen at
  Nantes in 1894. He found his true calling in politics, however,
  when, at the age of forty, he was elected to the Chamber of
  Deputies in 1902. In the next thirty years he was premier of
  France and a cabinet minister innumerable times<sup><a href=
  "#not_3">3</a></sup>.<br>
  <br>
  He achieved recognition almost immediately as the moving force of
  the commission that prepared the law separating church and state.
  He guided the legislation through the Chamber and in 1906 was
  appointed to administer the law itself as minister of public
  instruction and worship in Sarrien's cabinet. He was retained in
  this post when Clemenceau formed a government later in that year,
  was given the justice portfolio in Clemenceau's next government,
  and in 1909 became premier for the first time.<br>
  <br>
  Briand tended to be a political loner. In 1906 when he joined
  Sarrien's &laquo;&raquo; government, he was expelled from the
  Socialist Party. As premier he broke the railway workers' strike
  in 1910 by the novel expedient of mobilizing the railway workers
  who were still subject to military service. Since he never formed
  a political party, he survived because of his power of
  imagination, his mastery of procedure, his talent in oratory, and
  his understanding of people, especially of the common man.<br>
  <br>
  Briand, the enemy of war, was forced by the irony of events to
  lead his nation during World War I for eighteen critical months
  from October, 1915, to March, 1917. He devised and, despite
  opposition from the French general staff, resolutely supported a
  plan, ultimately a successful military venture, to strike Turkey,
  Bulgaria, and Austria through Greece; he strengthened the French
  high command; he helped to obtain a new ally in Italy.<br>
  <br>
  Briand was not a member of the Clemenceau government which
  conducted the negotiations for France at Versailles after the
  war. When he resumed as premier in January of 1921, retaining for
  himself the portfolio for foreign affairs, he tried to obtain a
  settlement of the reparations issue; represented France at the
  Washington Arms Conference; and negotiated a security pact with
  Lloyd George at Cannes in 1922, resigning when he failed to
  obtain its ratification.<br>
  <br>
  Recalled to the foreign ministry by Painlev&eacute; in 1925, Briand
  now entered upon five and a half years of highly successful
  diplomacy. The first success was at Locarno. Briand seized upon
  <a href="index.html">Stresemann</a>'s offer of a pact of mutual
  guarantee and nonaggression, showed <a href=
  "../1925/index.html">Austen Chamberlain</a> how this proposal
  would fit into his concept of regional, collective security
  pacts, and during the conference itself, established the
  atmosphere of informal amiability that eventually brought
  understanding. On October 16, 1925, Briand, as foreign minister,
  initialled and on December 1, as premier, signed the Locarno
  Pact, which included various treaties and guarantees: four
  arbitration treaties between Germany on the one hand and France,
  Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia on the other; two treaties
  between France on the one hand and Poland and Czechoslovakia on
  the other; Germany's western boundaries were guaranteed, the
  Rhineland was to be demilitarized, war was renounced except in
  extraordinary circumstances, and Germany was to join the League
  of Nations. Locarno embodied the Briand spirit - the humanization
  of politics.<br>
  <br>
  With Locarno as a model, Briand sought to extend the arbitration
  concept to the United States, proposing in 1927 that France and
  the United States join in renouncing war as &laquo; instrument of
  national policy&raquo; <a href="../1929/index.html">Frank B.
  Kellogg</a> countered with the suggestion of a multilateral
  rather than a bilateral treaty, and on August 27, 1928, at the
  Quai d'Orsay, fifteen nations signed the Pact of Paris, or
  Kellogg-Briand Pact, for the renunciation of war. In the next
  year Kellogg joined Briand in the ranks of Nobel Peace Prize
  laureates.<br>
  <br>
  The last major proposal Briand offered to the world was his
  sweeping concept of a European Union outlined in a memorandum to
  twenty-six nations in May, 1930. In September the proposal was
  presented to the League of Nations, but when Briand was not
  reappointed to the foreign ministry after Premier Laval's
  resignation in January, 1932, the proposal languished.<br>
  <br>
  On May 13, 1931, Briand lost his bid for the presidency of
  France, but with his vital resiliency and equable temperament, he
  did not lose a day at his office in Quai d'Orsay.<br>
  <br>
  Briand occupied the French foreign office longer than any
  diplomat since Talleyrand. A moral force in post-World War I
  politics, he sought to substitute trust for suspicion, law for
  international disorder, mankind's betterment for human
  destruction. Yet he tempered his ideals with a Gallic sense of
  reality; he would, for example, hedge an idealistic conception
  with precautions in case it should fail.<br>
  <br>
  Briand died quite unexpectedly on March 7, 1932; he was buried at
  Cocherel, his country retreat.</p>
