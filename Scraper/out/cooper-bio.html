  <h1>Leon N. Cooper - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cooper.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Leon Cooper</b> was born in 1930 in
  New York where he attended Columbia University (A.B. 1951; A.M. 1953;
  Ph.D. 1954). He became a member of the Institute for Advanced
  Study (1954-55) after which he was a research associate of
  Illinois (1955-57) and later an assistant professor at the
  Ohio State
  University (1957-58). Professor Cooper joined Brown University in
  1958 where he became Henry Ledyard Goddard University Professor
  (1966-74) and where he is presently the Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
  Professor of Science (1974-).<br>
  <br>
  Professor Cooper is Director of Brown University's Center for
  Neural Science. This Center was founded in 1973 to study animal
  nervous systems and the human brain. Professor Cooper served as
  the first director with an interdisciplinary staff drawn from the
  Departments of Applied Mathematics, Biomedical Sciences,
  Linguistics and Physics. Today, Cooper, with members of the Brown
  Faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students with
  interests in the neural and cognitive sciences, is working
  towards an understanding of memory and other brain functions, and
  thus formulating a scientific model of how the human mind
  works.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Cooper has received many forms of recognition for his
  work in 1972, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics (with J.
  Bardeen and J.R. Schrieffer) for his studies on the theory of
  superconductivity completed while still in his 20s. In 1968, he
  was awarded the Comstock Prize (with J.R. Schrieffer) of the
  National Academy of
  Sciences. The Award of Excellence, Graduate Faculties Alumni
  of Columbia University and Descartes Medal, Academie de Paris,
  Universit&eacute; Rene Descartes were conferred on Professor Cooper
  in the mid 1970s. In 1985, Professor Cooper received the John Jay
  Award of Columbia College. He holds seven honorary
  doctorates.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Cooper has been an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, 1954-55,
  Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellow, 1959-66 and John
  Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow, 1965-66. He is a
  fellow of the American Physical Society and American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences; Sponsor, Federation of American Scientists;
  member of American Philosophical Society, National Academy of
  Sciences, Society of Neuroscience, American Association for the
  Advancement of Science, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. Professor
  Cooper is also on the Governing Board and Executive Committee of
  the International Neural Network Society and a member of the
  Defense Science Board.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Cooper is Co-founder and Co-chairman of Nestor, Inc.,
  an industry leader in applying neural-network systems to
  commercial and military applications. Nestor's adaptive
  pattern-recognition and risk-assessment systems simulated in
  small conventional computers <i>learn by example</i> to
  accurately classify complex patterns such as targets in sonar,
  radar or imaging systems, to emulate human decisions in such
  applications as mortgage origination and to assess risks.</p>
