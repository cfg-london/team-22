  <h1>George A. Olah - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="olah.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May
  22, 1927 the son of Julius Olah and Magda Krasznai. My father was
  a lawyer and to my best knowledge nobody in my family before had
  interest in science. I grew up between the two world wars and
  received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class
  children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its
  roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. I attended a
  Gymnasium (a combination of junior and senior high school) at one
  of the best schools in Budapest run by the Piarist Fathers, a
  Roman Catholic order. A strict and demanding curriculum heavily
  emphasizing the humanities included 8 years of Latin, with German
  and French as other obligatory languages. Although we had an
  outstanding science teacher who later became a professor of
  physics in the University of Budapest I can not recollect any
  particular interest in chemistry during my school years. My main
  interest was in the humanities, particularly history, literature,
  etc. I was (and still am) and avid reader and believe that
  getting attached too early to a specific field frequently
  shortchanges a balanced broad education. Although reading the
  classics in Latin in school may be not as fulfilling as it would
  be at a more mature age, few scientists can afford the time for
  such diversion later in life.<br>
  <br>
  After graduating from high school and having survived the ravages
  of war in Budapest and realizing the difficulties facing life in
  a small and war torn country, I started to study chemistry upon
  entering university, being attracted by the wide diversity it
  offered.<br>
  <br>
  Classes at the Technical University of Budapest were relatively
  small. We probably started with a class of 70 or 80, whose
  numbers were rapidly pared down during the first year to maybe
  half by rather demanding "do or die" oral examinations, where the
  ones who failed could not continue. This was a rather cruel
  process, because laboratory facilities were so limited that only
  few could be accommodated. At the same time the laboratory
  training was thorough. For example, in the organic laboratory we
  did some 40 Gatterman preparations. It certainly gave a solid
  foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Organic chemistry particularly intrigued me and I was fortunate
  later to become a research assistant to Professor Geza Zemplen,
  the senior professor of organic chemistry in Hungary, who himself
  was a student of <a href="../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a> in
  Berlin. He established in Hungary a reputable school in organic
  chemistry. As Fischer, he too expected his students to pay their
  own way and even paying for the privilege to work in his
  laboratory. Becoming an assistant to him although meant no
  remuneration but also no fee. Zemplen had a formidable
  reputation, and working for him was quite an experience. He also
  liked partying and these remarkable events in neighboring pubs
  lasted frequently for days. Certainly one's stamina developed
  through these experiences.<br>
  <br>
  Zemplen was a carbohydrate chemist, much interested in
  glycosides. Early in our association it became clear that my
  ideas and interest were not always closely matching his. When I
  suggested that fluorine containing carbohydrates may be of
  interest in coupling reactions, his reaction was not unexpectedly
  very negative. To try to pursue fluorine chemistry in post-war
  Hungary was indeed far fetched. Eventually, however, he gave in.
  Even basic chemicals needed for the work, such as HF,
  FSO<sub>3</sub>H or BF<sub>3</sub> were non-existent and I made
  them myself, with enthusiastic help by some of my early
  associates (A. Pavlath, S. Kuhn). Laboratory space, particularly
  hoods (the kind exhausted only by draft caused by a gas burner
  causing warm air to raise and take some of the obnoxious fumes
  through a chimney) was very scarce and even by the time I became
  an assistant professor it was not welcome to "pollute" more
  important conventional work. However, the Institute which was on
  the second floor of the chemistry building, had in the back an
  open balcony, used to store chemicals. In one of his unexpected
  gestures Zemplen agreed that I can have the use of this balcony.
  With some effort we enclosed it, installed two old hoods and were
  soon in business in what was referred to as the "balcony
  laboratory". I am not sure that Zemplen even set foot in it. We
  enjoyed, however, our new quaters and the implicit understanding
  that our fluorine chemistry and related study of Friedel-Crafts
  reactions and their intermediates was now officially
  tolerated.<br>
  <br>
  Some of my publications in the early 50s from Hungary caught the
  eye of Hans Meerwein. It is still a mystery to me how he came to
  read them in a Hungrian journal, although there also was a
  foreign language edition of the Hungarian Chimica Acta. Anyhow, I
  received an encouraging letter from him and we followed up
  correspondence (not easy at a time in completely isolated
  Hungary). He must have sympathized with my difficulties because
  one day through his efforts I received a cylinder of boron
  trifluoride. What a precious gift it was!<br>
  <br>
  The Hungarian educational system after the Communist takeover was
  realigned according to the Soviet example. University research
  was deemphasized and research institutes were established under
  the auspices of the Academy of Sciences. I was invited to join
  the newly established Central Chemical Research Institute of the
  Hungarian Academy of
  Sciences in 1954 and was able to establish a small research
  group in organic chemistry, housed in temporary laboratories of
  an industrial research institute. With my group, which by now
  also included my wife, we were able to expand our work and made
  the best of our possibilities. In October 1956 Hungary revolted
  against the Soviet rule, but the uprising was soon put down by
  drastic measures and much loss of life. Budapest was again
  devastated and the future looked rather dim. In November-December
  1956 some 200,000 Hungarians, mostly of the younger generation
  fled their country. With my family and much of my research group
  we also decided to follow this path and look for a new life in
  the West.<br>
  <br>
  I married in 1949 Judith Lengyel, the best thing ever to happen
  to me in my life. We knew each other from our early youth and are
  happily married now for more than 45 years. Judy worked initially
  as a technical secretary at the Technical University. After we
  were married she enrolled to study chemistry. She probably
  rightly recalls that I was entirely responsible for this step and
  she only agreed to get along with her single minded husband who
  seemed to believe that there is little in life outside chemistry.
  From my point of view for husband and wife to closely understand
  each other's work and may even work together was most desirable.
  Our older son George John was born in Budapest in 1954. After we
  fled Hungary in early December of 1956, we reached late in
  December London where my wife had relatives. We subsequently
  moved on in the spring of 1957 to Canada, where my mother-in-law
  lived in Montreal after the war. During our stay in London for
  the first time I was able to establish personal contact with some
  of the organic chemists, whose work I knew and admired from the
  literature. I found them most gracious and helpful. In particular
  Christopher Ingold and <a href="../1957/index.html">Alexander
  Todd</a> extended efforts on behalf of a young, practically
  unknown Hungarian refugee chemist in a way which I never forget
  and for which I am always grateful.<br>
  <br>
  Dow Chemical, with its home base at Midland, Michigan was
  establishing at the time a small exploratory research laboratory
  100 miles across the border in Sarnia, Ontario where its Canadian
  Subsidaries major operations were located. I was offered a
  position to join this new laboratory and they also hired two of
  my original Hungarian Collaborators, including Steven Kuhn. We
  moved to Sarnia in late May of 1957. As our moving expenses where
  paid we checked in two cardboard boxes containing all of our
  worldly possessions unto the train from Montreal and started our
  new life. Our younger son Ronald Peter was born in Sarnia in
  1959. There was no possibility for Judy to continue her career at
  the time. Sacrificing her own career she devoted herself to bring
  up our children. She rejoined in our research only a decade later
  in Cleveland after I returned to academic life.<br>
  <br>
  The Sarnia years at Dow were productive. It was during this
  period in the late 50's that my initial work on stable
  carbocations was started. Dow was and is a major user of
  carbocationic chemistry, such as the Friedel-Crafts type
  manufacture of etylbenzene for styrene production. My work thus
  also had practical significance and helped to improve some
  industrial processes. In return I was treated well and given
  substantial freedom to pursue my own ideas. Eventually I was
  promoted to company Scientist, the highest research position
  without administrative responsibility.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of '64 I transferred to Dow's Eastern Research
  Laboratories in Framingham, Massachusetts established under Fred
  McLarrerty's directorship. The laboratory was subsequently moved
  to Wayland, just outside Boston. In the summer of 1965 I was
  invited to join Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and
  returned to academic life as professor with the added
  responsibility of becoming also Department Chairman.<br>
  <br>
  My Cleveland years were both scientifically and personally most
  rewarding. My wife Judy was able to rejoin me in our research and
  my research group grew rapidly. The chemistry departments of
  Western Reserve University and neighboring Case Institute of
  Technology were practically adjacent, separated only by a parking
  lot. It became obvious that it would make sense to join the two
  into a single, stronger department. We achieved this by 1967 with
  surprisingly little friction and I was asked to serve as the
  Chair of the joint department till things settled down. It was in
  1969 that I was able to give up my administrative responsibility.
  As I worked hard my research never suffered during this period
  and as a matter of fact these were probably some of my most
  productive years.<br>
  <br>
  After 12 years in Cleveland it was time again to move on. Our
  older son George was approaching the end of his college years and
  our younger son Ron who was finishing high school set his mind to
  go to Stanford. He convinced us that it should be nice for
  the whole family to resettle in California. Coincidentally, in
  the fall of 1976 Sid Benson, an old friend called me to find out
  whether I would be interested to join him at the University of Southern
  California in Los Angeles. After some visits to LA the
  challenge of trying to build up chemistry in a dynamic university
  and the attractiveness of life in Southern California convinced
  us to move. We fell in love with California and we still are. As
  USC had limited chemistry facilities, it was offered to establish
  a research institute in the broad area of hydrocarbon research
  and provide it with its own building and facilities. We moved in
  May of 1977. Some 15 members of my research group joined the move
  West. By arrangements worked out we were able to take with us
  most of the laboratory equipment, chemicals, etc. Two weeks after
  our arrival with some large moving vans we were back doing
  chemistry in temporary quarters, while our research institute was
  constructed. The Institute was established at USC with generous
  support by Mr. &amp; Mrs. D.P. Loker, friends and great
  supporters of the University. The Institute was subsequently
  named after them. Don Loker passed away some years ago, but
  Katherine still chairs the Institute's board. Through her and
  other friends' generosity a wonderful new addition to our
  Institute is just completed doubling our space.<br>
  <br>
  As rewarding as the Nobel Prize is personally to any scientist, I
  feel it is also recognition of all my past and present students
  and associates (by now numbering close to 200), who contributed
  over the years so much through their dedicated hard work to our
  joint effort. It also recognizes fundamental contributions by
  many colleagues and friends from around the world to a field of
  chemistry, which is not frequently highlighted or recognized.</p>
