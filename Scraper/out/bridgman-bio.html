  <h1>Percy W. Bridgman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bridgman.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Percy Williams Bridgman</b>
  was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 21st, 1882. He
  received his early education in public schools in the nearby city
  of Newton until 1900 when he entered Harvard University.
  He graduated A.B. in 1904, A.M. in 1905 and was awarded his Ph.D.
  (Physics) in 1908 when he joined the Faculty of the University.
  Bridgman was successively appointed Instructor (1910), Assistant
  Professor (1919), before becoming Hollis Professor of Mathematics
  and Natural Philosophy in 1926. He was appointed Higgins
  University Professor in 1950.<br>
  <br>
  His researches concerning the effects of high pressures on
  materials and their thermodynamic behaviour commenced in 1905 and
  have continued throughout his career. He has carried out
  extensive investigations on the properties of matter at pressures
  up to 100,000 atmosphere including a study of the
  compressibility, electric and thermal conductivity, tensile
  strength and viscosity of more than 100 different compounds. He
  developed a method of packing which eliminated leak, and later
  introduced various methods of external support to pressure
  vessels as higher pressures were demanded. Bridgman has also
  contributed to crystallography, where he devised a method of
  growing single crystals; to the problems of electrical conduction
  in metals, where he discovered internal Peltier heat - a new
  electrical effect; and to the philosophy of modern physics. In
  the latter field, he is a strong supporter of the operational
  viewpoint, considering it meaningless to interpret physical
  concepts except as they are capable of observation.<br>
  <br>
  Prof. Bridgman has contributed many papers to leading scientific
  journals and he is the author of <i>Dimensional Analysis</i>
  (1922), <i>The Logic of Modern Physics</i> (1927), <i>The Physics
  of High Pressure</i> (1931), <i>The Thermodynamics of Electrical
  Phenomena in Metals</i> (1934), <i>The Nature of Physical
  Theory</i> (1936), <i>The Intelligent Individual and Society</i>
  (1938), <i>The Nature of Thermodynamics</i> (1941), and, more
  recently, <i>Refections of a Physicist</i>.<br>
  <br>
  He has received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Stevens
  Institute (1934), Harvard (1939), Brooklyn Polytechnic (1941),
  Princeton
  (1950), Paris (1950), and Yale (1951). He has received the Rumford Medal
  (American Academy
  of Arts and Sciences), the Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute), the
  Roozeboom Medal (Royal Academy of Sciences of the Netherlands),
  the Comstock Prize (National Academy of Sciences), and the New York
  Award of the Research Corporation. He was a member of the
  American Physical Society (President, 1942), the American Association for
  the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and
  Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the National
  Academy of Sciences. He was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society
  and Honorary Fellow of the Physical Society (London).<br>
  <br>
  Bridgman married Olive Ware in 1912. Their daughter, Jane, was
  born in I9I4, and their son, Robert Ware, in 1915.<br>

  Prof. Bridgman died in 1961.</p>
