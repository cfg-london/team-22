  <h1>Frits Zernike - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="zernike.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Frits Zernike</b> was born in
  Amsterdam, 16th July 1888, as the second son in a family of six
  children. His father, Carl Frederick August Zernike, was teacher
  in mathematics and head of a primary school in Amsterdam, and was
  a highly gifted man having interests in many branches of science;
  he compiled numerous elementary books in a series of subjects,
  and had also articles on pedagogy to his credit. His mother,
  Antje Dieperink, was also a teacher of mathematics. One of his
  brothers also became a professor of physics, one of his sisters,
  married to the well-known painter Jan Mankes, was the first woman
  ordained in the Dutch Protestant Church, another sister is one of
  The Netherlands' foremost literary figures.<br>
  <br>
  Frits inherited his passion for physics from his father; as a boy
  he already possessed an arsenal of pots, crucibles, tubes, which
  he scraped together with his own pocket money, or received as
  gifts from understanding manufacturers. At the secondary school
  he excelled in the scientific subjects, and neglected topics such
  as history and languages, including Greek and Latin, for which
  later on he was obliged to pass a State matriculation test in
  order to be fully admitted to the University.<br>
  <br>
  During these school years he devoted all his spare time to his
  endless experiments, entering also the realms of colour
  photography. His limited financial means forced him to synthesize
  his own ether which he required for his photographic experiments.
  Other results of his ingenuity were a photographic camera and a
  miniature astronomical observatory equipped with the clockwork of
  an old record player, which enabled him to take pictures of a
  comet. Together with his father and mother he also indulged in
  solving arduous mathematical problems.<br>
  <br>
  He entered the University of Amsterdam in 1905, studying chemistry,
  with physics and mathematics as minor subjects. His early
  interest in mathematics appears from a prize essay on
  probabilities for which he obtained a gold medal of the University of Groningen
  in 1908. A more elaborate work on critical opalescence was
  similarly rewarded in 1912 by the Dutch Society of Sciences at
  Haarlem, which had as jury distinguished scientists of those
  days: Lorentz, Van der Waals, and Haga. When asked to choose
  between a gold medal and an amount of money, he wrote back that
  he preferred the money, since he had already enjoyed the
  privilege of receiving a gold medal. The prize essay later formed
  the basis of his doctor's thesis (1915). In its theoretical part
  he applied Gibbs' statistical mechanics and this formed the
  starting-point of years of fruitful collaboration with L.S.
  Ornstein, who worked in the same field.<br>
  <br>
  In 1913 Kapteyn, the famous Professor of Astronomy at Groningen
  University, invited him to be his assistant. In 1915 he got his
  first university teaching post, not in chemistry, not in
  astronomy, but as successor of Ornstein as lecturer in
  mathematical physics at Groningen, where he was made a full
  professor in 1920. His papers on statistics include a paper with
  J.A. Prins, introducing the <i>g</i>-function for the correlation
  of the position of two molecules in a liquid, an extensive
  article in the Geiger and Scheel handbook, and an approximation
  method in the order-disorder problem (1940). Of his experimental
  work, the sensitive galvanometer, manufactured since 1923 by Kipp
  and Sons, Delft, is well known. From 1930 on he turned to optics,
  developed phase contrast, wrote on imaging errors of the concave
  grating and on partial coherence. With the collaboration of his
  pupils he solved the problem of the influence of lens aberrations
  on the diffraction pattern at a focus (1938-1948)<br>
  <br>
  It is interesting to know that his great discovery of the
  phase-contrast phenomenon, which he discovered one evening in
  1930 in his totally blackpainted optical laboratory, did not
  immediately receive the attention it deserved. The world-famous
  Zeiss factories at Jena completely underestimated the value of
  his phase-contrast microscope. It was not until the German
  <i>Wehrmacht</i> took stock of all inventions which might serve
  in the war that at last (in 1941) the first phase-contrast
  microscopes were manufactured. The grotesque situation thus arose
  that the German war machinery helped to develop on an industrial
  scale Professor Zernike's long-neglected invention while its
  inventor, like his fellow-countrymen, suffered under the
  oppression by the same German powers during the occupation of the
  Netherlands. After the war, other firms also took up the
  production of many thousands of phase-contrast microscopes,
  thereby providing the service to science, and in particular to
  medicine, which should have been effectuated some twenty years
  earlier.<br>
  <br>
  Zernike's achievements were recognized by the Royal Microscopical
  Society; he was also awarded the Rumford Medal of the Royal
  Society (London) and an honorary doctorate in Medicine from the
  University of Amsterdam.<br>
  <br>
  Zernike married twice. His first wife, Dora van Bommel van
  Vloten, died in 1945; they had one son. In 1954 he married Mrs.
  L. Koperberg-Baanders. After his retirement from Groningen
  University they moved to Naarden, a town in the countryside near
  Amsterdam.</p>
