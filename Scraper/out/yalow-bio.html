  <h1>Rosalyn Yalow - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="yalow.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born on
  July 19, 1921 in New York City and have always resided and worked
  there except for 3 1/2 years when I was a graduate student at the
  University of
  Illinois.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the earliest memories I have are of being a stubborn,
  determined child. Through the years my mother has told me that it
  was fortunate that I chose to do acceptable things, for if I had
  chosen otherwise no one could have deflected me from my
  path.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, n&eacute;e Clara Zipper, came to America from Germany at
  the age of four. My father, Simon Sussman, was born on the Lower
  East Side of New York, the Melting Pot for Eastern European
  immigrants. Neither had the advantage of a high school education
  but there was never a doubt that their two children would make it
  through college. I was an early reader, reading even before
  kindergarten, and since we did not have books in my home, my
  older brother, Alexander, was responsible for our trip every week
  to the Public Library to exchange books already read for new ones
  to be read.<br>
  <br>
  By seventh grade I was committed to mathematics. A great
  chemistry teacher at Walton High School, Mr. Mondzak, excited my
  interest in chemistry, but when I went to Hunter, the college for
  women in New York City's college system (now the City University of New
  York), my interest was diverted to physics especially by
  Professors Herbert N. Otis and Duane Roller. In the late '30's
  when I was in college, physics, and in particular nuclear
  physics, was the most exciting field in the world. It seemed as
  if every major experiment brought a Nobel Prize. Eve Curie had
  just published the biography of her mother, Madame <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Marie Curie</a>, which
  should be a must on the reading list of every young aspiring
  female scientist. As a Junior at college, I was hanging from the
  rafters in Room 301 of Pupin Laboratories (a physics lecture room
  at Columbia
  University) when <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1953/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a> gave a
  colloquium in January 1939 on the newly discovered nuclear
  fission - which has resulted not only in the terror and threat of
  nuclear warfare but also in the ready availability of
  radioisotopes for medical investigation and in hosts of other
  peaceful applications.<br>
  <br>
  I was excited about achieving a career in physics. My family,
  being more practical, thought the most desirable position for me
  would be as an elementary school teacher. Furthermore, it seemed
  most unlikely that good graduate schools would accept and offer
  financial support for a woman in physics. However my physics
  professors encouraged me and I persisted. As I entered the last
  half of my senior year at Hunter in September 1940 I was offered
  what seemed like a good opportunity. Since I could type, another
  of my physics professors, Dr. Jerrold Zacharias, now at Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology, obtained a part time position for me as a
  secretary to Dr. Rudolf Schoenheimer, a leading biochemist at
  Columbia University's College of Physicians and
  Surgeons (P&amp;S). This position was supposed to provide an
  entr&eacute;e for me into graduate courses, via the backdoor, but I
  had to agree to take stenography. On my graduation from Hunter in
  January 1941, I went to business school. Fortunately I did not
  stay there too long. In mid-February I received an offer of a
  teaching assistantship in physics at the University of Illinois,
  the most prestigious of the schools to which I had applied. It
  was an achievement beyond belief. I tore up my stenography books,
  stayed on as secretary until June and during the summer took two
  tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at
  New York
  University.<br>
  <br>
  In September I went to Champaign-Urbana, the home of the
  University of Illinois. At the first meeting of the Faculty of
  the College of Engineering I discovered I was the only woman
  among its 400 members. The Dean of the Faculty congratulated me
  on my achievement and told me I was the first woman there since
  1917. It is evident that the draft of young men into the armed
  forces, even prior to American entry into the World War, had made
  possible my entrance into graduate school.<br>
  <br>
  On the first day of graduate school I met Aaron Yalow, who was
  also beginning graduate study in physics at Illinois and who in
  1943 was to become my husband. The first year was not easy. From
  junior high school through Hunter College, I had never had boys
  in my classes, except for a thermodynamics course which I took at
  City College at night and the two summer courses at NYU. Hunter
  had offered a physics major for the first time in September 1940
  when I was an upper senior. As a result my course work in physics
  had been minimal for a major - less than that of the other first
  year graduate students. Therefore at Illinois I sat in on two
  undergraduate courses without credit, took three graduate courses
  and was a half-time assistant teaching the freshman course in
  physics. Like nearly all first-year teaching assistants, I had
  never taught before - but unlike the others I also undertook to
  observe in the classroom of a young instructor with an excellent
  reputation so that I could learn how it should be done.<br>
  <br>
  It was a busy time. I was delighted to receive a straight A in
  two of the courses, an A in the lecture half of the course in
  Optics and an A- in its laboratory. The Chairman of the Physics
  Department, looking at this record, could only say "That A-
  confirms that women do not do well at laboratory work". But I was
  no longer a stubborn, determined child, but rather a stubborn,
  determined graduate student. The hard work and subtle
  discrimination were of no moment.<br>
  <br>
  Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 brought our country into the
  war. The Physics Department was becoming decimated by loss of
  junior and senior faculty to secret scientific work elsewhere.
  The campus was filled with young Army and Navy students sent to
  the campus by their respective Services for training. There was a
  heavy teaching load, graduate courses, an experimental thesis
  requiring long hours in the laboratory, marriage in 1943,
  war-time housekeeping with its shortages and rationing, and in
  January 1945 a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. My thesis director was
  Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, later to become Director of Brookhaven
  National Laboratories. Support and encouragement came from the
  Goldhabers. Dr. Gertrude Goldhaber, his wife, was a distinguished
  physicist in her own right, but with no University position
  because of nepotism rules. Since my research was in nuclear
  physics I became skilled in making and using apparatus for the
  measurement of radioactive substances. The war was continuing. I
  returned to New York without my husband in January 1945 since
  completion of his thesis was delayed and I accepted a position as
  assistant engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory, a
  research laboratory for ITT - the only woman engineer. When the
  research group in which I was working left New York in 1946, I
  returned to Hunter College to teach physics, not to women but to
  returning veterans in a preengineering program.<br>
  <br>
  My husband had come to New York in September 1945. We established
  our home in an apartment in Manhattan, then in a small house in
  the Bronx. It and a full-time teaching position at Hunter were
  hardly enough to occupy my time fully. By this time my husband
  was in Medical Physics at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx.
  Through him I met Dr. Edith Quimby, a leading medical physicist
  at P&amp;S. I volunteered to work in her laboratory to gain
  research experience in the medical applications of radioisotopes.
  She took me to see "The Chief", Dr. G. Failla, Dean of American
  medical physicists. After talking to me for a while, he picked up
  the phone, dialed, and I heard him say "Bernie, if you want to
  set up a radioisotope service, I have someone here you must
  hire." Dr. Bernard Roswit, Chief of the Radiotherapy Service at
  the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital and I appeared to have
  no choice; Dr. Failla had spoken.<br>
  <br>
  I joined the Bronx VA as a part time consultant in December 1947,
  keeping my position at Hunter until the Spring Semester of 1950.
  During those years while I was teaching full-time, I equipped and
  developed the Radioisotope Service and started research projects
  together with Dr. Roswit and other physicians in the hospital in
  a number of clinical fields. Though we started with nothing more
  than a janitor's closet and a small grant to Dr. Roswit from a
  veterans' group, eight publications in different areas of
  clinical investigation resulted from this early work. The VA
  wisely made a commitment to set up Radioisotope Services in
  several of its hospitals around the country because of its
  appreciation that this was a new field in which research had to
  proceed pari passu with clinical application. Our hospital
  Radioisotope Service was one of the first supported under this
  plan.<br>
  <br>
  In January 1950 I chose to leave teaching and join the VA full
  time. That Spring when he was completing his residency in
  internal medicine at the Bronx VA, Dr. Solomon A. Berson and I
  met and in July he joined our Service. Thus was to begin a 22
  year partnership that lasted until the day of his death, April
  11, 1972. Unfortunately, he did not survive to share the Nobel
  Prize with me as he would have had he lived.<br>
  <br>
  During that period Aaron and I had two children, Benjamin and
  Elanna. We bought a house in Riverdale, less than a mile from the
  VA. With sleep-in help until our son was 9, and part-time help of
  decreasing time thereafter, we managed to keep the house going
  and took pride in our growing children: Benjamin, now 25, is a
  systems programmer at the CUNY Computer Center; Elanna, now 23,
  is a third year doctoral candidate in Educational Psychology at
  Stanford University. She has just married Daniel Webb and is with
  us on part of her honeymoon.<br>
  <br>
  But to return to the scientific aspects of my life, after Sol
  joined our Service, I soon gave up collaborative work with others
  and concentrated on our joint researches. Our first
  investigations together were in the application of radioisotopes
  in blood volume determination, clinical diagnosis of thyroid
  diseases and the kinetics of iodine metabolism. We extended these
  techniques to studies of the distribution of globin, which had
  been suggested for use as a plasma expander, and of serum
  proteins. It seemed obvious to apply these methods to smaller
  peptides, i.e., the hormones. Insulin was the hormone most
  readily available in a highly purified form. We soon deduced from
  the retarded rate of disappearance of insulin from the
  circulation of insulin-treated subjects that all these patients
  develop antibodies to the animal insulins. In studying the
  reaction of insulin with antibodies, we appreciated that we had
  developed a tool with the potential for measuring circulating
  insulin. It took several more years of work to transform the
  concept into the reality of its practical application to the
  measurement of plasma insulin in man. Thus the era of
  radioimmunoassay (RIA) can be said to have begun in 1959. RIA is
  now used to measure hundreds of substances of biologic interest
  in thousands of laboratories in our country and abroad, even in
  scientifically less advanced lands.<br>
  <br>
  It is of interest from this brief history that neither Sol nor I
  had the advantage of specialized post-doctoral training in
  investigation. We learned from and disciplined each other and
  were probably each other's severest critic. I had the good
  fortune to learn medicine not in a formal medical school but
  directly from a master of physiology, anatomy and clinical
  medicine. This training was essential if I were to use my
  scientific background in areas in which I had no formal
  education.<br>
  <br>
  Sol's leaving the laboratory in 1968 to assume the Chairmanship
  of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of
  Medicine and his premature death 4 years later were a great
  loss to investigative medicine. At my request the laboratory
  which we shared has been designated the Solomon A. Berson
  Research Laboratory so that his name will continue to be on my
  papers as long as I publish and so that his contributions to our
  Service will be memoralized. At present my major collaborator is
  a young, talented physician, Dr. Eugene Straus, who joined me in
  1972, first as a Fellow, then as Research Associate and now as
  Clinical Investigator.<br>
  <br>
  Through the years Sol and I together, and now I alone, have
  enjoyed the time spent with the "professional children", the
  young investigators who trained in our laboratory and who are now
  scattered throughout the world, many of whom are now leaders in
  clinical and investigative medicine. In the training in my
  laboratory the emphasis has been not only in learning our
  research techniques but also our philosophy. I have never aspired
  to have, nor do I now want, a laboratory or a cadre of
  investigators-in-training which is more extensive than I can
  personally interact with and supervise.<br>
  <br>
  The laboratory since its inception has been supported solely by
  the Veterans Administration Medical Research Program and I
  acknowledge with gratitude its confidence in me and its
  encouragement through the years. My hospital is now affiliated
  with The Mount Sinai School of Medicine where I hold the title of
  Distinguished Service Professor. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Honors which I have
  received include, among others: Albert Lasker Basic Medical
  Research Award; A. Cressy Morrison Award in Natural Sciences of
  the N.Y. Academy of Sciences; Scientific Achievement Award of the
  American Medical Association; Koch Award of the Endocrine
  Society; Gairdner Foundation International Award; American
  College of Physicians Award for distinguished contributions in
  science as related to medicine; Eli Lilly Award of the American
  Diabetes Association; First William S. Middleton Medical Research
  Award of the VA and five honorary doctorates.</p>
