<h2><br>Peace Policy in Our Time</h2>
<p><b>I.</b></p>

  <p>The Nobel Peace Prize for 1971 has been
  awarded to a man still active in political life; therefore, it
  can only have been in appreciation of his continuing endeavors,
  not of his past achievements.</p>

  <p>Yesterday I expressed my gratitude; today I
  wish to speak about peace policy in our time: about my own
  experiences and, naturally, about what my own country can do, but
  also about what we in Europe, and from Europe, can do for the
  world. It is little enough, as our powerlessness in the face of
  the new war between India and Pakistan demonstrates.</p>

  <p>This is precisely the time for me to
  clearly emphasize my principles: War must not be a means to
  achieve political ends. Wars must be eliminated, not merely
  limited. No national interest can today be isolated from
  collective responsibility for peace. This fact must be recognized
  in all foreign relations. As a means of achieving European and
  worldwide security, therefore, foreign policy must aim to reduce
  tensions and promote communication beyond frontiers.</p>

  <p>Foreign Minister Walter Scheel and I are
  guided by the principle that it is not enough to pronounce
  peace-loving intentions but we must also endeavor actively to
  organize peace.</p>

  <p>We wage war - we maintain peace; our use of
  language shows the challenge of peace when we see it as a
  permanent task.</p>

  <p>How to prevent war is a question which is
  part of the European tradition - Europe has always had reason
  enough to ask it. The politician who in the daily conflict of
  interests tries to serve the cause of equitable peace draws his
  strength from the moral reserves that have been formed by
  generations before him. Consciously or not he is guided by
  them.</p>

  <p>Our ethical and social concepts have been
  shaped by two thousand years of Christianity. And this means
  that, in spite of many aberrations under the flag of <i>bellum
  justum</i>, "the just war", attempts have been made over and over
  again to achieve peace in this world, too.</p>

  <p>Our second source of strength is humanism and classical
  philosophy. Immanuel Kant postulated his idea of a constitutional
  confederation of states in words that pose a very distinct
  question to today's generations: Man, he said, will one day be
  faced with the choice of either un<span class=
  "normaltext">i</span>ting under a true law of nations or
  destroying with a few blows the civilization he has built up over
  thousands of years: then, necessity will compel him to do what he
  ought better to have done long ago of his own free
  reason.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>A third strong source is socialism with its
  aspiration to social justice at home and abroad. And with its
  insistence that moral laws should find application not only
  between individual citizens but among nations and states.</p>

  <p>Peace policy is a sober task. I, too, try
  with the means at my command to pave the way for the prevalence
  of reason in my own country and in the world: that reason which
  demands that we seek peace because the absence of peace has come
  to mean extreme lack of reason.</p>

  <p>War is no longer the <i>ultima ratio</i>
  but rather the <i>ultima irratio</i>. Even if this is still not a
  generally held view, I personally understand a policy for peace
  as a genuine <i>Realpolitik</i> of this epoch.</p>

  <p><i>Realpolitik,</i> grossly abused in
  Germany over a period of twelve years, proved to be an infernal
  chimera. Today we are in the process of finding a tolerable
  balance between ourselves and with the world. If the balance
  sheet of my political effectiveness were to say that I have
  helped to open up the way for a new sense of reality in Germany,
  then one of the greatest hopes of my life would have been
  fulfilled.</p>

  <p>I say here what I say in Germany: A good
  German cannot be a nationalist. A good German knows that he
  cannot refuse a European calling. Through Europe, Germany returns
  to itself and to the constructive forces of its history. Our
  Europe, born of the experience of suffering and failure, is the
  imperative mission of reason.</p>

  <p><b>II.</b></p>

  <p>Under the threat of mankind's
  self-destruction, co-existence has become a question of the very
  existence of man. Co-existence became not one of several
  acceptable possibilities but the only chance of survival.</p>

  <p>What is it that has characterized
  developments in Europe in the past 25 years? To begin with, an
  impressive phase of reconstruction, and secondly, continued
  tension. The East-West conflict - the root causes of which were
  for the most part not in the West - has bound up many forces.
  During this period I was deeply involved in Berlin, the
  intersection of East-West tension. And let me add that I always
  regarded my task there-particularly in the very "militant" years
  - as one also of helping to safeguard peace. It was then, and
  still is, my conviction that if the West had allowed itself to be
  driven out of my city, that would not only have spelt misfortune
  for the people directly concerned, not only great harm to the
  Federal Republic of Germany, Western Europe and the United
  States, but would most probably have had perilous consequences
  for peace. That was the case during Stalin's blockade of 1948, as
  it was when Khrushchev issued his ultimatum in 1958.<a href=
  "#note2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

  <p>I am not one of those people who maintain
  or even feel that they have always been right. My journey through
  life has always required me to ponder upon my own position. But I
  can say that ever since my youth I have been guided by those
  fundamental convictions that are held to lead to good
  neighbourliness - both at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>As Mayor of Berlin I experienced how
  critical situations influence our thinking. I knew, though, that
  steadfastness serves the cause of peace.</p>

  <p>A great deal has been written about the
  years of crisis 1961 and 1962.<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>
  Perhaps I may be allowed to add a few more comments on this
  period. The most striking aspect of the Berlin Wall was the
  absurd division of what had remained intact of the whole organism
  of a metropolis, with all the lamentable consequences for the
  people.</p>

  <p>There were also the international
  implications of this deep incision. The Western Powers
  unwaveringly stood by their aegis for <i>West</i> Berlin. But,
  willy-nilly, they accepted the fact that their counterpart held
  sole control over <i>East</i> Berlin. No Four-Power status did
  anything to alter the fact that the Wall had become the dividing
  line between the nuclear superpowers. And no one in a position of
  responsibility demanded that the Western Powers should use
  military force and risk a war to preserve their share of what
  originally was common responsibility.</p>

  <p>There is still another aspect - that of
  impotence disguised by verbalism: taking a stand on legal
  positions which cannot become a reality and planning
  counter-measures for contingencies that always differ from the
  one at hand. At critical times we were left to our own devices;
  the verbalists had nothing to offer.</p>

  <p>Passionate protests were justified and
  necessary, but they did not alter the situation. The Wall
  remained; we had to learn to live with it, and I had to call in
  the police to prevent young demonstrators from running to their
  ruin. The impediments on the access routes to Berlin remained.
  The gulf which divided Germany from L&uuml;beck to the
  Czechoslovakian border also remained and grew deeper. The game
  with trumps that are none, as Golo Mann<a href=
  "#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> put it, did not change anything. It was
  necessary to contemplate the political possibilities anew if the
  people were to be aided and peace made safer.</p>

  <p>The Cuban crisis, on a more dramatic scale
  and with even more at stake, showed the delimitation and the
  changing relations between the nuclear giants.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of October 1962, I visited
  John F. Kennedy. He spoke of the danger that would emanate from
  missile bases aimed at the United States. I was under the
  impression that the danger of miscalculation could not be ruled
  out; there were concentrations of troops around Berlin. When, on
  the evening of October 23rd, President Kennedy delivered his most
  serious speech on Cuba, he twice mentioned the connection with
  Berlin. I supported his view. As it turned out, everything in our
  part of the world remained peaceful. The Cuban crisis was
  overcome by a sense of responsibility and cool-headedness. This
  was a significant experience and a turning-point.</p>

  <p>A few weeks previously I had spoken at
  Harvard about co-existence. Judging by my experience in Berlin, I
  said that realistic self-confidence need not fear contact with
  the political and ideological antagonist. The uncertainty of the
  present time must not be permitted to make us uncertain, too.
  What was the point, I asked, of getting in touch with the other
  side without being prepared to speak? Speaking surely also meant
  negotiating and being open to compromise, not unilateral
  concessions. An active peace policy will remain for a long time
  to come the test of our intellectual and material
  vitality.<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><b>III.</b></p>

  <p>After staring into the abyss of a global
  war we found ourselves beset by problems of global dimensions:
  hunger, the population explosion, environmental hazards, and the
  dwindling of natural resources. Only those who accept or even
  look forward with pleasure to the end of the world can ignore
  problems of such magnitude.</p>

  <p>In our epoch the learned provide us with
  works that are outstanding for their expertise and deep
  sincerity. They are no longer merely concerned with the
  differences between ideologies and social systems. Their concern
  now is the future of man and whether he has any future at all.
  They are concerned with problems which extend beyond the borders
  of individual states and beyond continents. They make a science
  of politics, and this science is one in which the rich, the more
  advanced powers must jointly participate. It is one which no
  country can any longer pursue for itself.</p>

  <p>We need peace not only in the sense of the
  absence of violence; we need it as the basis for that redeeming
  cooperation I have spoken about. And in the same way that it
  presupposes peace, it can help to create peace, for where there
  is redeeming cooperation there is peace; and there mutual
  confidence will also gradually establish itself. My country is no
  longer a "great" power, nor can it be. But it is definitely an
  economic and scientific power, and I feel I can say that we are
  all prepared for such cooperation, at any time and at any place,
  however much Government and Opposition may otherwise be in
  dispute over this question.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned a few aspects of what
  today is called peace research. It is true that a new quality in
  international politics has been discernible for over ten years
  now. The Cold War with its sterile paradox of freezing frontiers
  without eliminating the risk of conflict did not point the way to
  a solution. So the powers concerned began to keep extreme risks
  within bounds and to reduce tensions. In Cuba and Berlin they
  learned how to keep conflicts under control. De Gaulle and Nixon
  set the course for cooperation rather than confrontation, and
  Brezhnev and Kosygin began in their own way to steer towards a
  new relationship with the West.<a href=
  "#note6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

  <p>On a small scale, my approach eight years
  ago as the Governing Mayor of Berlin was that small steps are
  better than no steps at all. When hundreds of thousands of
  people, after years of separation, were given passes to visit
  their relatives over Christmas, this, in a nutshell, was the
  application of the knowledge that there could be a new, only
  apparent, paradox - and that is improving the situation by
  recognizing it for what it is.</p>

  <p>From that time and the Harvard speech when
  I developed my concept of co-existence as a challenge, to my
  activity as Foreign Minister, the government declaration of more
  than two years ago, and the treaties of Moscow, Warsaw and
  Berlin, you will meet with no surprises along the course I have
  taken. There have been no illusions, no see-sawing. But I try to
  do what I said I would.</p>

  <p>An active policy of co-existence should be
  based neither on fear nor on blind confidence. I know that the
  Western alliance would function; the potential adversary will
  have no illusions about this. But we must also discard that
  unimaginative principle that nations with different social and
  economic systems cannot live side by side without being in grave
  conflict.</p>

  <p>Once we have got this business of living
  together organized with the use of force excluded and all living
  in safety, then we shall have to start work on the organization
  of cooperation. However, this aim would be doomed from the outset
  if its ulterior motive were a new kind of crusade. There is and
  will continue to be the delimitation through ideological
  differences. But it means progress if we speak more of interests
  than of ideology. It is encouraging when dialogue takes the place
  of monologue in East-West relations in the search for solutions
  to those problems which, in spite of continuing differences,
  affect common interest.</p>

  <p>The solution of mutual problems implies
  establishing links through meaningful cooperation among states
  beyond inter-bloc frontiers. This means transforming the
  conflict; it means doing away with actual or supposed barriers
  with peaceful risks on both sides. It means building up
  confidence through practical arrangements. And this confidence
  may then become the new basis for the solution of long-standing
  problems. This opportunity can be Europe's opportunity in a world
  which, as has been proved, cannot be ruled by Washington or
  Moscow - or by Peking - alone.</p>

  <p>However unmistakably great the strength of
  the superpowers may be, it is an indisputable fact that other
  magnetic fields are emerging at the same time. Is there any point
  at all in drawing up a balance sheet of the future, saying that
  at such and such a time there will be I don't know how many
  superpowers? We are living in a world of the many and of change.
  Small nations, too, have a part in the big game; they, too, can
  represent power in their own way; they can be a help to
  themselves and to others; and they can also be a danger to
  themselves and to others.</p>

  <p>The entry of the People's Republic of China
  into the organized system of states is not in my opinion
  synonymous with a transition to tripolarity; there are more than
  two or three centers of world power. But apart from other things,
  there is a certain significance in the fact that huge China is
  both a developing country and a nuclear power, and that in view
  of the ever-mounting problems in the Third World, there is
  growing disappointment with the industrialized countries.</p>

  <p>Europe, which after the last war proved
  that its vitality was unbroken, still has its future ahead of
  itself. In the West it will grow beyond the European Economic
  Community and - in the way that Jean Monnet<a href=
  "#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> sees it - develop into a union which
  will be able to assume part of the responsibility for world
  affairs, independently of the United States, but - I am sure -
  firmly linked with it. At the same time there are opportunities
  for developing cooperation and safeguarding peace throughout the
  whole of Europe, perhaps of establishing a kind of European
  Partnership for Peace; and if I were not aware of the practical
  and theoretical obstacles that still have to be overcome, I would
  even speak of a European Union of Peace.</p>

  <p><b>IV.</b></p>

  <p>I realize that in the annals of Nobel Prize
  history the Germans have been more outstanding for their
  achievements in the fields of chemistry and physics than for
  their contribution to peace. Yet in this field, too, we have our
  representatives. War has always called for peace, and in my
  country also there has at times been no want of courageous
  theoreticians of peace.</p>

  <p>I recall the Nobel Peace Prize winner of
  1927, Professor <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1927/index.html">Ludwig
  Quidde</a>. The knowledge and discernment which he acquired from
  his historical studies inspired him to support the international
  anti-war movement, and for many years he was chairman of the
  German Peace Society. During the First World War he was an active
  member of the <i>Bund Neues Vaterland</i> (Federation for the New
  Fatherland) - a nice camouflage for "Europe" - which could boast
  of Ernst Reuter, the future Mayor of Berlin, as its
  secretary-general, and of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Albert Einstein</a> as one
  of its first members. Quidde, who was a member of the Bavarian
  legislature as early as 1907 and of the Weimar National Assembly
  in 1919-20, supported the principle of arbitration and was a
  champion of the League of Nations. Undergoing personal sacrifice,
  he showed democratic civil courage. He died in exile.</p>

  <p>There is a clearer connection between me
  and the first German winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1926/index.html">Gustave Stresemann</a>. He,
  too, was still active in politics when he was awarded the prize.
  True, we differ in some ways, not only owing to the circumstances
  but also as regards our personal and political temperament, and
  no worthy reflection on the past should attempt to even them out.
  And yet, rarely are achievements possible without a model from
  the past, and we should be able to express our gratitude for
  this.</p>

  <p>The First World War, like the Second, was
  followed by suspicions and oppressions. The era of mistrust
  brought the nations of Europe no further. It was Stresemann who,
  five years after the ceasefire, upheld the view and fought until
  it was accepted at home and abroad that clinging to positions
  long since eroded was bound to remain sterile. He was of the
  opinion that it was first necessary to restore the basis of trust
  before there could be a turn for the better. Not everybody felt
  as he did. There were many who thought that the mantle of
  mistrust should not be discarded until a number of improvements
  had been made. That was a problem then as it is today. The then
  Reich Foreign Minister was not blindly confident, but he fought -
  and for that he, too, needed civil courage - for a policy of
  conciliation, for his peace policy.</p>

  <p>It was France-German relations which then
  had suffered most under the burden of war. Nowhere else was the
  mountain of mistrust higher. Stresemann set about removing this,
  and his appeals were echoed from the other side by the man with
  whom he was to share the Peace Prize, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1926/index.html">Aristide Briand</a>. What they
  achieved together with the help of England in Locarno was
  expressed by Stresemann in the following words in this very
  place; "For one thing, it is the state of lasting peace on the
  Rhine guaranteed by a solemn undertaking by the two great
  neighboring nations not to use force, guaranteed by the
  undertaking by other states to come to the assistance of the one
  who falls victim to force contrary to this solemn agreement".</p>

  <p>You will see that what makes this sentence
  so important to me is the concept of renunciation of force.
  Malicious propaganda had at that time misunderstood or
  misinterpreted German policy as meaning that the Germans had
  renounced something which was rightfully theirs. But the truth
  was that we had renounced the use of force so as to give others a
  feeling of security and open a chapter of mutual trust.</p>

  <p>That state of lasting peace which
  Stresemann spoke about was then, as we all know, again disrupted
  by those who, inwardly, had not renounced force. And yet I feel
  that what was achieved in Locarno was not to no avail. It had
  traced the paths which others were able to follow after yet
  another war.</p>

  <p>I recall Robert Schuman, a man of so many
  noble ideas, on the French side, and Charles de Gaulle, the
  statesman who often proved to have a prophetic vision; and on the
  German side that conservative and constructive politician Konrad
  Adenauer. Not only was it given to him at an advanced age to see
  his life-long dream come true and Germany and France reconciled;
  he also played his part in making the Federal Republic an equal
  member of the emerging union of Western Europe and of the
  Atlantic alliance. Whatever our judgment of the details of these
  developments may have been at the time, it must be said that
  without the foundation that was built in the West, we would not
  have been in a position to pursue today's aims in the East.</p>

  <p>It was here, in the relations between
  Germany and her Eastern neighbors, that the greatest burdens were
  to be found, the highest mountain of mistrust. Here lay the task
  of our days. We have not by a long chalk accomplished it; in fact
  we have only just made a beginning, but we have taken the step in
  that direction and this we could only do along the paths that
  others had trodden before us.</p>

  <p>European peace policy lives from the spirit
  of history. This does not exclude the darkest years but
  explicitly includes them. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1935/index.html">Carl von Ossietzky</a>
  during that evil era of the Hitler regime meant a great deal.</p>

  <p>Together with Ludwig Quidde he had been
  active in the German Peace Society. With his sharp pen he
  struggled against militarism and nationalism. In 1921, he wrote:
  "Many nations have fought against each other, but the blood that
  has flowed is of only one kind: the blood of Europe's citizens".
  That era demanded more from him than civil courage, it demanded
  his life.</p>

  <p>Shortly before the presentation was made,
  one of those in power tried to exact from this uneasy prisoner an
  assurance that he would refuse the prize. In return he was to be
  set free, given financial security, and not to be bothered again
  in the future. Ossietzky refused and went back to prison. At that
  time I was 22 years old and "illegally" in Berlin just then. I
  had been directly involved in the "campaign" and was deeply moved
  when later learned of his decision.</p>

  <p>In Carl von Ossietzky the Nobel Committee
  had honored a man who had been persecuted and who could not come
  here to receive the prize. That award was a moral victory over
  the ruling powers of barbarism. Today, in the name of free
  Germany, I wish to express belated thanks to the Nobel Committee
  for making that choice. At the same time I wish to express my
  appreciation and encouragement to those who help people
  imprisoned or persecuted in other ways on account of their
  convictions.</p>

  <p>Here, in particular, I owe a word of deep
  respect to those men and women who joined the resistance against
  Hitler. I greet former members of the resistance movement in all
  countries.</p>

  <p>The German resistance fought and made
  sacrifices for decency, lawfulness and freedom. It preserved that
  Germany which I regard as my own and which has again fully become
  my country after the re-establishment of law and freedom.</p>

  <p>What yesterday meant to me was that it
  demonstrated to the whole world that Germany has come to terms
  with itself, just like an exile rediscovering the peaceful and
  human features of his fatherland.</p>

<p><b>V.</b></p>

  <p>When I was still Foreign Minister, I said
  that the policy of our country must unequivocally be directed to
  the safeguarding of peace as its common denominator. The present
  Foreign Minister and I know, of course, that peace policy must be
  something more than merely applauding others. Everyone must ask
  himself what specific contribution he should make. In particular,
  a country like the Federal Republic of Germany could not remain
  tied to a vague generality, but had to define a specific
  contribution. We could not leave to others answers which we could
  give ourselves. Nobody can relieve us of a task when, owing to
  the realities of the situation, it is one that only we ourselves
  can fulfill.</p>

  <p>I said the realities of the situation.
  These we cannot recognize if we are prone to self-deception or if
  we confuse politics with legal arguments. The Kremlin is no local
  court, said President Paasikivi,<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>
  and I would extend this metaphor to include Washington. I knew
  that the bill for Hitler's war was still unpaid, but I have never
  been of a mind to negotiate on the principles of human rights and
  self-determination.</p>

  <p>Looking at the matters from the realities
  of the situation, that meant not questioning any one's
  territorial integrity but rather recognizing the inviolability of
  frontiers. When we proposed a treaty on the renunciation of force
  and called upon our Eastern neighbors to take us at our word, we
  were able to build on what other West German governments before
  us had said and to which they had pledged themselves in the
  treaties with the Western countries. The logical consequence of
  our policy was that the inviolability of frontiers also had to
  apply to our relations with Eastern Europe and to relations
  between the two states in Germany which had become members of the
  two alliance systems.</p>

  <p>The tension - between the will for peace
  and self-assertion - which governed the work of the German
  politician during the period of confrontation led, via passionate
  disputes, to the clarification of major problems. The result has
  been our East-West policy. We have taken the dictate of
  self-assertion seriously, and we have not let the idea of
  national unity fall into decay. On the contrary, we have set
  about reorganizing our relationship with Eastern Europe in our
  own national interest as well. This is not simply a succession of
  measures and treaties, but an extensive and manifold process
  designed to use all possible ways of reducing the relative
  importance of frontiers and of opening up new paths.</p>

  <p>I do not like the label <i>Ostpolitik</i>,
  but how can one take back something that has almost become a
  byword and, like <i>Gem&uuml;tlichkeit</i>, apparently
  untranslatable, and accepted in international terminology? The
  word is tinged with connotations of the past. And it could lead
  to misinterpreting foreign policy as if it were a chest of
  drawers which can be opened at random. In actual fact, our policy
  of detente began in the West and remains rooted in the West. We
  want and need both partnership with the West and conciliation
  with the East.</p>

  <p>No one should overlook the fact that
  Western European unification, in which we are playing an active
  part, remains our top priority. The Atlantic alliance is
  indispensable to us. Yet, not only the development of the world
  situation in general, but also the special reality of the
  treaties with the West require them to be supplemented by normal
  and, where possible, friendly relations with the Soviet Union and
  its partners in the Warsaw Pact. In this I am in agreement with
  President Pompidou, with Prime Ministers Heath and Colombo, in
  fact with all our friends and allies.<a href=
  "#note9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p>Because it will benefit ourselves, the
  Germany in the two states of the one nation, we shall ratify our
  treaties with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of
  Poland. One of the Federal Government's aims is to establish a
  relaxed and fruitful relationship with the other members of the
  Warsaw Pact. Our relations with the German Democratic Republic
  will, in spite of all the difficulties, and respecting the rights
  and responsibilities of the Four Powers for Germany as a whole,
  be organized on the basis of equality in the form customary in
  international relations. The negotiations between the two parts
  of Germany with a view to filling in the framework provided by
  the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin have shown that complicated
  matters can be settled even where legal views are
  irreconcilable.</p>

  <p>The Federal Republic knows the limits of
  its possibilities. At the same time, it is conscious that it
  definitely possesses power and is a power - it regards itself as
  a power fully in the service of peace. The transition from
  classical power politics to the business-like peace policy we are
  pursuing must be understood as the change of objective and method
  from the <i>imposition</i> to the <i>balancing of interests.</i>
  This calls for self-conquest, an objective approach and an
  appraisal of our political strength and possibilities that is in
  no way less realistic than the classical concept of power
  politics would demand. This appraisal should lead from sacred
  national egoism to a European and global domestic policy which
  feels responsible for ensuring that man everywhere has an
  existence worthy of human dignity.</p>

<p><b>VI.</b></p>

  <p>Turning now to a few of the elements that
  could go to make up a European peace pact, I will not tarry to
  consider institutional concepts which cannot in any case be put
  into effect in the short term. But I re-emphasise my faith in the
  universal principles of general international law, however much
  they may be disregarded. They found binding expression in the
  principles of the United Nations Charter: sovereignty -
  territorial integrity - nonviolence - the right of
  self-determination of nations - human rights.</p>

  <p>These principles are inalienable even
  though their application is often imperfect - that I know.
  Incidentally, one of the hardships in the life of the politician,
  especially the head of the Government, is that he cannot always
  say what he thinks, that for the sake of peace he cannot always
  give vent to his feelings.</p>

  <p>Moreover, I am convinced that
  <i>general</i> European security and cooperation will not be
  impaired by the continued progress of West European unification.
  Western Europe including Britain, the enlarging Community
  therefore, is not forming itself into a bloc against Eastern
  Europe, but it can, by strengthening its social components also,
  develop into an especially important element in the building of a
  balanced European system of security. Firmly rooted cohesion
  internally need not be inconsistent with an outward-looking
  cooperative approach.</p>

  <p>I would also say that Europe and America
  cannot be separated. They need each other as self-confident,
  equal partners. The heavier the burden the United States has to
  carry, the more will that great country be able to rely on our
  friendship.</p>

  <p>The points I am outlining are realistically
  based on the assumption that we must first of all take the world
  with its systems and ideologies as it stands today. Knowing full
  well the degree of imperfection we encounter, we must nonetheless
  attempt to build a structure of peace which will be more durable
  than former systems and egoisms, and which can be further
  improved.</p>

  <p>First, this means that our general European
  policy cannot ignore the centuries old identities of nations and
  states. In fact, we shall have to establish a balance between
  states and groups of states in which each will preserve its
  identity and security. But such a balance must be something more
  than just a balance of military power.</p>

  <p>Second, once and for all and without
  exception, we must renounce force and the threat of force in
  relations between states. This includes of necessity the
  inviolability of existing frontiers. But the integrity of
  frontiers cannot mean cementing them as barriers between
  enemies.</p>

  <p>Third, beyond a general renunciation of
  force - whether bilateral or multilateral - we can achieve more
  security through the equal participation of the nations of Europe
  in specific agreements on arms limitation and control. There will
  have to be concrete negotiations on balanced force reductions in
  Central Europe.</p>

  <p>Fourth, the principle of non-interference
  in the internal affairs of other states must be respected, but
  non-interference is not enough. A Europe living in peace calls
  for its members to be willing to listen to the arguments of
  others, for the struggle of convictions and interests will
  continue. Europe needs tolerance. It needs freedom of thought,
  not moral indifference.</p>

  <p>Fifth, the time is ripe for the development
  of new forms of economic, technological and scientific
  cooperation and for the building up of an all-European
  infrastructure. And above all: Europe evolved as a cultural
  community, and it should again become what it was.</p>

  <p>Sixth, social security is one of the
  foundations of lasting peace. Material want is in effect bondage
  and, in Europe at any rate, it must be overcome by evolution.</p>

  <p>Seventh, Europe must live up to its
  worldwide responsibility. This means co-responsibility for world
  peace, and it must also mean co-responsibility for justice
  towards the outside world, so that hunger and misery elsewhere
  can be overcome. Peace is something more than the absence of war,
  although some nations would be thankful for that alone today. A
  durable and equitable peace system requires equal development
  opportunities for all nations.</p>

  <p>Our object in this respect is not to pursue
  far-off abstract targets but to deal with differences as soberly
  as possible. I know that to some, especially among the young
  generation, this is too little, and that to many people the whole
  process is too slow anyway. It is not harmful but rather helpful
  when young people revolt against the disproportion between
  outdated structures and new possibilities, and when they protest
  against the contradiction of semblance and reality. I do not
  believe in saying what young people expect me to say, but I
  appeal to them to use their unspent energies in critical and
  responsible cooperation with us.</p>

  <p>What we need is a sense of proportion,
  resolution and endurance. And of course, we also need to have an
  eye for new dimensions and the energy to cope with them. In view
  of the magnitude of the tasks facing us, we require a healthy
  mixture of faith in the future and sober realism. Incidentally,
  can there be anything more important than helping to organize
  Europe and peace?</p>

<p><b>VII.</b></p>

  <p>In the field of practical politics there
  are two tasks not far ahead: a conference on security and
  cooperation in Europe and negotiations on force reductions. At
  the same time, irrespective of whether they are members of blocs
  or not, the nations of Europe must begin to develop economic,
  technological and cultural cooperation, commensurate with the
  size of the projects that will need to be implemented in the
  development of Europe. And in pursuing this objective, national
  frontiers must be no obstacle.</p>

  <p>The conference will have to consider the
  possibilities of cooperation and, at the same time, questions of
  security. I perceive the possibility of creating, through
  economic and other ties between East and West, North and South in
  Europe, common interests and responsibilities which will produce
  more security for all.</p>

  <p>Renunciation of force must become a law
  which every state respects and which rules out interference.
  Along this road, which will certainly not be a short one, we can
  arrive at a system of security in Europe superimposed on the
  blocs, as it were; judging by the world situation, that system is
  feasible neither without the United States nor without the Soviet
  Union.</p>

  <p>Balanced force reductions can pave the way
  towards that aim. I helped to formulate the "Signal of
  Reykjavik"<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> in the spring of
  1968 and naturally I have not forgotten the setback which we all
  witnessed soon afterwards. The road ahead will continue to be
  stony. Those who have followed the history of global or regional
  agreements which the Geneva Disarmament Committee has achieved
  through painstaking efforts over the past ten years - Antarctic,
  test ban, space, non-proliferation, seabed, and biological
  weapons - feel encouraged in spite of everything. Together with
  others, the superpowers, in spite of all their differences, are
  finding partial areas of common interest in the safeguarding of
  peace.</p>

  <p>And I feel even more encouraged for a
  special reason: This year I have put to President Nixon and Mr.
  Brezhnev separately the same questions on various aspects of
  force reductions, and received favorable answers from both of
  them. The leaders of the most powerful nations are also wondering
  whether they cannot make available more money for other than
  military purposes.</p>

<p><b>VIII.</b></p>

  <p>There are strong forces in opposition to
  the organization of peace. We have witnessed the barbarism into
  which man can relapse. No religion, no ideology, no glorious
  cultural evolution can rule out for certain the possibility of
  hatred breaking out from the innermost depths of the human heart
  and plunging nations into disaster. Peace, like freedom, is no
  original state which existed from the start; we shall have to
  make it, in the truest sense of the word.</p>

  <p>To achieve this, we shall have to know more
  about the origin of conflicts. This is where the institutions of
  peace and conflict research are faced with huge tasks. As I see
  it, next to reasonable politics, learning is in our world the
  true credible alternative to force.</p>

  <p>Another opposing force we have to contend
  with is the <i>sacro egoismo</i> of pressure groups. We still see
  them in Europe practically everyday, and the unbridled national
  egoism of young states is developing so quickly that it seems to
  have no difficulty in catching up with the old nations who have
  many centuries' start.</p>

  <p>Ideologies, their harbingers and followers
  over and over again disregard the fundamental ethical principles
  of co-existence because they want to "improve" mankind, to
  preserve the purity of their doctrine, or to get the better of
  other doctrines. It is not possible to sow the seeds of lasting
  peace between such forces. A policy for peace must make them
  understand that neither states nor ideologies are ends in
  themselves but that they are there to serve the individual in his
  efforts to live and develop his life meaningfully.</p>

  <p>The quest for absolute possession is a
  threat to man. Those who feel they own the entire truth, those
  who will have the paradise of their dreams here and now, destroy
  only too easily the ground on which a system allowing for human
  dignity can grow. The tradition of European democracy, too, knows
  not only of a humanitarian but also of a doctrinaire trait which
  leads to tyranny; liberation then becomes slavery.</p>

  <p>Young people often expect me to give an
  unqualified "Yes", a clear "No". But it has become impossible for
  me to believe in one, in the single truth, so I say to my young
  friends and to others who want to hear it: There are several
  truths, not merely the one truth which excludes all others. That
  is why I believe in diversity and hence in doubt. It is
  productive. It questions existing things. It can be strong enough
  to smash fossilized injustice. Doubt proved its worth during the
  resistance. It is tough enough to outlast defeats and to
  disillusion victors.</p>

  <p>Today we know how rich and at the same time
  how limited man is in his possibilities. We know him in his
  aggression and in his brotherliness. We know that he is capable
  of applying his inventions for his own good, but also of using
  them to destroy himself. Let us drop all these terrible excessive
  demands. I believe in active compassion and therefore in man's
  responsibility. And I believe in the absolute necessity of
  peace.</p>

  <p>As a democratic socialist my thoughts and
  my work are directed to change. Not that I want to remodel man,
  for to force him into a system means to destroy him, but I
  believe in the changeability of human conditions.</p>

  <p>During my life I have seen many illusions
  develop and disappear; much confusion, escapism and
  simplification. In one place a sense of responsibility was
  lacking, in another imagination. I have also experienced what
  faith in one's convictions, steadfastness and solidarity can
  mean. I know how moral strength can develop and emerge especially
  in times of great affliction. Many things declared dead have
  proved to be alive.</p>

  <p>Originally Alfred Nobel thought that he
  would have his Peace Prize awarded only six times, once every
  five years, after which it would no longer be necessary. It has
  in fact lasted longer, otherwise I would not have had the
  opportunity of addressing you here today.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1905/index.html">Bertha von Suttner</a>, who
  was awarded the prize in 1905, overestimated the favorable
  response to her book <i>Lay Down Your Arms.</i> I am still one of
  those who were deeply impressed by the book, and after all else I
  gladly identify myself with the naive Humanism of my youth.</p>

  <p>But I cannot end my speech without
  reminding you and myself of those who at this moment are living
  and suffering in war, especially on the Indian subcontinent and
  in Vietnam. I include also the people living in the Middle East
  and other areas of crises. I do not feel like making loud
  appeals, for it is easy to demand moderation, reason and modesty
  of others. But this plea comes from the bottom of my heart: May
  all those who possess the power to wage war have the mastery of
  reason to maintain peace.</p>
