  <h1>Jacobus H. van &#39;t Hoff - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hoff.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff</b> was
  born in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, on August 30, 1852. He was
  the third child in a family of seven children of Jacobus Henricus
  van&nbsp;'t Hoff, a physician, and Alida Jacoba Kolff.<br>
  <br>
  In 1869 he entered the Polytechnic School at Delft and obtained
  his technology diploma in 1871. His decision to follow a purely
  scientific career, however, came soon afterwards during
  vacation-work at a sugar factory when he anticipated for himself
  a dreary profession as a technologist. After having spent a year
  at Leiden,
  mainly for mathematics, he went to Bonn to work with A.F.
  Kekul&eacute; from autumn 1872 to spring 1873; this period was
  followed by another in Paris with A. Wurtz, when he attended a
  large part of the curriculum for 1873-1874. He returned to
  Holland in 1874 and obtained his doctor's degree that same year
  under E. Mulder in Utrecht.<br>
  <br>
  In 1876 he became lecturer at the Veterinary College at Utrecht,
  but left this post for a similar position at the University of
  Amsterdam the following year. In 1878 came his appointment as
  Professor of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology at the same
  university. After having occupied this chair for 18 years he
  accepted an invitation to go to Berlin as Honorary Professor,
  connected with a membership of the Royal Prussian Academy of
  Sciences. The principal reason for this change was the fact that
  he was overburdened with obligations to give elementary lectures
  and to examine large numbers of students, including even those
  for medical propaedeutics, leaving him with too little time to do
  his own research work. He was an ardent advocate for the creation
  of a special class of scientific workers. At his new post he
  remained till the end of his life.<br>
  <br>
  van 't Hoff has acquired fame particularly by his epoch-making
  publications. His doctor's thesis (1874) was entitled <i>Bijdrage
  tot de Kennis van Cyaanazijnzuren en Malonzuur</i> (Contribution
  to the knowledge of cyanoacetic acids and malonic acid). Of far
  greater weight, however, was his publication which appeared
  several months before: <i>Voorstel tot Uitbreiding der
  Tegenwoordige in de Scheikunde gebruikte Structuurformules in de
  Ruimte</i>, etc. (Proposal for the development of 3-dimensional
  chemical structural formulae). This small pamphlet, consisting of
  twelve pages text and one page diagrams, gave the impetus to the
  development of stereochemistry. The concept of the "asymmetrical
  carbon atom", dealt with in this publication, supplied an
  explanation of the occurrence of numerous isomers, inexplicable
  by means of the then current structural formulae. At the same
  time he pointed out the existence of relationship between optical
  activity and the presence of an asymmetrical carbon atom.<br>
  <br>
  His revolutionary ideas, however, only found acceptance after the
  publication, in 1875, of his <i>Chimie dans l'Espace</i>;
  especially when two years later the German translation appeared,
  with an introduction by J. Wislicenus. (The English translation:
  <i>Chemistry in Space</i> did not appear until 1891.) In his
  <i>Dix Ann&eacute;es dans l'Histoire d'une Th&eacute;orie</i> (Ten
  years in the history of a theory) he drew attention to the fact
  that J.A. Le Bel had independently arrived at the same ideas,
  though in a more abstract form.<br>
  <br>
  In 1884 his book <i>&Eacute;tudes de Dynamique chimique</i>
  (Studies in dynamic chemistry) appeared, in which he entered for
  the first time the field of physical chemistry. Of great
  importance was his development of the general thermodynamic
  relationship between the heat of conversion and the displacement
  of the equilibrium as a result of temperature variation. At
  constant volume, the equilibrium in a system will tend to shift
  in such a direction as to oppose the temperature change which is
  imposed upon the system. Thus, lowering the temperature results
  in heat development while increasing the temperature results in
  heat absorption. This principle of mobile equilibrium was
  subsequently (1885) put in a general form by Le Chatelier, who
  extended the principle to include compensation, by change of
  volume, for imposed pressure changes - it is now known as the van
  't Hoff-Le Chatelier principle.<br>
  <br>
  The following year, in 1885, followed <i>L'&Eacute;quilibre
  chimique dans les Syst&egrave;mes gazeux ou dissous &agrave;
  I'&Eacute;tat dilu&eacute;</i> (Chemical equilibria in gaseous
  systems or strongly diluted solutions), which dealt with this
  theory of dilute solutions. Here he demonstrated that the
  "osmotic pressure" in solutions which are sufficiently dilute is
  proportionate to the concentration and the absolute temperature
  so that this pressure can be represented by a formula which only
  deviates from the formula for gas pressure by a coefficient
  <i>i</i>. He also determined the value of <i>i</i> by various
  methods, for example by means of the vapour pressure and Raoult's
  results on the lowering of the freezing point. Thus van 't Hoff
  was able to prove that thermodynamic laws are not only valid for
  gases, but also for dilute solutions. His pressure laws, given
  general validity by the electrolytic dissociation theory of
  <a href="../1903/index.html">Arrhenius</a> (1884-1887) - the
  first foreigner who came to work with him in Amsterdam (1888) -
  are considered the most comprehensive and important in the realm
  of natural sciences.<br>
  <br>
  During his Berlin period he was from 1896 to 1905 continuously
  engaged on the problem of the origin of oceanic deposits, with
  special reference to those formed at Stassfurt. In this extensive
  work he was especially assisted by W. Meyerhoffer, who had
  previously worked with him in Amsterdam for a number of years. He
  was probably the first to apply small-scale results, obtained in
  the laboratory, to phenomena occurring on a large scale in
  Nature. The results of this ambitious investigation, mostly
  published in the Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences,
  were summarized by him in a two-volumes work <i>Zur Bildung
  ozeanischer Salzablagerungen,</i> 1905-1909.<br>
  <br>
  van 't Hoff greatly valued the power of imagination in scientific
  work, as is apparent from his inaugural address on taking up his
  professorship in Amsterdam: <i>Verbeeldingskracht in de
  Wetenschap</i> (The power of imagination in Science), in which,
  after a rather elaborate study of biographies, he arrived at the
  conclusion that the most prominent scientists have possessed this
  quality in a high degree. <a href="../1909/index.html">Wilhelm
  Ostwald</a>, who together with him established the <i>Zeitschrift
  f&uuml;r physikalische Chemie</i> in Leipzig, and can be
  regarded as founders of physical chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Of the numerous distinctions he himself mentioned the award of
  the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1901) to him as the
  culmination-point of his career. In 1885 he was appointed member
  of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, after his
  nomination had been withheld in 1880 because of an insufficient
  number of votes - a proof that his ideas initially found little
  acceptance in his own country. Among his other distinctions were
  the honorary doctorates of Harvard and Yale (1901), Victoria University, Manchester(1903),
  Heidelberg (1908); the Davy Medal of the Royal Society (1893),
  Helmholtz Medal of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1911); he
  was also appointed Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur (1894),
  Senator der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (1911). He was also
  member or honorary member of the Chemical Society, London (1898),
  Royal Academy of Sciences, Gottingen (1892), American Chemical
  Society (1898), Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, Paris (1905).<br>
  <br>
  van 't Hoff was a lover of nature; as a student in Leyden he
  frequently took part in the botanical excursions, and later in
  Bonn he fully enjoyed the mountains in the vicinity, taking long
  walks in company or alone. His quite detailed description of his
  journey to the United States, resulting from an invitation to
  lecture at Chicago University, amply shows his love of travel.
  His receptiveness for philosophy and his predilection for poetry
  were already apparent in his early school years - Lord Byron was
  his idol.<br>
  <br>
  In 1878 he married Johanna Francina Mees. They had two daughters,
  Johanna Francina (b. 1880) and Aleida Jacoba (b. 1882) and two
  sons, Jacobus Hendricus (b. 1883) and Govert Jacob (b.
  1889).<br>
  <br>
  van 't Hoff died on March 1, 1911, at Steglitz near Berlin.</p>
