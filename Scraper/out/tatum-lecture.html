  <h2>A Case History in Biological Research</h2>

  <p>In casting around in search of a new approach, an important
  consideration was that much of biochemical genetics has been and
  will be covered by Professor Beadle and Professor Lederberg, and
  in many symposia and reviews, in which many aspects have been and
  will be considered in greater detail and with greater competence
  than I can hope to do here. It occurred to me that perhaps it
  might be instructive, valuable, and interesting to use the
  approach which I have attempted to define by the title "A Case
  History in Biological Research". In the development of this case
  history I hope to point out some of the factors involved in all
  research, specifically the dependence of scientific progress: on
  knowledge and concepts provided by investigators of the past and
  present all over the world; on the free interchange of ideas
  within the international scientific community; on the hybrid
  vigor resulting from cross-fertilization between disciplines; and
  last but not least, also dependent on chance, geographical
  proximity, and opportunity. I would like finally to complete this
  case history with a brief discussion of the present status of the
  field, and a prognosis of its possible development.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances, I hope I will be forgiven if this
  presentation is given from a personal viewpoint. After graduating
  from the University of Wisconsin in chemistry, I was fortunate in
  having the opportunity of doing graduate work in biochemistry and
  microbiology at this University under the direction and
  leadership of W.H. Peterson and E.B. Fred. At that time, in the
  early 30's, one of the exciting areas being opened concerned the
  so-called "growth-factors" for micro-organisms, for the most part
  as yet mysterious and unidentified. I became deeply involved in
  this field, and was fortunate to have been able, in collaboration
  with H.G. Wood, then visiting at Wisconsin, to identify one of
  the required growth-factors for propionic acid bacteria, as the
  recently synthesized vitamin B1 or thiamine<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This was before the universality
  of need for the B vitamins, and the enzymatic basis of this
  requirement, had been clearly defined. The vision of Lwoff and
  Knight had already indicated a correlation of the need of
  micro-organisms for "growth-factors" with failure of synthesis,
  and correlated this failure with evolution, particularly in
  relation to the complex environment of "fastidious" pathogenic
  micro-organisms. However, the tendency at this time was to
  consider "growth-factors" as highly individual requirements,
  peculiar to particular strains or species of micro-organisms as
  isolated from nature, and their variation in these respects was
  not generally considered as related to gene mutation and
  variation in higher organisms. Actually my ignorance of and
  naivet&eacute; in genetics was probably typical of that of most
  biochemists and microbiologists of the time, with my only contact
  with genetic concepts being a course primarily on vertebrate
  evolution.</p>

  <p>After completing graduate work at Wisconsin I was fortunate in
  being able to spend a year studying at the University of Utrecht
  with F. K&ouml;gl, the discoverer of the growth-factor biotin,
  and to work in the same laboratory with Nils Fries, who already
  had contributed significantly in the field of nutrition and
  growth of fungi.</p>

  <p>At this time, Professor Beadle was just moving to Stanford
  University, and invited me as a biochemist to join him in the
  further study of the eye-color hormones of <i>Drosophila</i>,
  which he and Ephrussi in their work at the California Institute
  of Technology and at Paris had so brilliantly established as
  diffusible products of gene-controlled reactions. During this, my
  first contacts with modern genetic concepts, as a consequence of
  a number of factors the observation of Khouvine, Ephrussi, and
  Chevais<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> in Paris that
  dietary tryptophan was concerned with <i>Drosophila</i> eye-color
  hormone production; our studies on the nutrition of
  <i>Drosophila</i> in aseptic culture<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>; and the chance contamination of
  one of our cultures of <i>Drosophila</i> with a particular
  bacterium - we were able to isolate the v<sup>+</sup> hormone in
  crystalline state from a bacterial culture supplied with
  tryptophan<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and with A.J.
  Haagen-Smit to identify it as kynurenine<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, originally isolated by Kotake, and
  later structurally identified correctly by Butenandt. It might be
  pointed out here that kynurenine has since been recognized to
  occupy a central position in tryptophan metabolism in many
  organisms aside from insects, including mammals and fungi.</p>

  <p>At about this time, as the result of many discussions and
  considerations of the general biological applicability of
  chemical genetic concepts, stimulated by the wealth of
  potentialities among the micro-organisms and their variation in
  nature with respect to their nutritional requirements, we began
  our work with the mold <i>Neurospora crassa</i>.</p>

  <p>I shall not renumerate the factors involved in our selection
  of this organism for the production of chemical or nutritionally
  deficient mutants, but must take this opportunity of reiterating
  our indebtedness to the previous basic findings of a number of
  investigators. Foremost among these, to B.O. Dodge for his
  establishment of this <i>Ascomycete</i> as a most suitable
  organism for genetic studies<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>;and to C.C. Lindegren<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, who became interested in
  <i>Neurospora</i> through T.H. Morgan, a close friend of
  Dodge.</p>

  <p>Our use of <i>Neurospora</i> for chemical genetic studies
  would also have been much more difficult, if not impossible,
  without the availability of synthetic biotin as the result of the
  work of K&ouml;gl<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> and of du
  Vigneaud<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>. In addition, the
  investigations of Nils Fries on the nutrition of
  <i>Ascomycetes</i><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> were
  most helpful, as shown by the fact that the synthetic minimal
  medium used with <i>Neurospora</i> for many years was that
  described by him and supplemented only with biotin, and has
  ordinarily since been referred to as "Fries medium". It should
  also be pointed out that the experimental feasibility of
  producing the desired nutritionally deficient mutant strains
  depended on the early pioneering work of Roentgen, with X-rays,
  and on that of H.J. Muller, on the mutagenic activity of X-rays
  and ultraviolet light on <i>Drosophila</i>. All that was needed
  was to put these various facts and findings together to produce
  in the laboratory with irradiation, nutritionally deficient
  (auxotrophic) mutant strains of <i>Neurospora</i>, and to show
  that each single deficiency produced was associated with the
  mutation of a single gene<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Having thus successfully tested with <i>Neurospora</i> the
  basic premise that the biochemical processes concerned with the
  synthesis of essential cell constituents are gene controlled, and
  alterable as a consequence of gene mutation, it then seemed a
  desirable and natural step to carry this approach to the
  bacteria, in which so many and various naturally occurring
  growth-factor requirements were known, to see if analogous
  nutritional deficiencies followed their exposure to radiation. As
  is known to all of you, the first mutants of this type were
  successfully produced in <i>Acetobacter</i> and in <i>Escherichia
  coli</i><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and the first
  step had been taken in bringing the bacteria into the fold of
  organisms suitable for genetic study.</p>

  <p>Now to point out some of the curious coincidences or twists of
  fate as involved in science: One of the first series of mutants
  in <i>Neurospora</i> which was studied intensily from the
  biochemical viewpoint was that concerned with the biosynthesis of
  tryptophan. In connection with the role of indole as a precursor
  of tryptophan, we wanted also to study the reverse process, the
  breakdown of tryptophan to indole, a reaction typical of the
  bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. For this purpose we obtained, from the
  Bacteriology Department at Stanford, a typical <i>E. coli</i>
  culture, designated K-12. Naturally, this strain was later used
  for the mutation experiments just described so that a variety of
  biochemically marked mutant strains of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 were
  soon available. It is also of interest that Miss Esther Zimmer,
  who later became Esther Lederberg, assisted in the production and
  isolation of these mutant strains.</p>

  <p>Another interesting coincidence is that F.J. Ryan spent some
  time on leave from Columbia University at Stanford, working with
  <i>Neurospora</i>. Shortly after I moved to Yale University in
  1945, Ryan encouraged Lederberg, then a medical student at
  Columbia who had worked some time with Ryan on <i>Neurospora</i>,
  to spend some time with me at Yale University. As all of you
  know, Lederberg was successful in showing genetic recombination
  between mutant strains of <i>E. coli</i> K-12<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> and never returned to medical
  school, but continued his brilliant work on bacterial
  recombination at Wisconsin. In any case, the first demonstration
  of a process analogous to a sexual process in bacteria was
  successful only because of the clear-cut nature of the genetic
  markers available which permitted detection of this very rare
  event, and because of the combination of circumstances which had
  provided those selective markers in one of the rare strains of
  <i>E. coli</i> capable of recombination. In summing up this
  portion of this case history, then, I wish only to emphasize
  again the role of coincidence and chance played in the sequence
  of developments, but yet more strongly to acknowledge the even
  greater contributions of my close friends and associates,
  Professor Beadle and Professor Lederberg, with whom it is a rare
  privilege and honor to share this award.</p>

  <p>Now for a brief and necessarily somewhat superficial mention
  of some of the problems and areas of biology to which these
  relatively simple experiments with <i>Neurospora</i> have led and
  contributed. First, however, let us review the basic concepts
  involved in this work. Essentially these are: <i>(1)</i> that all
  biochemical processes in all organisms are under genie control;
  <i>(2)</i> that these overall biochemical processes are
  resolvable into a series of individual stepwise reactions;
  <i>(3)</i> that each single reaction is controlled in a primary
  fashion by a single gene, or in other terms, in every case a I:I
  correspondence of gene and biochemical reaction exists, such that
  <i>(4)</i> mutation of a single gene results only in an
  alteration in the ability of the cell to carry out a single
  primary chemical reaction. As has repeatedly been stated, the
  underlying hypothesis, which in a number of cases has been
  supported by direct experimental evidence, is that each gene
  controls the production, function, and specificity of a
  particular enzyme. Important experimental implications of these
  relations are that each and every biochemical reaction in a cell
  of any organism, from a bacterium to man, is theoretically
  alterable by gene mutation, and that each such mutant cell strain
  differs in only one primary way from the non-mutant parental
  strain. It is probably unnecessary to point out that these
  experimental expectations have been amply supported by the
  production and isolation, by many investigators during the last
  15 or more years, of biochemical mutant strains of
  micro-organisms in almost every species tried: bacteria, yeasts,
  algae, and fungi.</p>

  <p>It is certainly unnecessary for me to do more than point out
  that mutant strains such as those produced and isolated first in
  <i>Neurospora</i> and <i>E. col</i>i have been of primary utility
  as genetic markers in detecting and elucidating the details of
  the often exotic mechanisms of genetic recombination of
  micro-organisms.</p>

  <p>Similarly, it seems superfluous even to mention the proven
  usefulness of mutant strains of micro-organisms in unraveling the
  detailed steps involved in the biosynthesis of vital cellular
  constituents. I would like to list, however, a few of the
  biosynthetic sequences and biochemical interrelationships which
  owe their discovery and elucidation largely to the use of
  biochemical mutants. These include: the synthesis of the aromatic
  amino acids via dehydroshikimic and shikimic acid <sup><a href=
  "#footnote14">14</a>, <a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup>, by way
  of prephenic acid to phenylalanine<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>, and by way of anthranilic acid,
  indole glycerol phosphate<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>,
  and condensation of indole with serine to give tryptophan<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>; the conversion of tryptophan via
  kynurenine and 3-OH anthranilic acid to niacin<sup><a href=
  "#footnote19">19</a>, <a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup>; the
  biosynthesis of histidin<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>;
  of isoleucine and valine via the analogous di-OH and keto
  acids<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>; the biosynthesis of
  proline and ornithine from glutamic acid<a href=
  "#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a>; and the synthesis of
  pyrirnidines via erotic acid<a href=
  "#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>If the postulated relationship of gene to enzyme is correct,
  several consequences can be predicted. First, mutation should
  result in the production of a changed protein, which might either
  be enzymatically inactive, of intermediate activity, or have
  otherwise detectably altered physical properties. The production
  of such proteins changed in respect to heat stability, enzymatic
  activity, or other properties such as activation energy, by
  mutant strains has indeed been demonstrated in a number of
  instances<a href="#footnote25"><sup>25-31</sup></a>. Recognition
  of the molecular bases of these changes must await detailed
  comparison of their structures with those of the normal enzyme,
  using techniques similar to the elegant methods of Professor
  Sanger. That the primary effect of gene mutation may be as simple
  as the substitution of a single amino acid by another and may
  lead to profound secondary changes in protein structure and
  properties has recently been strongly indicated by the work of
  Ingram on hemoglobin<a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>. It
  seems inevitable that induced mutant strains of microorganisms
  will play a most important part in providing material for the
  further examination of these problems.</p>

  <p>A second consequence of the postulated relationship stems from
  the concept that the genetic constitution defines the
  potentialities of the cell, the time and degree of expression of
  which are to a certain extent modifiable by the cellular
  environment. The analysis of this type of secondary control at
  the biochemical level is one of the important and exciting new
  areas of biochemistry. This deals with the regulation and
  integration of biochemical reactions by means of feed-back
  mechanisms restricting the synthesis or activities of
  enzymes<a href="#footnote33"><sup>33-36</sup></a> and through
  substrate induced biosynthesis of enzymes<a href=
  "#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a>. It seems probable that some gene
  mutations may affect biochemical activities at this level,
  (modifiers, and suppressors), and that chemical mutants will
  prove of great value in the analysis of the details of such
  control mechanisms.</p>

  <p>An equally fascinating newer area of genetics, opened by
  Benzer<a href="#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a> with bacteriophage,
  is that of the detailed correlation of fine structure of the gene
  in terms of mutation and recombination, with its fine structure
  in terms of activity. Biochemical mutants of micro-organisms have
  recently opened this area to investigation at two levels of
  organization of genetic material. The higher level relates to the
  genetic linkage of non-allelic genes concerned with sequential
  biosynthetic reactions. This has been shown by Demerec and by
  Hartman in the biosynthesis of tryptophan and histidine by
  <i>Salmonella</i><a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>At a finer level of organization of genetic material, the
  biological versatility of <i>Neurospora</i> in forming
  heterocaryotic cells has permitted the demonstration<a href=
  "#footnote40"><sup>40-42</sup></a> that genes damaged by mutation
  in different areas, within the same locus and controlling the
  same enzyme, complement each other in a heterocaryon in such a
  way that synthesis of enzymatically active protein is restored,
  perhaps, in a manner analogous to the reconstitution of
  ribonuclease from its a and b constituents, by they production in
  the cytoplasm of an active protein from two gene products
  defective in different areas. This phenomenon of complementation,
  which appears also to take place in <i>Aspergillus</i><a href=
  "#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a>, permits the mapping of genetic
  fine structure in terms of function, and should lead to further
  information on the mechanism of enzyme production and
  clarification of the role of the gene in enzyme synthesis.</p>

  <p>The concepts of biochemical genetics have already been, and
  will undoubtedly continue to be, significant in broader areas of
  biology. Let me cite a few examples in microbiology and
  medicine.</p>

  <p>In microbiology the roles of mutation and selection in
  evolution are coming to be better understood through the use of
  bacterial cultures of mutant strains. In more immediately
  practical ways, mutation has proven of primary importance in the
  improvement of yields of important antibiotics - such as in the
  classic example of penicillin, the yield of which has gone up
  from around 40 units per ml of culture shortly after its
  discovery by Fleming to approximately 4,000, as the result of a
  long series of successive experimentally produced mutational
  steps. On the other side of the coin, the mutational origin of
  antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms is of definite medical
  significance. The therapeutic use of massive doses of antibiotics
  to reduce the numbers of bacteria which by mutation could develop
  resistance, is a direct consequence of the application of genetic
  concepts. Similarly, so is the increasing use of combined
  antibiotic therapy, resistance to both of which would require the
  simultaneous mutation of two independent characters.</p>

  <p>As an important example of the application of these same
  concepts of microbial genetics to mammalian cells, we may cite
  the probable mutational origin of resistance to chemotherapeutic
  agents in leukemic cells<a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a>,
  and the increasing and effective simultaneous use of two or more
  chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of this disease. In this
  connection it should be pointed out that the most effective
  cancer chemotherapeutic agents so far found are those which
  interfere with DNA synthesis, and that more detailed information
  on the biochemical steps involved in this synthesis is making
  possible a more rational design of such agents. Parenthetically,
  I want to emphasize the analogy between the situation in a
  bacterial culture consisting of two or more cell types and that
  involved in the competition and survival of a malignant cell,
  regardless of its origin, in a population of normal cells.
  Changes in the cellular environment, such as involved in
  chemotherapy, would be expected to affect the metabolic
  efficiency of an altered cell, and hence its growth
  characteristics. However, as in the operation of selection
  pressures in bacterial populations, based on the interaction
  between cell types, it would seem that the effects of
  chemotherapeutic agents on the efficiency of selective pressures
  among mammalian cell populations can be examined most effectively
  only in controlled mixed populations of the cell types
  concerned.</p>

  <p>In other areas in cancer, the concepts of genetics are
  becoming increasingly important, both theoretically and
  practically. It seems probable that neo-plastic changes are
  directly correlated with changes in the biochemistry of the cell.
  The relationships between DNA, RNA, and enzymes which have
  evolved during the last few decades, lead one to look for the
  basic neoplastic change in one of these intimately interrelated
  hierarchies of cellular materials.</p>

  <p>In relation to DNA, hereditary changes are now known to take
  place as a consequence of mutation, or of the introduction of new
  genetic material through virus infection (as in transduction) or
  directly (as in transformation). Although each of these related
  hereditary changes may theoretically be involved in cancer,
  definite evidence is available only for the role of viruses,
  stemming from the classic investigations of Rous on fowl
  sarcoma<a href="#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a>. At the RNA level
  of genetic determination, any one of these classes of change
  might take place, as in the RNA containing viruses, and result in
  an heritable change, perhaps of the cytoplasmic type,
  semi-autonomous with respect to the gene. At the protein level,
  regulatory mechanisms determining gene activity and enzyme
  synthesis as mentioned earlier, likewise provide promising areas
  for exploration.</p>

  <p>Among the many exciting applications of microbial-genetic
  concepts and techniques to the problems of cancer, may I mention
  in addition the exploration by Klein<a href=
  "#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a> of the genetic basis of the
  immunological changes which distinguish the cancer cell from the
  normal, and the studies on the culture, nutrition, morphology,
  and mutation of isolated normal and malignant mammalian cells of
  Puck<a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a> and of Eagle<a href=
  "#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a>. Such studies are basic to our
  exploration and to our eventual understanding of the origin and
  nature of the change to malignancy.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the origin of a cancer cell, however, and of the
  precise genetic level at which the primary change takes place, it
  is not too much to hope and expect eventually to be able to
  correct or alleviate the consequences of the metabolic defect,
  just as a closer understanding of a heritable metabolic defect in
  man permits its correction or alleviation. In terms of
  biochemical genetics, the consequences of a metabolic block may
  be rectified by dietary limitation of the precursor of an
  injurious accumulation product, aromatic amino acids in
  phenylketonuria; or by supplying the essential end product from
  without the cell, the specific blood protein in hemophilia, or a
  specific essential nutrient molecule such as a vitamin.</p>

  <p>Time does not permit the continuation of these examples.
  Perhaps, however, I will be pardoned if I venture briefly on a
  few more predictions and hopes for the future.</p>

  <p>It does not seem unrealistic to expect that as more is learned
  about control of cell machinery and heredity, we will see the
  complete conquering of many of man's ills, including hereditary
  defects in metabolism, and the momentarily more obscure
  conditions such as cancer and the degenerative diseases, just as
  disease of bacterial and viral etiology are now being
  conquered.</p>

  <p>With a more complete understanding of the functioning and
  regulation of gene activity in development and differentiation,
  these processes may be more efficiently controlled and regulated,
  not only to avoid structural or metabolic errors in the
  developing organism, but also to produce better organisms.</p>

  <p>Perhaps within the lifetime of some of us here, the code of
  life processes tied up in the molecular structure of proteins and
  nucleic acids will be broken. This may permit the improvement of
  all living organisms by processes which we might call biological
  engineering.</p>

  <p>This might proceed in stages from the <i>in vitro</i>
  biosynthesis of better and more efficient enzymes, to the
  biosynthesis of the corresponding nucleic acid molecules, and to
  the introduction of these molecules into the genome of organisms,
  whether via injection, viral introduction into germ cells, or via
  a process analogous to transformation. Alternatively, it may be
  possible to reach the same goal by a process involving directed
  mutation.</p>

  <p>As a biologist, and more particularly as a geneticist, I have
  great faith in the versatility of the gene and of living
  organisms in providing the material with which to meet the
  challenges of life at any level. Selection, survival, and
  evolution take place in response to environmental pressures of
  all kinds, including sociological and intellectual. In the larger
  view, the dangerous and often poorly understood and controlled
  forces of modern civilization, including atomic energy and its
  attendant hazards, are but more complex and sophisticated
  environmental challenges of life. If man cannot meet those
  challenges, in a biological sense he is not fit to survive.</p>

  <p>However, it may confidently be hoped that with real
  understanding of the roles of heredity and environment, together
  with the consequent improvement in man's physical capacities and
  greater freedom from physical disease, will come an improvement
  in his approach to, and understanding of, sociological and
  economic problems. As in any scientific research, a problem
  clearly seen is already half solved. Hence, a renaissance may be
  foreseen, in which the major sociological problems will be
  solved, and mankind will take a big stride towards the state of
  world brotherhood and mutual trust and well being envisaged by
  that great humanitarian and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.</p>
