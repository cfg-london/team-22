  <h1>Rudolph A. Marcus - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="marcus.jpg" class="bio-img">My first encounters with McGill University
  came when I was still in a baby carriage. My mother used to wheel
  me about the campus when we lived in that neighborhood and, as
  she recounted years later, she would tell me that I would go to
  McGill. There was some precedent for my going there, since two of
  my father's brothers received their M.D.'s at McGill.<br>
  <br>
  I have always loved going to school. Since neither of my parents
  had a higher education, my academic "idols" were these two
  paternal uncles and one of their uncles, my great-uncle, Henrik
  Steen (n&eacute; Markus). My admiration for him, living in faraway
  Sweden, was not because of a teol.dr. (which he received from the
  University of Uppsala in 1915) nor because of the
  many books he wrote - I knew nothing of that - but rather because
  he was reputed to speak 13 languages. I learned decades later
  that the number was only 9! Growing up, mostly in Montreal, I was
  an only child of loving parents. I admired my father's athletic
  prowess - he excelled in several sports - and my mother's
  expressive singing and piano playing.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in the sciences started with mathematics in the very
  beginning, and later with chemistry in early high school and the
  proverbial home chemistry set. My education at Baron Byng High
  School was excellent, with dedicated masters (boys and girls were
  separate). I spent the next years at McGill University, for both
  undergraduate and, as was the custom of the time, graduate study.
  Our graduate supervisor, Carl A. Winkler, specialized in rates of
  chemical reactions. He himself had received his Ph.D. as a
  student of <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/hinshelwood-facts.html">Cyril Hinshelwood</a> at
  Oxford.
  Hinshelwood was later the recipient of the Nobel Prize for his
  work on chemical kinetics. Winkler brought to his laboratory an
  enthusiastic joyousness in research and was much loved by his
  students.<br>
  <br>
  During my McGill years, I took a number of math courses, more
  than other students in chemistry. Upon receiving a Ph.D. from
  McGill University in 1946, I joined the new post-doctoral program
  at the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa. This
  program at NRC later became famous, but at the time it was still
  in its infancy and our titles were Junior Research Officers. The
  photochemistry group was headed by E.W.R. Steacie, an
  international figure in the study of free-radical reactions and a
  major force in the development of the basic research program at
  NRC. I benefitted from the quality of his research on gas phase
  reaction rates. Like my research on chemical reaction rates in
  solution at McGill (kinetics of nitration), it was experimental
  in nature. There were no theoretical chemists in Canada at the
  time, and as students I don't think we ever considered how or
  where theories were conceived.<br>
  <br>
  About 1948 a fellow post-doctoral at NRC, Walter Trost, and I
  formed a two-man seminar to study theoretical papers related to
  our experimental work. This adventure led me to explore the
  possibility of going on a second post-doctoral, but in
  theoretical work, which seemed like a radical step at the time. I
  had a tendency to break the glass vacuum apparatus, due to a
  still present impetuous haste, with time-consuming consequences.
  Nevertheless, the realization that breaking a pencil point would
  have far less disastrous consequences played little or no role, I
  believe, in this decision to explore theory!<br>
  <br>
  I applied in 1948 to six well-known theoreticians in the U.S. for
  a postdoctoral research fellowship. The possibility that one of
  them might take on an untested applicant, an applicant hardly
  qualified for theoretical research, was probably too much to hope
  for. Oscar K. Rice at the University of North Carolina alone
  responded favorably, subject to the success of an application he
  would make to the Office of Naval Research for this purpose. It
  was, and in February 1949 I took the train south, heading for the
  University of North
  Carolina in Chapel Hill. I was impressed on arrival there by
  the red clay, the sandy walks, and the graciousness of the
  people.<br>
  <br>
  After that, I never looked back. Being exposed to theory,
  stimulated by a basic love of concepts and mathematics, was a
  marvelous experience. During the first three months I read
  everything I could lay my hands on regarding reaction rate
  theory, including Marcelin's classic 1915 theory which came
  within one small step of the Transition State Theory of 1935. I
  read numerous theoretical papers in German, a primary language
  for the "chemical dynamics" field in the 1920s and 1930s,
  attended my first formal course in quantum mechanics, given by
  Nathan Rosen in the Physics Department, and was guided by Oscar
  in a two-man weekly seminar in which I described a paper I had
  read and he pointed out assumptions in it that I had overlooked.
  My life as a working theorist began three months after this
  preliminary study and background reading, when Oscar gently
  nudged me toward working on a particular problem.<br>
  <br>
  Fortunately for me, Oscar's gamble paid off. Some three months
  later, I had formulated a particular case of what was later
  entitled by B. Seymour Rabinovitch, RRKM theory
  ("Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus"). In it, I blended statistical
  ideas from the RRK theory of the 1920s with those of the
  transition state theory of the mid-1930s. The work was published
  in 1951. In 1952 I wrote the generalization of it for other
  reactions. In addition, six months after arrival in Chapel Hill,
  I was also blessed by marriage to Laura Hearne, an attractive
  graduate student in sociology at UNC. She is here with me at this
  ceremony. Our three sons, Alan, Kenneth and Raymond, and two
  daughters-in-law are also present today.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951, I attempted to secure a faculty position. This effort
  met with little success (35 letters did not yield 35 no's, since
  not everyone replied!). Very fortunately, that spring I met Dean
  Raymond Kirk of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn at an
  American Chemical Society meeting in Cleveland, which I was
  attending primarily to seek a faculty position. This meeting with
  Dean Kirk, so vital for my subsequent career, was arranged by
  Seymour Yolles, a graduate student at UNC in a course I taught
  during Rice's illness. Seymour had been a student at Brooklyn
  Poly and learned, upon accidentally encountering Dr. Kirk, that
  Kirk was seeking new faculty. After a subsequent interview at
  Brooklyn Poly, I was hired, and life as a fully independent
  researcher began.<br>
  <br>
  I undertook an experimental research program on both gas phase
  and solution reaction rates, wrote the 1952 RRKM papers, and
  wondered what to do next in theoretical research. I felt at the
  time that it was pointless to continue with RRKM since few
  experimental data were available. Some of our experiments were
  intended to produce more.<br>
  <br>
  After some minor pieces of theoretical study that I worked on, a
  student in my statistical mechanics class brought to my attention
  a problem in polyelectrolytes. Reading everything I could about
  electrostatics, I wrote two papers on that topic in 1954/55. This
  electrostatics background made me fully ready in 1955 to treat a
  problem I had just read about on electron transfers. I comment on
  this next period on electron transfer research in my Nobel
  Lecture. About 1960, it became clear that it was best for me to
  bring the experimental part of my research program to a close -
  there was too much to do on the theoretical aspects - and I began
  the process of winding down the experiments. I spent a year and a
  half during 1960-61 at the Courant Mathematical Institute at
  New York
  University, auditing many courses which were, in part, beyond
  me, but which were, nevertheless, highly instructive.<br>
  <br>
  In 1964, I joined the faculty of the University of Illinois in
  Urbana-Champaign and I never undertook any further
  experiments there. At Illinois, my interests in electron transfer
  continued, together with interests in other aspects of reaction
  dynamics, including designing "natural collision coordinates",
  learning about action-angle variables, introducing the latter
  into molecular collisions, reaction dynamics, and later into
  semiclassical theories of collisions and of bound states, and
  spending much of my free time in the astronomy library learning
  more about classical mechanics, celestial mechanics,
  quasiperiodic motion, and chaos. I spent the academic year of
  1975-76 in Europe, first as Visiting Professor at the University
  of Oxford and later as a Humboldt Awardee at the Technical University
  of Munich, where I was first exposed to the problem of electron
  transfer in photosynthesis.<br>
  <br>
  In 1978, I accepted an offer from the California Institute of
  Technology to come there as the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor
  of Chemistry. My semiclassical interlude of 1970-80 was
  intellectually a very stimulating one, but it involved for me
  less interaction with experiments than had my earlier work on
  unimolecular reaction rates or on electron transfers.
  Accordingly, prompted by the extensive experimental work of my
  colleagues at Caltech in these fields of unimolecular reactions,
  intramolecular dynamics and of electron transfer processes, as
  well as by the rapidly growing experimental work in both broad
  areas world-wide, I turned once again to those particular topics
  and to the many new types of studies that were being made. Their
  scope and challenge continues to grow to this day in both fields.
  Life would be indeed easier if the experimentalists would only
  pause for a little while!<br>
  <br>
  There was a time when I had wondered about how much time and
  energy had been lost doing experiments during most of my stay at
  Brooklyn Poly- experiments on gas phase reactions, flash
  photolysis, isotopic exchange electron transfer, bipolar
  electrolytes, nitration, and photoelectrochemistry, among
  others-and during all of my stay at NRC and at McGill. In
  retrospect, I realized that this experimental background heavily
  flavored my attitude and interests in theoretical research. In
  the latter I drew, in most but not all cases, upon experimental
  findings or puzzles for theoretical problems to study. The growth
  of experiments in these fields has served as a continually
  rejuvenating influence. This interaction of experiment and
  theory, each stimulating the other, has been and continues to be
  one of the joys of my experience.<br>

  Honors received for the theoretical work include the Irving
  Langmair and the Peter Debye Awards of the American Chemical
  Society (1978, 1988), the Willard Gibbs, Theodore William
  Richards, and Pauling Medals, and the Remsen and Edgar Fahs Smith
  Awards, from various sections of the ACS, (1988, 1990, 1991,

  Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry (1982, 1988), Columbia
  University's Chandler Medal (1983) and Ohio State's William Lloyd
  Evans Award (1990), a Professorial Fellowship at University
  College, Oxford (1975 to 1976) and a Visiting Professorship in
  Theoretical Chemistry at Oxford during that period, the Wolf
  Prize in Chemistry (1985), the National Medal of Science (1989),
  the Hirschfelder Prize in Chemistry (1993), election to the
  National Academy of Sciences (1970), the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences (1973), the American Philosophical Society (1990),
  honorary membership in the Royal Society of Chemistry (1991), and
  foreign membership in the Royal Society (London) (1987) and in
  the Royal Society of Canada (1993). Honorary degrees were
  conferred by the University of Chicago and by Goteborg,
  Polytechnic, McGill, and Queen's Universities and by the
  University of New Brunswick (1983, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1993, 1993).
