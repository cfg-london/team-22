  <h1>Christiaan Eijkman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="eijkman.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Christiaan
  Eijkman</b> was born on August 11, 1858, at Nijkerk in Gelderland
  (The Netherlands), the seventh child of Christiaan Eijkman, the
  headmaster of a local school, and Johanna Alida Pool.<br>
  <br>
  A year later, in 1859, the Eijkman family moved to Zaandam, where
  his father was appointed head of a newly founded school for
  advanced elementary education. It was here that Christiaan and
  his brothers received their early education. In 1875, after
  taking his preliminary examinations, Eijkman became a student at
  the Military Medical School of the University of
  Amsterdam, where he was trained as a medical officer for the
  Netherlands Indies Army, passing through all his examinations
  with honours.<br>
  <br>
  From 1879 to 1881, he was an assistant of T. Place, Professor of
  Physiology, during which time he wrote his thesis <i>On
  Polarization of the Nerves</i>, which gained him his doctor's
  degree, with honours, on July 13, 1883. That same year he left
  Holland for the Indies, where he was made medical officer of
  health first in Semarang later at Tjilatjap, a small village on
  the south coast of Java, and at Padang Sidempoean in W. Sumatra.
  It was at Tjilatjap that he caught malaria which later so
  impaired his health that he, in 1885, had to return to Europe on
  sick-leave.<br>
  <br>
  For Eijkman this was to prove a lucky event, as it enabled him to
  work in E. Forster's laboratory in Amsterdam, and also in
  <a href="../1905/index.html">Robert Koch</a>'s bacteriological
  laboratory in Berlin; here he came into contact with A. C.
  Pekelharing and C. Winkler, who were visiting the German capital
  before their departure to the Indies. In this way medical officer
  Christiaan Eijkman was seconded as assistant to the
  Pekelharing-Winkler mission, together with his colleague M. B.
  Romeny. This mission had been sent out by the Dutch Government to
  conduct investigations into beriberi, a disease which at that
  time was causing havoc in that region.<br>
  <br>
  In 1887, Pekelharing and Winkler were recalled, but before their
  departure Pekelharing proposed to the Governor General that the
  laboratory which had been temporarily set up for the Commission
  in the Military Hospital in Batavia should be made permanent.
  This proposal was readily accepted, and Christiaan Eijkman was
  appointed its first Director, at the same time being made
  Director of the "Dokter Djawa School" (Javanese Medical School).
  Thus ended Eijkman's short military career - now he was able to
  devote himself entirely to science.<br>
  <br>
  Eijkman was Director of the "Geneeskundig Laboratorium" (Medical
  Laboratory) from January 15, 1888 to March 4, 1896, and during
  that time he made a number of his most important researches.
  These dealt first of all with the physiology of people living in
  tropical regions. He was able to demonstrate that a number of
  theories had no factual basis. Firstly he proved that in the
  blood of Europeans living in the tropics the number of red
  corpuscles, the specific gravity, the serum, and the water
  content, undergo no change, at least when the blood is not
  affected by disease which will ultimately lead to anaemia.
  Comparing the metabolism of the European with that of the native,
  he found that in the tropics as well in the temperate zone, this
  is entirely governed by the work carried out. Neither could he
  find any disparity in respiratory metabolism, perspiration, and
  temperature regulation. Thus Eijkman put an end to a number of
  speculations on the acclimatization of Europeans in the tropics
  which had hitherto necessitated the taking of various
  precautions.<br>
  <br>
  But Eijkman's greatest work was in an entirely different field.
  He discovered, after the departure of Pekelharing and Winkler,
  that the real cause of beriberi was the deficiency of some vital
  substance in the staple food of the natives, which is located in
  the so-called "silver skin" (pericarpium) of the rice. This
  discovery has led to the concept of vitamins. This important
  achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
  for 1929. This late recognition of his outstanding merits has
  ended all criticism of his work. In addition to his work on
  beriberi, he occupied himself with other problems such as arach
  fermentation, and indeed still had time to write two textbooks
  for his students at the Java Medical School, one on physiology
  and the other on organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 he became successor to G. Van Overbeek de Meyer, as
  Professor in Hygiene and Forensic Medicine at Utrecht. His
  inaugural speech was entitled <i>Over Gezondheid en Ziekten in
  Tropische Gewesten</i> (On health and diseases in tropical
  regions). At Utrecht, Eijkman turned to the study of
  bacteriology, and carried out his well-known fermentation test,
  by means of which it can be readily established if water has been
  polluted by human and animal defaecation containing coli bacilli.
  Another research was into the rate of mortality of bacteria as a
  result of various external factors, whereby he was able to show
  that this process could not be represented by a logarithmic
  curve. This was followed by his investigation of the phenomenon
  that the rate of growth of bacteria on solid substratum often
  decreases, finally coming to a halt. Beyerinck's auxanographic
  method was applied on several occasions by Eijkman, as for
  example during the secretion of enzymes which break down casein
  or bring about haemolysis, whereby he could demonstrate the
  hydrolysis of fats under the influence of lipases.<br>
  <br>
  As a lecturer he was known for his clarity of speech and
  demonstration, his great practical knowledge standing him in good
  stead. He had a preeminently critical mind and he continuously
  warned his students against the acceptance of dogmas. But Eijkman
  did not confine himself to the University he also engaged himself
  in problems of water supply, housing, school hygiene, physical
  education; as a member of the Gezondheidsraad (Health Council)
  and the Gezondheidscommissie (Health Commission) he participated
  in the struggle against alcoholism and tuberculosis. He was the
  founder of the Vereeniging tot Bestrijding van de Tuberculose
  (Society for the struggle against tuberculosis ).<br>
  <br>
  His unassuming personality has contributed to the fact that his
  great merits were at first not really appreciated in his own
  country; but anyone who had the privilege of coming into close
  contact with him, quickly perceived his keen intellect and
  extensive knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  In 1907, Eijkman was appointed Member of the Royal Academy of
  Sciences (The Netherlands), after having been Correspondent
  since 1895. The Dutch Government conferred upon him several
  orders of knighthood, whereas on the occasion of the 25th
  anniversary of his professorship a fund has been established to
  enable the awarding of the Eijiman Medal. But the crown of all
  his work was the award of the Nobel Prize in 1929.<br>
  <br>
  Eijkman was holder of the John Scott Medal, Philadelphia, and
  Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. He was
  also Honorary Fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute in
  London.<br>
  <br>
  In 1883, before his departure to the Indies, Eijkman married
  Aaltje Wigeri van Edema, who died in 1886. In Batavia, Professor
  Eijkman married Bertha Julie Louise van der Kemp in 1888; a son,
  Pieter Hendrik, who became a physician, was born in 1890.<br>
  <br>
  He died in Utrecht, on November 5, 1930, after a protracted
  illness.</p>
