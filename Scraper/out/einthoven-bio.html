  <h1>Willem Einthoven - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="einthoven.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Willem Einthoven</b> was born on May 21, 1860, in Semarang on
  the island of Java, in the former Dutch East Indies (now
  Indonesia). His father was Jacob Einthoven, born and educated in
  Groningen, The Netherlands, an army medical officer in the
  Indies, who later became parish doctor in Semarang. His mother
  was Louise M.M.C. de Vogel, daughter of the then Director of
  Finance in the Indies. Willem was the eldest son, and the third
  child in a family of three daughters and three sons.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of six, Einthoven lost his father. Four years later
  his mother decided to return with her six children to Holland,
  where the family settled in Utrecht.<br>
  <br>
  After having passed the "Hogere Burgerschool" (secondary school),
  he in 1878 entered the University of Utrecht as a medical student,
  intending to follow in his father's footsteps. His exceptional
  abilities, however, began to develop in quite a different
  direction. After being assistant to the ophthalmologist H.
  Snellen Sr. in the renowned eye-hospital "Gasthuis voor
  Ooglidders", he made two investigations, both of which attracted
  widespread interest. The first was carried out after Einthoven
  had gained his "candidaat" diploma (approximately equivalent to
  the B.Sc. degree), under the direction of the anatomist W.
  Koster, and was entitled "Quelques remarques sur le
  m&eacute;canisme de l'articulation du coude" (Some remarks on the
  elbow joint). Later he worked in close association with the great
  physiologist F.C. Donders, under whose guidance he undertook his
  second study, which was published in 1885 as his doctor's thesis:
  "Stereoscopie door kleurverschil." (Stereoscopy by means of
  colour variation) - one of Einthoven's teachers was the physicist
  C.H.D. Buys Ballot, who discovered the well-known law in
  meteorology.<br>
  <br>
  That same year, 1885, he was appointed successor to A. Heynsius,
  Professor of Physiology at the University of Leiden, which he took up after having
  qualified as general practitioner in January, 1886. His inaugural
  address was entitled "De leer der specifieke energieen" (The
  theory of specific energies). His first important research in
  Leiden was published in 1892: "&Uuml;ber die Wirkung der
  Bronchialmuskeln nach einer neuen Methode untersucht, und
  &uuml;ber Asthma nervosum" (On the function of the bronchial
  muscles investigated by a new method, and on nervous asthma), a
  study of great merit, mentioned as "a great work" in Nagel's
  "Handbuch der Physiologie". At that time he also began research
  into optics, the study of which occupied him ever since. Some
  publications in this field were: "Eine einfache physiologische
  Erkl&auml;rung f&uuml;r verschiedene geometrisch-optische
  T&auml;uschungen" (A simple physiological explanation for various
  geometric-optical illusions ) in 1898; "Die Accommodation des
  menschlichen Auges" (The accommodation of the human eye) in 1902;
  "The form and magnitude of the electric response of the eye to
  stimulation by light at various intensities", with W.A. Jolly in
  1908.<br>
  <br>
  Up till now, his talents had not yet been developed to the full.
  This opportunity came when he began the task of registering
  accurately the heart sounds, using a capillary electrometer. With
  this in view, he investigated the theoretical principles of this
  instrument, and devised methods of obtaining the necessary
  stability, and of correcting mathematically the errors in the
  photographically registered results due to the inertia of the
  instrument. Having found these methods he decided to carry out a
  thorough analysis of A.D. Waller's electrocardiogram - a study
  which has remained classic in its field.<br>
  <br>
  This investigation led Einthoven to intensify his research. To
  avoid complex mathematical corrections, he finally devised the
  string galvanometer which did not involve these calculations.
  Although the principle in itself was obvious, and practical
  applications of it were made in other fields of study, the
  instrument had to be precisioned and refined to make it usable
  for physiologists, and this took three years of laborious work.
  As a result of this, a galvanometer was produced which could be
  used in medical science as well as in technology; an instrument
  which was incomparable in its adaptability and speed of
  adjustment.<br>
  <br>
  He then, with P. Battaerd, took up the study of the heart sounds,
  followed by research into the retina currents with W.A. Jolly
  (begun earlier with H. K. de Haas). The electrocardiogram itself
  he studied in all its aspects with numerous pupils and with
  visiting scientists. It was this last research which earned him
  the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1924. In addition
  to this the string galvanometer has proved of the highest value
  for the study of the periphery and sympathetic nerves.<br>
  <br>
  In the remaining years of his life, problems of acoustics and
  capacity studies came within the sphere of his interests. The
  construction of the string phonograph (1923) could be considered
  as a consequence of this.<br>
  <br>
  Einthoven possessed the gift of being able to devote himself
  entirely to a particular field of study. (His genius was actually
  more orientated towards physics than physiology.) As a result he
  was able to make penetrating inquiries into almost any subject
  which came within the scope of his interests, and to carry out
  his work to its logical conclusion.<br>
  <br>
  Einthoven was a great believer in physical education. In his
  student days he was a keen sportsman, repeatedly urging his
  comrades "not to let the body perish". (He was President of the
  Gymnastics and Fencing Union, and was one of the founders of the
  Utrecht Student Rowing Club.) His first study on the
  elbow joint resulted from a broken wrist suffered while pursuing
  one of his favourite sports, and during the somewhat involuntary
  confinement his interest was awakened in the pro- and supination
  movements of the hand and the functions of the shoulder and elbow
  joints.<br>
  <br>
  The string galvanometer has led countless investigators to study
  the functions and diseases of the heart muscle. The laboratory at
  Leiden became a place of pilgrimage, visited by scientists from
  all over the world. For this, suffering mankind has much to owe
  to Einthoven. In electrocardiography the string galvanometer is
  the most reliable tool. Although it has been superseded by
  portable types and by models utilizing amplification techniques
  used in radio communication (Einthoven has always mistrusted the
  use of condensers, fearing the distortion of curves), cardiograms
  from the string galvanometer have remained the standard of
  reference in numerous cases to this day.<br>
  <br>
  Einthoven was a member of the Dutch Royal Academy
  of Sciences, the meetings of which he hardly ever missed. He
  frequently took part in the debates himself, and his sharp
  criticism frequently found weaknesses in many a lecture.<br>
  <br>
  Einthoven married in 1886 Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Jeanne Louise de
  Vogel, a cousin, and sister of Dr. W.Th. de Vogel, former
  Director of the Dienst der Volksgezondheid (Public Health
  Service) in the Dutch East Indies. There were four children:
  Augusta (b. 1887), who was married to R. Clevering, an engineer;
  Louise (b. 1889), married to J.A.R. Terlet, pastor emeritus;
  Willem (1893-1945) - a brilliant electro-technical engineer who
  was responsible for the development of the vacuum model of the
  string galvanometer and for its use in wireless communication,
  and who was Director of the Radio Laboratory in Bandung, Java;
  and Johanna (b. 1897), a physician.<br>
  <br>
  He died on the 29th of September, 1927, after long suffering.</p>
