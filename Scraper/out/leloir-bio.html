  <h1>Luis Leloir - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="leloir.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Luis F. Leloir</b> was born in Paris
  of Argentine parents on September 6, 1906 and has lived in Buenos
  Aires since he was two years old. He graduated as a Medical
  Doctor in the University of Buenos Aires in 1932 and started his
  scientific career at the Institute of Physiology working with
  Professor Bernardo A. Houssay on the role of the adrenalin
  carbohydrate metabolism. In 1936 he worked at the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge, England, which
  was directed by <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/index.html">Sir
  Frederick Gowland Hopkins</a>. There he collaborated with Malcom
  Dixon, N.L. Edson and D.E. Green. On returning to Buenos Aires he
  worked with J.M. Mu&ntilde;oz on the oxidation of fatty acids in
  liver, and also together with E. Braun Men&eacute;ndez, J.C.
  Fasciolo and A.C. Taquini on the formation of angiotensin. In
  1944 he was Research Assistant in Dr. Carl F. Cori's laboratory
  in St. Louis, United States and thereafter worked with D.E. Green
  in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia
  University, New York. Since then he has been Director of the
  Instituto de Investigaciones Bioqu&iacute;micas, Fundaci&oacute;n
  Campomar. With his early collaborators, Ranwel Caputto, Carlos E.
  Cardini, Ra&uacute;l Trucco and Alejandro C. Paladini work was
  started on the metabolism of galactose which led to the isolation
  of glucose 1,6-diphosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose. The
  latter substance was then found to act as glucose donor in the
  synthesis of trehalose (with Enrico Cabib, 1953 ) and sucrose
  (with Carlos E. Cardini and J.Chiriboga, 1955). Other sugar
  nucleotides such as uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine and
  guanosine diphosphate mannose were also isolated. Further work
  showed that uridine diphosphate glucose is involved in glycogen
  synthesis and adenosine diphosphate glucose in that of
  starch.<br>
  <br>
  More recent investigations (with Nicol&aacute;s Behrens) have dealt
  with the role of a polyprenol, dolichol, in glucose transfer in
  animal tissues.<br>

  Luis Leloir was married in 1943 to Amelia Zuberbuhler and has a
  daughter, Amelia. At present Leloir is Professor in the Faculty
  of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires. He is a member of the
  following academies; National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences, Academia Nacional de Medicina, American
  Philosophical Society, Pontificial Academy of Sciences, and
  Honorary Member of the Biochemical Society (England). He has
  received honorary degrees of the following universities: Granada
  (Spain), Paris (France), Tucuman (Argentina) and La Plata
  (Argentina). Prof. Leloir has received the following awards:
  Argentine Scientific Society, Helen Hay Whitney Foundation
  (United States), Severo Vaccaro Foundation (Argentina), Bunge and
  Born Foundation (Argentina), Gairdner Foundation (Canada), Louisa
  Gross Horowitz (United States), Benito Juarez (Mexico); and at
  present he is President of the Pan-American Association of
  Biochemical Societies.</p>
