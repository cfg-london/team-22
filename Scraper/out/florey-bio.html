  <h1>Sir Howard Florey - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="florey.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Sir Howard
  Walter Florey</b> was born on September 24, 1898, at Adelaide,
  South Australia, the son of Joseph and Bertha Mary Florey. His
  early education was at St. Peter's Collegiate School, Adelaide,
  following which he went on to Adelaide
  University where he graduated M.B., B.S. in 1921. He was
  awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College,
  Oxford, leading to the degrees of B.Sc. and M.A. (1924). He then
  went to Cambridge as a John Lucas Walker Student. In 1925 he
  visited the United States on a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship
  for a year, returning in 1926 to a Fellowship at Gonville and Caius
  College, Cambridge, receiving here his Ph.D. in 1927. He also
  held at this time the Freedom Research Fellowship at the London
  Hospital. In 1927 he was appointed Huddersfield Lecturer in
  Special Pathology at Cambridge. In 1931 he succeeded to the
  Joseph Hunter Chair of Pathology at the University of
  Sheffield.<br>
  <br>
  Leaving Sheffield in 1935 he became Professor of Pathology and a
  Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. He was made an Honorary
  Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1946 and an
  Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford in 1952. In 1962 he
  was made Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  During World War II he was appointed Honorary Consultant in
  Pathology to the Army and in 1944 he became Nuffield Visiting
  Professor to Australia and New Zealand.<br>
  <br>
  His best-known work dates from his collaboration with <a href=
  "index.html">Chain</a>, which began in 1938 when they conducted a
  systematic investigation of the properties of naturally occurring
  antibacterial substances. Lysozyme, an antibacterial substance
  found in saliva and human tears, was their original interest, but
  their interest moved to substances now known as antibiotics. The
  work on penicillin was a result of this interest.<br>
  <br>
  Penicillin had been discovered by Fleming in 1928 as a result of
  observations on a mould which developed on some germ culture
  plates but the active substance was not isolated. In 1939, Florey
  and Chain headed a team of British scientists, financed by a
  grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, whose efforts led to the
  successful small-scale manufacture of the drug from the liquid
  broth in which it grows. In 1940 a report was issued describing
  how penicillin had been found to be a chemotherapeutic agent
  capable of killing sensitive germs in the living body. Thereafter
  great efforts were made, with government assistance, to enable
  sufficient quantities of the drug to be made for use in World War
  II to treat war wounds.<br>
  <br>
  Florey was a contributor to, and Editor of, <i>Antibiotics</i>
  (1949). He was also part-author of a book of lectures on general
  pathology and has had many papers published on physiology and
  pathology.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Florey has had many honours bestowed upon him. Among these
  may be mentioned the Lister Medal of the Royal College of
  Surgeons, the Berzelius Medal of the Swedish Medical Society, the
  Royal and Copley Medals of the Royal Society, the Medal of Merit
  of the U. S. Army, and many others.<br>
  <br>
  He is President of the Royal Society since 1960 and a Fellow of the
  Royal College of Physicians, and among other honorary fellowships
  he holds is that of the Royal Australian College of
  Physicians.<br>
  <br>
  He has been awarded honorary degrees by seventeen universities
  and is a member or honorary member of many learned societies and
  academies in the field of medicine and biology.<br>
  <br>
  In 1944 he was created a Knight Bachelor.<br>
  <br>
  He married Mary Ethel Hayter Reed in 1926. They have two
  children, Paquita Mary Joanna and Charles du V&eacute;.</p>
