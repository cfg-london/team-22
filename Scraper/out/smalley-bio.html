  <h1>Richard E. Smalley - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="smalley.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  Akron, Ohio on June 6, 1943, one year to the day before D-Day,
  the allied invasion at Normandy. The youngest of four children, I
  was brought up in a wonderfully stable, loving family of strong
  Midwestern values. When I was three my family moved to Kansas
  City, Missouri where we lived in a beautiful large home in a
  lovely upper-middle class neighborhood. I grew up there (at least
  to the extent one can be considered to be grown up on leaving for
  college at age 18) and was convinced that Kansas City, Missouri
  was the exact center of the known universe.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Esther Virginia Rhoads, was the third of six children
  of Charlotte Kraft and Errett Stanley Rhoads, a wealthy
  manufacturer of furniture in the Kansas City area. She liked the
  unusual name Errett so much that she gave it to me as my middle
  name. She picked the name Richard after the crusading English
  king (the Lion-Hearted), but being a good American and suitably
  suspicious of royalty, she was fond of calling me "Mr. President"
  instead. She had big plans for me, and loved me beyond all
  reason.<br>
  <br>
  My father, Frank Dudley Smalley, Jr., was the second of four
  children born to Mary Rice Burkholder and Frank Dudley Smalley
  (Sr.), a railroad mail clerk in Kansas City. Although my father
  went by the name of June (short for Junior), he never quite
  forgave his father for not having given him a name of his own,
  and for not having aspired to more in life. My father started
  work as a carpenter, and then as a printer's devil, working for
  the local newspaper, <i>The Kansas City Star,</i> and later for a
  farm implement trade journal, <i>Implement and Tractor.</i> By
  the time he retired in 1963 he had long since risen to be CEO of
  this company, and a group of several others that published trade
  journals in the booming agriculture industry throughout the
  Western Hemisphere. He was incredibly industrious, talented, and
  fascinated with both business and technology. He had a
  wonderfully analytic mind, and loved argument, open discussion,
  and homespun philosophy. During the depression in the early
  1930's he married my mother (who fell in love with his blue eyes)
  and was promptly laid off from work. The story of his career is
  one of total dedication to both his work and his family, a
  dedication that held steady through a series of tribulations, many
  of which I am only now beginning to appreciate. He loved me too,
  but he could see himself in me, and knew my failings through and
  through. Until late in life I was never quite good enough for my
  father, and I suppose that is part of what drives me even now,
  well after his death in 1992.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in Science had many roots. Some came from my mother
  as she finished her B.A. Degree studies in college while I was in
  my early teens. She fell in love with science, particularly as a
  result of classes on the Foundations of Physical Science taught
  by a magnificent mathematics professor at the University of Kansas
  City, Dr. Norman N. Royall, Jr. I was infected by this
  professor second hand, through hundreds of hours of conversations
  at my mother's knees. It was from my mother that I first learned
  of Archimedes, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and
  Darwin. We spent hours together collecting single-celled
  organisms from a local pond and watching them with a microscope
  she had received as a gift from my father. Mostly we talked and
  read together. From her I learned the wonder of ideas and the
  beauty of Nature (and music, painting, sculpture, and
  architecture). From my father I learned to build things, to take
  them apart, and to fix mechanical and electrical equipment in
  general. I spent vast hours in a woodworking shop he maintained
  in the basement of our house, building gadgets, working both with
  my father and alone, often late into the night. My mother taught
  me mechanical drawing so that I could be more systematic in my
  design work, and I continued in drafting classes throughout my 4
  years in high school. This play with building, fixing, and
  designing was my favorite activity throughout my childhood, and
  was a wonderful preparation for my later career as an
  experimentalist working on the frontiers of chemistry and
  physics.<br>
  <br>
  The principal impetus for my entering a career in science,
  however, was the successful launching of Sputnik in 1957, and the
  then current belief that science and technology was going to be
  where the action was in the coming decades. While I had been a
  rather erratic student for many years, I suddenly became very
  serious with my education at the beginning of my junior year in
  the fall of 1959. I set up a private study in the partly
  furnished, unheated attic of our home, and began to spend long
  hours in solitude studying and reading (and smoking cigarettes).
  This happened to be the year when I began to study chemistry for
  the first time. Luckily, these years were some of the best ever
  for the public school system in Kansas City, and my local high
  school, Southwest High, was one of the most effective anywhere in
  the US as measured by scores on standard achievement tests, and
  the fraction of students going on to college. My teacher, Victor
  E. Gustafson, was a great inspiration. He had just begun to teach
  the preceding year, and was full of love for his subject and for
  teaching, and had an as yet unblunted ambition to reach even the
  slowest of students. In addition, this was the first class I had
  ever taken with my sister, Linda, who was a year older than I,
  and was a far better student than I had ever been. The result was
  that by the end of the year, my sister and I finished with the
  top two grades in the class. We hardly ever missed a question on
  an exam. It was an exhilarating experience for me, and still
  ranks as the single most important turning point in my life, even
  from my current perspective of nearly four decades later. It was
  the proof of an existence theorem. After my junior year, I knew I
  could be successful at science. The next year I did equally well
  in physics with a wonderful professor, J.C. Edwards, but my soul
  had already been imprinted by my exposure to chemistry the year
  before.<br>
  <br>
  My mother's youngest sibling, Dr. Sara Jane Rhoads, was one of
  the first women in the United States to ever reach the rank of
  full Professor of Chemistry. After earning her Ph.D. in 1949 with
  William von Eggers Doering, who was then at Columbia
  University, she devoted her life to teaching and research in
  the Department of Chemistry of the University of Wyoming. She received the
  Garvan Medal of the American Chemical Society in 1982 for her
  contributions to physical organic chemistry, particularly in the
  study of the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. She was the only
  scientist in our extended family and was one of the brightest
  and, in general, one of the most impressive human beings I have
  ever met. She was my hero. I used to call her, lovingly, "The
  Colossus of Rhoads". Her example was a major factor that led me
  to go into chemistry, rather than physics or engineering. One of
  the most enjoyable memories of my early life was the summer
  (1961) I spent working in her organic chemistry laboratory at the
  University of Wyoming. It was at her suggestion that I decided to
  attend Hope College that fall in Holland, Michigan. Hope had then
  (and still has now) one of the finest undergraduate programs in
  chemistry in the United States.<br>
  <br>
  At Hope College I spent two years in fruitful study, but decided
  to transfer to the University of Michigan in Ann Arborafter my favorite
  professor, Dr. J. Harvey Kleinheksel, died of a heart attack, and
  the organic chemistry professor with whom I had hoped to do
  research, Dr. Gerrit Van Zyl, announced his retirement. While the
  next two years in Ann Arbor were successful, I had become so
  entangled in a stormy love affair with a lovely girl back at Hope
  College, that I was not able to concentrate as much on science as
  I should have. I did, however, learn a lot. Most of all I learned
  from my fellow students, and particularly from John Seely Brown,
  a graduate student in mathematics who lived in an apartment down
  the hall in a small house off campus (he is currently Director of
  Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC). John displayed an
  audacity of thought and intellectual ambition that I have rarely
  seen in any individual. My fellow housemates and I were infected
  with the notion that we could master any subject, and at times we
  did manage to at least feel that we got close.<br>
  <br>
  By the time of my graduation in 1965, the job market for
  scientists in the United States was at an all-time high, and even
  chemistry graduates with just a BS degree were in great demand.
  Rather than proceeding directly to graduate school, I decided to
  take a job in the chemical industry in order to buy a bit of time
  to see what I really wanted to do in science, and to live a
  little in the "real" world. It turned out to be a terrific
  decision.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1965 I began work full time in Woodbury, New
  Jersey at a large polypropylene manufacturing plant owned by the
  Shell Chemical Company. I began as a chemist working in the
  quality control laboratory for the plant, a 24 hour a day
  operation that in the mid 60's was quite a wonderland of high
  technology. My first boss was a chemist named Donald S. Brath. He
  taught his young professionals that "chemists can do anything",
  and the time I worked under him was a wonderfully broadening
  experience. I was teamed up with chemical engineers at the plant
  to study problems with the quality of the polymer product. The
  Ziegler-Natta catalyst system then in use by Shell to produce
  isotactic polypropylene was no where near as efficient as those
  currently in use, and the level of inorganics remaining in the
  polymer was high. Much of what we were concerned with in those
  days revolved around this problem of high "ash" content and how
  it affected the downstream applications. These were fascinating
  days, involving huge volumes of material, serious real-world
  problems, with large financial consequences. I loved it.<br>
  <br>
  After two years I moved up to the Plastics Technical Center at
  the same site in Woodbury, and devoted myself to developing
  analytical methods for various aspects of polyolefins, and of the
  materials involved in their manufacture, modification, and
  processing. Although I found my work at Shell highly enjoyable, I
  realized it was time to get on to graduate school, so I began to
  study seriously and to send out applications. At the time I was
  most interested in quantum chemistry, and received several offers
  for graduate assistantships in excellent schools. I was close to
  accepting an offer from the Theoretical Chemistry Institute at
  the University of Wisconsin when the automatic graduate student
  deferments from the Draft into the US military were eliminated.
  This was in early 1968, during a major buildup phase in the
  Vietnam War, and I decided it would be more prudent to remain at
  Shell for a while since my industrial deferment was still in
  effect.<br>
  <br>
  In my off hours over the past few years I had met Judith Grace
  Sampieri, who was a wonderful young secretary at Shell. We were
  married on May 4 of 1968. Soon thereafter, even the industrial
  deferment was lost, and we decided that I might as well reapply
  for graduate school. Since Judy's family lived in New Jersey, I
  decided to apply to Princeton University, and was accepted. In the late
  fall of 1968 I was reclassified 1A for the draft and reported to
  the processing center in Newark for my physical. At the end of
  the day I ended up in the group who had passed. We were told to
  put our affairs in order since we would soon be called up.
  However, in a great stroke of luck, within a week, my wife told
  me she was pregnant, and within just a few more weeks my draft
  board reclassified me to some status I do not remember, save that
  it meant I would not be drafted. On June 9, 1969 Judy and I were
  blessed with the birth of a beautiful child, Chad Richard. Later
  that summer, I held him in my lap as Neil Armstrong first stepped
  out onto the Moon.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1969 I moved my new family up to Princeton to
  begin studies and research for the Ph.D. in the Department of
  Chemistry. I was lucky enough to be in the first group of
  graduate students to work with Elliot R. Bernstein who was just
  starting as an Assistant Professor at Princeton, after having
  spent a few years postdoctoral work at the University of
  Chicago with Clyde A. Hutchison III, following doctoral
  training with G. Wilse Robinson at CalTech. Elliot's research at
  the time involved detailed optical and microwave spectral probes
  of pure and mixed molecular single crystals cooled in liquid
  helium. I knew nothing about it at the time I joined the group. I
  was certain that it was going to be both experimentally and
  theoretically complex and challenging, but it seemed likely to be
  worth the effort. My research project was the detailed study of
  1,3,5-triazine, a heterocyclic benzene analog that we expected
  would provide a poignant testing ground for theories of the Jahn
  Teller effect. In the end we found that the crystal field
  surrounding each molecule was insufficiently symmetrical to
  provide the tests we originally sought, but much was learned.
  Most importantly from my standpoint, I learned from Elliot
  Bernstein a penetrating, intense style of research that I had
  never known before, and I learned a great deal about the chemical
  physics of condensed phase and molecular systems.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1973 we moved to the south side of Chicago so I
  could begin a postdoctoral period with Donald H. Levy at the
  University of Chicago. Levy had studied gas-phase magnetic
  resonance with Alan Carrington, and had been doing some of the
  most impressive research anywhere in the world with
  microwave/optical double resonance and the Hanle effect on
  NO<sub>2</sub> and other open-shell small molecules. These were
  the earliest days when tunable dye lasers were beginning to
  transform molecular spectroscopy, and Levy's group was in the
  lead. The optical spectrum of NO<sub>2</sub> was the most
  troublesome problem for molecular spectroscopists. Even though it
  had only three atoms, the visible spectrum had far more structure
  than anyone could understand. But since NO<sub>2</sub> was
  readily available and it displayed an extensive absorption
  spectrum just where the new lasers could readily operate (500-640
  nm), it was a favorite object for study. Don Levy and one of his
  students, Richard Solarz, had made some major advances with
  NO<sub>2</sub> earlier that summer, so after I arrived in Chicago
  I began to consider what I could do next. My biggest problem was
  that my training at Princeton had been in condensed matter
  spectroscopy, and the ultrahigh resolution gas-phase spectral
  techniques being used by the Levy group were going to take months
  to understand. The detailed physics of rotating polyatomic
  molecules with spin is extremely complex. I was familiar only
  with the physics of molecules frozen still in a crystal lattice
  near absolute zero.<br>
  <br>
  When we first arrived in Chicago, Don Levy was in Germany for a
  several month-long visit, so I had an opportunity to do some
  extended reading and to prepare for the final oral exam for the
  Ph.D. degree back in Princeton. At that time in the Chemistry
  Department at Princeton, the final oral exam consisted of a
  defense of three original research proposals. I spent many hours
  in the Univ. Chicago chemistry department library reading recent
  journal articles, searching for possible topics for these
  research proposals. On one day I read a new paper by <a href=
  "../1986/index.html">Yuan Lee</a> and Stuart Rice on the crossed
  beam reaction of fluorine with benzene (<i>J. Chem. Phys.</i>
  <b>59</b>, 1427 (1973)] in one of Yuan's "universal" molecular
  beam apparatuses. It was the sort of experiment that was to lead
  to Yuan Lee sharing the Nobel Prize in 1986 with <a href=
  "../1986/index.html">John Polanyi</a> and <a href=
  "../1986/index.html">Dudley Herschbach</a>. I was deeply struck
  by a passage in the paper which said that the supersonic
  expansion used to make the benzene molecular beam was strong
  enough to cool out essentially all rotational degrees of freedom.
  That was just what I needed. Since I didn't understand rotating
  molecules yet, perhaps I could just stop them from rotating in
  the first place!<br>
  <br>
  As a result of this exciting day in the Chicago library, one of
  the proposals I presented to the Princeton Ph.D. committee later
  that fall was to use a supersonic expansion to cool
  NO<sub>2</sub> to the point that only a single rotational state
  was populated, and then to use a tunable dye laser to study the
  now greatly simplified spectrum. I had found in further reading
  that the current supersonic expansion techniques actually would
  not get cold enough, so I added the further use of an electric
  resonance "state-selector" to do a final sorting out of just a
  single rotational state for study. I recommended, in fact, that
  the 10 meter state-selector beam machine of Lennard Wharton at
  Chicago could be used.<br>
  <br>
  When Levy returned from Germany, I told him of this proposal, and
  we discussed it in some depth. He was intrigued, but was
  concerned that too much of the NO<sub>2</sub> would dimerize to
  N<sub>2</sub>0<sub>4</sub> before sufficient cooling was
  obtained. A few weeks later we discussed it again, and became
  sufficiently excited to walk down the hall and ask Lennard
  Wharton what he thought. Len lit up like a light bulb.<br>
  <br>
  Wharton argued that we should first do the experiment on
  NO<sub>2</sub> expanded in a supersonic free jet, and leave the
  much more elaborate state-selected experiment for later. I told
  him that wouldn't be cold enough - the lowest rotational
  temperature reported for a polyatomic molecule in a supersonic
  beam that I was aware of at that time was 30 K still way too hot
  to achieve the simplification we needed. Wharton smiled wryly and
  swiveled in his chair to reach a research notebook from the shelf
  behind him. After reading a few pages he looked up and asked
  "would 3 K be cool enough?". He had already built a liquid
  hydrogen cryopumped supersonic beam source with argon, and in the
  research notebook had measured data for the velocity distribution
  showing the translational temperature was cooled to 3 K. That, I
  knew from my Ph.D. proposal, would be quite cool enough in the
  case of NO<sub>2</sub> to collapse the rotational population to
  just a few levels. We would simply mix in a percent or so of
  NO<sub>2</sub> into the argon and make a "seeded" supersonic
  beam. This would avoid the N<sub>2</sub>0<sub>4</sub> formation
  that concerned Don Levy, and may just possibly cool the
  rotational degrees of freedom to near the translational
  temperature of the argon carrier gas. Thus began the
  collaboration that led to supersonic beam laser
  spectroscopy.<br>
  <br>
  On the night of August 8, 1974 (the night Nixon resigned from the
  US Presidency) we recorded the first jet cooled spectrum of
  NO<sub>2</sub>. The next morning Don Levy saw the spectrum for
  the first time, and immediately recognized its significance.
  Molecular physics had changed. Now we could study at least small
  polyatomic molecules with at the same penetrating level of detail
  previously attained only for atoms and diatomics.<br>
  <br>
  A year later, Lennard Wharton came back from a trip to France
  where he had visited with Roger Campargue and learned of the
  concept of the "zone of silence" that exists in an expanding gas
  at sufficiently high densities. While this zone is surrounded by
  shock waves where the gas is heated to very high temperatures,
  within the zone the expanding gas is exactly as cold and
  unperturbed as it would be if the gas expanded into a perfect
  vacuum, forming no shock waves at all. Campargue had learned to
  fabricate a ultrasharp edged "skimmer" that could penetrate the
  "Mach disc" at end of the zone and transmit the gas streaming
  along the center line of the zone of silence to form the most
  intense, coldest supersonic beams ever produced. Wharton told Don
  Levy and me that using helium in such an apparatus we could
  easily get cowl to 1 K and perhaps even lower. I was stunned. I
  knew that 1 Kwas low enough to freeze out the rotational motion
  of even medium-sized molecules such as benzene and naphthalene,
  and all such molecules could now be studied without rotational
  congestion.<br>
  <br>
  Later that same day in a hallway conversation Len Wharton and I
  realized we didn't need the skimmer. The probe laser beam could
  easily penetrate the shock waves without perturbation, and we
  could image just the fluorescence from the laser-excited
  ultracold molecules in the zone of silence. We quickly built a
  new apparatus that incorporated these ideas. With the
  spectroscopic insight of Don Levy and with a series of graduate
  students we published the pioneering papers on not only jet
  cooled spectra of ordinary molecules such as NO<sub>2</sub>, and
  tetrazine, but also on the first van der Waals complexes with
  helium (e.g. HeI<sub>2</sub>), and with the vital collaboration
  of Daniel Auerbach the first supersonic beam study of a metal
  atom-rare gas complex, NaAr.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1976 my family and I moved to Houston, Texas
  where I had accepted a position as assistant professor in the
  chemistry department at Rice University. I knew of Rice principally because
  of the beautiful laser spectroscopy that was being done there by
  Robert F. Curl, and I wanted to collaborate with him much the
  same as I had with Don Levy. The first supersonic beam apparatus
  I set up was a free jet machine similar to that I had used in
  Chicago, but adapted to use pulsed dye lasers in the ultraviolet
  so that we could study more ordinary molecules such as benzene.
  My first proposal to the National Science Foundation was for a
  much larger, more ambitious apparatus that would for the first
  time use pulsed supersonic nozzles. With these pulsed devices
  mounted in a large chamber I expected we could attain a 10-100
  fold increase in beam intensity and cooling, and by synchronizing
  with the pulsed lasers in both the visible and ultraviolet be
  able to study a vast array of large molecules, radicals, and
  clusters. Being the second apparatus we constructed, it was
  called "AP2".<br>
  <br>
  With AP2 we quickly succeeded in setting the world's record for
  rotational cooling of a polyatomic molecule (0.17 K). We invented
  resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI) with time of flight mass
  spectrometric detection as a means of probing the spectrum of
  molecules in the supersonic beam. We used this to probe the
  structure and molecular dynamics of large aromatic molecules,
  particularly focussing on the question of intramolecular
  vibrational redistribution. We also developed a means of
  producing fragments of polyatomic molecules (free radicals such
  as benzyl and methoxy) by directing a pulsed laser into a
  specially designed pulsed supersonic nozzle, and studying these
  cooled in the supersonic beam.<br>
  <br>
  In the late 1970s in collaboration with Andrew Kaldor and his
  group at Exxon we had extended the capabilities of AP2 so that we
  could study a large uranium containing molecule (a
  hexafluoroacetylacetonate-, tetahydrofurancomplexed form of UO2).
  These were the days of the oil crisis, when there was widespread
  belief that nuclear fission using uranium was going to be the
  only long-term alternative. Exxon was working intensely on
  laser-based isotope separation schemes, and Kaldor was heading up
  a group to pursue the molecular route. Our experiment on AP2
  ultimately revealed a beautiful sharpening of the infrared
  multiphoton dissociation spectrum of this volatile UO<sub>2</sub>
  complex cooled in the supersonic beam, just what Exxon was
  looking for. Unfortunately, we began to succeed with these
  experiments only after the nuclear release "event" at Three Mile
  Island on March 28, 1979. Within a year, Exxon made a corporate
  level decision to get out of the isotope separation business. But
  Kaldor had become so impressed with the capabilities of AP2 that
  he wanted his own at the corporate laboratories in Linden in any
  event. Under contract to Exxon, we developed a smaller version of
  the apparatus, and built two versions. One was kept at Rice and
  lived on for many years with a very productive science history.
  Logically, it was called AP3. The clone of AP3 was shipped to
  Exxon in late 1982.<br>
  <br>
  After a few years of intensive research we found a way to use a
  pulsed laser directed into a nozzle to vaporize any material,
  allowing for the first time the atoms of any element in the
  periodic table to be produced cold in a supersonic beam. Most
  importantly, we developed a way to control the clustering of
  these atoms to small aggregates, which then were cooled in the
  supersonic expansion. Now for the first time it was possible to
  roam the periodic table and make detailed study of the properties
  of nanometer-scale particles consisting of a precise number of
  atoms. The field of metal and semiconductor cluster beams was
  born. We shipped Exxon this new accessory to their AP3 clone, and
  both groups then rapidly began to develop the new field.<br>
  <br>
  As is now well known, the Kaldor group was the first to put
  carbon in a laser vaporization cluster beam apparatus, and see
  the amazing even-numbered distribution of carbon clusters that we
  now know to be the fullerenes. Within a year we repeated the same
  experiment, but now on an improved version of AP2 that had been
  modified for the study of semiconductor clusters. The story of
  what we discovered on this apparatus in September of 1985 has
  been told many times.<br>
  <br>
  The subsequent development of my research in metal and
  semiconductor clusters, and the fullerenes is too involved to
  recount here. Increasingly, the tubular variant of the fullerenes
  has dominated our activities. Now our motto is "if it ain't
  tubes, we don't do it". We are convinced that major new
  technologies will be developed over the coming decades from
  fullerene tubes, fibers, and cables, and we are moving as fast as
  possible to bring this all to life.<br>
  <br>
  Several years ago AP2 was dismantled and sold off in pieces to
  other research groups, and the main chamber where the first
  pulsed nozzle experiments were performed was sold off to a scrap
  metal dealer along the Houston Ship Channel. Now there are no
  supersonic beam machines of any type in the laboratory. Times
  change.<br>
  <br>
  But life and science go on.</p>
