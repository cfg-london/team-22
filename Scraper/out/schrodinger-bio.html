  <h1>Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schrodinger.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger</b> was
  born on August 12, 1887, in Vienna, the only child of Rudolf
  Schr&ouml;dinger, who was married to a daughter of Alexander
  Bauer, his Professor of Chemistry at the Technical College of
  Vienna. <br>
  <br>Erwin's father came from a Bavarian family which
  generations before had settled in Vienna. He was a highly gifted
  man with a broad education. After having finished his chemistry
  studies, he devoted himself for years to Italian painting. After
  this he took up botany, which resulted in a series of papers on
  plant phylogeny.<br>
  <br>
  Schr&ouml;dinger's wide interests dated from his school years at
  the Gymnasium, where he not only had a liking for the scientific
  disciplines, but also appreciated the severe logic of ancient
  grammar and the beauty of German poetry. (What he abhorred was
  memorizing of data and learning from books.)<br>
  <br>
  From 1906 to 1910 he was a student at the University of Vienna,
  during which time he came under the strong influence of Fritz
  Hasen&ouml;hrl, who was Boltzmann's successor. It was in these
  years that Schr&ouml;dinger acquired a mastery of eigenvalue
  problems in the physics of continuous media, thus laying the
  foundation for his future great work. Hereafter, as assistant to
  Franz Exner, he, together with his friend K. W. F. Kohlrausch,
  conducted practical work for students (without himself, as he
  said, learning what experimenting was). During the First World
  War he served as an artillery officer.<br>
  <br>
  In 1920 he took up an academic position as assistant to <a href=
  "../1911/index.html">Max Wien</a>, followed by positions at
  Stuttgart (extraordinary professor), Breslau (ordinary
  professor), and at the University of Zurich (replacing <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1914/index.html">von Laue</a>) where he
  settled for six years. In later years Schr&ouml;dinger looked
  back to his Zurich period with great pleasure - it was here that
  he enjoyed so much the contact and friendship of many of his
  colleagues, among whom were Hermann Weyl and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1936/index.html">Peter Debye</a>. It was
  also his most fruitful period, being actively engaged in a
  variety of subjects of theoretical physics. His papers at that
  time dealt with specific heats of solids, with problems of
  thermodynamics (he was greatly interested in Boltzmann's
  probability theory) and of atomic spectra; in addition, he
  indulged in physiological studies of colour (as a result of his
  contacts with Kohlrausch and Exner, and of Helmholtz's lectures).
  His great discovery, Schr&ouml;dinger's wave equation, was made
  at the end of this epoch-during the first half of 1926.<br>
  <br>
  It came as a result of his dissatisfaction with the quantum
  condition in Bohr's orbit theory and his belief that atomic
  spectra should really be determined by some kind of eigenvalue
  problem. For this work he shared with Dirac the Nobel Prize for
  1933.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927 Schr&ouml;dinger moved to Berlin as Planck's successor.
  Germany's capital was then a centre of great scientific activity
  and he enthusiastically took part in the weekly colloquies among
  colleagues, many of whom "exceeding him in age and reputation".
  With Hitler's coming to power (1933), however, Schr&ouml;dinger
  decided he could not continue in Germany. He came to England and
  for a while held a fellowship at Oxford. In 1934 he was invited
  to lecture at Princeton University and was offered a permanent
  position there, but did not accept. In 1936 he was offered a
  position at University of Graz, which he accepted only after much
  deliberation and because his longing for his native country
  outweighed his caution. With the annexation of Austria in 1938,
  he was immediately in difficulty because his leaving Germany in
  1933 was taken to be an unfriendly act. Soon afterwards he
  managed to escape to Italy, from where he proceeded to Oxford and
  then to University of Ghent. After a short stay he moved to
  the newly created Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin, where he
  became Director of the School for Theoretical Physics. He
  remained in Dublin until his retirement in 1955.<br>
  <br>
  All this time Schr&ouml;dinger continued his research and
  published many papers on a variety of topics, including the
  problem of unifying gravitation and electromagnetism, which also
  absorbed <a href="../1921/index.html">Einstein</a> and which is
  still unsolved; (he was also the author of the well-known little
  book "What is Life?", 1944). He remained greatly interested in
  the foundations of atomic physics. Schr&ouml;dinger disliked the
  generally accepted dual description in terms of waves and
  particles, with a statistical interpretation for the waves, and
  tried to set up a theory in terms of waves only. This led him
  into controversy with other leading physicists.<br>
  <br>
  After his retirement he returned to an honoured position in
  Vienna. He died on the 4th of January, 1961, after a long
  illness, survived by his faithful companion, Annemarie Bertel,
  whom he married in 1920.</p>
