  <h1>Pyotr Kapitsa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kapitsa.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Pjotr Leonidovich Kapitsa</b> was
  born in Kronstadt, near Leningrad, on the 9th July 1894, son of
  Leonid Petrovich Kapitsa, military engineer, and Olga Ieronimovna
  n&eacute;e Stebnitskaia, working in high education and folklore
  research.<br>
  <br>
  Kapitsa began his scientific career in A.F. Ioffe's section of
  the Electromechanics Department of the Petrograd Polytechnical
  Institute, completing his studies in 1918. Here, jointly with
  N.N. Semenov, he proposed a method for determining the magnetic
  moment of an atom interacting with an inhomogeneous magnetic
  field. This method was later used in the celebrated Stern-Gerlach
  experiments.<br>
  <br>
  At the suggestion of A.F. Ioffe in 1921 Kapitsa came to the
  Cavendish
  Laboratory to work with Rutherford. In 1923 he made the first
  experiment in which a cloud chamber was placed in a strong
  magnetic field, and observed the bending of alfa-particle paths.
  In 1924 he developed methods for obtaining very strong magnetic
  fields and produced fields up to 320 kilogauss in a volume of 2
  cm<sup>3</sup>. In 1928 he discovered the linear dependence of
  resistivity on magnetic field for various metals placed in very
  strong magnetic fields. In his last years in Cambridge Kapitsa
  turned to low temperature research. He began with a critical
  analysis of the methods that existed at the time for obtaining
  low temperatures and developed a new and original apparatus for
  the liquefaction of helium based on the adiabatic principle
  (1934).<br>
  <br>
  Kapitsa was a Clerk Maxwell Student of Cambridge University
  (1923-1926), Assistant Director of Magnetic Research at Cavendish
  Laboratory (1924-1932), Messel Research Professor of the Royal Society
  (1930-1934), Director of the Royal Society Mond Laboratory
  (1930-1934). With R.H. Fowler he was the founder editor of the
  International Series of Monographs on Physics (Oxford, Clarendon
  Press).<br>
  <br>
  In 1934 he returned to Moscow where he organized the Institute
  for Physical Problems at which he continued his research on
  strong magnetic fields, low temperature physics and
  cryogenics.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a
  lowpressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion
  turbine. In low temperature physics, Kapitsa began a series of
  experiments to study the properties of liquid helium that led to
  discovery of the superfluidity of helium in 1937 and in a series
  of papers investigated this new state of matter.<br>
  <br>
  During the World War II Kapitsa was engaged in applied research
  on the production and use of oxygen that was produced using his
  low pressure expansion turbines, and organized and headed the
  Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the USSR Council of
  Ministers.<br>
  <br>
  Late in the 1940's Kapitsa turned his attention to a totally new
  range of physical problems. He invented high power microwave
  generators - planotron and nigotron (1950- 1955) and discovered a
  new kind of continuous high pressure plasma discharge with
  electron temperatures over a million K.<br>
  <br>
  Kapitsa is director of the Institute for Physical Problems. Since
  1957 he is a member of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of
  Sciences. He was one of the founders of the Moscow
  Physico-Technical Institute (MFTI), and is now head of the
  department of low temperature physics and cryogenics of MFTI and
  chairman of the Coordination Council of this teaching Institute.
  He is the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Experimental and
  Theoretical Physics and member of the Soviet National Committee
  of the Pugwash movement of scientists for peace and
  disarmament.<br>
  <br>
  He was married in 1927 to Anna Alekseevna Krylova, daughter of
  Academician A.N. Krylov. They have two sons, Sergei and
  Andrei.</p>
