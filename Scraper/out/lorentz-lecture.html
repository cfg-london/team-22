  <h2>The Theory of Electrons and the Propagation of Light</h2>

  <p>When Professor Zeeman and I received the
  news of the great honour of the high distinction awarded to us,
  we immediately began to consider how we could best divide our
  roles with respect to our addresses. Professor Zeeman was first
  to have described the phenomenon discovered by him, given the
  explanation of it, and given an outline of his later experimental
  work. My task should have been to consider rather more deeply our
  present-day knowledge of electricity, in particular the so-called
  electron theory.</p>

  <p>I am more sorry than I can say that
  Professor Zeeman has been prevented by illness from undertaking
  the journey to Stockholm, and that therefore you will now only be
  able to hear the second half of our programme. I hope you will
  excuse me if under these circumstances I say only a little about
  the main theme, Zeeman's fine discovery. A short description of
  it, however, might well precede my further thoughts.</p>

  <p>As is well known to you, Faraday even in
  his day discovered that magnetic forces can have an effect on the
  propagation of light. He showed in fact that in suitable
  conditions the vibrations of a beam of polarized light can be
  made to rotate by such forces. Many years later Kerr found that
  such a beam of light also undergoes similar changes when it is
  simply reflected from the polished pole of a magnet. However, it
  remained for Zeeman's talent to show that a magnetic field
  affects not only the propagation and reflection of light but also
  the processes in which the beam of light originates, that is to
  say that the rays emitted by a light source assume different
  properties if this source is placed in the gap between a magnetic
  north and south pole. The difference is shown in the spectral
  resolution of the light, when one is working with the type of
  light source whose spectrum consists of single bright lines -
  that is, with a coloured flame, an electrical spark, or a
  Geissler tube. To have a specific case before your eyes, imagine
  that my hands are the two poles, only much closer together than I
  am holding them now, and that the light source is between these
  poles, that is to say in the space immediately in front of me.
  Now if the spectrum of the light which shines on a point directly
  opposite me is investigated, there can be observed, instead of a
  single spectral line such as can be seen under normal
  circumstances, a three-fold line, or triplet, whose components
  admittedly are separated from each other by a very small
  distance. Since each position in the spectrum corresponds to a
  specific frequency of light, we can also say that instead of
  light of one frequency the source is, under the influence of the
  magnetic field, emitting light of three different frequencies. If
  the spectrum consists of more than one line, then you can imagine
  that each line is resolved into a triplet. I must, however, add
  that the situation is not always as simple as this, and many
  spectral lines resolve into more than three components.</p>

  <p>Before turning to the theory, I should like
  to remark that thanks to the speedy publication of research and
  the consequent lively exchange of views between scientists much
  progress must be considered as the result of a great deal of
  joint effort. Since it is expected of me, I am going to talk
  principally of my own ideas and the way in which I have come to
  them. I do beg of you, however, not to lose sight of the fact
  that many other physicists, not all of whom I can name in this
  short space of time, have arrived at the same or very similar
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>The theory of which I am going to give an
  account represents the physical world as consisting of three
  separate things, composed of three types of building material:
  first ordinary tangible or ponderable matter, second electrons,
  and third ether. I shall have very little to say about ponderable
  matter, but so much the more about ether and electrons. I hope it
  will not be too much for your patience.</p>

  <p>As far as the ether - that bearer of light
  which fills the whole universe - is concerned, after Faraday's
  discovery which I have already mentioned and also independently
  of it, many attempts were made to exploit the ether in the theory
  of electricity also. Edlund went so far as to identify the
  electric fluid with the ether, ascribing to a positively charged
  body an excess of ether and to a negatively charged one a
  deficiency of ether. He considered this medium as a liquid,
  subject to the Archimedean principle, and in this way succeeded
  in imputing all electrostatic effects to the mutual repulsion of
  particles of ether.</p>

  <p>There was also a place in his theory for
  the electrodynamic attraction and repulsion between two metallic
  wires with electrical current flowing in them. Indeed, he formed
  a most remarkable conception of these effects. He explained them
  by the condition that the mutual repulsion of two particles of
  ether needs a certain time to be propagated from the one to the
  other; it was in fact an axiom with him that everything which
  occurs in Nature takes a certain length of time, however short
  this may be. This idea, which has been fully developed in our
  present-day views, is found also in the work of other older
  physicists. I need only mention Gauss, of whom we know that he
  did not follow this up only because he lacked a clear picture of
  the propagation. Such a picture, he wrote to Wilhelm Weber, would
  be the virtual keystone of a theory of electrodynamics.</p>

  <p>The way pioneered by Edlund, in which the
  distinction between ether and electricity was completely swept
  aside, was incapable of leading to a satisfactory synthesis of
  optical and electrical phenomena. Lorenz at Copenhagen came
  nearer the goal. You know, however, that the true founders of our
  present views on this subject were Clerk Maxwell and Hertz. In
  that Maxwell developed further and constructed a basis for the
  ideas put forward by Faraday, he was the creator of the
  electromagnetic theory of light, which is undoubtedly well known
  to you in its broad outline. He taught us that light vibrations
  are changes of state of the same nature as electric currents. We
  can also say that electrical forces which change direction
  extremely rapidly - many billions of times a second - are present
  in every beam of light. If you imagine a tiny particle in the
  path of a sunbeam, something like the familiar dust motes in the
  air, only considerably smaller, and if you also imagine that this
  particle is electrically charged, then you must also suppose that
  it is set into a rapid quivering movement by the light
  vibrations.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Maxwell I named Hertz,
  that great German physicist, who, if he had not been snatched
  from us too soon, would certainly have been among the very first
  of those whom your Academy would have considered in fulfilling
  your annual task. Who does not know the brilliant experiments by
  which he confirmed the conclusions that Maxwell had drawn from
  his equations? Whoever has once seen these and learnt to
  understand and admire them can no longer be in any doubt that the
  features of the electromagnetic waves to be observed in them
  differ from light beams only in their greater wavelength.</p>

  <p>The result of these and other
  investigations into the waves propagated in the ether culminate
  in the realization that there exists in Nature a whole range of
  electromagnetic waves, which, however different their wavelengths
  may be, are basically all of the same nature. Beginning with
  Hertz's "rays of electrical force", we next come to the shortest
  waves caused by electromagnetic apparatus and then, after jumping
  a gap, to the dark thermal rays. We traverse the spectrum far
  into the ultraviolet range, come across another gap, and may then
  put X-rays, as extremely short violent electromagnetic
  disturbances of the ether, at the end of the range. At the
  beginning of the range, even before the Hertzian waves, belong
  the waves used in wireless telegraphy, whose propagation was
  established last summer from the southwest tip of England to as
  far as the Gulf of Finland.</p>

  <p>Although it was principally Hertz's
  experiments that turned the basic idea of Maxwell's theory into
  the common property of all scientists, it had been possible to
  start earlier with some optimism on the task of applying this
  theory to special problems in optics. We will begin with the
  simple phenomenon of the refraction of light. It has been known
  since the time of Huygens that this is connected with the unequal
  rate of propagation of the beams of light in different
  substances. How does it come about, however, that the speed of
  light in solid, liquid, and gaseous substances differs from its
  speed in the ether of empty space, so that it has its own value
  for each of these ponderable substances; and how can it be
  explained that these values, and hence also the refractive index,
  vary from one colour to another?</p>

  <p>In dealing with these questions it appeared
  once more, as in many other cases, that much can be retained even
  from a theory which has had to be abandoned. In the older theory
  of undulation, which considered the ether as an elastic medium,
  there was already talk of tiny particles contained in ponderable
  substances which could be set in motion by light vibrations. The
  explanation of the chemical and heating action of light was
  sought in this transmission of motion, and a theory of colour
  dispersion had been based on the hypothesis that transparent
  substances, such as glass and water, also contained particles
  which were set into co-vibration under the influence of a beam of
  light. A successor to Maxwell now has merely to translate this
  conception of co-vibrating particles into the language of the
  electromagnetic theory of light.</p>

  <p>Now what must these particles be like if
  they can be moved by the pulsating <i>electrical</i> forces of a
  beam of light? The simplest and most obvious answer was: they
  must be electrically charged. Then they will behave in exactly
  the same way as the tiny charged dust motes that we spoke of
  before, except that the particles in glass and water must be
  represented, not as floating freely, but as being bound to
  certain equilibrium positions, about which they can vibrate.</p>

  <p>This idea of small charged particles was
  otherwise by no means new; as long as 25 years ago the phenomena
  of electrolysis were being explained by ascribing positive
  charges to the metallic atoms in a solution of a salt, and
  negative charges to the other components of the salt molecule.
  This laid the foundation of modern electrochemistry, which was to
  develop so rapidly once Prof. Arrhenius had expressed the bold
  idea of progressive dissociation of the electrolyte with
  increasing dilution.</p>

  <p>We will return to the propagation of light
  in ponderable matter. The covibrating particles must, we
  concluded, be electrically charged; so we can conveniently call
  them "electrons", the name that was introduced later by Johnstone
  Stoney. The exact manner in which this co-vibration takes place,
  and what reaction it has on the processes in the ether, could be
  investigated with the aid of the well-known laws of
  electromagnetism. The result consisted of formulae for the
  velocity of propagation and the refractive indices, in their
  dependence on the one hand on the vibration period - i.e. on the
  colour of the light - and on the other hand on the nature and
  number of the electrons.</p>

  <p>You will forgive me if I do not quote the
  rather complicated equations, and only give some account of their
  significance. In the first place, as regards the dependence of
  the refractive index on vibration period - that is, colour
  dispersion: in the prismatic spectrum and in rainbows we see a
  demonstration of the fact that the electrons in glass and water
  possess a certain mass; consequently they do not follow the
  vibrations of light of different colours with the same
  readiness.</p>

  <p>Secondly, if attention is focussed on the
  influence of the greater or smaller number of particles in a
  certain space an equation can be found which puts us in a
  position to give the approximate change in the refractive index
  with increasing or decreasing density of the body - thus, for
  example, it is possible to calculate the refractive index of
  water vapour from that of water. This equation agrees fairly well
  with the results of experiments.</p>

  <p>When I drew up these formulae I did not
  know that Lorenz at Copenhagen had already arrived at exactly the
  same result, even though he started from different viewpoints,
  independent of the electromagnetic theory of light. The equation
  has therefore often been referred to as the formula of Lorenz and
  Lorentz.</p>

  <p>This formula is accompanied by another
  which makes it possible to deduce the refractive index of a
  chemical compound from its composition, admittedly only in rough
  approximation as was possible earlier with the aid of certain
  empirical formulae.</p>

  <p>The fact that such a connection between the
  refraction of light and the chemical composition does exist at
  all is of great importance in the electromagnetic theory of
  light. It shows us that the power of refraction is not one of
  those properties of matter which are completely transformed by
  the action of chemical combination. The relative positions of,
  and type of bond between, the atoms are not of primary importance
  as concerns the speed of propagation in a compound. Only the
  number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, etc. is of importance; each
  atom plays its part in the refraction of light, unaffected by the
  behaviour of the others. In the face of these results we find it
  hard to imagine that the forces which bind an electron to its
  equilibrium position and on the intensity of which depends the
  velocity of light are generated by a certain number of
  neighbouring atoms. We conclude rather that the electron,
  together with whatever it is bound to, has its place within a
  single atom; hence, electrons are smaller than atoms.</p>

  <p>Permit me now to draw your attention to the
  ether. Since we learnt to consider this as the transmitter not
  only of optical but also of electromagnetic phenomena, the
  problem of its nature became more pressing than ever. Must we
  imagine the ether as an elastic medium of very low density,
  composed of atoms which are very small compared with ordinary
  ones? Is it perhaps an incompressible, frictionless fluid, which
  moves in accordance with the equations of hydrodynamics, and in
  which therefore there may be various turbulent motions? Or must
  we think of it as a kind of jelly, half liquid, half solid?</p>

  <p>Clearly, we should be nearer the answers to
  these questions if it were possible to experiment on the ether in
  the same way as on liquid or gaseous matter. If we could enclose
  a certain quantity of this medium in a vessel and compress it by
  the action of a piston, or let it flow into another vessel, we
  should already have achieved a great deal. That would mean
  displacing the ether by means of a body set in motion.
  Unfortunately, all the experiments undertaken on these lines have
  been unsuccessful; the ether always slips through our fingers.
  Imagine an ordinary barometer, which we tilt so that the mercury
  rises to the top, filling the tube completely. The ether which
  was originally above the mercury must be somewhere; it must have
  either passed through the glass or been absorbed into the metal,
  and that without any force that we can measure having acted upon
  it. Experiments of this type show that bodies of normal
  dimensions, as far as we can tell, are completely permeable to
  the ether. Does this apply equally to much larger bodies, or
  could we hope to displace the ether by means of some sort of
  very-large, very-fast moving piston? Fortunately, Nature performs
  this experiment on a large scale. After all, in its annual
  journey round the sun the earth travels through space at a speed
  more than a thousand times greater than that of an express train.
  We might expect that in these circumstances there would be an end
  to the immobility of the ether; the earth would push it away in
  front of itself, and the ether would flow to the rear of the
  planet, either along its surface or at a certain distance from
  it, so as to occupy the space which the earth has just vacated.
  Astronomical observation of the positions of the heavenly bodies
  gives a sharp means of determining whether this is in fact the
  case; movements of the ether would assuredly influence the course
  of the beams of light in some way.</p>

  <p>Once again we get a negative answer to our
  question whether the ether moves. The direction in which we
  observe a star certainly differs from the true direction as a
  result of the movement of the earth - this is the so-called
  aberration of light. However, by far the simplest explanation of
  this phenomenon is to assume that the whole earth is completely
  permeable to the ether and can move through it without dragging
  it at all. This hypothesis was first expressed by Fresnel and can
  hardly be contested at present.</p>

  <p>If we wish to give an account of the
  significance of this result, we have one more thing to consider.
  Thanks to the investigations of Van der Waals and other
  physicists, we know fairly accurately how great a part of the
  space occupied by a body is in fact filled by its molecules. In
  fairly dense substances this fraction is so large that we have
  difficulty in imagining the earth to be of such loose molecular
  structure that the ether can flow almost completely freely
  through the spaces between the molecules. Rather are we
  constrained to take the view that each individual molecule is
  permeable. The simplest thing is to suggest further that the same
  is true of each atom, and this leads us to the idea that an atom
  is in the last resort some sort of local modification of the
  omnipresent ether, a modification which can shift from place to
  place without the medium itself altering its position. Having
  reached this point, we can consider the ether as a substance of a
  completely distinctive nature, completely different from all
  ponderable matter. With regard to its inner constitution, in the
  present state of our knowledge it is very difficult for us to
  give an adequate picture of it.</p>

  <p>I hardly need to mention that, quite apart
  from this question of constitution, it will always be important
  to come to a closer understanding of the transmission of apparent
  distant actions through the ether by demonstrating how a liquid,
  for example, can produce similar effects. Here I am thinking in
  particular of the experiments of Prof. Bjerknes in
  Christiania<a href="#footnote">*</a> on transmitted hydrodynamic
  forces and of his imitation of electrical phenomena with
  pulsating spheres.</p>

  <p>I come now to an important question which
  is very closely connected with the immobility of the ether. You
  know that in the determination of the velocity of sound in the
  open air, the effect of the wind makes itself felt. If this is
  blowing towards the observer, the required quantity will increase
  with the wind speed, and with the wind in the opposite direction
  the figure will be reduced by the same amount. If, then, a moving
  transparent body, such as flowing water, carries along with it in
  its entirety the ether it contains, then optical phenomena should
  behave in much the same way as the acoustical phenomena in these
  experiments. Consider for example the case in which water is
  flowing along a tube and a beam of light is propagated
  <i>within</i> this water in the direction of flow. If everything
  that is involved in the light vibrations is subject to the
  flowing movement, then the propagation of light in the flowing
  water will in relation to the latter behave in exactly the same
  way as in still water. The velocity of propagation relative to
  the wall of the tube can be found by adding the velocity of
  propagation <i>in</i> the water to the rate of flow of the water,
  just as, if a ball is rolling along the deck of a ship in the
  direction in which it is travelling, the ball moves relative to
  an observer on the shore at the sum of two speeds - the speed of
  the ship and the speed at which the ball is rolling on it.
  According to this hypothesis the water would drag the light waves
  at the full rate of its own flow.</p>

  <p>We come to a quite different conclusion if
  we assume, as we now must, that the ether contained in the
  flowing water is itself stationary. As the light is partly
  propagated through this ether, it is easy to see that the
  propagation of the light beams, for example to the right, must
  take place more slowly than it would if the ether itself were
  moving to the right. The waves are certainly carried along by the
  water, but only at a certain fraction of its rate of flow.
  Fresnel has already demonstrated the size of this fraction; it
  depends on the refractive index of the substance - the value for
  water, for example, being 0.44. By accepting this figure it is
  possible to explain various phenomena connected with aberration.
  Moreover, Fresnel deduced it from a theoretical standpoint which,
  however ingenious it may be, we can now no longer accept as
  valid.</p>

  <p>In 1851 Fizeau settled the question by his
  famous experiment in which he compared the propagation of light
  in water flowing in the direction of the beam of light with its
  propagation in water flowing in the opposite direction. The
  result of these experiments, afterwards repeated with the same
  result by Michelson and Morley, was in complete agreement with
  the values assumed by Fresnel for the drag coefficient.</p>

  <p>There now arose the question of whether it
  is possible to deduce this value from the new theory of light. To
  this end it was necessary first of all to develop a theory of
  electromagnetic phenomena in moving substances, with the
  assumption that the ether does not partake of their motion. To
  find a starting-point for such a theory, I once again had
  recourse to electrons. I was of the opinion that these must be
  permeable to the ether and that each must be the centre of an
  electric and also, when in motion, of a magnetic field. For
  conditions in the ether I introduced the equations which have
  been generally accepted since the work of Hertz and Heaviside.
  Finally I added certain assumptions about the force acting on an
  electron, as follows: this force is always due to the ether in
  the immediate vicinity of the electron and is therefore affected
  <i>directly</i> by the state of this ether and <i>indirectly</i>
  by the charge and velocity of the other electrons which have
  brought about this state. Furthermore, the force depends on the
  charge and speed of the particle which is being acted upon; these
  values determine as it were the sensitivity of the electron to
  the action due to the ether. In working out these ideas I used
  methods deriving from Maxwell and partly also relied on the work
  of Hertz. Thus I arrived at the drag coefficient accepted by
  Fresnel, and was able to explain in a fairly simple way most of
  the optical phenomena in moving bodies.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a start was made on a
  general theory which ascribed all electromagnetic processes
  taking place in ponderable substances to electrons. In this
  theory an electrical charge is conceived as being a surplus of
  positive or negative electrons, but a current in a metallic wire
  is considered to be a genuine progression of these particles, to
  which is ascribed a certain mobility in conductors, whereas in
  non-conductors they are bound to certain equilibrium positions,
  about which, as has already been said, they can vibrate. In a
  certain sense this theory represents a return to the earlier idea
  that we were dealing with two electrical substances, except that
  now, in accordance with Maxwell's ideas, we have to do with
  actions which are transmitted through ether and are propagated
  from point to point at the velocity of light. Since the nature
  and manner of this transmission can be followed up in all its
  details, the demand that Gauss made for a theory of
  electrodynamics is fulfilled. I cannot spend any more time on
  these matters, but would like to mention that Wiechert at
  G&ouml;ttingen and Larmor at Cambridge have produced very similar
  results, and that Prof. Poincar&eacute; has also contributed much
  to the development and evaluation of the theory.</p>

  <p>I must also pass over many phenomena
  investigated in recent years, in which the concept of electrons
  has proved a useful guide, in order not to stray too far from the
  theory of the Zeeman effect.</p>

  <p>When Prof. Zeeman made his discovery, the
  electron theory was complete in its main features and in a
  position to interpret the new phenomenon. A man who has peopled
  the whole world with electrons and made them covibrate with light
  will not scruple to assume that it is also electrons which
  vibrate within the particles of an incandescent substance and
  bring about the emission of light. An oscillating electron
  constitutes, as it were, a minute Hertzian vibrator; its effect
  on the surrounding ether is much the same as the effect we have
  when we take hold of the end of a stretched cord and set up the
  familiar motion waves in the rope by moving it to and fro. As for
  the force which causes a change in the vibrations in a magnetic
  field, this is basically the force, the manifestations of which
  were first observed by Oersted, when he discovered the effect of
  a current on a compass needle.</p>

  <p>I will leave the explanation of triplets to
  Prof. Zeeman. I will confine myself to remarking that it is the
  negative electrons which oscillate, and that from the distance
  between the components into which the spectral line is resolved
  the ratio between the numerical value of the charge and the mass
  of these particles can be deduced. The results are in gratifying
  agreement with those which have been found in other contexts. The
  same or similar values for the ratio mentioned above have been
  found for the negative particles with which we are concerned in
  cathode rays.</p>

  <p>A noteworthy aspect is the enormous size of
  the charge of these particles compared with their mass. A
  numerical example will give you some idea of this. Imagine that
  we had two iron spheres, each with a radius of one metre,
  situated ten metres apart, and that we gave each of them a
  surplus of our negative electrons of such a size that the mass of
  this surplus was the millionth part of a milligram. The spheres
  would then repel each other with a force equivalent to a weight
  of more than 80,000 kilograms and would therefore be able to
  reach a speed of many metres per second. I need hardly say that
  we are far from being able to make an experiment on this scale;
  we are not in a position to bring such a large number of
  electrons of one certain kind together on one body. If it were
  possible, we could carry out many interesting experiments which
  we can now only imagine. For instance, we could demonstrate the
  Zeeman effect on a simple pendulum. This can easily be made to
  swing in a circle, and if the bob is given an electrical charge
  the vertical component of the earth's magnetic field somewhat
  alters the period of rotation, which is increased in one
  direction and reduced in the other. With the charges which we
  have at our disposal this difference is completely imperceptible,
  and Prof. Zeeman himself would be unable to observe the Zeeman
  effect on a pendulum.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn from the relative sizes of
  charge and mass to their absolute values. We can at least give an
  estimate of these. If we combine the results to which Zeeman's
  experiments lead with those which can be deduced from the colour
  dispersion of gases, on the hypothesis that it is the same type
  of electrons which is under consideration in both cases, we come
  to the conclusion that the charge of an electron is of the same
  order of size as the charge of an electrolytic ion. The mass,
  however, is much smaller - about one eight-hundredth part of that
  of a hydrogen atom. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a> at
  Cambridge has confirmed this result by a completely different
  method. At present we are not concerned with the exact value; the
  principal thing is that, as we have remarked before, the electron
  is very small compared with the atom. The latter is a composite
  structure, which can contain many electrons, some mobile, some
  fixed; perhaps it bears electrical charges which are not
  concentrated at single points but distributed in some other
  way.</p>

  <p>Of the other magneto-optical phenomena I
  will only describe one in any greater detail. Soon after Zeeman
  had published his discovery the Russian physicists Egorov and
  Georgievsky found that a sodium flame situated between the poles
  of an electromagnet emitted partially polarized light - i.e., in
  its beams vibrations in a certain direction were present with a
  greater intensity than vibrations in the direction perpendicular
  to this. To describe this phenomena to you more exactly and at
  the same time to make clear how it is to be explained, I ask you
  to imagine once more that my hands are opposing magnetic poles
  and that the sodium flame is placed between them. Now if you were
  exactly opposite me, you would observe that the vertical
  electrical vibrations have a greater intensity than the
  horizontal ones.</p>

  <p>This is connected with the fact that the
  flame has a certain thickness and that the beams emitted by the
  back half are partly swallowed up again as they pass through the
  front half. In accordance with a familiar rule, this absorption
  effect is strongest when all the incandescent particles in the
  flame are vibrating with the same period. It diminishes, and the
  flame therefore becomes brighter, as soon as this uniformity of
  the period of vibration is disturbed in any way. Now the magnetic
  field does this, in that instead of <i>one</i> common period of
  vibration it causes several to come into play. However, the
  increase in illuminating power brought about in this way is
  restricted to the vertical vibrations in the flame that we are
  imagining. The horizontal vibrations of the electrons, from right
  to left and back again, are - it follows from the principles of
  the theory - not at all influenced by the magnetic field.</p>

  <p>The conclusion therefore is that of the
  vibrations emitted only the vertical ones and not the horizontal
  ones are reinforced, which is the cause of the phenomenon we have
  observed.</p>

  <p>I may add that this phenomenon is one of
  those magneto-optical effects which are most easily observed. The
  explanation given can also be put to the proof by the use of two
  flames instead of one, and an investigation of the absorption to
  which the light of the rear one is subject in the front one which
  has been situated between the magnetic poles.</p>

  <p>Now that I have come to absorption, I must
  also consider the masterly and important theoretical
  considerations to which Prof. Voigt at G&ouml;ttingen has been
  led by Zeeman's discovery. His theory differs from mine in that
  he always has in mind, not the emission of light, but its
  absorption. He explains the so-called <i>inverse</i> Zeeman
  effect - that is, the phenomenon that, when a strong white light
  is transmitted through the flame situated between the poles,
  instead of an absorption stripe we get a triplet of dark lines.
  On the basis of the parallelism between absorption and emission,
  it is possible to work back from this inverse phenomenon to the
  direct one.</p>

  <p>Voigt does not refer to vibrating electrons; he is content to add appropriately chosen new terms to the
  equations which represent propagation in an absorbent medium.
  This method throws into relief the connection between the Zeeman
  effect and the rotation of the direction of vibration which was
  discovered by Faraday, and has other advantages, namely when
  vapours of rather high density, with correspondingly wider
  spectral lines, are concerned. Professor Zeeman will be able to
  give you an example of the effects of Voigt's theory.</p>

  <p>However, any one who sets himself the task
  of drawing conclusions about the nature of the vibrations of
  electrons from these observations will, I think, prefer to choose
  the emission from very rarefied gases as an object of study. Here
  the radiation from the single molecules or atoms, undimmed by
  their effects on each other, is mirrored by the sharp lines in
  the spectrum. I followed this course in my later research, but
  came across considerable difficulties due to the fact that
  although the simple triplet frequently appears, in many cases
  there is resolution into more than three lines. This is a
  stumblingblock in the way of the theory. At all events it is easy
  to draw some general rules about the state of polarization of the
  light beams corresponding to the different components - i.e., the
  shape and direction of their vibrations, but unfortunately I have
  hardly got any further.</p>

  <p>As long as we have to deal only with
  resolution into three components, it is sufficient explanation to
  assume that each incandescent atom contains a single electron
  which can vibrate round its equilibrium position in all
  directions in the same way. This simple theory however leaves us
  high and dry as soon as the spectral lines split into more than
  three components in the magnetic field. It is obvious then that
  we must imagine atoms of more complicated structure, which are
  provided with electrical charges, and the parts of which are
  capable of making small vibrations, rather like the parts of an
  elastic resonant body. When I investigated the theory of such
  movements, which can be done without much difficulty, it became
  evident that such an arbitrary system would in general show no
  Zeeman effect at all.</p>

  <p>However, no mathematical theory is
  necessary to perceive this and to find the condition necessary to
  bring about such an effect. Imagine a light source which shows a
  Zeeman triplet under the influence of a magnetic field. The three
  lines naturally cannot appear unless three types of vibration
  with slightly different periods are present in the particles of
  the light source. These periods however can only be different if
  the directions of movement or the shapes of the path in the three
  cases are not the same. We will say in short that we are dealing
  with three different <i>vibration patterns</i>, each with its own
  frequency, in the light source.</p>

  <p>We will now gradually reduce the intensity
  of the magnetic field and finally let it disappear. As long as
  even a weak field is present, the three lines persist, only they
  draw nearer each other; the three vibration patterns thus always
  exist, but their frequencies approach a common limiting value,
  the frequency of the unresolved spectral line. In this way we
  come to suppose that even when we observe the latter, the three
  patterns of movement still exist, though without distinguishing
  themselves from each other by their frequency as is the case in a
  magnetic field. It can be expressed thus: the spectral line is
  already three-fold before the magnetic force comes into play, and
  this force has nothing else to do except, as it were, to push
  apart the three lines which originally coincided.</p>

  <p>The same applies to a four-, five- or
  six-fold line, and you may rest assured that a spectral line will
  never resolve into six components unless, before the magnetic
  field is set up, each incandescent particle can vibrate in six
  different ways, that is, with exactly the same frequency.</p>

  <p>Herein lies one necessary condition which
  is not quite so easy to fulfil. I could add a second condition
  for the appearance of clear-cut components of the spectral lines,
  but the one I have described should suffice to show that in the
  further development of the theory we cannot give free rein to our
  imagination. Instead, we are fairly limited in the choice of
  hypotheses. A suitable model of a vibrating atom would be an
  elastic spherical shell with a uniformly distributed electrical
  charge, whose surface is divided by nodal lines into a greater or
  lesser number of fields vibrating in different directions.
  However, I will not linger over the phenomena which appear in
  such models, for I fear I might wander too far from reality along
  these paths.</p>

  <p>I have tried to delineate in broad outline
  how much - or it would be better to say, how little - the
  electron theory has achieved in the explanation of the new
  magneto-optical phenomena. If I were now to give an account of
  the experimental work, it would become clear that the experiments
  have made more considerable advances. The research workers have
  already made a start on comparing the different spectral lines of
  a chemical element with each other, with respect to their
  magnetic resolution, and on investigating the connection between
  this resolution and the regular relationships existing in
  spectra.</p>

  <p>In this country, where the father of my
  worthy colleague Angstrom, and Prof. Thal&eacute;n have worked, and
  where Prof. Hasselberg continued his observations and
  measurements with indefatigable diligence, I hardly need to say
  how wonderful and rich a world these investigations into spectra
  have opened up to us. A world whose laws we are beginning to
  understand. It has become apparent that many line spectra are
  constructed according to a definite type; the lines are arranged
  in certain series, and in such a way that each series consists of
  lines which are distributed over the spectrum in accordance with
  a fairly simple law, and moreover there are relationships between
  the one series and the next. These relationships, in the
  clarification of which Prof. Rydberg and the German physicists
  Kayser and Runge have been particularly prominent, suggest a
  connection between the magnetic resolution of lines belonging to
  the same series. Such a connection has now in fact been
  confirmed. Runge and Paschen have found, in their investigation
  of the Zeeman effect in mercury, that all the lines of one series
  are resolved in exactly the same way.</p>

  <p>I am convinced that the theory will only
  make significant progress when it also turns its attention not
  simply to one single spectral line but to all the lines of a
  chemical element. When once we succeed in building a theoretical
  foundation for the structure of spectra, then and not before then
  will we be able to grasp successfully the more complicated forms
  of the Zeeman effect. It would be better to say: in the future,
  research into the regular relationships in the spectra and into
  the Zeeman effect must go hand in hand; thus they will be able to
  lead some day to a theory of light emission, the achievement of
  which is one of the greatest aims of present-day physics.</p>

  <p>The electron theory also presents an
  enormous field of study outside the realm of magneto-optical
  phenomena. For one thing, the free-moving electrons, with which
  we are concerned in cathode rays and in some types of Becquerel
  rays, give rise to many interesting problems. I will single out
  only the important question of the so-called apparent mass of
  these particles. A definite magnetic field in the surrounding
  ether - and hence also a certain amount of energy in this medium
  - are inextricably connected with every movement of an electron;
  we can therefore never set an electron in motion without
  simultaneously imparting energy to the ether. To do this a great
  amount of work is necessary, and we must employ a greater force
  than if it were not necessary to set up this magnetic field.
  Calculation shows that the force required is the same as would be
  needed if the mass were somewhat greater than it is in reality.
  In other words, if we determine the mass in the usual way from
  the phenomena, we get the true mass increased by an amount which
  we can call the apparent, or electromagnetic, mass. The two
  together form the effective mass which determines the
  phenomena.</p>

  <p>Now the investigations published by
  Kaufmann and Abraham in the past year have shown that the
  apparent mass is by no means to be discounted. It certainly forms
  a considerable part of the effective mass, and there is a
  possibility that in the end we shall have to ascribe apparent
  mass only and never true mass at all to electrons.</p>

  <p>The peculiar thing about this apparent mass
  is, moreover, that it is not constant, but depends on the
  velocity; consequently the study of the motion of the electron
  differs in many ways from ordinary dynamics.</p>

  <p>It is hard to say if it will ever be
  possible to examine further with any success the question of the
  nature of an electron, which the research I have mentioned has
  already touched on. Meanwhile, even without ascertaining this, we
  can continue to test the basic assumptions of the theory in
  practice, and to draw from the properties of ponderable matter
  conclusions about the electrons it contains. The conductivity of
  electricity and heat by metals, thermoelectricity, permanent and
  temporary magnets, heat radiation and absorption, the optical,
  electrical and magnetic properties of crystals - all these
  aspects promise us a rich harvest. And even farther fields are
  opening up to our view. If it is true, as had been concluded from
  optical experiments, that the dimensions of a ponderable body
  undergo a slight alteration as soon as it moves through the
  motionless ether, we must conclude that molecular forces are
  transmitted through the ether in a way similar to electrical
  effects, and that leads to the idea that these forces are
  basically of an electromagnetic nature and the material particles
  among which they exist are composed of electrons - or, at least,
  the electrical charges of these particles are not something
  accidental but something very significant, also where molecular
  forces are concerned.</p>

  <p>Thus we hope that the electron hypothesis,
  as it is being taken up in widely different sectors of physics,
  will lead to a general theory embracing many aspects of physics
  and also of chemistry. Perhaps it will be itself completely
  transformed on the long journey; however, there can hardly be any
  doubt that our hypotheses about the connection of widely
  differing phenomena with electromagnetism will prove correct, and
  that hence, in so far as it relates to the nature of ponderable
  matter, that general theory will be an electrochemical one, as
  Berzelius already dimly foresaw and as he tried to demonstrate
  with the resources at his disposal.</p>

  <p>This is admittedly a prospect of the
  distant future, and the individual scientist can scarcely hope to
  make any significant contribution to its achievement. As far as I
  am concerned, I would count myself fortunate if it fell to me,
  encouraged and spurred on as I am by the high distinction awarded
  to me by your Academy, to play a modest part in the solution of
  the problems which next present themselves to us.</p>

  <p>I close with the warmest thanks for the
  attention with which you have listened to me.</p>
