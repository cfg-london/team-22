  <h1>Martin Ryle - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ryle.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on September 27, 1918, the
  second of five children. My father John A. Ryle was a doctor who,
  after the war, was appointed to the first Chair of Social
  Medicine at Oxford
  University.<br>
  <br>
  I was educated at Bradfield College and Oxford, where I graduated
  in 1939. During the war years I worked on the development of
  radar and other radio systems for the R.A.F. and, though gaining
  much in engineering experience and in understanding people,
  rapidly forgot most of the physics I had learned.<br>
  <br>
  In 1945 J.A. Ratcliffe, who had been leading the ionospheric work
  in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge before the war,
  suggested that I apply for a fellowship to join his group to
  start an investigation of the radio emission from the Sun, which
  had recently been discovered accidentally with radar
  equipment.<br>
  <br>
  During these early months, and for many years afterwards both
  Ratcliffe and Sir Lawrence Bragg, then Cavendish Professor, gave
  enormous support and encouragement to me. Bragg's own work on
  X-ray crystallography involved techniques very similar to those
  we were developing for "aperture synthesis", and he always showed
  a delighted interest in the way our work progressed.<br>
  <br>
  In 1948 I was appointed to a Lectureship in Physics and in 1949
  elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College. At this time Tony
  Hewish joined me, and in fact four other members of our present
  team started their research during the period 1948-52.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959 the University recognized our work by appointing me to a
  new Chair of Radio Astronomy.<br>
  <br>
  During 1964-7 I was president of Commission 40 of the
  International Astronomical Union, and in 1972 was appointed
  Astronomer Royal.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 I married Rowena Palmer, and we have two daughters,
  Alison and Claire, and a son, John. We enjoy sailing small boats,
  two of which I have designed and built myself.</p>
