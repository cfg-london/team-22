  <h1>Ludwig Quidde - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="quidde.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ludwig
  Quidde</b> (March 23, 1858 - March 4, 1941), the oldest son of a
  wealthy merchant, grew up in the republican atmosphere of the
  Hanseatic city of Bremen, enjoying an unusually liberal education
  at its humanistic gymnasium, &laquo;an education in freedom to
  freedom&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_1">1</a></sup>. He studied at the
  Universities of Strassburg and G&ouml;ttingen, where his
  professors recognized and furthered his aptitude for historical
  research. Under the sponsorship of Professor Weizs&auml;cker in
  G&ouml;ttingen, Quidde was given a post on a board of editors
  responsible for the publication of the medieval German Reichstag
  documents, a post he held until 1933 when the Bavarian Historical
  Commission removed him for political reasons. In 1889 he founded
  the <i>Deutsche Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Geschichtswissenschaft</i>
  [German Review of Historical Sciences], a journal which he edited
  until 1896; from 1890 to 1892, he was on the staff of the
  Prussian Historical Institute in Rome. Quidde, however, did not
  follow a career as a professional historian, perhaps because he
  had a substantial private fortune, but he always maintained a
  lively interest in history, especially constitutional history,
  even after his attention had turned from the academic to the
  political.<br>
  <br>
  The publication of the pamphlet <i>Caligula: A Study of Imperial
  Insanity</i><sup><a href="#not_2">2</a></sup> in 1894 changed the
  course of Quidde's career. Seemingly an objective study of the
  Roman emperor Caligula, emphasizing his madness, his pleasure in
  sham heroics, his ruthless use of power, his vanity as an actor
  and conceit as an orator, the pamphlet was, in fact, a satire on
  Emperor Wilhelm II and the &laquo;Byzantine&raquo; nature of the
  Prussian society of which he was a part. Quidde escaped
  conviction of the charge of lese majesty: he denied that he had
  intended to draw an analogy between the two emperors, thus
  leaving to the prosecution the task of proving the validity of
  the analogy, an alternative too embarrassing to accept.<br>
  <br>
  Quidde entered politics in Munich. In 1895 he helped to
  reorganize the German People's Party which was, in political
  philosophy, anti-prussian and antimilitary; in 1902 he won a seat
  on the City Council of Munich; from 1907 to 1919 he served in the
  Bavarian Assembly; in 1919 he was elected to the Weimar National
  Assembly.<br>
  <br>
  Quidde's political ideology was a direct heritage from the
  Enlightenment. Uncompromisingly ethical, he strove to imbue the
  German people with a sense of justice which would of itself
  generate social reform. He had the courage of his convictions.
  After delivering a political speech on January 20, 1896, Quidde
  was accused of lese majesty, tried, and sentenced to three months
  in the Munich prison Stadelheim. For writing an article in 1924
  attacking secret military training, he was arrested, found guilty
  of &laquo;collaborating with the enemy&raquo;, and put in prison
  for a brief period.<br>
  <br>
  Initially not antiwar on principle, Quidde's interest in the
  peace movement, prompting him to join the German Peace Society
  shortly after its founding in 1892, grew out of his historical
  studies, his ethical ideals, his distrust of the military, and
  the urgings of his wife, Margarethe, whom he married in 1882. He
  filled a position on the Council of the International Peace
  Bureau in Bern, rose to a position of leadership in the World
  Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901, joined with <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Passy</a> at the Congress
  at Lucerne in 1905 to achieve a rapprochement between German and
  French, supervised the organization of the World Peace Congress
  of 1907 in Munich, became president of the German Peace Society
  in 1914, a position he held for fifteen years.<br>
  <br>
  When World War I broke out, Quidde went to The Hague, attempting
  to maintain ties with English and French peace groups. The
  attempt failed, and when Quidde returned to Germany he was
  charged with treason, though the charges were later dropped.
  Nonetheless, Quidde was kept under surveillance for months, his
  mail censored, and his pamphlets confiscated. At the end of the
  war, Quidde continued to pull together the remnants of the German
  peace movement, heading the German Peace Cartel, a body composed
  of twenty-one organizations.<br>
  <br>
  When Hitler came to power, Quidde fled first to Munich and then
  to Geneva, where he lived from March, 1933, until his death in
  March, 1941. Although Quidde's private fortune had been wiped out
  by the inflation, he was able to live fairly well with the help
  of friends and with a subvention from the Nobel Peace Prize
  Committee for his projected book, <i>German Pacifism during the
  World War</i>, which was never finished. Even in exile, Quidde
  continued to attend World Peace Congresses, to publish articles,
  and to exercise his organizational talents by founding the
  Comit&eacute; de secours aux pacifistes exil&eacute;s to care for
  fellow political exiles from Nazi Germany.</p>

  <p><b>Editor's Note<br></b> In a subsequent
  annotation in <i>Europ&auml;ische Gespr&auml;che</i> (Heft VI,
  Juni 1931, S. 304) - found when this volume was already in galley
  proof - Quidde comments further on his interpretation of the
  draft resolution of March 22. His interpretation is incomplete,
  he says, because it does not mention the draft's &laquo;unreserved
  recognition of the principle of balance between victor and
  defeated of 1918 in the question of armaments&raquo;. It is
  inaccurate, he continues, because it implies that restrictions of
  individual elements of armaments should proceed only from
  suggestions made in the Peace Treaties; whereas, in fact, the
  draft demands the prohibition of the specific means of war
  forbidden by the Peace Treaties and recommends the adoption of
  budgetary restrictions as a method of limiting the remaining
  means of war - a method not mentioned in the treaties.</p>
