  <h2>The Physiology of Insulin and Its Source in the Animal
  Body</h2>

  <p>The knowledge that the isles of Langerhans
  of the pancreas have the function of secreting into the blood a
  hormone which plays an essential role in the regulation of the
  metabolism of the carbohydrates, is the outcome of numerous
  investigations extending over many years, and to the development
  of this knowledge workers in various fields of medical science
  have contributed.</p>

  <p>In 1889, when Minkowski and von Mering
  discovered that complete extirpation of the pancreas leads to
  fatal diabetes, practically nothing was known concerning the
  significance of the ductless glands, and few conceived that it
  would be possible to extract, from various of them, substances
  capable of replacing the lost function, when administered to
  animals from which some particular gland had been removed.
  Although, at this time, it was known that the thyroid gland is
  atrophied in myxoedema and in cretinism, it was not until 1892
  that Murray discovered that administration of the gland removes
  the symptoms, and it was only later that the doctrine of internal
  secretions, first enunciated by Claude Bernard in 1856 in
  connection with the production of sugar by the liver, came to
  take its place in physiological teaching. Minkowski in the
  complete account of his researches, published in 1893, considered
  the antidiabetic function of the pancreas to be dependent upon
  its acting as a ductless gland, and no doubt he had in mind that
  it performed this through an internal secretion, although the
  positive statement that such exists was first made by Lepine, who
  thought that it took the form of a glycolytic enzyme. But, so
  far, there was no hint as to the actual structure within the
  pancreas upon which the antidiabetic influence of the gland
  depends and it is primarily to the anatomists, Laguesse and
  Diamare, that we owe the hypothesis that this must be the
  collection of cells, named after their discoverer, the isles of
  Langerhans. By careful studies of the cytological characteristics
  of the cells of these islets, as distinguished from those of the
  much more numerous secreting acini among which they lie, and by
  painstaking examination of the anatomical relationships of the
  two kinds of cells in different classes of vertebrates, Laguesse
  and Diamare concluded that the islets must be responsible for the
  antidiabetic influence.</p>

  <p>As this anatomical work was in progress,
  the potent action of extracts of the suprarenal gland on the
  blood pressure and other physiological functions was discovered,
  in 1894, by Oliver and Schafer, thus adding strong support to the
  hypothesis that the ductless glands function by producing
  internal secretions. The hypothesis, that the islets of
  Langerhans of the pancreas must act in a similar manner, gained a
  firm hold among physiologists and clinical workers, with the
  result that many attempted to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes
  by administration of pancreas, or of extracts of the gland, to
  patients suffering from the disease. No success attended these
  attempts partly, we believe, because the antidiabetic principle
  was destroyed, either during the preparation of the extracts or
  by the action of the digestice juices, and partly, because of
  imperfect knowledge of the clinical course of the disease,
  particularly with regard to the relationship of diet to it.
  Notwithstanding the failure of these attempts, the hypothesis
  that the isles of Langerhans are the structures to which the
  pancreas owes its antidiabetic function was still maintained, and
  indeed strengthened, by the supporting evidence furnished by the
  graft experiments of Minkowski and H&eacute;don. These workers
  showed that no diabetic symptoms supervene in dogs when a portion
  of the pancreas is transplanted into the wall of the abdomen
  prior to, or at the same time as, removal of the remainder of the
  gland, but immediately do so in full intensity when this graft is
  subsequently excised. Moreover, it was known that ligation of the
  ducts of the pancreas, or their injection by oil or paraffin, is
  not followed by diabetes. Since, in neither of these types of
  experiment, can any of the digestive secretion gain the intestine
  it was clear that the anti-diabetic function of the pancreas must
  be independent of its digestive function. It may be well to point
  out also that the graft experiments once and for all disproved
  the view held by some (by Pfl&uuml;ger, for example), that damage
  to the nerve structures adjacent to the pancreas, or in the
  duodenal wall, is responsible for the diabetic symptoms.</p>

  <p>A distinct step forward was taken in 1900
  when Schulze and Ssobolev discovered that the degenerative
  changes which follow ligation of the ducts affect the cells of
  the acini much more markedly than those of the islets, and
  although among those who repeated these researches, there were
  some who failed to corroborate the findings, the conclusions of
  Schulze and Ssobolev were generally accepted. It was not long
  after this that the first, though unsuccessful, attempt was made
  to see whether an extract of the degenerated residue of
  duct-ligated pancreas might not relieve the symptoms of diabetes.
  About this time also (1906) - as was revealed in 1922 by the
  opening of a sealed package deposited with the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
  de Biologie - Gley had found similar extracts to diminish the
  symptoms in diabetic dogs, and in the same year, Miss Dewitt had
  tried their effects on glycolysis.</p>

  <p>The insular hypothesis of diabetes was
  meanwhile strongly supported by the careful histological studies
  of the pancreas of patients who had died from the disease (Opie)
  for, although it had been known, even prior to the experiments of
  Minkowski and von Mering, that the gland is often the seat of
  morbid change, it was not realized that the islets are the
  structures which are chiefly affected.</p>

  <p>In 1903-1904, Rennie, by anatomical studies
  in certain Teleostei, gave strong support to the view of Diamare,
  that the islet cells in these fishes exist as separate glands of
  relatively large size and more or less independent of the
  pancreatic acini. Both workers attempted to demonstrate an effect
  of extracts of these glands on sugar or starch solutions, but
  without success. They administered them by mouth to diabetic
  patients with no favourable results, although in one case, in
  which an extract was given subcutaneously, there was decided
  alleviation of the diabetic symptoms (Rennie and Fraser).</p>

  <p>About this time the significance of
  internal secretions in the control of animal functions was
  clearly demonstrated by the discovery of secretin by Bayhss and
  Starling (1902), and the term "hormone" came into use to
  designate their active principles. Many believed that the
  antidiabetic function of the pancreas must depend on a hormone
  secreted by the isles of Langerhans, but neither the graft
  experiments already referred to, nor the transfusion experiments
  of H&eacute;don - in which it was found that when the blood of a
  normal dog was transfused in a diabetic one the symptoms were
  alleviated - could prove the hypothesis. To do this it was
  necessary to- show that extracts of the islets, or at least of
  the pancreas, are capable of removing the symptoms of diabetes.
  In 1907 Zuelzer published results which must be considered, in
  the light of what we now know, as really demonstrating the
  presence of the antidiabetic hormone in alcoholic extracts of
  pancreas. But unfortunately, even although several diabetic
  patients were benefited by administration of the extracts, the
  investigations were not sufficiently completed to convince
  others, and, apparently, Zuelzer himself was discouraged in
  continuing them because of toxic reactions in the treated
  patients.</p>

  <p>To describe, even in mere outline, the
  further attempts to prepare active antidiabetic extracts of the
  pancreas would far exceed the limits of this essay. To Knowlton
  and Starling, Meltzer and Kleiner, E. L. Scott, Murlin and
  Cramer, and to Clark, we owe much, for although none of these
  investigators succeeded in demonstrating beyond doubt that an
  extract having antidiabetic properties could be prepared from the
  pancreas, they all obtained results which were sufficiently
  positive to keep alive the hope that some day this would be
  possible. Special reference must also be made to the more recent
  work of Paulesco who prepared extracts having very decided
  effects on the sugar and the urea of the blood of diabetic
  animals.</p>

  <p>Believing that the want of success to
  prepare extracts of uniform potency as due to the destruction of
  the antidiabetic hormone by the digestive enzymes also present in
  the gland, F. G. Banting suggested preparing them from
  duct-ligated pancreas, and with the aid of C. H. Best, and under
  my direction, he succeeded in 1922 in showing that such extracts
  reduced the hyperglycaemia and glycosuria in depancreatized dogs.
  The general symptoms of diabetes were also found to be alleviated
  and the duration of life of the depancreatized animal prolonged,
  by the repeated injection of alcoholic extracts of foetal, as
  well as of adultox pancreas. Later it was shown, in collaboration
  with Collip, that other symptoms of diabetes, namely the
  ketonuria and the absence of glycogen from the liver, were
  favourably influenced by the extracts and, with Hepburn, that the
  respiratory quotient became raised. These results on
  depancreatized dogs showed beyond doubt that the antidiabetic
  hormone was present in potent form in the extracts, and the time
  seemed ripe to investigate their action on the clinical forms of
  diabetes. This was done by Banting in a severe case under the
  care of W. R. Campbell, with the result that the hyperglycaemia
  and glycosuria were diminished. At the same time, however, it was
  found that it would be necessary to rid the extracts of
  irritating substances before the value of their repeated
  injection in the treatment of diabetes in man could be adequately
  put to the test. This was accomplished by Collip, and the name
  insulin was decided upon for the purified extract. This name had
  previously been suggested by Sir E. Sharpey Schafer (1916), who
  had been one of the first to support the hypothesis of the
  insular derivation of the antidiabetic hormone. I need not here
  detail the rapid progress which it was now possible to make in
  studying the therapeutic value of insulin in the treatment of
  diabetes in man; for it is with experimental aspects of the
  subject that this essay is concerned.</p>

  <p>The invariable lowering of the blood sugar
  which was observed to result from the administration of insulin
  in animals rendered diabetic by pancreatectomy, raised the
  question as to whether such would also occur in those forms of
  hyperglycaemia which can be induced by other experimental
  procedures, such as the injection of epinephrin, piq&ucirc;re, or
  asphyxia. As the first step in the investigation of this
  question, Collip injected insulin into normal rabbits and found
  the blood sugar to become lowered, thus furnishing a valuable
  method for testing the potency of various preparations and,
  therefore, for affording a basis for their physiological assay.
  At the same time it was found that neither piq&ucirc;re, nor
  epinephrin, nor asphyxia caused any hyperglycaemia in rabbits in
  which, as a result of injection with insulin, the blood sugar was
  at a low level to start with.</p>

  <p>Peculiar symptoms (convulsions and coma)
  were observed in many of the injected animals, and it was soon
  possible to show that these were related to the lowering of the
  blood sugar and that they usually supervened when this was about
  0.045 per cent. Sometimes the animals recovered spontaneously
  from these symptoms, but more frequently the coma became so
  profound, with marked fall of body temperature, that death
  occurred. That the lowering of blood sugar is closely related to
  the occurrence of the symptoms, was proved by finding that the
  subcutaneous injection of a solution of glucose was followed,
  almost immediately, by complete recovery, even in cases in which
  death was imminent from deep coma. It has been found, in
  collaboration with Noble, that glucose is remarkably specific in
  this regard, the only other sugar which approaches it being
  mannose and, in certain animals, such as the mouse, maltose.
  Laevulose and galactose are decidedly inferior in their
  antidoting action, the pentoses are entirely inactive and none of
  the disaccharides, other than maltose, has any effect. It is
  evident that this specificity in the action of glucose, in
  combating the hypoglycaemic symptoms, offers an opportunity to
  determine, not only what related substances are readily converted
  into glucose in the animal body, but also what groupings in the
  glucose molecule itself are significant for the effects. By
  substituting various side chains in the molecule, as for example,
  by methyl groups, it has been found, in collaboration with
  Herring and Irvine, that none of these substitution products is
  effective, even such compounds as the mono-methylglucosides being
  entirely inactive.</p>

  <p>The fall in blood sugar is dependent upon
  increased diffusion of sugar into the tissues and not to its more
  rapid destruction in the blood itself. Thus, Eadie and I could
  detect no change in the rate of glycolysis by adding insulin to
  blood incubated under sterile conditions outside the body, or in
  blood withdrawn from animals injected some minutes before death
  with insulin. Hepburn and Latchford, on the other hand,
  demonstrated that the addition of insulin to the fluid perfused
  through the excised mammalian heart markedly increased the rate
  at which the percentage of sugar became diminished in it.</p>

  <p>The striking relationship between the
  concentration of glucose in the blood and the normal functioning
  of the nervous system, which is revealed by these observations,
  had already been noted by Mann and Magath in their experiments on
  hepatectomized dogs. They observed that when the blood sugar fell
  to about 0.045 per cent, characteristic symptoms supervened which
  could be antidoted by glucose, and to a less extent, by laevulose
  and mannose. We must conclude that when the tension of glucose in
  the tissue cells falls below a certain level (glucatonia), a
  condition of irritability becomes developed; but little is known
  as to what the underlying cause for this may be. Olmsted and
  Logan have advanced some evidence that it may depend on
  interference with the process of oxidation in the nerve cells, or
  that these are irritated by substances produced elsewhere in the
  body by faulty oxidation. More recent experiments by Argyll
  Campbell on the tension of oxygen in the tissues lend support to
  this view.</p>

  <p>These observations emphasize the great
  importance of a certain tension of glucose within the tissue
  cells. They help us to understand why it is that the
  concentration of this sugar in the circulating fluids of animals
  of every order and species in which it has been determined,
  varies only within narrow limits, even after prolonged periods of
  starvation, or following muscular exercise.</p>

  <p>We must imagine that it is by lowering the
  tension of glucose within the tissue cells that insulin primarily
  acts, so that the glucose of the blood plasma, with which the
  tissue glucose is in equilibrium, diffuses into the cells to
  maintain the tension. With Eadie we have found that the free
  glucose extractable from the muscles by warm alcohol is reduced
  following the injecting of insulin, but we know nothing of the
  fate of the glucose which disappears. It is not converted into
  glycogen (McCormick, Noble and Macleod, Dudley and Marrian, Cori,
  etc.) nor is it immediately oxidized, since the respiratory
  metabolism (intake 0, and respiratory quotient) does not become
  increased at the time when the blood sugar is falling (Eadie,
  Dickson, Macleod, and Pember; Trevan and Boock; <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1920/index.html">Krogh</a>; Boothby and
  Wilder, etc.)<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>.</p>

  <p>Although the intake of oxygen may become
  greater in certain animals such as dogs, cats, and man when
  hypoglycaemic symptoms make their appearance, this does not occur
  when sugar is also administered. In the light of these results we
  have concluded that the glucose which disappears must become
  converted into some hitherto unidentified substance, but we have
  been unable to obtain any clue as to what this substance may be.
  Large amounts of it must be formed to account for the enormous
  quantities of glucose which may vanish from the blood, as when
  glucose is injected along with insulin. We have, for example,
  injected into rabbits, in the course of eight hours, as much as
  10 grams of glucose per kilo body weight along with insulin,
  without finding, at the end, any increase in blood sugar, or in
  the free or the combined sugar of the muscles or liver. Burn and
  Dale have also shown that very large quantities of glucose can be
  injected along with insulin into eviscerated animals without
  increasing the percentage of the blood sugar. It is conceivable
  that between glucose and the material which is finally oxidized
  in the tissues there exists, not one, but a group of substances
  constantly changing from one into another in an equilibrated
  system, and that no one of them ever accumulates in sufficient
  quantity to make its identification possible by available
  chemical methods.</p>

  <p>Be this as it may, it is significant that
  the percentage of inorganic phosphoric acid in the blood declines
  at the same rate as the sugar, although, in the recovery process,
  the phosphoric acid begins to rise decidedly before the sugar in
  animals injected with insulin. Accompanying this fall in the
  phosphates of the blood, those of the urine entirely disappear
  for several hours and then return to considerably above the
  normal level so that, in urine collected throughout the 24 hours,
  an excess is excreted, as compared with the amount on days during
  which no insulin is given. (Winter and Smith, Allan and Sokhey,
  etc.). These facts would seem to indicate that in the process
  responsible for the disappearance of glucose in the tissues there
  is a stage when compounds of phosphoric acid with sugar or its
  immediate breakdown products are formed. One immediately thinks
  of the possibility that an increase in the amount of the
  substance, described by Embden and his school, in muscle, and
  named lactacidogen, might be responsible, but we have been unable
  to demonstrate that this is the case (Eadie, Macleod, and Noble).
  At the present time we are entirely at a loss to account for the
  disappearing glucose. When this problem is solved it may be
  anticipated that a great advance will become possible in our
  knowledge of the intermediary metabolism of the
  carbohydrates.</p>

  <p>Having outlined the known facts with regard
  to its physiological action, we may now turn to the interesting
  question of the source of insulin. The observations of Banting
  and Best, that simple extracts of the residue of pancreas
  remaining several weeks after the ducts are tied possess
  antidiabetic properties, does not necessarily prove that insulin
  is derived from the islets. As Bensley and others have shown
  there may still remain, at this period after duct-ligation, a
  considerable amount of more or less normal acinar tissue. Even
  were the gland allowed to degenerate for a sufficient time so
  that all acinar tissue had disappeared - which is considerably
  over a year in the rabbit - it would be difficult, in the event
  that extracts of the residue still contained insulin, to be
  certain that this insulin is not of the type which it is possible
  to extract from various materials, including even the tissues of
  depancreatized animals, as Best and Scott have shown.</p>

  <p>Further investigation of the problem was
  therefore undertaken by continuing the work of Diamare and Rennie
  on certain of the Teleostei, such as Lophius and Myoxocephalus,
  in which the islet cells exist apart from the acinar tissue, as
  the so-called "principal islets". Extracts were made by alcohol
  from these structures, as well as from the acinar tissue, and it
  was found that, whereas very large yields of insulin are readily
  obtainable from the islets, little or none at all can usually be
  prepared from the pancreas itself. Indeed, extracts of the latter
  sometimes cause the blood sugar of rabbits to become raised,
  instead of lowered. The lowering of the blood sugar by acinar
  extracts when it occurred, may have been due to the presence of a
  few scattered microscopic islets, such as have been observed by
  Slater Jackson to exist in the pancreatic bands of Myoxocephalus.
  That the principal islet may have some acinar tissue associated
  with it does not detract from the value of the foregoing
  observations as evidence supporting the insular hypothesis, since
  it has been shown that extracts of the acinar tissue are
  comparatively impotent. In this connection it is of interest to
  note that insulin can be readily prepared from the pancreas of
  the Elasmobranchi (Raja and Squalus), which occurs as a compact
  gland with the islet tissue included in it, much in the same
  manner as in the mammalian pancreas.</p>

  <p>But in view of the fact that insulin, or at
  least extracts capable of lowering the blood sugar in normal
  rabbits, can be prepared from other tissues than the pancreas or
  the principal islets, there still remains the possibility that it
  might be secreted internally from some of these. It is indeed
  possible that although this did not occur in the normal animal,
  in which a sufficient amount was coming from the pancreas, it
  might occur when the normal. secretion was cut off, as in
  diabetes. By such a vicarious functioning of extra-pancreatic
  potential sources of insulin, the tolerance of the diabetic
  organism for carbohydrate might become raised. It seemed
  important, therefore, to see whether diabetes would result from
  excision of the principal islets alone, an operation which is
  possible in Myoxocephalus, the two principal islets being readily
  removable without exposure of the fish to air for more than 15
  minutes.</p>

  <p>In a large number of fish in which this
  operation was performed, it was found, in collaboration with
  McCormick, that the blood sugar became raised, often to ten times
  the normal value. At this high level it remained so long as the
  fish were kept alive - 11 days in one case, 5-10 days in others.
  The hyperglycaemia in itself was not sufficient to prove that the
  fish had become diabetic as a result of the isletectomy, for it
  was found, in other fish that were exposed to air for a period
  equal to that required for the operation (about 15 minutes), that
  the blood sugar rose, sometimes almost as much as in the operated
  ones. This asphyxial hyperglycaemia, however, was found to
  disappear within four days<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>,
  nor while it lasted was it so pronounced as in the isletectomized
  fish. There is no doubt that removal of the islets in
  Myoxocephalus causes pronounced diabetes, as judged by the
  behaviour of the blood sugar, and, it is of interest to add that
  there was, on an average, considerably more fat and less glycogen
  present in the liver of the operated fish than in those of the
  controls. It remains to determine whether, by giving insulin to
  the isletectomized fish, the blood sugar can be brought down to
  the normal level. So far we have been unable to demonstrate any
  very potent influence of insulin on the blood sugar of normal
  fish, although there is some indication that it can retard the
  development of asphyxial hyperglycaemia.</p>

  <p>Taking all the evidence into consideration
  the conclusion seems justified that the only source from which
  physiologically effective insulin can be secreted within the
  animal body is the islet tissue.</p>

  <p>And finally permit me to say something
  concerning the behaviour of depancreatized animals kept alive by
  means of insulin. By such studies it is possible that we may be
  able to determine whether the lost power to utilize carbohydrate
  can be reacquired in any measure, and also whether the secretion
  of pancreatic juice and of insulin include all the functions of
  the gland. With the collaboration of Frank N. Allan, I. L.
  Chaikoff, J. Markowitz, and W. W. Simpson, several completely
  depancreatized dogs have now been kept alive, by daily injections
  of insulin, for many months, the operation on * one of them,
  which is at present under observation, having been performed over
  eighteen months ago. But this result was not immediately
  achieved.</p>

  <p>In the earlier observations it was observed
  that, notwithstanding the fact that the animals ate large amounts
  of meat, the body weight steadily fell, no doubt because of
  inadequate intestinal digestion and absorption. The addition of
  cane sugar, in amounts sufficient to cause a mild degree of
  glycosuria (50 to 100 g daily), had the immediate effect of
  preventing the loss of body weight, and in most animals, of
  causing it to become increased, especially when large amounts
  were given. Four of these animals lived in excellent nutritive
  condition for periods varying between one and seven months, when
  each in turn developed symptoms of acute jaundice (bile pigment
  in urine, yellowing of sclera and skin) accompanied by rise in
  rectal temperature, anuria and progressive bodily weakness,
  ending fatally in from two to three days after the onset. The
  post mortem examination revealed, in each case, an extremely
  fatty liver with no significant pathological changes elsewhere in
  the body. Under the microscope it was difficult to see any liver
  cells that were not completely filled with fat, except for a few
  towards the centres of the lobules which were only moderately
  invaded. In some way or other, absence of the pancreas leads to a
  fatal breakdown of the hepatic function. Two possibilities may be
  considered: the one, that the pancreas secretes internally,
  besides insulin, some other hormone which is necessary for the
  functional integrity of the liver, perhaps a hormone having to do
  with its action on fat metabolism; and the other, that in the
  absence of the pancreatic ferments, the process of intestinal
  digestion becomes of such a (bacterial) type that substances
  having a toxic effect on the liver cells are absorbed into the
  portal blood. It was therefore decided to add raw ox pancreas (50
  g) to the daily diet, and it is as an outcome of this addition
  that the animals have thrived without showing any symptoms of
  hepatic breakdown. This favourable result may be dependent either
  on the restoration of the pancreatic enzymes, thus preventing the
  development of toxic substances, or because some hormone which
  withstands digestive action is absorbed from the ingested gland.
  We are at present observing the effect of adding trypsin to the
  food, instead of raw pancreas, but although the animal thus
  treated is in excellent nutritive condition we cannot as yet say
  whether it may not ultimately develop the hepatic symptoms. It
  may be added that the toxic theory is supported by the
  observation that in the absence of raw pancreas, or trypsin, not
  more than fifty per cent of the ingested meat is assimilated,
  whereas over eighty per cent is assimilated when either of these
  is present.</p>

  <p>The carbohydrate balance is being
  determined at intervals in several diabetic animals, in order to
  see whether any of the lost power to secrete insulin may be
  reacquired. This is done by determining the proportion of the
  ingested sugar which reappears in the urine daily while the
  animals are under the same dose of insulin, but so far no change
  has been detected. While it is certain that any considerable
  reacquirement of the power to secrete insulin would be revealed
  by this method, it is possible that a very scanty secretion might
  be masked on account of the relatively large amounts administered
  daily from without, for it has been shown, by Frank N. Allan,
  that the glucose equivalent of each unit of insulin is very much
  higher when the total number of units administered is small than
  when it is large. Another method for investigating this problem
  remains available, namely to observe whether the diabetic
  symptoms which supervene when insulin is discontinued are less
  severe after several months treatment than they are soon after
  the removal of the pancreas. Our attempts to make this
  observation have, so far, been frustrated by the very rapid
  downward progress of the animals after discontinuing insulin.
  Unless they are given large quantities of meat they die in a few
  days of symptoms not unlike those of diabetic coma.</p>

  <p>It has been stated by Carlson and Drennan
  that the diabetic symptoms are very much less than usual when
  pancreatectomy is performed on pregnant animals near full time,
  and this they have attributed to the secretion of insulin from
  the foetal pancreas. We could obtain no evidence in support of
  this hypothesis in the present investigations. Thus, one of the
  depancreatized dogs gave birth to five pups without any change
  whatsoever in her sugar balance throughout the pregnancy,
  although, on the day after the pups were born, severe symptoms of
  hypoglycaemia developed, no doubt because of the removal of
  glucose from the body to form the lactose of the milk. There was
  therefore no evidence that the developing foetuses contributed
  any significant amount of insulin to the maternal organism. In
  the face of the relatively large amounts of insulin injected into
  the mother, however, it is possible, in view of Allan's results,
  that the small contribution from the foetuses could have no
  measurable influence on the maternal sugar balance.</p>

  <p>I have attempted to review but a small part
  of the work relating to insulin and have only cursorily referred
  to the perplexing problem of the mechanism of its action in the
  animal body. Facts of importance in this regard come almost daily
  to light and it is to be anticipated that, as these accumulate, a
  great advance will become possible in our knowledge of the
  history of carbohydrates in the animal body.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote1" id="footnote1"></a>1.
  Practically all observers have confirmed the observation first
  made by Dickson and Pember that the R. Q. (respiratory quotient)
  rises somewhat in normal animals injected with insulin but the
  extent of this rise is not sufficient to indicate that increased
  combustio of glucose can be the significant cause for the rapid
  reduction in blood sugar.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote2" id="footnote2"></a>2.
  There was one fish in which the blood sugar remained at a high
  level even eight days after asphyxia.</p>
