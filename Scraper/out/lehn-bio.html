  <h1>Jean-Marie Lehn - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lehn.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on September 30 1939 in
  Rosheim, a small medieval city of Alsace in France. My father,
  Pierre Lehn, then a baker, was very interested in music, played
  the piano and the organ and became later, having given up the
  bakery, the organist of the city. My mother Marie kept the house
  and the shop. I was the eldest of four sons and helped out in the
  shop with my first brother. I grew up in Rosheim during the years
  of the second world war, went to primary school after the war
  and, at age eleven, I entered high school, the Coll&egrave;ge
  Freppel, located in Obernai, a small city about five kilometers
  from Rosheim. During these years I began to play the piano and
  the organ, and with time music has become my major interest
  outside science. My high school studies from 1950 to 1957 were in
  classics, with Latin, Greek, German, and English languages,
  French literature and, during the last year, philosophy, on which
  I was especially keen. However, I also became interested in
  sciences, especially chemistry, so that I obtained the
  baccalaur√©at in Philosophy in July 1957 and in Experimental
  Sciences in September of the same year.<br>
  <br>
  I envisaged to study philosophy at the University of Strasbourg,
  but being still undecided, I began with first year courses in
  physical, chemical and natural sciences (SPCN). During this year
  1957/58, I was impressed by the coherent and rigorous structure
  of organic chemistry. I was particularly receptive to the
  experimental power of organic chemistry, which was able to
  convert at will, it seemed, complicated substances into one
  another following well defined rules and routes. I bought myself
  compounds and glassware and began performing laboratory practice
  experiments at my parents home. The seed was sown, so that when,
  the next year, I followed the stimulating lectures of a newly
  appointed young professor, Guy Ourisson, it became clear to me
  that I wanted to do research in organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  After having obtained the degree of
  Licenci&eacute;-&egrave;s-Sciences (Bachelor), I entered Ourisson's
  laboratory in October of 1960, as a junior member of the Centre
  National de la Recherche Scientifique in order to work towards a
  Ph.D. degree. This was the first decisive stage of my training.
  My work was concerned with conformational and physico-chemical
  properties of triterpenes. Being in charge of our first NMR
  spectrometer, I was led to penetrate more deeply into the arcanes
  of this very powerful physical method; this was to be of much
  importance for later studies. My first scientific paper in 1961
  reported an additivity rule for substituent induced shifts of
  proton NMR signals in steroid derivatives.<br>
  <br>
  Having obtained my degree of Docteur &egrave;s Sciences (Ph.D.) in
  June of 1963, I spent a year in the laboratory of <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">Robert Burns Woodward</a> at Harvard
  University, where I took part in the immense enterprise of the
  total synthesis of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. This was the second
  decisive stage of my life as a researcher. I also followed a
  course in quantum mechanics and performed my first computations
  with <a href="../1981/index.html">Roald Hoffmann</a>. I had the
  chance to witness in 1964 the initial stages of what was to
  become the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.<br>
  <br>
  After my return to Strasbourg, I began to work in the area of
  physical organic chemistry, where I could combine the knowledge
  acquired in organic chemistry, in quantum theory and on physical
  methods. It was clear that, in order to be able to better analyze
  physical properties of molecules, a powerful means was to
  synthesize compounds that would be especially well suited for
  revealing a given property and its relationships to structure.
  This orientation characterized the years 1965- 1970 of my
  activities and of my young laboratory, newly established after my
  appointment in 1966 as ma&icirc;tre de conf&eacute;rences (assistant
  professor) at the Chemistry Department of the University of
  Strasbourg. Our main research topics were concerned with NMR
  studies of conformational rate processes, nitrogen inversion,
  quadrupolar relaxation, molecular motions and liquid structure,
  as well as ab initio quantum chemical computations of inversion
  barriers, of electronic structures and later on, of
  stereoelectronic effects.<br>
  <br>
  While pursuing these projects, my interest for the processes
  occurring in the nervous system (stemming diffusely from the
  first year courses in biology as well as from my earlier
  inclination towards philosophy), led me to wonder how a chemist
  might contribute to their study. The electrical phenomena in
  nerve cells depend on sodium and potassium ion distributions
  across membranes. A possible entry into the field was to try to
  affect the processes which allow ion transport and gradients to
  be established. I related this to the then very recent
  observations that natural antibiotics were able to make membranes
  permeable to cations. It thus appeared possible to devise
  chemical substances that would display similar properties. The
  search for such compounds led to the design of cation cryptates,
  on which work was started in October 1967. This area of research
  expanded rapidly, taking up eventually the major part of my group
  and developing into what I later on termed "supramolecular
  chemistry". Organic, inorganic and biological aspects of this
  field were explored and investigations are continuing. In 1976
  another line of research was started in the area of artificial
  photosynthesis and the storage and chemical conversion of solar
  energy; it was first concerned with the photoly is of water and
  later with the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.<br>
  <br>
  I was promoted associate professor in early 1970 and full
  professor in October of the same year. I spent the two spring
  semesters of 1972 and 1974 as visiting professor at Harvard University
  giving lectures and directing a research project. This
  relationship extended on a loose basis to 1980. In 1979, I was
  elected to the chair of "Chimie des Interactions
  Mol&eacute;culaires" at the Coll&egrave;ge de France in Paris. I took
  over the chemistry laboratory of the Coll&egrave;ge de France when
  Alain Horeau retired in 1980 and thereafter divided my time
  between the two laboratories in Strasbourg and in Paris, a
  situation continuing up to the present. New lines of research
  developed, in particular on combining the recognition, transport
  and catalytic properties displayed by supramolecular species with
  the features of organized phases, the long range goal being to
  design and realize "molecular devices", molecular components that
  would eventually be able to perform signal and information
  processing at the molecular level. A major research effort is
  presently also devoted to supramolecular self-organisation, the
  design and properties of "programmed" supramolecular
  systems.<br>
  <br>
  The scientific work, performed over twenty years with about 150
  collaborators from over twenty countries, has been described in
  about 400 publications and review papers. Over the years I was
  visiting professor at other institutions, the E.T.H. in
  Z&uuml;rich, the Universities of Cambridge, Barcelona, Frankfurt.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965 I married Sylvie Lederer and we have two sons, David
  (born 1966) and Mathias (born 1969).</p>
