  <h1>Simon van der Meer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="meer.jpg" class="bio-img"><span>I</span> was
  born in 1925, in The Hague, the Netherlands, as the third child
  of Pieter van der Meer and Jetske Groeneveld, both of Frisian
  origin. I had three sisters.<br>
  <br>
  My father was a schoolteacher and my mother came from a teacher's
  family. Under these conditions it is not astonishing that
  learning was highly prized; in fact, my parents made sacrifices
  to be able to give their children a good education.<br>
  <br>
  I visited the Gymnasium in The Hague and passed my final
  examination (in the sciences section) in 1943. Because the Dutch
  universities had just been closed at that time under the German
  occupation, I spent the next two years attending the humanities
  section of the Gymnasium. Meanwhile, my interest in physics and
  technology had been growing; I dabbled in electronics, equipped
  the parental home with various gadgets and assisted my brilliant
  and inspiring physics teacher (U.Ph. Lely) with the preparation
  of numerous demonstrations.<br>
  <br>
  From 1945 onwards, I studied "Technical Physics" at the University of
  Technology, Delft, where I specialized in measurement and
  regulation technology under C.J.D.M. Verhagen. The physics taught
  in this newly created subsection of an old and established
  engineering school, although of excellent quality, was of
  necessity somewhat restricted and I have often felt regrets at
  not having had the intensive physics training that many of my
  colleagues enjoyed. Nevertheless, if I have at times been able to
  make original contributions in the accelerator field, I cannot
  help feeling that to a certain extent my slightly amateur
  approach in physics, combined with much practical experience, was
  an asset.<br>
  <br>
  After obtaining my engineering degree in 1952, I worked in the
  Philips Research Laboratory, Eindhoven, mainly on high-voltage
  equipment and electronics for electron microscopes. In 1956 I
  moved to Geneva to join the recently founded European Organization for
  Nuclear Research (CERN), where I have been working ever since
  on many different projects, in an agreeable and stimulating
  international atmosphere.<br>
  <br>
  To start with, my work (under the leadership of J.B. Adams and
  C.A. Ramm) was concerned mainly with technical design: poleface
  windings, multipole correction lenses for the 28 GeV synchrotron
  and their power supplies. My interest in matters more directly
  concerned with the handling of particles was growing, in the
  meantime, stimulated by many contacts with people understanding
  accelerators. After working for a year on a separated antiproton
  beam (1960), I proposed a high-current, pulsed focusing device
  ("horn") aimed at increasing the intensity of a beam of
  neutrinos, then at the centre of interest at CERN and elsewhere.
  The design of this monster, together with the associated neutrino
  flux calculations kept me busy until 1965, when I joined a small
  group, led by F.J.M. Farley, preparing the second "g-2"
  experiment for measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of the
  muon. I designed the small storage ring used and participated at
  all stages of the experiment proper, including part of the data
  treatment. This was an invaluable experience; not only did I
  learn the principles of accelerator design, but I also got
  acquainted with the lifestyle and way of thinking of experimental
  high-energy physicists.<br>
  <br>
  From 1967 to 1976 I returned to more technical work when I was
  responsible for the magnet power supplies, first of the
  Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) and then of the 400 GeV
  synchrotron (SPS). I kept up with accelerator ideas, however, and
  worked (during my ISR period) on a method for the luminosity
  calibration of storage rings and on stochastic cooling. The
  latter was, of course, aimed at increasing the ISR luminosity,
  but practical application seemed difficult at the time, mainly
  because the high beam intensity in the ISR would have made the
  cooling very slow. After developing a primitive theory (1968) I
  therefore did not pursue this subject. However, the work was
  taken up by others and in 1974 the first experiments were done in
  the ISR.<br>
  <br>
  In 1976, Cline, McIntyre, Mills, and Rubbia proposed to use the
  SPS or the Fermilab ring as a pp collider. Accumulation of the
  needed antiprotons would clearly require cooling. At this time,
  my work on the SPS power supplies had just come to an end; I
  joined a study group on the pp project and an experimental team
  studying cooling in a small ring (ICE). The successful
  experiments in this ring and the work by Sacherer on theory and
  by Thorndahl on filter cooling showed that p accumulation by
  stochastic stacking was feasible. The collider project was
  approved and I became joint project leader with R. Billinge for
  the accumulator construction. Since then, I have worked with the
  group that commissioned and improved the ring and that is now
  preparing the construction of a second ring to increase the p
  stacking rate by an order of magnitude. As a spin-off from this
  work, I proposed the stochastic extraction method that is now
  used (in a much improved form) in the Low-Energy Antiproton Ring
  (LEAR).<br>

  In the meantime, in 1966, while skiing with friends in the Swiss
  mountains, I met my wife-to-be Catharina M. Koopman and after a
  very brief interval we decided to marry. This was certainly one
  of the best decisions I ever made; my life has since been far
  more interesting and colourful. We have two children: Esther
  (1968) and Mathijs (1970).</p>
