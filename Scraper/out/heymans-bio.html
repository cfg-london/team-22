  <h1>Corneille Heymans - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="heymans.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Corneille
  Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Heymans</b> was born in Ghent, Belgium, on
  March 28, 1892. His father was J. F. Heymans, formerly Professor
  of Pharmacology and Rector of the University of Ghent, who founded the J. F. Heymans Institute of Pharmacology and
  Therapeutics at the same University.<br>
  <br>
  Corneille received his secondary education at the St.
  Lievenscollege (Ghent), St. Jozefscollege (Turnhout), and St.
  Barbaracollege (Ghent). He had his medical education at the
  University of Ghent, where he obtained his doctor's degree in
  1920. After his graduation he worked at the Coll&egrave;ge de
  France, Paris (Prof. E. Gley), University of Lausanne (Prof. M. Arthus), University of
  Vienna (Prof. H. H. Meyer), University College of London (Prof. E. H.
  Starling) and Western Reserve Medical School (Prof. C. F.
  Wiggers).<br>
  <br>
  In 1922 he became Lecturer in Pharmacodynamics at the University
  of Ghent. In 1930 he succeeded his father as Professor of
  Pharmacology, being also appointed Head of the Department of
  Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics, and Toxicology; at the same time
  he became Director of the J. F. Heymans Institute. He is
  Professor Emeritus since 1963.<br>
  <br>
  The scientific investigations carried out at the Heymans
  Institute are mainly directed towards the physiology and
  pharmacology of respiration, blood circulation, metabolism, and
  numerous pharmacological problems. These studies led, in
  particular, to the discovery of the chemoreceptors, situated in
  the cardio-aortic and carotid sinus areas, and also to
  contributions regarding the proprioceptive regulation of arterial
  blood pressure and hypertension. The discovery of the
  reflexogenic role of the cardio-aortic and the carotid sinus
  areas in the regulation of respiration, above all, earned C.
  Heymans the Nobel Prize in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  Another series of investigations by Heymans and his collaborators
  was devoted to the physiology of cerebral circulation and of the
  physiopathology of arterial hypertension of nervous and renal
  origin; also to the study of blood circulation during muscular
  exercise; to the physiology and pharmacology of animals totally
  sympathectomized; to the study of the survival and revival of
  different nervous centres after the arrest of blood circulation;
  to the pharmacology of stimulating substances of cellular
  metabolism, to the pharmacology of the lungs and many other
  problems.<br>
  <br>
  A prolific author, Heymans has since 1920 issued about 800
  papers, published in different periodicals. The results of his
  investigations have been mainly reported by him in the following
  general publications: <i>Le Sinus Carotidien et les autres Zones
  vasosensibles r&eacute;flexog&egrave;nes</i> (1920); <i>Le Sinus
  Carotidien et la Zone Homologue Cardio-aortique</i>, with J. J.
  Bouckaert and P. Regniers (1933); <i>Sensibilit&eacute;
  r&eacute;flexog&egrave;ne des vaisseaux aux excitants chimiques</i>,

  circulation&raquo;, <i>Physiol. Rev.</i>, 30 (1950) 375; &laquo;New

  Fishman and D. W. Richards.<br>
  <br>
  Heymans is publisher and Editor-in-Chief of the <i>Archives
  Internationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Th&eacute;rapie</i>,
  founded in 1895 by his father and Professor E. Gley, Paris.<br>
  <br>
  From 1945 to 1962 Heymans has lectured at numerous universities
  in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia. He was in
  1934 &laquo;Herter Lecturer&raquo; at the University of New York;
  and in 1937 he was &laquo;Lecturer of the Dunham Memorial
  Foundation&raquo; at Harvard University, as well as &laquo;Hanna
  Foundation Lecturer&raquo; at the Western Reserve University, and
  &laquo;Greensfelder Memorial Lecturer&raquo; at the University of
  Chicago. In 1939 he was &laquo;Lecturer of the Purser Memorial
  Foundation&raquo; at Trinity College, University of Dublin.<br>
  <br>

  He has been President of the International Union of Physiological
  Sciences and of the International Council of Pharmacologists and

  held in Brussels in 1956. His vast knowledge of pharmacology has
  justified his nomination as Member of the Committee of Experts of
