  Prague, and his wife Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanl.<br>
  <br>
  He obtained his early education at secondary school till 1909
  when he began his study of chemistry, physics and mathematics at
  the Czech University, Prague. From 1910 to 1914 he continued his
  studies at University College, London, under Professors
  <a href="../1904/index.html">Sir William Ramsay</a>, W.C.Mc.C.
  Lewis and F.G. Donnan, taking his B.Sc. degree in 1913. He was
  particularly interested in working with Professor Donnan, on
  electrochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  During the First World War Heyrovsky did his war service in a
  military hospital as dispensing chemist and radiologist, which
  enabled him to continue his studies and to take his Ph.D. degree
  in Prague in 1918 and D.Sc. in London in 1921.<br>
  <br>
  Heyrovsky started his university career as assistant to Professor
  B. Brauner in the Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the
  Charles University, Prague; he was promoted to
  Associate Professor in 1922 and in 1926 he became the first
  Professor of Physical Chemistry at this University.<br>
  <br>
  Heyrovsky's invention of the polarographic method dates from 1922
  and he concentrated his whole further scientific activity on the
  development of this new branch of electrochemistry. He formed a
  school of Czech polarographers in the University, and was himself
  in the forefront of polarographic research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950 the Professor was appointed Director of the newly
  established Polarographic Institute which has been incorporated
  into the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences since 1952.<br>
  <br>
  Many universities and seats of learning have honoured Professor
  Heyrovsky. He was elected Fellow of University College, London,
  in 1927, and received honorary doctorates of the Technical
  University, Dresden, in 1955, the University of Warsaw in
  1956, the University Aix-Marseille in 1959, and the University
  of Paris in 1960. He was granted honorary membership of the
  American Academy
  of Arts and Sciences, Boston, Mass., in 1933; of the Hungarian Academy of
  Sciences in 1955; the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore,
  in 1955; the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, in 1962; was
  elected Corresponding Member of the German Academy of Sciences,
  Berlin, in 1955; member of the German Academy of Natural
  Scientists, Leopoldina (Halle-Saale) in 1956; Foreign Member of
  the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, Copenhagen, in 1962;
  Vice-President of the International Union of Physics from 1951 to
  1957; President and first honorary member of the Polarographic

  Japan; honorary member of the Chemical Societies of
  Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, England and India.<br>
  <br>
  In Czechoslovakia he was awarded the State Prize, First Grade, in
