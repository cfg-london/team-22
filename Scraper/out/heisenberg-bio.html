  <h1>Werner Heisenberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="heisenberg.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Werner Heisenberg</b> was born
  on 5th December, 1901, at W&uuml;rzburg. He was the son of Dr.
  August Heisenberg and his wife Annie Wecklein. His father later
  became Professor of the Middle and Modern Greek languages in the
  University
  of Munich. It was probably due to his influence that
  Heisenberg remarked, when the Japanese physicist Yukawa
  discovered the particle now known as the meson and the term
  "mesotron" was proposed for it, that the Greek word "mesos" has
  no "tr" in it, with the result that the name "mesotron" was
  changed to "meson".<br>
  <br>
  Heisenberg went to the Maximilian school at Munich until 1920,
  when he went to the University of Munich to study physics under
  Sommerfeld, Wien, Pringsheim, and Rosenthal. During the winter of
  1922-1923 he went to G&ouml;ttingen to study physics under
  <a href="../1954/index.html">Max Born</a>, <a href=
  "../1925/index.html">Franck</a>, and Hilbert. In 1923 he took his
  Ph.D. at the University of Munich and then became Assistant to
  Max Born at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, and in 1924 he gained
  the <i>venia legendi</i> at that University.<br>
  <br>
  From 1924 until 1925 he worked, with a Rockefeller Grant, with
  <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>, at the University of Copenhagen,
  returning for the summer of 1925 to G&ouml;ttingen.<br>
  <br>
  In 1926 he was appointed Lecturer in Theoretical Physics at the
  University of Copenhagen under <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels
  Bohr</a> and in 1927, when he was only 26, he was appointed
  Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of
  Leipzig.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929 he went on a lecture tour to the United States, Japan,
  and India.<br>
  <br>
  In 1941 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University
  of Berlin and Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
  Physics there.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the Second World War he, and other German
  physicists, were taken prisoner by American troops and sent to
  England, but in 1946 he returned to Germany and reorganized, with
  his colleagues, the Institute for Physics at G&ouml;ttingen. This
  Institute was, in 1948, renamed the Max Planck Institute for
  Physics.<br>
  <br>
  In 1948 Heisenberg stayed for some months in Cambridge, England,
  to give lectures, and in 1950 and 1954 he was invited to lecture
  in the United States. In the winter of 1955-1956 he gave the
  Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, these
  lectures being subsequently published as a book.<br>
  <br>
  During 1955 Heisenberg was occupied with preparations for the
  removal of the Max Planck Institute for Physics to Munich. Still
  Director of this Institute, he went with it to Munich and in 1958
  he was appointed Professor of Physics in the University of
  Munich. His Institute was then being renamed the Max Planck
  Institute for Physics and Astrophysics.<br>
  <br>
  Heisenberg's name will always be associated with his theory of
  quantum mechanics, published in 1925, when he was only 23 years
  old. For this theory and the applications of it which resulted
  especially in the discovery of allotropic forms of hydrogen,
  Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for
  1932.<br>
  <br>
  His new theory was based only on what can be observed, that is to
  say, on the radiation emitted by the atom. We cannot, he said,
  always assign to an electron a position in space at a given time,
  nor follow it in its orbit, so that we cannot assume that the
  planetary orbits postulated by Niels Bohr actually exist.
  Mechanical quantities, such as position, velocity, etc. should be
  represented, not by ordinary numbers, but by abstract
  mathematical structures called "matrices" and he formulated his
  new theory in terms of matrix equations.<br>
  <br>
  Later Heisenberg stated his famous <i>principle of
  uncertainty</i>, which lays it down that the determination of the
  position and momentum of a mobile particle necessarily contains
  errors the product of which cannot be less than the quantum
  constant <i>h</i> and that, although these errors are negligible
  on the human scale, they cannot be ignored in studies of the
  atom.<br>
  <br>
  From 1957 onwards Heisenberg was interested in work on problems
  of plasma physics and thermonuclear processes, and also much work
  in close collaboration with the International Institute of Atomic
  Physics at Geneva. He was for several years Chairman of the
  Scientific Policy Committee of this Institute and subsequently
  remained a member of this Committee.<br>
  <br>
  When he became, in 1953, President of the Alexander von
  Humboldt Foundation, he did much to further the policy of
  this Foundation, which was to invite scientists from other
  countries to Germany and to help them to work there.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1953 his own theoretical work was concentrated on the
  unified field theory of elementary particles which seems to him
  to be the key to an understanding of the physics of elementary
  particles.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from many medals and prizes, Heisenberg received an
  honorary doctorate of the University of Bruxelles, of the Technological
  University Karlsruhe, and recently (1964) of the University of Budapest;
  he is also recipient of the Order of Merit of Bavaria, and the
  Grand Cross for Federal Services with Star (Germany). He is a
  Fellow of the Royal Society of London and a Knight of the Order
  of Merit (Peace Class). He is a member of the Academies of
  Sciences of G&ouml;ttingen, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Sweden</a>, Rumania, Norway,
  Spain, The Netherlands, Rome (Pontificial), the German Akademie
  der Naturforscher Leopoldina (Halle), the Accademia dei
  Lincei (Rome), and the American Academy of Sciences. During
  1949-1951 he was President of the Deutsche Forschungsrat (German
  Research Council) and in 1953 he became President of the
  Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  One of his hobbies is classical music: he is a distinguished
  pianist. In 1937 Heisenberg married Elisabeth Schumacher. They
  have seven children, and live in Munich.</p>
