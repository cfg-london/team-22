  <h1>George E. Palade - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="palade.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born in
  November 1912 in Jassy (Iasi), the old capital of Moldavia, the
  eastern province of Romania. My education was started in that
  city and was continued through a baccalaureate (continental
  style) at the "Al Hasdeu" Lyceum in Buzau. My father, Emil
  Palade, was professor of philosophy and my mother, Constanta
  Cantemir-Palade, was a teacher. The family environment explains
  why I acquired early in life great respect for books, scholars
  and education.<br>
  <br>
  My father had hoped I was going to study philosophy at the
  University, like himself, but I preferred to deal with tangibles
  and specifics, and - influenced by relatives much closer to my
  age than he was - I entered the School of Medicine of the
  University of
  Bucharest (Romania) in 1930.<br>
  <br>
  Early in my student years I developed a strong interest in basic
  biomedical sciences by listening to, and speaking with, Francisc
  Rainer and Andr&eacute; Boivin, professors of Anatomy and
  Biochemistry, respectively. As a result, I started working in the
  Anatomy laboratory while still in medical school. I went,
  nonetheless, through six years of hospital training, mostly in
  internal medicine, but I did the work for my doctorate thesis in
  microscopic anatomy on a rather unusual topic (for an M.D.): the
  nephron of the cetacean <i>Delphinus delphi.</i> It was an
  attempt to understand its structure in terms of the functional
  adaptation of a mammal to marine life.<br>
  <br>
  I graduated in 1940 and, after a short period as an assistant in
  internal medicine, I went back to Anatomy, since the discrepancy
  between knowledge possessed by, and expected from, the medical
  practitioners of that time made me rather uneasy.<br>
  <br>
  During the second world war, I served in the medical corps of the
  Romanian Army, and after the war - encouraged by Grigore Popa,
  Rainer's successor - I came to the United States in 1946 for
  further studies. I worked for a few months in the Biology
  Laboratory of Robert Chambers at New York University and, while there, I met
  <a href="index.html">Albert Claude</a> who had come to give a
  seminar on his work in electron microscopy. I was fascinated by
  the perspectives opened by his findings and extremely happy when,
  after a short discussion following his seminar, he asked me to
  come to work with him at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical
  Research in the fall of the same year. This was truly a timely
  development, since Chambers was retiring that summer.<br>
  <br>
  At The Rockefeller Institute, Claude was working in the
  department of Pathology of James Murphy with George Hogeboom and
  Walter Schneider as direct collaborators; Keith Porter was in the
  same department but had developed his own line of research on the
  electron microscopy of cultured animal cells. At the beginning, I
  worked primarily on cell fractionation procedures, and I
  developed with Hogeboom and Schneider the "sucrose method" for
  the homogenization and fractionation of liver tissue. This first
  "Rockefeller group" had a rather short existence: Schneider
  returned to the University of Wisconsin, Hogeboom moved to the
  National Cancer
  Institute, and Claude went back to Belgium in 1949 to assume
  the directorship of the Jules Bordet Institute. Only Porter and I
  remained at The Rockefeller Institute; two years later, upon
  Murphy's retirement, we became "orphans" and were adopted by
  <a href="../1944/index.html">Herbert Gasser</a> then the director
  of the Institute, since none of us had the rank required to head
  a laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  Around that time, I started working in electron microscopy with
  the general aim of developing preparation procedures applicable
  to organized tissue. This line of research had been tackled
  before by a few investigators, Claude included, but there was
  still ample room for improvement. Taking advantage of whatever
  techniques were already available, Porter and I worked out enough
  improvements in microtomy and tissue fixation to obtain
  preparations which, at least for a while, appeared satisfactory
  and gratifying. A period of intense activity and great excitement
  followed since the new layer of biological structure revealed by
  electron microscopy proved to be unexpectedly rich and
  surprisingly uniform for practically all eukaryotic cells.
  Singly, or in collaboration with others, I did my share in
  exploring the newly open territory and, in the process, I defined
  the fine structure of mitochondria, and described the small
  particulate component of the cytoplasm (later called ribosomes);
  with Porter, I investigated the local differentiations of the
  endoplasmic reticulum and with Sanford Palay I worked out the
  fine structure of chemical synapses. With all this activity, our
  laboratory became reasonably well known and started functioning
  as a training center for biological electron microscopy. The
  circumstances that permitted this development were unusually
  favorable: we didn't have to worry about research funds (since we
  were well supported by Herbert Gasser), we had practically
  complete freedom in selecting our targets, strong competitors who
  kept us alert, and excellent collaborators who helped us in
  maintaining our advance.<br>
  <br>
  In the middle 1950's, I felt that the time was ripe for going
  back to cell fractionation as a means of defining the chemical
  composition and the functional role of the newly discovered
  subcellular components. The intent was to use electron microscopy
  for monitoring cell fractionation. I was starting from structural
  findings and morphological criteria seemed appropriate for
  assessing the degree of homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the
  cell fractions. Philip Siekevitz joined our laboratory in 1955
  and together we showed that Claude's microsomes were fragments of
  the endoplasmic reticulum (as postulated by Claude in 1948) and
  that the ribosomes were ribonucleoprotein particles. To find out
  more about the function of the endoplasmic reticulum and of the
  attached ribosomes, we started an integrated morphological and
  biochemical analysis of the secretory process in the guinea pig
  pancreas.<br>
  <br>
  In 1961, Keith Porter who had been the head of our group since
  1953 joined the Biological Laboratories of Harvard University
  and, with his departure, the history of the second "Rockefeller
  group" came to an end. It was during this period that cell
  biology became a recognized field of research in biological
  sciences and that the Journal of Cell Biology and the American
  Society for Cell Biology were founded. Our group participated
  actively in each of these developments.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1960's, I continued the work on the secretory process
  using in parallel or in succession two different approaches. The
  first relied exclusively on cell fractionation, and was developed
  in collaboration with Philip Siekevitz, Lewis Greene, Colvin
  Redman, David Sabatini and Yutaka Tashiro; it led to the
  characterization of the zymogen granules and to the discovery of
  the segregation of secretory products in the cisternal space of
  the endoplasmic reticulum. The second approach relied primarily on
  radioautography, and involved experiments on intact animals or
  pancreatic slices which were carried out in collaboration with
  Lucien Caro and especially James Jamieson. This series of
  investigations produced a good part of our current ideas on the
  synthesis and intracellular processing of proteins for export. A
  critical review of this line of research is presented in the
  Nobel Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  In parallel with the work on the secretory process in the
  pancreatic exocrine cell, I maintained an interest in the
  structural aspects of capillary permeability, that goes back to
  the early 1950's when I found a large population of plasmalemmal
  vesicles in the endothelial cells of blood capillaries. Along
  this line of research, Marilyn Farquhar and I investigated the
  capillaries of the renal glomeruli and recognized that, in their
  case, the basement membrane is the filtration barrier for
  molecules of 100A diameter or larger; a byproduct of this work
  was the definition of junctional complexes in a variety of
  epithelia. Visceral (fenestrated) capillaries were investigated
  with Francesco Clementi, and muscular capillaries with Romaine
  Bruns and Nicolae and Maia Simionescu.<br>
  <br>
  The capillary work has relied primarily on the use of "probe"
  molecules of known dimensions detected individually or in mass
  (after cytochemical reactions) by electron microscopy. It led to
  the identification of the passageways followed by large
  water-soluble molecules in both types of capillaries and by small
  molecules in visceral capillaries. The pathway followed by small,
  watersoluble molecules in muscular capillaries is still under
  investigation.<br>
  <br>
  In the middle of the 1960's our laboratory began a series of
  investigations on membrane biogenesis in eukaryotic cells using
  as model objects either the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian
  hepatocytes (with P. Siekevitz, Gustav Dallner and Andrea
  Leskes), or the thylakoid membranes of a green alga
  (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) (With P. Siekevitz, Kenneth
  Hoober and Itzhak Ohad). These studies showed that "new" membrane
  is produced by expansion of "old" preexisting membrane (there is
  no <i>de novo</i> membrane assembly), and that new molecules are
  asynchronously inserted, and randomly distributed throughout the
  expanding membrane. Asynchrony also applies to the turnover of
  membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by work
  down with P. Siekevitz, Tsuneo Omura and Walter Bock.<br>
  <br>
  In 1973, I left the Rockefeller University to join the Yale
  University Medical School. The main reason for the move was
  my belief that the time had come for fruitful interactions
  between the new discipline of Cell Biology and the traditional
  fields of interest of medical schools, namely Pathology and
  Clinical Medicine. Besides, my work at the Rockefeller University
  was done: when I left there were at least five other laboratories
  working in different sectors of cell biology.<br>
  <br>
  At present I am investigating, together with my collaborators,
  the interactions which occur among the membranes of the various
  compartments of the secretory pathway, namely the endoplasmic
  reticulum, the Golgi complex, the secretion granules, and the
  plasmalemma.<br>
  <br>
  I have been a member of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) since 1961,
  and I have received in the past a number of awards and prizes for
  my scientific work, among them: the Lasker Award (1966), the
  Gairdner Special Award (1967), and the Hurwitz Prize - shared
  with Albert Claude and Keith Porter (1970).<br>
  <br>
  Since my high school years I have been interested in history,
  especially in Roman history, a topic on which I have read rather
  extensively. The Latin that goes with this kind of interest
  proved useful when I had to generate a few terms and names for
  cell biology.<br>
  <br>
  I have a daughter, Georgia Palade Van Duzen, and a son Philip
  Palade from a first marriage with Irina Malaxa, now deceased. In
  1970 I married Marilyn Gist Farquhar who is a cell biologist like
  myself.</p>
