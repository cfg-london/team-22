  <h1>H. Robert Horvitz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="horvitz.jpg" class="bio-img">"He can't even throw
  a baseball!" was the way my cousin Harvey greeted me soon after
  my birth on May 8, 1947. Looking forward to a fellow athlete,
  Harvey, age three, found me ill prepared for sports. I suspect
  the disappointment continued, as Harvey progressed to become one
  of the star little league players in Chicago. I did not.</p>

  <p><b>Family history</b><br>
  Chicago is my hometown. My mother Mary Savit Horvitz was born in
  Chicago, and my father Oscar Horvitz was born in the neighboring
  town of Joliet. Both of my parents were first-generation
  Americans, the children of Jews who left Eastern Europe around
  the turn of the century. My maternal grandfather David Savit
  (Savitzky) was born in 1879 and came to Chicago in 1904 (via
  Liverpool, Halifax and Detroit) from Oster, Russia, in
  present-day Ukraine about 40 miles north of Kiev. He was the
  second oldest of ten children, and his widowed mother Malke
  Zolotar Savitzky and his eight younger siblings followed him to
  Chicago. David was a dress manufacturer and a grocer, but I
  remember him most reading, playing chess (sometimes with me) or
  standing at his newstand selling newspapers. The family held him
  in awe as a gentle and caring human being, and as a scholar.</p>

  <p>My maternal grandmother Rose Bleiweiss
  Savit came to Chicago from Galicia, Austria, around 1902. She was
  from an area that was alternatingly Austrian and Polish, from a
  town that is now Debica, Poland, about 60 miles east of Cracow. I
  always thought of her as Polish. She was one of the lucky members
  of her family, as her father Hersch David Bleiweiss and at least
  three of her siblings were murdered by the Nazis. Rose married
  David Savit in 1908, and my mother Mary Savit was born in 1921,
  the youngest of four girls, after Ann, Sylvia and Esther. In the
  early 1950s, David and Rose moved to Miami because of Rose's ill
  health, but after David's death in 1957 Rose returned to Chicago.
  She lived with us from 1963 until her death in 1968. Like David,
  Rose played chess, but she enjoyed poker more and sometimes
  joined poker games with my friends and me. Before I left for
  college in 1964, I spent one year living with Rose and during
  this time heard many stories, most of them about Chicago
  speakeasies during the 1920s.</p>

  <p>My father's parents were Samuel and Celia
  Horvitz. Sam's original name was Solomon ben Mikhail Gourevitch,
  but, like many other immigrants to the U.S., he found his name
  altered upon entry to the country. Sam was from a Jewish village
  called Shchedrin, located near Minsk, in what was then Russia and
  is now Belarus. Sam was from a wealthy Russian family. His father
  ran a lumber business but, being Jewish, was not allowed to own
  any land himself. Sam spoke Russian, Polish, Yiddish and German.
  He married his first wife (not my grandmother) in Poland in 1902
  and went to Chicago to avoid the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War.
  Once in the U.S., Sam worked in the garment trade as a presser.
  In 1910, he was blacklisted for participating in the four-month
  long Hart, Schaffner and Marx labor strike. Hart, Schaffner and
  Marx was a giant clothing manufacturer, the largest company in
  Chicago at that time. Employees were subjected to excessive work
  hours, miniscule wages and subhuman working conditions, and a
  strike at the company became the basis of a city-wide violent
  clash between businesses and the unions. Sam kept a hat with a
  bullet hole in it, a souvenir of a shot taken at him during a
  union rally. He became an insurance salesman, and it was because
  he was working for a Polish insurance company that from 1917 to
  1920 he lived in Joliet, which had much industry, many steel
  mills and large numbers of Polish immigrants. Later, Sam operated
  a Chicago dry cleaning business, which I remember visiting once,
  just before he died in 1951.</p>

  <p>Sam's first wife died in 1908, and he and
  their two daughters moved in with cousins, where my paternal
  grandmother Celia Bolotin was a boarder. Celia was from
  Novgorad-Syovorsk, about 150 miles northeast of Kiev in Russia.
  Celia was generally called by her Hebrew name of Tzipporeh, which
  means "little bird." In Russia she had lived in a one-room house,
  which her family shared with the domestic animals, for mutual
  warmth. As a young girl, Celia was unusual. First, unlike most
  girls in her town, she learned to read. Second, she was rather
  stubborn and independently minded. Because in one of the books
  she had read a girl was cruelly mistreated by her step-mother,
  when young Celia's widowed father remarried and was loading a
  cart to take his family and possessions to another town to live
  with his new wife, Celia refused to go, and moved in with an
  aunt. Both a desire for knowledge and a strong will are family
  characteristics that have endured. In 1905, Celia, not yet 20
  years old, was involved in the first Bolshevik uprising and was
  captured by the Czar's police. Knowing that they were executing
  people who knew how to read or write, she feigned illiteracy.
  They released her, but informed her if caught again she would be
  killed. Celia left Russia, traveling via Rotterdam to Chicago.
  She and Sam were married around 1909, and she raised Sam's two
  daughters (Faye and Bess) as well as two daughters (Pearl and
  Diana) and two sons (Mike and my father, Oscar) from their own
  marriage. My father, like my mother, was the youngest. My
  father's family moved a lot - about every three months - because
  landlords offered three months free rent to attract tenants. I
  never knew either of my father's parents very well, as Celia died
  before I was three and Sam when I was four. My father and Sam
  were not on good terms, both because Sam left Celia for another
  woman and because Sam failed to provide any support for the large
  family he deserted during the Depression. I think both Celia and
  Sam influenced me greatly through my father, who learned about
  responsibility from his mother and about the costs of
  irresponsibility from his father.</p>

  <p>My father was born on November 3, 1918,
  just before the signing of the armistice ending World War I. His
  parents were delighted that the war was ending, and named him
  Oscar Freedom Horvitz. My father never liked and never used his
  middle name, signing things as Oscar F. or, more often, simply as
  Oscar. He grew up on the north side of Chicago, but nonetheless
  became an ardent fan of the south-side Chicago White Sox baseball
  team. Dad himself wanted to be a professional baseball player,
  but his eyes went bad when he was young (as did mine) and his
  family could not afford to buy eyeglasses. Eventually, one of his
  teachers purchased a pair of glasses for him. As a teenager, my
  father worked as a milkman's helper, and many weeks the family
  lived on the butter, eggs, milk and cottage cheese he was allowed
  to bring home from whatever was left over at the end of the daily
  run. After my father finished high school, he went to work to
  support both his mother and himself. He took a job with an
  advertising agency, clipping ads from daily and weekly newspapers
  around the country. He found the job tediously dull, and to amuse
  himself he memorized the names of every town and its newspaper.
  He remembered these names throughout his life, and I think back
  fondly how years later people would express amazement that he
  knew not only the locations of their hometowns but also the names
  of their hometown newspapers.</p>

  <p>My mother Mary Savit was born on June 5,
  1921. Not given any middle name, she decided to adopt the middle
  initial "R," because it gave her the initials "MRS." She lived in
  a variety of neighborhoods in Chicago's north side. My parents
  met at a Christmas party in 1938, when my mother was 17 and my
  father 20. While in high school, my mother worked for 25 cents
  per hour as a sales clerk in a dimestore. In college, she had a
  part-time job as a bookkeeper and telephone switchboard operator
  at a company that made and sold uniforms for military officers.
  My mother obtained a teaching certificate in elementary education
  and then a B.A. in English from the Chicago Teacher's College.
  She began substitute teaching in the Chicago public schools. My
  father changed jobs, working next at a mail-order house, and
  attended night school to study chemistry, which he loved.
  However, he soon realized that he could not afford the continued
  schooling that would be needed to allow him to make a living as a
  chemist. He switched to accounting. In 1941, my father passed the
  civil service exam in accounting and was hired by the General
  Accounting Office of the U.S. Government for a job in Washington,
  D.C. To be together, he and my mother decided to get married.
  Because he could not afford and my mother did not want a diamond
  ring, my father bought a ring for my mother in a dimestore. He
  returned to Chicago for the wedding, which was on June 30, 1942.
  They lived in Washington until 1945, when they moved back to
  Chicago. While in Washington, shortly after my parent's marriage,
  my father was hit by a car, soon thereafter leaving him with a
  steel pin in his shoulder. He later told me that without this
  accident I might never have existed, as otherwise he would have
  been drafted into the army and who knows what would have happened
  to him if he had gone to war. In Chicago my father continued
  working with the General Accounting Office, while my mother
  continued the employment she had begun in Washington, D.C., with
  the Social Security Board of the U.S. Government.</p>

  <p><b>Growing up</b><br>
  I was born in 1947 and given the name Howard Robert Horvitz. My
  first name, which started with an "H," was in memory of my
  great-grandfather Hersch, who had been shot a few years before by
  the Nazis. "Robert" my parents simply liked, in fact so much that
  they decided to call me "Bobby" and registered me for
  kindergarten as "Robert H." Later, when I went to university, I
  reverted to the name on my birth certificate and became known as
  "H. Robert." As I grew up my parents mostly called me "Bob,"
  reserving "Robert" for times of disapproval and "Rob" or
  sometimes "Robin," by my father, as terms of love. I begged my
  parents for a baby sister, and, on October 5, 1950, my sister
  Carol Cecile was born. She was named for my grandmother Celia,
  who had died earlier that year. I remember awakening the day my
  sister was born, surprised to find myself in my parent's bed next
  to my Aunt Ann, my mother's oldest sister. Ann died of
  Alzheimer's Disease many years later, one of a number of my
  personal reasons for becoming interested in neurodegenerative
  disorders.</p>

      Me, with The Great Pumpkin (1948).
    
  </p>

  <p>We lived on the north side of Chicago,
  which led to my becoming a fan of the Chicago Cubs baseball team,
  unlike my father, whose loyalty to the White Sox continued. My
  parents saved their money and moved repeatedly to find better
  homes for themselves and their family. When I was born, we lived
  in a one-room kitchenette near Lake Michigan, and I slept behind
  a screen while they ate, entertained or slept. We moved some
  miles west in 1948 to a one bedroom, four-room apartment. After
  my sister Carol was born, we moved again a few blocks away to a
  five-room bungalow on Rockwell St. Sometimes at night Carol and I
  secretly crawled out through her window to play in the back yard
  with friends who lived next door. One of the great delights of my
  receiving the Nobel Prize was that I was contacted by many old
  friends with whom I had lost touch, including one of these
  next-door neighbors on Rockwell St.</p>

  <p>The Rockwell St. house is where I feel that
  I grew up, living there from ages five through 12. The
  neighborhood at that time was a mix of 1920s bungalows and
  apartment buildings, and was mostly Jewish. Author <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1976/index.html">Saul Bellow</a>'s father
  lived a few houses south of us. I was a member of a club we named
  the Epics, without having any idea what the word meant but simply
  because we liked its sound. The year after I moved out of
  Chicago, the Epics became the Commodores, a gang. Rockwell St.
  was also important for me because it was while living there I
  became good friends with Ira Zarov, who lived across the street
  and whose mother was my Den Mother in Cub Scouts. Ira and I
  remain very close, exchanging e-mails almost daily and spending a
  week of most summers with our families together at his family
  home along the south shore of Lake Michigan, near Chicago.</p>

  <p>I went to the DeWitt Clinton Elementary
  School and got into trouble repeatedly for small misdemeanors,
  particularly in the third grade. One transgression was my
  insistence upon crossing in the middle of the street to walk to
  school with Ira. Another involved the fact that Ira and I had
  acquired vast quantities of gumballs as a consequence of having
  found a cardboard circle that could substitute for a penny in the
  gumball machine in the local candy store. A few years later Ira
  and I were stopped at knife point by a boy trying to rob us. He
  was no bigger than we were. Ira and I moved apart and pointed out
  to our assailant that we had him outnumbered. He left.</p>

  <p>In 1960, my family moved to the northern
  Chicago suburb of Skokie, because the schools were better. I
  attended eighth grade at East Prairie Grammar School. Because I
  had come from the Chicago school system, I was placed in the
  lowest of the three academic tracks for all of my classes. Within
  a few weeks, each of my teachers moved me to the highest track.
  The consequence was that I got to know, and become friends with,
  most of the eighth grade students very rapidly. My eighth grade
  English teacher, Marcia Wachs, is particularly memorable and
  engaged me in the reading of proper English literature. A year
  after I left her class, she sent me a book accompanied by a very
  nice note: "How many times I have thought of you and wondered how
  you were enjoying high school. ... You seem to have a talent for
  writing, and I thought you might profit from reading this book.
  It's a gem ... ." The book was "The Elements of Style" by Strunk
  and White. I still have both the book and her note, and I use the
  book to this day (particularly when I try to educate members of
  my laboratory concerning the usage of "which" and "that").</p>

  <p>In 1947, the year I was born, my father
  became a Certified Public Accountant. His professional life
  thereafter was that of an accountant. My father loved numbers, a
  love I learned from him. Eventually, he became the Vice President
  and Treasurer of a major trucking company based in Chicago.
  Whenever we went on family trips, Carol and I always watched for
  Spector trucks, sometimes reminded by my father that the stock he
  had purchased for us was almost enough to say that we owned one
  of the tires on the truck. He was President of the Motor Carriers
  Accountants Society of Chicago. I was always very proud of the
  fact that he had published a book, which was an income tax guide
  for farmers. He also authored a chapter in a book about data
  processing. Published in 1957 and focused on the accounting
  machines and punched cards of the era, his chapter noted,
  "Long-range studies of electronic computers are being made at the
  present time." In 1989, my father died from amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS). His illness moved me to become actively involved
  in research involving this horrific neurodegenerative
  disease.</p>

  <p>A sense of my father is reflected in a
  dedication written by my sister and me to an ALS Resource Book,
  the publication and distribution of which we funded. We wrote:
  "Dad was a humanitarian, not only in his values, but also in the
  actions of his everyday life. He cared deeply about people and
  always had the time to listen and provide insight. He was
  happiest when he was making someone else happy. In our family,
  Dad created an environment filled with a love of knowledge and
  the joy of inquiry and discovery about the world around us. Not a
  day went by without his learning something new and our learning
  something from him. So many things interested him: foreign
  languages, exotic places, history, new words, opera, baseball,
  people. He was equally excited by an exchange of smiles with
  little children as by a beautiful piece of music or by some
  scientific discovery. He also had a way with languages and often
  surprised people by speaking with them in their native tongue or
  talking with them about some detail of their country that few
  would know about. He once dreamed of being a major-league
  catcher, and then of being a research chemist. Numbers were his
  friends, and he chose accounting as his profession. However, his
  love of science continued and was infectious, giving both of us
  the opportunity and encouragement to study and lead lives
  dedicated to scientific inquiry. Dad was a wonderful mentor. He
  always strove to do his best, and he always brought out the best
  in those around him."</p>

  <p>My father's illness and death were an
  immeasurable loss to me. My father was a major cornerstone of my
  life. It was my father who came to talk with the elementary
  school principal with me after my more serious infringements. It
  was my father who - after at age 15 I had attempted
  unsuccessfully to drive the family car using a "borrowed" key and
  knocked down a wall of the garage - convinced me over the
  telephone not to run away from home and who then came home from
  work not to punish me but rather to console and comfort me. It
  was my father who would sit with me and amaze me as he solved
  diagramless crossword puzzles and double acrostics by simply
  reading the clues and writing in the answers to each as he read
  them. It was my father who, throughout my adult life, prepared my
  income tax returns and who, once ill and dying, taught me how to
  prepare them myself. I think it was when my father died that I
  really grew up. I also became more introspective and much closer
  to both my sister and my mother during his illness. This
  closeness has continued.</p>

  <p>My mother began working as an elementary
  school teacher in 1948, stopped in 1950 when my sister was born,
  and then resumed teaching in 1955. She first taught in the third
  grade and then progressed through the grades with me until she
  stopped as a seventh and eighth grade teacher of math and
  science. Her training was in English, and her interest in science
  and her desire to be a good teacher led her to take part in a
  program supported by the National Science Foundation in which she spent a
  summer studying astronomy. Later she returned to school and
  obtained an M.A. in guidance and counseling, after which she
  worked as an elementary school guidance counselor. My mother
  retired in 1988. My mother has been a wonderful model for the
  professional woman - a loving mother dedicated to both her family
  and her work. She inspired me, made me proud and developed in me
  an enormous respect for women in general. My mother chose
  teaching as a profession in part because it would allow her to be
  home with her children as they grew up. Nonetheless, to this day,
  she asks me if she ruined my life by returning to work too soon
  after my birth. I tell her I do not believe that I turned out so
  badly.</p>

  <p>I could always depend on my mother. She is
  capable, organized, practical, logical and absolutely reliable.
  Although she is a worrier, my mother never loses her sense of
  purpose or her ability to deal with difficult situations. When I
  was hit in the eye with a baseball, it was my mother who took me
  for stitches (after leaving my father the succinct note: "Took
  Bob to the hospital. Don't worry."). When friends and I rode our
  bicycles to O'Hare Airport (a trip far beyond the confines we
  were supposed to traverse) and one of the others got a flat tire,
  it was my mother who came and brought us home. It was also my
  mother, with her interest and knowledge as a science teacher, who
  encouraged my first experiences with experimental science. My
  sixth grade science project, which I think was her idea, was
  entitled "Electricity Produces Light through Heat" and won a
  third prize. My ninth grade project, in which I used the fruit
  fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to replicate Gregor Mendel's
  famed 3:1 and 9:3:3:1 inheritance ratios, required my mother to
  relinquish her bathroom for my breeding experiments. She helped
  me prepare the fly food, which smelled awful, and tolerated the
  fact that to anesthetize the flies I used ether, which smelled
  worse. This project also won a prize, and earned me a trip to the
  Illinois State Science Fair, in Champaign-Urbana. My mother saved
  the (written) project intact, and when the announcement was made
  that I had received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
  Medicine, my mother showed a local reporter my 1961 science fair
  poster, one panel of which was then reproduced in the Chicago
  Sun-Times on October 8, 2002 (next to my high school graduation
  photograph).</p>

  <p>My mother's strength and independence
  became clearest to me as she nursed my father during his illness
  and as she has coped with and redefined her life after his death.
  My mother, now age 81, is impressively active and completely
  engaged in the events of the world. She regularly takes brisk
  walks for exercise and particularly enjoys walking at a nearby
  botanical garden. She is a bridge player, and loves the theater,
  the symphony, movies and art. She has long been politically
  active, and for some years has supported local and national
  actions of the National Council of Jewish Women. My mother has many
  friends, some of whom, albeit sadly a diminishing number, she has
  had for decades. My parents traveled together extensively, and my
  mother has continued her travels on her own, for example touring
  Australia, New Zealand and China. She also has visited Greece,
  Turkey and Costa Rica with my sister Carol. Their descriptions of
  the trip to Costa Rica, to see one of Carol's field stations in
  the tropical rainforest, were somewhat divergent. Whereas Carol
  described the site as the Hilton of field stations, my mother
  emphasized the primitive conditions that she had experienced.
  Carol never told my mother that each night before going to sleep
  she would check my mother's bedding for deadly snakes and
  spiders. After my father died, my mother for 10 years taught
  English as a second language on a volunteer basis to immigrants
  from all over the world. She also has taken countless adult
  education courses, on topics as diverse as international
  relations, world religions, poetry, music appreciation and money
  management. She has very recently obtained and begun to learn to
  use a computer. My mother is highly organized, and both her home
  and her person are well-kempt. She has been described as "an
  elegant woman." She is constantly sending me newspaper clippings,
  sometimes about the world but more often with advice about foods,
  health, finance or child-rearing. Generally, the advice is very
  good.</p>

  <p>My father and my mother were a team, in
  raising my sister and me and in life in general. Together they
  instilled in me a sense of responsibility, of commitment, of
  determination, of fairness, of pride, of ambition, of optimism
  and of love. People, particularly family, came first. Knowledge
  and learning were revered. We were all always expected to do our
  best. Prejudice was unacceptable and attributed to ignorance.
  Time together and family vacations were important, and we
  traveled together extensively within the U.S. Without doubt, my
  parents defined the priorities and many of the interests that
  came to be central in my life.</p>

  <p>Growing up with my sister Carol was a
  special delight, except perhaps during a few of my teenage years
  when I regarded her at best as an intrusion. When little we would
  play together, and I would make up long stories of flying horses
  and imaginary friends. Carol voiced progressive views at an early
  age. When she was about five, she was listening to a conversation
  between my father and me. After he told me "Everything is made of
  atoms," she immediately cried in response, "That's not fair!
  Isn't anything made of Eves?" Carol and I were quite divergent in
  our interests, with her gravitating toward the artistic and
  poetic aspects of life, whereas I was more focused on math,
  science and schemes to make money. Carol also was more
  rebellious, first against our quite secular home - she adapted
  the orthodox Jewish custom of lighting candles and saying prayers
  on Friday nights and went to a Hebrew overnight camp - and later
  politically, leaving Barnard College (at Columbia
  University) with the plan of becoming a left-wing political
  activist. Our parents intervened, and she registered at highly
  liberal Antioch College in Ohio, which because of its
  work study program allowed her to be almost any place but Ohio.
  While she was a student at Antioch, Carol spent time in Colombia,
  South America, and developed her passion for botany, Spanish and
  Latin culture. During this period Carol was rescued rather
  dramatically and against her will by our parents from a nearly
  fatal disease and an ill-fated engagement to a Colombian merchant
  marine, after which she stayed briefly in Chicago. I invited her
  to come to Boston, and she moved in with me, living on a front
  porch that we insulated for her and working at the Harvard
  Herbarium. Carol then went back to school and obtained a
  Ph.D. degree in biology, just like me. It is amazing, given our
  backgrounds and interests, that we both became biologists. Carol
  married Randy Nutt, an artist also from Chicago, and the two of
  them now live in Miami, Florida, where Carol is on the faculty of
  the University of Miami. Carol has spent much of her
  life in the tropical rainforests of Mexico, Central and South
  America. I believe we have always been close and mutually
  supportive, and I often think about the different view of life
  held by those who are not lucky enough to have siblings.</p>

  <p>In addition to my family, there was another
  constant presence in my young life that I believe influenced me
  greatly. At age two and a half, I acquired asthma. For many years
  thereafter, nights (in particular) could plague me with a
  shortness of breath that made me feel (and occasionally wish)
  that I was dying. When I was small, my father would carry me in
  his arms through the night. Later I would just lie in bed,
  waiting for the dawn and hoping for the relief that often came
  with daybreak. I had tests, medications, and shots. The asthma
  continued and affected my life in many ways. Most sports seemed
  precluded. At age 10, I insisted upon going away to Camp Chi, an
  overnight camp in nearby Wisconsin, and spent almost the entire
  two weeks in the infirmary, with an adrenaline inhalator next to
  my bed. Despite these stresses, instead of becoming increasingly
  afraid of life, I think I became more and more determined to
  experience and conquer it. Nothing, I thought, could be worse
  than what I had already suffered. I became fearless, unafraid to
  go anywhere and try anything and determined to persevere, even
  when my shortness of breath made my physical suffering so great I
  could barely force myself to move.</p>

  <p>In retrospect, I think back to growing up
  in Chicago with the impression that I had far more freedom and
  independence than I would allow a child today. After school, my
  friends and I wandered the neighborhood, which was assumed to be
  and probably was safe. For a while, Ira and I went house-to-house
  selling magazine subscriptions, hoping to earn all sorts of
  wonderful prizes. We rang every doorbell within the distance we
  could walk between school and dinner. We never sold a single
  subscription, but we did meet and talk with lots of people. For
  greater distances, my bicycle was my major source of
  transportation. Bicycle explorations went far beyond my local
  neighborhood and as often as possible into unknown areas. These
  adventures perhaps helped kindle the wanderlust that stays with
  me today.</p>

  <p>In high school, the means of my
  explorations progressed from bicycles to cars. Before I could
  drive, I hitch-hiked through Chicago, simply going wherever the
  drivers were headed. Once the first of my friends turned age 16,
  we had access to cars, and a much greater world was opened. We
  went north to the expansive Lake Michigan beaches of wealthy
  Chicago suburbs and once even to Wisconsin (discovering in the
  process how fast a station wagon could go). We went south into
  the heart of the Chicago slums. 14th and Peoria, reportedly the
  site of various houses of ill-repute (we never got out of the
  car, so I never ascertained if that was true), was a favorite
  target.</p>

  <p>As a high school student I did well
  academically. My introduction to biology was in the ninth grade,
  when I did my <i>Drosophila</i> breeding experiments. The class
  consisted almost entirely of dissections of
  formaldehyde-preserved animal corpses. The teacher was allergic
  to formaldehyde (or so he told us), and left us on our own each
  day. Mostly, I played dots with my laboratory partner. Based upon
  this experience, I never would have guessed that I would later
  become a professional biologist. For a project for this class, I
  made an extensive insect collection, which the school kept and
  displayed. While collecting insects in Chicago's Humboldt Park,
  Ira and I were mugged by two older boys. They put their arms
  around our necks, and one said, "Your money or your lives." Ira
  and I laughed, which was the wrong response. They squeezed more
  tightly, and I relinquished my butterfly net and thirty-nine
  cents.</p>

  <p>As a sophomore, I received my first B,
  which was for one quarter of a summer school World History class.
  It was traumatic. I had been encouraged at home to have high
  expectations. Later B's were less upsetting. I tended to work
  reasonably hard and developed a method of study that consisted of
  my trying to think of every possible question the teacher could
  ask followed by my writing both the question and the answer to
  the question on paper, which then allowed me to review both
  easily. This approach took some time and presumably reinforced
  the various facts I was supposed to be learning. I was the
  Assistant Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper, The
  Nilehilite, which was my main extracurricular activity.</p>

  <p>While I was in high school, my parents
  became convinced I would later become an entrepreneurial
  businessman. I had a variety of money-making plans. I published a
  magazine that I called Brigand (again, I simply liked the sound
  of the word), using a mimeograph machine for mass production. I
  sold advertisements for Brigand to local merchants and sold the
  magazines to friends, neighbors and relatives - mostly relatives.
  In another scheme, a shipment of sweatshirts had been damaged in
  one of the trucks from the trucking company at which my father
  worked. The trucking company had to buy the sweatshirts, which I
  purchased and resold at a profit. I also had a number of
  part-time jobs. For a while, I worked at an insurance company,
  looking at a handwritten number on a new insurance application
  and stamping that number onto the upper right hand corner of the
  first page the application. My most memorable job was at the
  large discount house E. J. Korvette's, where I was employed in
  the record department and was able to buy records at wholesale
  prices. My boss was a bit of an eccentric, and every day after
  the store oficially closed he would play at maximal volume his
  favorite album, "The War Whoops of the North American
  Indians."</p>

  <p>I did not have a clear idea about either
  where I wanted to go to college or what I wanted to study. I
  enjoyed science, particularly math and chemistry, but I also
  liked English and working on the school newspaper. It seemed
  likely that I, like most of my classmates who chose to continue
  their education, would attend the University of
  Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. Alternatively, some of the best
  students went a bit further away, to the University of
  Michigan in Ann Arbor. I applied to both schools. However, a
  guidance counselor insisted that I also apply to "some school in
  the East." I said that I would be happy to do so and that she
  should pick the school. She picked MIT, and I applied. I visited the University
  of Michigan the weekend of a Michigan vs. Michigan State football
  game, and the beer and partying convinced me this was not where I
  wanted to be. I was scheduled to visit the University of Illinois
  one weekend in November, but on Friday, November 22, President
  John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and my trip and much of the
  rest of what was happening in the U.S., were cancelled. The
  upshot was that when I was accepted to MIT, I saw no reason not
  to go there (except for the pleas from my English teacher, who
  warned me that my intellectual development would cease if I went
  to such a technical school).</p>

  <p>The assassination of JFK for me, as for so
  many others, was an enormously deep shock. I was 16 years old and
  simply could not believe such things could happen in the country
  in which I lived. This event was one of a small number that no
  doubt are etched deeply in the minds of many, causing us all to
  remember precisely where we were at the time. In this case, I was
  in my high school cafeteria. Five years later, when JFK's brother
  Bobby was shot, I learned the news from the radio upon awakening
  in my apartment in Brighton, Massachusetts. Much more recently,
  on September 11, 2001, I was at a meeting of the Howard Hughes Medical
  Institute in Chevy Chase, Maryland, sitting next to the HHMI
  President, Tom Cech, when Tom was called outside to be told what
  was soon to be announced to the entire group about the attacks on
  New York City and Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p><b>MIT, the first time</b><br>
  I flew from Chicago to Boston to begin life as an undergraduate
  student at MIT in September, 1964. At the freshman orientation,
  Dean Fred Fassett (whom I later got to know better after getting
  into some trouble) said "Look to your left. Look to your right.
  One of you won't be here when the rest of you graduate." My
  undergraduate years were a mix of academics and extracurricular
  activities, more of the latter than the former. I became Features
  and then Managing Editor of the MIT student newspaper, The Tech,
  and had the great excitement of scooping the Boston daily
  newspapers in getting a story and the paper out the morning after
  the great blackout in the northeast in 1965. I was very active in
  student government and was a member of a variety of committees
  and councils. When I became a candidate for student body
  president, I learned the names, hometowns, faces and majors of
  all approximately 3500 undergraduates. I spent full-time
  campaigning, met lots of people, and won the election. The next
  year I lived in a three-piece suit and had endless meetings with
  MIT administrators and, less often, with students. I talked with
  James Killian (President Eisenhower's Science Advisor), Jerry
  Wiesner (President Kennedy's Science Advisor), Jay Forrester (the
  inventor of magnetic core storage) and other MIT luminaries.
  Professor Forrester offered the view that everyone should change
  professions every seven years, a comment I have thought about
  many times since. I felt that I was grooming myself for a career
  in law and politics or possibly in business.</p>

  <p>My coursework probably suffered, not in my
  grades, particularly, but in what I was learning. Mostly I would
  wait until the night before an examination, stay up all night,
  and learn what I needed to know to answer the questions the next
  day. For some courses I did nothing whatsoever until the week
  before the final examination. When one of my professors penalized
  me for turning in all of my problem sets at the end of the
  course, I thought he was being quite unreasonable. I majored in
  mathematics, with an emphasis on its theoretical as opposed to
  its applied aspects. However, I knew that in contrast to some of
  my classmates, I was not a mathematician in my soul. I had
  sufficient credits to graduate after three years, but did not
  want to do so, in part so that I could continue with my
  extracurricular activities and in part because I was simply
  having too much fun to want to leave. I decided to earn a second
  undergraduate degree, in economics. I then had the enormous good
  fortune to be able to write my undergraduate thesis under the
  tutelage of <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1987/index.html">Bob
  Solow</a> of the Economics Department. Bob was amazing. I would
  struggle for two weeks, get stuck, go talk with him for 30
  minutes, and be set back on course for the next two weeks. The
  title of my thesis was "The Profit-Maximizing Utilization of
  Exhaustible Resources," and in short what it said was that left
  to their own devices with a profit motive as the only goal,
  businesses would deplete natural resources (such as oil, timber
  or minerals) as rapidly as possible, with no reason for or
  thoughts of conservation for the future. I enjoyed this project
  very much, and thought about becoming an economist. My minors,
  which were called something different, were computer science and
  psychology.</p>

  <p>My computer background was enhanced by my
  undergraduate summers, when I worked for IBM. My first summer
  (1964) I spent wiring panels for accounting machines. A friend of
  my father's had arranged the job, and I was employed by the IBM
  Chicago Transportation Office. Weekly business meetings were held
  at 7:30 a.m. Monday mornings, and the office was over an hour's
  drive from my home in Skokie. Business attire was suit and white
  shirt, with socks and tie that matched each other in color. The
  second summer I wrote computer programs for an IBM 1440 computer.
  There was lots of spare time, and I wrote a program that would
  randomize a virtual deck of cards and deal bridge hands. (I had
  started playing in duplicate bridge tournaments with my friend
  Ira.) The summer of 1966 I taught computer programming in the
  language Autocoder to business executives at the IBM Chicago
  Education Office in downtown Chicago. I still wonder what these
  high-level executives felt when they entered their first class
  and saw a 19 year-old standing in the front of the room. One
  special aspect of these summers was driving between Skokie and
  Chicago each day with my father. (The day I forgot to fill the
  gas tank and ran out of gas on the expressway during rush hour
  was particularly memorable.) My last summer in college, I stayed
  in Boston and worked at the IBM Boston Programming Center helping
  to develop CPS (Conversational Programming System), an early
  timesharing system that used the first computer language that
  looked more like English than algebra. CPS was never released,
  but I had a great time and many good lunches.</p>

  <p>It was that last summer in Boston that I
  met Joe Schwarz, one of my closest friends. A year later, Joe and
  I became roommates, as I began graduate school and he continued
  his graduate studies of astrophysics. Despite the fact that Joe
  and his family lead complicated two-city lives - splitting their
  time between Munich, Germany, and Milan, Italy - we see each
  other often and have shared family vacations on Cape Cod a number
  of times.</p>

  <p>During those summers in Chicago, my friends
  and I continued a tradition we had started in high school -
  Saturday night poker. A group of us would gather at Ira Zarov's
  house - Ira had been my closest friend since third grade - to
  play poker, whether Ira was there or not. (Often he was not.) My
  father's accounting approaches had taken root in me by then, and
  I kept a detailed log of my winnings each night, to the penny.
  (During this same period, I also kept a log of the precise time I
  went to bed and woke up each day, to the minute.) I say winnings,
  because there never was a night that I lost. I had studied the
  odds and poker strategy, and I was disciplined and cautious. In
  fact, after a year or two, I became obsessed with winning and
  distressed by the possibility of losing on a single night. I
  altered my play toward the end of evenings to ensure that I would
  be ahead when we finished. I realized that this state of mind was
  not healthy, and one day I decided that the next time I played I
  would lose, no matter what. I did so, and after that I sometimes
  won and sometimes lost when I played what I believe was both a
  better and a more enjoyable game of poker. Ira, as I recall, lost
  more often but may well have won more overall, and later became a
  successful professional poker player for a period of time. <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/">Marty
  Chalfie</a>, long a friend and later a colleague in the <i>C.
  elegans</i> field, sometimes joined the game.</p>

  <p>Typically during these games we would break
  for a while so that someone could pick up pizza. During one such
  break, those of us who had stayed behind started talking about
  how we were wasting time. Each Saturday we sat playing cards and
  trading our money back and forth. We should be able to come up
  with something more productive to do. We sat, and we thought.
  Then I had an idea. When our pizza-buying group returned, they
  were surprised to find the rest of us reading telephone
  directories. The idea was simple. The Chicago Daily News was
  running a contest called "The Wizard of Odds." Each day during
  the week the newspaper published a one-digit number. On
  Saturdays, the paper would publish three letters. Anyone with a
  telephone number that ended in four digits included in the five
  published numbers and with a last name that included all three of
  the published letters would share in that week's prize, which
  like a lottery grew during weeks when no prize was claimed. All
  we had to do was to read the phone books and find winners. So we
  did. We telephoned people and told them they had won a
  substantial cash prize and that we would tell them what it was if
  they agreed to give us one-third. People, not surprisingly, were
  exceedingly dubious. However, almost everyone agreed to meet with
  us and when they saw the newspaper description of the contest
  were convinced of our legitimacy. Only one person refused to pay
  us. Another invited me to tour the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
  and offered me a job there with him. One of my college roommates
  came to visit for a weekend and made a fair amount of money by
  joining us.</p>

  <p>I was very unsure about what I wanted to do
  after graduation. Having worked each summer for IBM, I probably
  was expected either to join the company or to continue my
  education in the area of computer science. Graduate school in
  mathematics or economics as well as law school or business school
  also seemed to fit my undergraduate experiences. But the time was
  the late 1960's, and I wanted to do something "relevant,"
  particularly if it did not involve wearing a three-piece suit. I
  began to think about medicine. However, I knew nothing about
  biology. A roommate, Al Singer, now a physician-scientist at the
  National Cancer
  Institute, convinced me that modern biology was more than
  formaldehyde-fixed specimens, and during the first term of my
  senior year I took the introductory course in biology. I loved
  it. As a text, we used <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Jim Watson</a>'s "Molecular
  Biology of the Gene." My interest in medicine became secondary to
  a growing intrigue with biology. Six weeks into the course I went
  to the professor in charge, Cy Levinthal. "Professor Levinthal,"
  I said, "I am a senior, all I know about biology is what I have
  learned during the past six weeks from you, and I'm thinking
  about going to graduate school in biology. Am I crazy?" "I went
  to graduate school in physics," Professor Levinthal replied, "And
  I'm teaching your course. You're starting early." Biology it was.
  The next semester I took a course in Genetics from Maury Fox, and
  was captivated by Sturtevant and Beadle's "An Introduction to
  Genetics." I also took a laboratory course, which introduced me
  to neurobiology and to the electrophysiological methods used in
  the classic studies by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/index.html">Haldan Hartline</a> of the
  eye of the horseshoe crab <i>Limulus</i>. I applied to Harvard,
  MIT and Stanford, was accepted at all three, and decided to
  simply move the mile up Massachusetts Ave. to the Harvard
  Department of Biology.</p>

  <p>The summer after my graduation from MIT was
  an adventure. With three friends, I set out in June with a car, a
  tent and four sleeping bags. Our first stop was Chicago, where we
  earned some spending money doing office jobs for my father's
  trucking company. Our only subsequent obligation was a wedding in
  Omaha, Nebraska, in early August. We traveled across the Midwest,
  into the west, up to western Canada, down the west coast and back
  across the country. We met many people, and had a wonderful time.
  Even the night we spent in the Butte, Montana, jail was
  interesting. (We had befriended a boxer from Monterey,
  California, or so we thought. He was staying next to our
  campsite. When we returned from town, he and our sleeping bags
  had all disappeared. We went to the police station to report the
  theft, and the police kindly offered us a place to stay for the
  night.) Three of us had been math majors, and as we drove we
  studied the recently published book "Beat the Dealer," by Edward
  Thorp. From this book we learned how to play a winning game of
  blackjack and also how to spot a stacked deck of cards. We
  discovered such a stacked deck in a well-known Las Vegas casino
  and proudly told the dealer. He called the pit boss, who was very
  friendly and asked us accompany him to another room. There he
  became less friendly, and informed us, "If I ever see any of you
  in here again, no one else will ever see you after that." We
  left. I was not winning much money anyway. The other book I
  remember reading while traveling during the summer of 1968 was
  Jim Watson's autobiography, "The Double Helix."</p>

  <p>At the end of that summer, I returned to
  Chicago in time to experience the Democratic National Convention,
  where the peace platform calling for an end to the Vietnam War
  was defeated and the pro-peace protestors were considered enemies
  of the country and in particular of Mayor Richard J. Daley's
  Chicago. Meeting Alan Ginsberg, standing face to face with the
  National Guardsmen, trying to help slow down the crowds running
  from the tear gas, watching the Chicago police beating innocent
  people, escaping by hiding in the back seat of a car driven by a
  resident of a nearby black ghetto through a neighborhood that on
  other occasions I might have feared entering - there are many
  images and memories engraved in my mind. These days still make me
  ashamed of my city and my country.</p>

  <p><b>Graduate school at the Harvard Bio
  Labs</b><br>
  In September, 1968, I entered graduate school in the Harvard
  Department of Biology, located at The Biological Laboratories, or
  Bio Labs, in Cambridge. I felt like a fish out of water. Everyone
  else seemed vastly more prepared, more knowledgeable about
  biochemistry and biology and more engaged. Because of my limited
  background, I was assigned mostly to undergraduate classes. In a
  cell biology course taught by Keith Porter and Dick McIntosh, the
  first exam had a question involving ribosomes. I had no idea what
  a ribosome was. In <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/index.html">Konrad Bloch</a>'s
  biochemistry course, one of the few graduate courses I was
  taking, we focused every day on how electrons moved in the series
  of biochemical reactions of the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/index.html">Krebs</a> cycle. I had
  never heard of the Krebs cycle. In a genetics seminar course, I
  was simply lost. The experimental approach to problem solving was
  completely unlike the way I had been trained to think as a
  student of mathematics. I was a teaching assistant in an
  introductory biology course taught by Lynn Riddiford and Carroll
  Williams. For the dissection laboratory, the students had to
  choose between rats and lobsters. I encouraged them all to study
  lobsters, although I had no idea what was inside either a rat or
  a lobster, because after class the TAs were allowed to cook and
  eat the dissected lobsters. I decided that if at the end of the
  first year my understanding of biology had not improved
  substantially, I would leave and do something else. However, my
  comprehension increased, and I stayed. My advisor was Matt
  Meselson, and I was supposed to begin working in his laboratory
  my first summer, in 1969. However, I had long planned and was
  very excited about spending that summer in Europe. The only
  foreign country I had ever visited was Canada - once during my
  trip the summer before and once during my freshman year at MIT
  when I had rather cold experience hitch-hiking to Montreal from
  Boston in January - and foreign travel appealed to me enormously.
  No one told me that in graduate school you were supposed to work
  in the laboratory over the summer. Matt was incredulous that I
  planned to be away during the period my professional training was
  supposed to begin. Still, I went, and had a wonderful time
  exploring new places, foods and peoples. The only downside was my
  continuing problem with asthma, which left me in bed for days at
  a time in Paris, Milan, Malaga and on the island of Skiathos in
  Greece, from which I had to be carried on a stretcher through the
  village to get to a boat back to the mainland and to a hospital
  in Volos, where I stayed for some time.</p>

  <p>In the fall, I continued with my courses
  and began research in Matt's laboratory. I had no idea what I was
  doing, and had to ask a fellow graduate student, Patricia Foster,
  to show me how to use a pipette. Pat and I had gotten to know
  each other as teaching assistants in the introductory biology
  course, for which she and I had been exiled together to the cold
  room to grind spinach for chloroplast preparations. Pat very much
  educated me about and encouraged me to persevere in biology. We
  became a couple in 1970, and lived together for the next 13
  years.</p>

      Me, at the Harvard Biological
      Laboratories (1973).
    
  </p>

  <p>Matt Meselson is a great scientist, but he
  was more focused on the crucially important issues of chemical
  and biological warfare than on his laboratory. Matt was spending
  much of his time in Washington, D.C. as an advisor to the U.S.
  government. I had to be in an alternative environment to acquire
  the training I needed. I considered changing schools. I was
  intrigued about the idea of living in Europe and thought about a
  number of European laboratories. However, my cousin Ed Brody
  (eight years older than me and an older brother of Harvey, of
  Chicago little league baseball fame) convinced me that staying at
  Harvard was a better idea. It was one of a number of times Ed had
  a major influence on my life. Ed is a physician-scientist who
  trained at the University of Chicago, did postdoctoral work in
  Geneva, Switzerland, and then ran a research laboratory in Paris,
  France for many years. It was Ed who obtained for me the fruit
  flies I used in my high school science fair project.</p>

  <p>I talked with Wally Gilbert and Jim Watson
  about transferring from Matt's laboratory into theirs. Jim had
  recently become Director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island,
  New York, and he suggested I go to the annual Cold Spring Harbor
  Symposium to be held in June, 1970, to become exposed to the
  field of molecular biology in a professional way. The meeting was
  focused on transcription, and was very exciting, with cutting
  edge research being presented in a way that made me want to know
  what was coming next. At the end of the meeting, still unsure if
  I was going to be accepted to join Jim's laboratory, I asked him
  what I should do. Jim told me to return to Cambridge and talk
  with Klaus Weber, another Harvard professor who with Jim and
  Wally ran a joint laboratory, about a project. I gathered his
  answer was yes.</p>

  <p>The Watson-Gilbert-Weber laboratory at
  Harvard offered an unparalleled training experience. The three of
  them were all exceptional scientists, and they were highly
  synergistic in their approaches and talents. Jim has a superb
  biological intuition, and it was he who defined the problems most
  of the students embarked upon. Wally has profound critical
  abilities, and could see the flaws in any experimental design or
  interpretation. Klaus has magic fingers, and could devise ways -
  old or new - to make any experiment work. It could not have been
  more stimulating, or more challenging.</p>

  <p>My thesis project derived from Jim's
  interests in transcriptional regulation. He had written in his
  1970 edition of "Molecular Biology of the Gene" about how
  development was likely to involve differential gene expression.
  With this in mind, Jim had focused a part of his laboratory on
  RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA from
  DNA. Jim's laboratory had shown that the enzyme consisted of two
  major components, a multi-protein complex that did the work of
  transcribing RNA and a more loosely associated protein that
  conferred specificity, i.e. that caused the enzyme to begin at
  specific sites along the DNA. This specificity factor they named
  sigma, and Jim's model for development was that a sequence of
  sigma factors defined a temporal series of distinct
  transcriptional products. The experimental basis for this model
  was some recent observations made in the laboratory concerning
  <i>E. coli</i> phage T4. These studies suggested that the
  bacterial RNA polymerase with a bacterial sigma factor
  transcribes a first set of T4-specifc RNAs, called "pre-early";
  one of the pre-early genes encodes a viral-specific sigma factor,
  which then reads the "early" genes; and finally, a second T4
  sigma factor encoded by one of the early genes reads the "late"
  genes. In this way, a series of three sigma factors defines three
  distinct developmental phases of T4 gene expression. However, no
  such factors had actually been isolated, and the evidence for
  this model was rather circumstantial. My project was to identify
  T4- specific sigma factors.</p>

  <p>To begin, I purified <i>E. coli</i> RNA
  polymerase from bacterial cells infected with T4 and examined the
  subunit composition of the enzyme. I worked with the expert,
  constant and generous guidance of Klaus Weber and graduate
  student Chris Goff. (Chris was studying another change in the
  T4-modified <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase.) Indeed, the host RNA
  polymerase had a number of new subunits, as had been recently
  reported by Audrey Stevens at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In a cleverly
  designed experiment (the clever design was that of a postdoctoral
  scientist working next door, Jeff Roberts), I was able to show
  that one of these subunits was the direct product of T4 gene 33.
  Other studies had indicated that gene 33 regulated the transition
  from the early to the late stage of T4 development, so this
  result was quite exciting and led to my first publication, in
  <i>Nature New Biology</i>. I was very proud of this achievement.
  However, my enthusiasm was dampened a bit by a conversation with
  Larry Gold, a T4 researcher at the University of Colorado
  in Boulder. Larry knew how hard I had worked to prove that
  this small RNA polymerasebinding protein was the product of gene
  33 and also knew the data that had suggested this was likely to
  be the case. Was it worth, he asked, working so hard to prove
  something that was clearly very likely to be true? Could I not
  have been better spending my time to find something that was
  unexpected, rather than something that was expected? Larry's
  questions were provocative - I'm still not sure I know the best
  answer - and I have thought about them often in designing further
  research projects.</p>

  <p>Most of my days as a graduate student were
  spent in a cold room at 4&deg;C, purifying RNA polymerase. After
  some time, I devised a rapid method for isolating small
  quantities of enzyme based upon precipitating RNA polymerase with
  antibody that had kindly been raised by Chris Goff. (Although I
  had tried, I proved to be too allergic to inoculate and bleed the
  rabbits myself.) Then I could work in my laboratory room at a
  normal temperature. To visualize changes in the enzyme, I used
  radioactivity, and routinely did bench-top experiments in the
  open laboratory involving 25 millicuries of radioactive phosphate
  or sulfate. I also worked with comparably high levels of
  radioactive iodine. Such experiments today would have to be done
  under special conditions, but during the early 1970s, scientists
  were much less cautious. After some years, I officially became
  Wally's student, as Jim left Harvard to spend full-time at the
  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>

  <p>I published four papers as a graduate
  student, all involving T4-induced modifications of the <i>E.
  coli</i> RNA polymerase. I was the sole author on all four
  publications. Both Jim and Wally put their names only on papers
  to which they felt they had made major and direct contributions.
  These papers were assembled into my Ph.D. thesis, which included
  an introductory chapter focused not on the biochemistry of RNA
  polymerase but rather on the biology of phage T4. I liked
  thinking about T4 as an organism, just as more recently I have
  enjoyed thinking about all aspects of the biology of the nematode
  <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

  <p>Life at Harvard was intense, which suited
  me well. Work started early in the morning and ended late at
  night. Students in the group were highly independent, relying
  more on other students and postdoctoral researchers than on
  faculty for input. "Sink-or-swim" seemed to be the prevailing
  attitude. If you managed to swim, you really learned to do
  science. However, there were a number of students who sank who I
  believed had outstanding potential. We had three group meetings a
  week, over lunch on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. For each
  session, one student or postdoc presented his/her most recent
  findings. These were serious times, as an audience of Jim Watson,
  Wally Gilbert, Klaus Weber and often Mark Ptashne and David
  Dressler (two other Harvard faculty members) left little
  uncritiqued. Giving my first public talk, at a phage meeting at
  Cold Spring Harbor, was a very gentle experience by comparison.
  If you could survive a Harvard group meeting, you could survive
  anywhere. In preparing for these group meetings, I acquired a
  habit that I have continued to this day - writing a complete text
  of my presentation. I find this practice helps me organize my
  thoughts and time my talk, gives me an aide for those moments
  when I go blank on-stage and allows me to prepare a related talk
  at a later date very easily.</p>

  <p>Some years into my graduate studies, our
  Harvard group meetings acquired a name. One of the underground
  Boston newspapers, either the Phoenix or the Real Paper, did a
  story about Wally Gilbert and entitled it "Stalking the Secret of
  Life." Thereafter, our group meetings were always labeled
  "Stalking the Secret of Life: Part 247," "Stalking the Secret of
  Life: Part 248," etc. I learned an enormous amount as a Ph.D.
  student, both about how to do and how not to do experimental
  biology. I came away with two beliefs that have driven my
  research ever since. First, do the do-able; working on an
  important but intractable problem would not suit me. Second,
  engraved in me from Jim Watson: since it is no harder to work on
  a problem that is important than on one that is not important,
  always choose the former.</p>

  <p>Studying the bacterial virus T4 introduced
  me to a community of interactive and cooperative scientists.
  During one visit to Chicago to see my family, I went to the
  University of Chicago to talk with a fellow T4 researcher, who
  kindly gave me a set of mutant strains I needed. My mother
  supplied a small mayonnaise tub for me to use to transport the
  glass vials. I carried the tub in my hand as I boarded the plane
  at O'Hare Field for my return to Boston. The woman sitting to my
  right was curious, and asked what I was carrying. "Oh, nothing
  important," I said, "Just some viruses." This was an error.
  "VIRUSES!!" she yelled. After considerable subsequent
  conversation, the viruses flew to Boston in the cockpit, and the
  woman to my right said not another word to me the entire flight.
  On another occasion, I visited biochemist Ray Gesteland at the
  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to ask for his advice about an
  experiment I had planned. As I spoke with Ray, he was emptying
  rack after rack of test tubes from a large refrigerator and
  pouring the contents down the sink. "Ray," I finally said. "What
  are you doing?" "Oh," he replied, almost gleefully. "These are my
  last six months of experiments. They didn't work, so I'm going to
  start something new." To me, six months literally down the drain
  seemed like a disaster. To Ray, they offered an opportunity to
  explore some exciting new idea. Ray was a scientist, and I still
  had a lot to learn.</p>

  <p>As a graduate student, I lived in north
  Cambridge, sharing the top two floors of a house with my friend
  Joe Schwarz and a cast of others. After a year, Pat Foster also
  moved in. Our roommates were interesting and varied and included
  graduate students in biology and astrophysics, people who worked
  at a great diversity of occupations and people who did not work
  at all. At one point, both the front and back porches were
  rented, someone was sleeping on the living room couch and a total
  of 14 people (including my sister Carol) called our five-bedroom
  house their home. For a while, we also had a German Shepherd and,
  briefly, her 11 pups. We took turns cooking. Because I had the
  only car, I did the shopping. We joined a food co-operative and
  when handed a form that asked for "Name," I wrote "Bob." After
  that, our house became known as a commune called "Bob."</p>

  <p>I began to think about what I wanted to do
  after completing my Ph.D. I had a strong desire to spend some
  time in Europe, and visited a number of laboratories there. Jim
  Watson thought I should go to Stanford - there was a regular
  exchange of graduate students and postdocs between Harvard and
  Stanford at that time. Klaus Weber had an alternative thought and
  suggested that I talk with Sam Ward, who had just moved to the
  Harvard Medical School from <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/index.html">Sydney Brenner</a>'s group
  in Cambridge, England. Sydney and Sam had been using the nematode
  <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, an organism that had been little
  studied previously, to pursue problems in neurobiology. I had
  long been intrigued by the nervous system, in particular by
  complex issues, like the mechanistic basis of learning, memory
  and consciousness. As an undergraduate I had taken a course given
  by Jerry Lettvin entitled "The Biological Basis of Perception and
  Knowledge," which had whetted my appetite but supplied few
  answers. As a graduate student, for a course about protein
  synthesis taught by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">John Hershey</a>, I had
  written a term paper entitled "A Research Proposal on Protein
  Synthesis and Learning." Sam told me about Sydney's efforts to
  reconstruct the worm's nervous system from serial section
  electron micrographs, promising to reveal the complete wiring
  diagram of a nervous system for the first time. <i>C. elegans</i>
  was eminently suited for genetic analysis, and I had become
  enamored with the power of genetics from my studies of T4. After
  a number of conversations with Sam, I wrote Sydney, and asked if
  I could join his laboratory. My expressed interests were
  developing methods for studying <i>C. elegans</i> at the
  molecular level and using genetics to analyze memory and
  learning. His response was "As far as I know, all attempts to
  show learning in nematodes have failed," but that I was free to
  choose my research project when I arrived. After some further
  correspondence, he wrote, "Go ahead and apply for fellowships."
  This meant "yes."</p>

  <p>There were a number of other factors that
  influenced my decision to join Sydney's laboratory. First, Chris
  Goff, with whom I had worked closely, had gone there and raved
  about the place. Second, I wrote Ed Brody, in Paris, and asked
  him for his views of "Brenner and his nematodes," noting that the
  phrase "sounds like a new rock band." Ed was encouraging. Third,
  Pat was delighted at the prospect of living in England. Cambridge
  indeed was a great place to live, and the Laboratory of Molecular
  Biology a fantastic place to do science.</p>

  <p>When I told Jim Watson that I planned to go
  to Cambridge, England, to study the neurobiology of <i>C.
  elegans</i> he asked me if I knew anything about neurobiology. I
  had to admit that I did not. Jim then suggested an immersion
  education - three consecutive Cold Spring Harbor summer courses
  in neurobiology. I enrolled in and took three such courses during
  the summer of 1974: An Introduction to Neurobiology, taught by
  John Nicholls; Experimental Methods in Electrophysiology, taught
  by Enrico Stefani and Dante Chiarandini; and The Neurobiology of
  <i>Drosophila</i>, taught by Bill Pak. Each course was intense
  and stimulating. I learned an enormous amount, and made many
  friends. Cold Spring Harbor courses have a reputation for being
  both exhilarating and exhausting, and I have been told that I am
  the only person who has ever taken three in a single summer.</p>

  <p><b>England and worms</b><br>
  Sydney Brenner was my fourth official research supervisor, after
  Bob Solow, Jim Watson and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/index.html">Wally Gilbert</a>.
  Amazingly, they, and I, now all have Nobel Prizes.</p>

  <p>Pat and I arrived in England just before
  Guy Fawkes Day (November 5) in 1974. Chris and Eleanor Goff,
  friends from our Harvard days, kindly provided our initial
  lodging. My first assignment for laboratory space was a two-foot
  wide area of benchtop in a room in which biochemists on each side
  of me were labeling tRNAs using vast quantities of 32P-labelled
  phosphate. As I began my studies of <i>C. elegans</i>, I wondered
  whether the worms, or I, might acquire mutations as a consequence
  of the nearby radioactivity. Soon I moved down the hall, into a
  room that I shared for the rest of my stay with a number of
  scientists, including <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/index.html">John Sulston</a>, a young
  staff member in Sydney's group.</p>

  <p>I had received a fellowship from the
  Muscular Dystrophy Association of America. The fellowship was for
  a much greater amount of money than Pat and I needed to live in
  England, and I deposited half of the funds I received into a
  Swiss bank account, believing this would guard us against an
  unstable British economy and also against currency fluctuations
  between Europe and the U.S. This account remains untouched. My
  fellowship application had focused on an analysis of the
  chemosensory nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i>. However,
  studies of nematode chemosensation had been begun by Sam Ward,
  and I decided I should do something different. My interests and
  my MDA support both drove me to want to study aspects of worm
  biology that might relate to human neuromuscular disorders. In
  particular, just before I left the U.S. I had a moving
  conversation with a close friend of my parents who was dying of
  ALS. I did not know anything about the disorder, but could see
  that it was terrible. Her last words to me were, "I know it is
  too late for me, but please try to do something for others who
  suffer from this horrible disease." Beyond studying the worm's
  musculature and/or nervous system, I had no idea how to try to do
  so, and in any event it was the basic biology that intrigued
  me.</p>

  <p>Sydney suggested I study muscle cell
  growth, in particular that I try to determine how individual
  muscle cells add new myofilaments as they increase in size. The
  problem sounded interesting, and remains unsolved. However, I had
  begun conversations with John Sulston and found a topic that
  excited me more. John had recently found that he could directly
  observe cell divisions in living <i>C. elegans</i> larvae and in
  this way determine aspects of the worm's cell lineage, the
  pattern of cell divisions and cell fates that occurs as a
  multicellular organism develops from a single-celled egg. So far,
  he had examined only the development of part of the nervous
  system. John and I decided that together we would explore more of
  the worm's cell lineage, with the goal of determining the
  complete pattern of cell divisions that generates the adult
  animal. I began by examining the musculature, in part because of
  my MDA fellowship. John had already noted that the number of
  muscle cells in the main body musculature increases as the animal
  develops from a newly hatched larva. My first goal was to
  determine the precise number of body muscle cells in the young
  animal and the cell lineage responsible for adding additional
  muscle cells during larval development.</p>

  <p>Counting muscle cells proved more
  challenging than I had anticipated, in part because using
  Nomarski optics one visualizes nuclei, and the difference between
  the nucleus of a muscle cell and that of certain non-muscle cells
  was not always obvious. More importantly, the worm was not
  designed the way I thought it should have been. The animal is
  shaped like a tube, with four quadrants of muscle: dorsal-right,
  dorsal-left, ventral-right and ventral-left. It never occurred to
  me that these four quadrants might contain differing numbers of
  muscle cells. So I counted, recounted, re-recounted and finally
  asked John to count, too. The upshot was that the superficially
  radially symmetric young animal contains 21 muscle cells in each
  dorsal quadrant, 20 in the ventral- right quadrant and 19 in the
  ventral-left quadrant. By tracing the postembryonic cell lineages
  involved in muscle development, I discovered that to this number
  is added an additional 14 muscle cells, three in each dorsal
  quadrant and four in each ventral quadrant. I learned that
  preconceived notions in biology can be very misleading. Only
  observation and experimentation can reveal biological truths.</p>

  <p>Life as a postdoctoral researcher at the
  Laboratory of Molecular Biology was exceedingly stimulating,
  great fun and involved far more conversation than did life at the
  Harvard Bio Labs. Morning coffee and afternoon tea on the second
  floor, where the Division of Cell Biology was housed, were key,
  whether or not one drank coffee or tea. These breaks were
  opportunities to talk, to think, to listen and to learn. Sitting
  in the tea room with Sydney Brenner after lunch never failed to
  be both amusing and interesting. Sydney has an incredible wit, an
  amazing breadth of knowledge and always enjoys a good
  conversation. Latenight science - and sleep - were often
  endangered by Sydney. A number of times when I was working at 2
  or 3 a.m. and desperate for a cup of tea, I would go to the tea
  room only to find myself soon joined by Sydney, attracted by the
  rattle of the spoon in the tea cup. In Sydney's (but not my)
  view, 2 a.m. was an excellent time to talk! I learned to stir
  silently.</p>

  <p>Lunch was an especially good time for
  scientific interaction. Everyone in the building went upstairs to
  the top floor to a cafeteria run by Gisela Perutz, the wife of
  the famed structural biologist <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">Max Perutz</a>. Here one
  would pick up lunch - bangers, spuds, faggots, toads-in-the-hole
  or whatever (I quickly saw that despite the U.S. and England
  ostensibly sharing a common language, much of the English spoken
  in England was completely foreign to me) - and sit at whatever
  table had an open seat and talk about whatever science came to
  mind. I had the opportunity to meet many outstanding scientists.
  One of these lunches, with fellow worm researchers Jonathan
  Hodgkin and John White, led to an experiment by Jonathan that
  revealed a fundamentally new aspect of <i>C. elegans</i> sex
  determination. Monday nights were special. Dinner at the University of
  Cambridge's Clare Hall, hosted by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/index.html">Tim Hunt</a> and often led
  in conversation by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick</a>, was
  followed by a research seminar, in which Peter Lawrence and/or
  Michael Ashburner, two <i>Drosophila</i> developmental
  geneticists, would invariably ask the speaker why he or she had
  bothered to do whatever it was that he or she had done. Friday
  evenings involved a short walk to the Frank Lee Center, for a
  pint (or more) of England's best brew.</p>

  <p>The worm group was very much the center of
  my scientific and much of my personal life. I worked most closely
  with John Sulston, who became a mentor, a friend and in some ways
  a hero. I had the impression that John could do anything. He was
  warm, personable, unassuming and completely dedicated. Often
  after his bicycle ride to the laboratory (John bicycled to reduce
  the pollution that results from driving cars), insects and other
  debris would fall from his long beard onto his samples. John
  argued passionately that research biologists should receive
  salaries much lower than those of trash collectors, because the
  former have so much more fun. I made many other friends,
  including Jonathan Hodgkin and John White. Toward the end of my
  stay, I had the opportunity to renew my high-school friendship
  with Marty Chalfie for the months that we overlapped. I developed
  scientific collaborations with Jonathan, John and Marty. The
  collaboration with Jonathan was particularly instructive to me.
  He had discovered a class of <i>C. elegans</i> mutants abnormal
  in the segregation of the sex chromosome during meiosis, and I
  had isolated a number of additional mutants of this sort. We
  decided to characterize our mutants together. We sat down, agreed
  upon a set of experiments, and assigned one of us to do each
  experiment. However, neither of us had ever collaborated in such
  a way before, and we each felt that we would trust our own data
  more than data from someone else. When we met again to examine
  our collected data, Jonathan had done all of his experiments as
  well as all of mine, and I had done all of mine as well as all of
  his. Luckily, our results agreed. The upshot was a paper in which
  we had counted precisely 183,001 worms for the published data
  alone. This experience made it easier for me later to trust the
  data of my students without having to repeat everything they did.
  (Even so, in the early days of my laboratory, there were some
  experiments I did repeat, privately, just to be sure.)</p>

  <p>Pat and I lived first in Cambridge, not far
  from the train station, and later in the village of Great
  Shelford. Going to and from the lab meant driving past open
  farmland, which was highly refreshing after having lived my
  previous 27 years in Chicago and Boston. I found the whole area,
  with its charming villages, thatched cottages, beautiful flower
  gardens and comparatively slow pace, extremely appealing. The
  nearby village of Grantchester, with The Green Man pub and a
  lovely tea garden, was a particular favorite. One could punt to
  Grantchester from the center of Cambridge and stop for a pub
  lunch or just a pint of beer. For food, Indian cuisine seemed
  vastly better than in the U.S., and the Curry Queen in Cambridge
  was a common target. Pat, who had left Harvard to work in what
  was a very early version of a biotechnology company (she was the
  Biology Department), resumed her studies as a Ph.D. student at
  the University of Cambridge, which gave us both the opportunity
  to partake of life at Wolfson College. Pat and I used Cambridge as
  a base for travel, and visited most of Britain and much of Europe
  during my three years in Sydney's laboratory. I considered
  staying in England, but decided that a return to the U.S. would
  allow me greater flexibility in developing an independent
  research program. My job at MIT came about through a
  misunderstanding. Sydney had visited Brandeis
  University, and he suggested that I apply for a faculty
  position there. I did not want to leave England yet, but I could
  not pass up such an opportunity. I sent my curriculum vitae and a
  statement of research interests, but no publications, as I had
  not yet published any of my postdoctoral studies. I decided that
  if there was a possibility that I might be offered a job, I
  should also apply to other places and see what the options might
  be. I came to the U.S. for a six-week visit and gave seminars at
  11 institutions. My first visit was to Cornell University
  in Ithaca, N.Y. I was lucky to be offered a job while I was still
  there, just before I flew to Boston to visit Brandeis and MIT.
  This offer made my subsequent visits very relaxed. To my
  surprise, when I arrived at Brandeis I was told that although
  they wanted to meet me, no faculty position was currently
  available. Thus, I need not have started sending out job
  applications at all. Not long after my return to England I was
  contacted by Boris Magasanik, Chair of the MIT Department of
  Biology, and offered a faculty position. I accepted.</p>

  <p><b>My laboratory at MIT</b><br>
  I moved back to Boston in January, 1978, between the two huge
  snowstorms that blanketed the northeastern U.S. that month. My
  friends Fred Ausubel and Stephanie Bird kindly offered me a spare
  room in their home on Irving St. in Cambridge, near the Harvard
  Bio Labs. They also let me use their cross country skies to get
  to and from MIT, skiing over barely detectable mounds of snow
  that had cars beneath them. Pat joined me in April, and we rented
  an apartment in north Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Setting up the new laboratory was a busy
  time. I had arrived with more than 500 strains of <i>C.
  elegans</i>, the transport of which had proved slightly
  problematic: to import nematodes, I needed permission from the
  U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, the Department of
  Agriculture gave import approval only for parasitic nematodes,
  and <i>C. elegans</i> was not a parasite. Therefore, they could
  not grant my request. It took a number of letters back and forth
  before they finally agreed that they could not be sure that <i>C.
  elegans</i> was not a parasite and thus could approve my
  importing a potential parasite. I also had arranged to avoid
  having to subject the living animals to X-rays at Heathrow
  Airport in London. The airline noted that this permission had
  been granted in my reservation information in their computer
  system. When I checked in, the woman behind the counter became
  wide-eyed as she looked at the computer screen, and said, "The
  computer says you have worms. Can I see them?" I explained that
  they were too small to be seen and that they were packaged in
  sealed boxes in any event. She let the opportunity pass.</p>

  <p>Every day in my new laboratory I
  transferred worms, establishing and then freezing each of my many
  mutant strains. In April I was joined by Nancy Tsung, whom I
  hired as a technician. Nancy could not get over the fact that a
  professor could be so young, and for some years referred to me as
  her young boss. Nancy stayed in the laboratory for over 21 years,
  and she provided crucial technical and emotional support for
  projects and people, respectively. Soon thereafter, my first two
  graduate students joined the laboratory, Iva Greenwald and Chip
  Ferguson. Each proved to have a deep interest in biology and a
  natural flare for genetics, and the new lab was off to a very
  strong start in the areas of the genetic analysis of <i>C.
  elegans</i> development and behavior. Chip focused on the
  genetics of intercellular signaling, while Iva studied a muscle
  mutant with what then appeared to be unusual genetic and
  behavioral properties. Iva discovered that although this mutant
  had a severe muscular disorder, the inactivation of the gene
  responsible had no discernable effect whatsoever. This finding
  led to my first publication as a mentor, a paper with Iva in the
  journal Genetics in 1980.</p>

  <p>Next, graduate students Paul Sternberg,
  Bill Fixsen and Carol Trent and postdoc Victor Ambros entered the
  lab. Paul started by studying the cell lineage of another
  nematodes species, <i>Panagrellus redivivus</i>, with an eye
  toward an analysis of the genetic basis of evolutionary change at
  the level of cell lineage. Bill studied the genetic control of
  cell migration. Carol analyzed the genetic basis of the behavior
  of egg laying. Victor pioneered studies of genes that control
  developmental timing.</p>

  <p>The diversity of problems - intercellular
  signaling, muscle, the genetics of evolution, egg laying and
  developmental timing - seems unusual and perhaps dangerous for a
  beginning faculty member. "No focus," would be the criticism made
  by some today. However, these projects were highly coherent, in
  history, in philosophy and in experimentation. Each had derived
  directly from the studies of cell lineage and cell lineage
  genetics I had begun in collaboration with John Sulston in
  England. Most of my time examining the <i>C. elegans</i> cell
  lineage was spent observing the development of the musculature,
  including the muscles used for egg laying, and of the vulva, also
  used for egg laying. In large part for this reason, in seeking
  cell lineage mutants, I primarily sought those abnormal in egg
  laying. Amongst those mutants were all of those to be analyzed in
  our initial explorations into intercellular signaling, muscle,
  developmental timing and the behavior of egg laying. The
  comparative evolutionary project had a similar rationale - unlike
  <i>C. elegans</i>, <i>Panagrellus</i> does not lay eggs but
  rather releases hatched larvae; furthermore, the vulva of
  <i>Pangrellus</i> is displaced posteriorly compared to that of
  <i>C. elegans</i>. The cell lineages of the egg-laying systems of
  the two species seemed very likely to be different.</p>

  <p>In addition, intellectually and
  experimentally, there was a single driving theme behind almost
  every project: use analytic genetics to define the genes and
  genetic pathways responsible for each biological phenomenon. How
  you design a mutant hunt, isolate additional mutations in a known
  gene, define a null phenotype, and order genes into a pathway is
  the same, whatever the problem being addressed. Each member of
  the laboratory could help each other member in thinking about
  such issues. There were two other factors that drove me to
  initiate so many distinct projects. First, given my experiences
  at Harvard and the LMB, I believed that one of the most important
  aspects of training a young scientist is to give that person the
  freedom to pursue his or her discoveries. Discovery leads to
  excitement, commitment, and fun. Elbow room is crucial. Training
  has always been one of my major goals, with the belief that
  training outstanding scientists will of necessity generate
  outstanding science. (The converse statement - that generating
  outstanding science will necessarily train outstanding scientists
  - in my view, is not necessarily the case.) In addition, the
  training environment is enhanced by exposure to a breadth of
  biological problems. A second factor that drove me to initiate so
  many distinct projects was, as I noted above, the fact that I am
  fascinated by the biology of the organism. The diversity of
  problems helped satisfy my personal curiosity.</p>

  <p>My philosophy for the lab, then as now, was
  that we should be a community of scientists, with each graduate
  student and postdoctoral researcher focused on a biological
  problem of interest. Lab members should be independent, but
  highly interactive. Postdocs should be free to continue their
  projects independently after leaving the laboratory.</p>

  <p>The next two young scientists to join my
  laboratory were graduate students Eun-chung (Joan) Park and
  Hilary Ellis. Again, I advised each to begin projects descended
  from but also distinct from projects already underway. Joan took
  a genetic approach that derived from the studies of Iva Greenwald
  to estimate the number of genes in <i>C. elegans</i>. Joan found
  that animals have a large number of genes that when inactivated
  have no obvious consequence to the organism. This finding was not
  broadly known and when rediscovered some years later in the field
  of mammalian genetics, as a consequence of the study of the first
  mouse "knock-out" mutants, was generally regarded as a great
  surprise. Hilary Ellis embarked on the study of the genetics of
  programmed cell death.</p>

  <p>Postdoctoral researcher Gary Ruvkun entered
  the laboratory slightly later. Gary and I shared a driving desire
  to find a way to clone the many genes our laboratory was defining
  by methods of classical genetics. We devised more than a dozen
  distinct possible approaches, involving a variety of molecular
  techniques. Gary was a Junior Fellow at Harvard University and
  his Harvard sponsor was Wally Gilbert. Gary was able to do many
  more molecular experiments using Wally's funds than could have
  been supported by my rather limited budget. Gary, Wally and I
  published one paper together, my only publication with my
  official Ph.D. advisor. Gary introduced current methods of
  molecular biology to the laboratory. He succeeded in cloning one
  of the genes that Victor Ambros had shown to be key in the
  control of developmental timing.</p>

  <p>The MIT lab grew in number, but not in
  physical size. Our only laboratory room, with seven lab benches,
  soon housed 11 scientists, three of whom worked at small desks
  where previously there had been a single -70&deg;C freezer and
  one of whom sat at the end of a high bench with a cabinet door
  open so he would have some place to put his legs. I asked the
  Department Chair, Gene Brown, for more space, and he instantly
  provided it, moving his own laboratory, which was across the hall
  from mine, to do so. David Botstein, whose laboratory was located
  one floor upstairs, proved to be my major mentor on issues of
  science and non-science both. Lunches were a special treat, as
  varying groups of faculty would assemble in the faculty lounge at
  precisely noon (when Gene Brown began his lunch) and sit and
  talk. Collected wisdom concerning science and life was shared by
  all, and I had the good fortune to be able to learn from many of
  my senior colleagues, including <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">Salvador Luria</a>. Salva
  was a humanist, an independent thinker and a scholar, and I was
  struck by the fact that he offered the first-year graduate
  students the opportunity to get together with him once a week to
  discuss literature, primary fiction, because he believed that a
  single-minded focus on science was intellectually stifling.</p>

  <p><b>Other professional activities</b><br>
  My scientific pursuits have led to many opportunities and
  responsibilities beyond those of simply doing research. For
  example, as a beginning graduate student it never occurred to me
  that the life of a scientist could involve so much travel,
  something that I have always loved. In the course of presenting
  lectures, attending meetings, serving on advisory committees and
  teaching courses, I have visited Alaska, most European countries,
  Russia, Israel, Egypt, India, Japan, Korea, China and Tibet. (Out
  of interest, and without scientific excuse, I have also traveled
  to Peru and Senegal.) I have been an advisor to many national and
  international organizations, including the U.S. National Cancer
  Institute; the National Human Genome Research Institute (the U.S.
  sponsor of the Human Genome Project); the Sanger Centre (the
  British arm of the Human Genome Project); and the Tropical
  Disease Program of the World Health Organization, which amongst other
  interests is concerned with diseases caused by parasitic
  nematodes, relatives of <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

  <p>I have also been very involved with
  scientific societies. I served as the President of the Genetics Society
  of America in 1995 and have been a member of the Public
  Policy Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology and of the Joint
  Steering Committee for Public Policy, an organization that
  advocates for biomedical research funding from the U.S.
  government. I feel strongly that the support of biomedical
  research is an important investment for society as a whole and
  that both the Congress and the public have the right to know what
  is being done with their funds. We, as scientists, have a
  responsibility both to advocate and to educate. Toward this end,
  in 1997 I presented a briefing of the Congressional Biomedical
  Research Caucus. I was hosted by Massachusetts Representative Joe
  Kennedy, and my lecture was entitled "All Creatures Great and
  Small: The Universality of Genes." My theme, based in part upon
  findings of my research group, was that studies of simple
  non-human organisms - such as a yeast used for baking bread or
  making beer, a tiny fruit fly or a microscopic worm - can provide
  crucial breakthroughs important for the understanding, prevention
  and cure of human disease.</p>

  <p>My laboratory and our studies of <i>C.
  elegans</i> have progressed in new directions and new dimensions.
  Our current interests include cell lineage and cell fate;
  programmed cell death; signal transduction; morphogenesis, micro
  RNAs; nervous system development; behavior; and the modulation of
  behavior by the environment and by experience. This last topic is
  essentially the one that drew me to <i>C. elegans</i> and was the
  interest that I wrote about when I first contacted Sydney Brenner
  - the genetic analysis of memory and learning. In addition, I
  have become increasingly interested in aspects of human disease.
  Much of the reason is that I have been repeatedly intrigued by
  the striking molecular genetic conservation between processes we
  have analyzed in <i>C. elegans</i> and those involved in human
  biology and human disease. The basic science has driven me toward
  human disease. My active involvement started in 1979, when Ed
  Kravitz, from the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical
  School, invited me to a meeting about cell death. The meeting was
  sponsored by the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which is focused
  on Huntington's Disease, and was until very recently run by Nancy
  Wexler and Allan Tobin, both of whom became good friends. This
  meeting opened my eyes to the possibility that our studies of
  programmed cell death in <i>C. elegans</i> might prove relevant
  to a variety of human neurological disorders and also indicated
  that discussions of some of the basic principles of analytic
  genetics used to study simple organisms like <i>C. elegans</i>
  might be helpful to those working on human genetic diseases. My
  involvement with the Hereditary Disease Foundation continues to
  this day.</p>

  <p>In 1986, when my father was diagnosed as
  having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, he came to Boston
  and was seen by MGH neurologist Bob Brown. Bob proved to be a
  highly supportive and sympathetic physician. Bob and I talked and
  soon agreed to establish a collaboration to try to better
  understand ALS though genetics. This collaboration has involved
  my having a small group of people working in Bob Brown's
  laboratory at MGH. This effort, in conjunction with the work of
  many others from around the world, led to the discovery in 1993
  that one gene responsible for familial ALS encodes the enzyme
  copper-zinc superoxide dismutase.</p>

  <p>During this period I began thinking that I
  might want to deepen my knowledge of medicine by attending
  medical school, but another friend, Mark Fishman, who later
  became Chief of Cardiology at MGH and is now the Global Head of
  Research for the pharmaceutical company Novartis, persuaded me
  not to do so. He told me that what I would learn in medical
  school I could more efficiently learn by reading text books, and
  that to understand medicine I should simply follow him while he
  did rounds in the clinic. So for brief periods during two
  summers, I did so.</p>

  <p>I have also been introduced to aspects of
  clinical medicine through my involvement with biotechnology
  companies. Although for some time I was adamant about being
  "pure," a conversation with friend and co-<i>C. elegans</i>
  researcher Jonathan Hodgkin changed my mind. When I told him I
  was about to turn down an invitation to become a company
  consultant, he said to me, "Don't you ever want to do anything
  useful?" I thought about his comment, and accepted the
  consultancy. I now feel that my three hats, under which I
  supervise basic research concerning <i>C. elegans</i> at MIT,
  help with medical research concerning ALS at MGH and advise
  companies how to apply basic knowledge of biology and medicine to
  drug development, together both foster my continuing education
  and synergistically enhance my efforts in all three arenas.</p>

  <p><b>My personal life and family</b><br>
  My scientific life would be empty were it not complemented by my
  personal life. Since becoming a research scientist, I have
  enjoyed the companionship and support of a small number of women
  with whom I have had close, intense long-term relationships. All
  have been dedicated scientists, strongly independent and
  understanding of the demands of my professional obligations while
  working similar hours themselves to fulfill their own
  professional goals. They have provided me with enormous support
  and helped me to grow emotionally and intellectually.</p>

  <p>Since 1991, I have shared my life with
  Martha Constantine Paton, now my wife. Martha studies the
  development of the nervous system. I first met Martha soon after
  we had both begun jobs as assistant professors - she was my host
  when I visited Princeton University to present a seminar in 1979.
  However, it was only years later, in 1991, that we became
  romantically involved. We have interests that are shared and
  interests that are complementary - all in all, a good match. In
  1991, Martha was a professor at Yale University, and she had two sons, Joe
  and Chris, ages 13 and 17, respectively. Martha and I married,
  and I suddenly acquired a family, complete with a station wagon,
  two dogs, two teenage stepsons, and before long, a house in the
  suburbs. Joe and Chris are wonderful, and being close to them as
  they have grown into independent, intelligent and interesting
  adults has been a special pleasure for me. At present, Joe is
  immersed in neurobiology and is currently a graduate student at
  Columbia
  University, while Chris has had no interest in science
  whatsoever and spent some years working in the music industry
  before recently entering law school at St. John's
  University in New York City.</p>

  <p>Our marriage is a partnership with love.
  While I do most of the cooking and laundry, Martha is responsible
  for preventing the house and garden from degenerating into chaos
  and for maintaining our extensive indoor foliage, including our
  growing collection of orchids. Shopping we do together, which may
  not be efficient but preserves time with each other. We very much
  wanted to have a child together. Given our ages, we were very
  lucky. On September 2, 1993, when Martha and I both were 46 years
  old, our daughter was born. We had discussed extensively what to
  call her. We agreed that the last name of Horvitz was
  appropriate. Martha wanted her father's name, Constantine, to be
  continued, so we had a Constantine Horvitz. But what should her
  first name be? We needed something substantial - a one syllable
  name would not suffice if followed by Constantine Horvitz. I
  desired a name in memory of my father Oscar, whose Hebrew name
  was Asher. So we focused on the A's and O's and decided upon
  Alexandra: Alexandra Constantine Horvitz.</p>

  <p>Alex's birth had a direct but little known
  consequence on the MIT Department of Biology. The Department was
  planning a new building, and I was chair of the building
  committee. The day we were selecting color schemes for the
  reading rooms, I was called out of the meeting for a phone call
  from Martha, who had just learned that she was pregnant with a
  healthy baby girl. I was elated! The reading rooms ended up with
  rather exuberant purple couches. Later, I telephoned my mother to
  tell her the news. "Mother," I said, "How would you like to be a
  grandmother?" After an exceedingly long pause, in which my mother
  was no doubt thinking about Martha and me, both 46, she replied,
  "How would that happen?" I could think of no answer other than
  the obvious, "In the usual way."</p>

  <p>Alex has given me an unprecedented
  excitement and joy. Nothing delights me more than to spend time
  with her and to see her happy. She is a wonderful, loving,
  intelligent, engaging and strong-willed nine year-old girl. Alex
  enjoys math, puzzles, games and piano, like me (we play piano
  about equally well), and, like Martha, arts and crafts, swimming
  and animals. Alex also has talents that are not obviously derived
  from either of us, such as in music. Alex's and Martha's combined
  love for animals seems boundless, and were it not for my
  allergies our home would no doubt resemble a zoo. As it is, we
  have two dogs, a bearded dragon and two aquaria with tropical
  fish. Our family lived a hectic two-city life for six years,
  commuting between Boston and New Haven. I listened to and became
  a fan of books-on-tape. Our marriage and Alex's birth have
  completely changed my life, which is now much more chaotic, much
  more interesting and much more fulfilling. In September, 1999,
  Martha moved from Yale to MIT, and we now all live in the lovely
  Victorian house in Auburndale, Massachusetts, we had purchased in
  1994 and then renovated in 1999 in preparation for new lives
  together.</p>

  <p>Thoughts and dreams It is easy to look back
  over the years that have brought me to writing this
  autobiography. I have been very lucky, both professionally and
  personally. I have had a fantastic family, wonderful friends and
  the opportunity to explore and experience much of the world. I
  have had the pleasure of running a successful research laboratory
  and the greater pleasure of having helped train a large number of
  young scientists, many of whom will contribute to the discoveries
  of the future. I hope that I have helped them develop not only
  the technical and intellectual abilities to do research and the
  confidence to persevere but also an approach to research that
  will make their efforts fun. Messages that emerge from my life's
  experiences so far are less obvious. One, which I believe
  strongly, is that one should not be afraid to try something new:
  becoming an undergraduate at MIT instead of staying in the
  Midwest; studying biology as a graduate student after having
  earned degrees in mathematics and economics; and embarking upon
  the study of <i>C. elegans</i> at a point when nothing was
  published about the organism and many of the techniques of modern
  biology could not be applied to its analysis - all of these
  decisions proved to be good. What comes next for me I cannot
  know. I have three dreams. The first and most important is to be
  as good a father as I possibly can for Alexandra. The second is
  that some of the discoveries for which I can claim some credit,
  or perhaps my discoveries yet to come, will lead to applications
  in medicine that will alleviate human suffering. My third dream
  is that I will be able to use my new label of Nobel Laureate to
  contribute to the world in ways that will benefit society and
  mankind.</p>
