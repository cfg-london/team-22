<p><img src="sakharov.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  21 May 1921. My father was a well-known teacher of physics and
  the author of textbooks, exercise books and works of popular
  science. I grew up in a large communal apartment where most of
  the rooms were occupied by my family and relations and only a few
  by outsiders. The house was pervaded by a strong traditional
  family spirit - a vital enthusiasm for work and respect for
  professional competence. Within the family we provided one
  another with mutual support, just as we shared a love of
  literature and science.<br>
  <br>
  My father played the piano remarkably well, in particular Chopin,
  Grieg, Beethoven and Scriabin. During the civil war he earned a
  living by playing the accompaniment to silent films at the
  cinema.<br>
  <br>
  I am especially grateful for the memory of my grandmother, Maria
  Petrovna, who was the family's good spirit. She died before the
  war at the age of 79. My grandmother brought up six children and
  when she was around 50 years old she taught herself English all
  on her own. Right up to the time of her death she read English
  works of fiction in the original. From when we were quite small
  she read aloud to us, her grandchildren. I still have the most
  vivid memory of her reading to us those evenings. It would be
  Pushkin, Dickens, Marlowe or Beecher-Stowe, and in Holy Week, the
  Gospel.<br>
  <br>
  The influence of my home has meant a great deal to me,
  particularly because I had my first lessons at home and later
  experienced the greatest difficulty in adapting myself to my
  classmates. I took my final school examination with distinction
  in 1938 and at once began to study at the Faculty of Physics in
  Moscow
  University. Here too I passed my Finals with distinction, in
  1942 when because of the war, we had been evacuated to
  Ashkhabad.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer and autumn of 1942 I lived for some weeks in Kovrov
  where I had originally been sent to work after my graduation.
  Later I worked as a lumberjack in a desolate rural settlement
  near Melekess. My first bitter impressions of the life of the
  workers and peasants in that very hard time are derived from
  those days. In September 1942 I was sent to a large munitions
  factory on the Volga where I worked as an engineer and inventor
  right until 1945. At the factory I made a number of inventions in
  the field of production control. But in 1944, while still
  employed at the factory, I wrote some scientific articles on
  theoretical physics and sent them to Moscow for appraisal and
  comment. These first works were never published, but they gave me
  the self-confidence so essential to every researcher.<br>
  <br>
  In 1945 I began to read for my doctorate at the Lebedev
  Institute, the department of physics in the Academy of Sciences
  of the USSR. My teacher there was the great theoretical
  physicist, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1958/index.html">Igor
  Evgenyevich Tamm</a>.<br>
  <br>
  He influenced me enormously and later became a member of the
  Academy of Sciences of the USSR and a winner of the Nobel Prize
  for physics. In 1947 I defended my thesis on nuclear physics, and
  in 1948 I was included in a group of research scientists whose
  task was to develop nuclear weapons. The leader of this group was
  I.E. Tamm.<br>
  <br>
  For the next 20 years I worked under conditions of the highest
  security and under great pressure, first in Moscow and
  subsequently in a special secret research centre. At the time we
  were all convinced that this work was of vital significance for
  the balance of power in the world and we were fascinated by the
  grandeur of the task. In the foreword to my book <i>Sakharov
  Speaks</i>, as well as in <i>My Country and the World</i>, I have
  already described the development of my socio-political views in
  the period 1953-68 and the dramatic events which contributed to
  or were the expression of this development. Between 1953 and 1962
  much of what happened was connected with the development of
  nuclear weapons and with the preparations for and realization of
  the nuclear experiments. At the same time I was becoming ever
  more conscious of the moral problems inherent in this work. In
  and after 1964 when I began to concern myself with the biological
  issues, and particularly from 1967 onwards, the extent of the
  problems over which I felt uneasy increased to such a point that
  in 1968 I felt a compelling urge to make my views public.<br>
  <br>
  Thus it was that the article <i>Progress, Peaceful Coexistence
  and Intellectual Freedom</i> came into being. In reality these
  are the same themes which seven and a half years later were to
  become the title of my Nobel Lecture ("Peace, Progress and Human
  Rights"). I consider these themes to be fundamentally important
  and closely interconnected. My public stand represented a turning
  point for me and my entire future. The article very quickly
  became known throughout the world. For a long time the Soviet
  press contained no mention of the <i>Progress</i>, and later
  references were either disapproving in the extreme or else
  ironic. A great many critics, even if sympathetically disposed
  towards me, regarded my reflections in this work as exceedingly
  naive and speculative. Today, however, after eight intervening
  years, it seems that much of what may be termed important both in
  Soviet politics and in international politics is connected in one
  way or another with these thoughts.<br>
  <br>
  From 1970 onwards the defence of human rights and the defence of
  the victims of political trials became all-important to me.
  Together with (Valery) Chalidze and Tverdokhlebov, and later with
  (Igor) Shafarevich and Podyapolski I shared in running the
  Committee for Human Rights, thus making my position quite clear.
  I feel bound to recall the fate of two of them. In April 1976
  Andrei Tverdokhlebov was sentenced to five years exile for his
  social work, and in March Grigori Podyapolski was lost to us
  through his tragic premature death.<br>
  <br>
  As early as 1950, Tamm and I were the joint originators of a
  Soviet work on controlled thermonuclear reaction (the
  thermonuclear reaction of hydrogen isotopes either for the
  production of electrical energy or for the production of fuel for
  nuclear reactors). Great advances have now been made in this
  work. A year later, at my initiative, experiments were started on
  the construction of implosive magnetic generators (devices by
  which chemical or nuclear reactions are transformed into magnetic
  field energy). In 1964 we attained a record with a magnetic field
  of 25 million gauss.<br>
  <br>
  From July 1968, when my article was published abroad, I was
  removed from top-secret work and "relieved" of my privileges in
  the Soviet "Nomenclatura" (the privileged class at the top of the
  system). Since the summer of 1969 I have again been working at
  the Lebedev Institute where I studied, as an assistant, for my
  doctorate from 1945 to 1947 and began my scientific work. My
  present work concerns the problems connected with the theory of
  elementary particles, the theory of gravitation and cosmology and
  I shall be glad if I can manage to make some contribution to
  these important branches of science.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, it is the social issues which unremittingly demand
  that I make a responsible personal effort and which also lay
  increasing claims on my physical and mental powers. For me, the
  moral difficulties lie in the continual pressure brought to bear
  on my friends and immediate family, pressure which is not
  directed against me personally but which at the same time is all
  around me. I have written about this on many occasions but, sad
  to report, all that I said before applies equally today. I am no
  professional politician - which is perhaps why I am continually
  obsessed by the question as to the purpose served by the work
  done by my friends and myself, as well as its final result. I
  tend to believe that only moral criteria, coupled with mental
  objectivity, can serve as a sort of compass in the cross-currents
  of these complex problems.<br>
  <br>
  I have stated in writing many times already that I intend to
  refrain from making any concrete political prognoses. There is a
  large measure of tragedy in my life at present. The sentences
  lately passed on my close friends - Sergei Kovalev (who just
  exactly at the time of the Nobel Prize ceremony was sentenced to
  seven years' imprisonment and three years' exile) and Andrei
  Tverdokhlebov - represent the clearest and most unequivocal
  evidence of this. Yet, even so, both now and for always, I intend
  to hold fast to my belief in the hidden strength of the human
  spirit.</p>

  <p>After receiving the prize, Sakharov
  continued to work for human rights and to make statements to the
  West through Western correspondents in Moscow. Early in 1980,
  after he had denounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he was
  exiled to Gorky. In 1984, Elena Bonner joined him, also under
  sentence of exile. Isolated from family and friends, they
  continued to be persecuted by the KGB. Sakharov resorted to
  hunger strikes to secure medical treatment for Bonner, who was
  finally given permission to leave the Soviet Union for heart
  surgery in 1985. After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power with a
  policy of liberalisation, they were freed and allowed to return
  to Moscow in 1986. Despite the measure of freedom now possible,
  which enabled him to take up a political role as an elected
  member of the Congress of the People's Deputies, Sakharov was
  critical of Gorbachev, insisting that the reforms should go much
  further. He died in Moscow on December 14, 1989.</p>
