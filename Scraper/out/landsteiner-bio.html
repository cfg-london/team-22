  <h1>Karl Landsteiner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="landsteiner.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Karl
  Landsteiner</b> was born in Vienna on June 14, 1868. His father,
  Leopold Landsteiner, a doctor of law, was a well-known journalist
  and newspaper publisher, who died when Karl was six years old.
  Karl was brought up by his mother, Fanny Hess, to whom he was so
  devoted that a death mask of her hung on his wall until he died.
  After leaving school, Landsteiner studied medicine at the
  University of
  Vienna, graduating in 1891. Even while he was a student he
  had begun to do biochemical research and in 1891 he published a
  paper on the influence of diet on the composition of blood ash.
  To gain further knowledge of chemistry he spent the next five
  years in the laboratories of Hantzsch at Zurich, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a> at
  Wurzburg, and E. Bamberger at Munich.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to Vienna, Landsteiner resumed his medical studies at
  the Vienna
  General Hospital. In 1896 he became an assistant under Max
  von Gruber in the Hygiene Institute at Vienna. Even at this time
  he was interested in the mechanisms of immunity and in the nature
  of antibodies. From 1898 till 1908 he held the post of assistant
  in the University Department of Pathological Anatomy in Vienna,
  the Head of which was Professor A. Weichselbaum, who had
  discovered the bacterial cause of meningitis, and with Fraenckel
  had discovered the pneumococcus. Here Landsteiner worked on
  morbid physiology rather than on morbid anatomy. In this he was
  encouraged by Weichselbaum, in spite of the criticism of others
  in this Institute. In 1908 Weichselbaum secured his appointment
  as Prosector in the Wilhelminaspital in Vienna, where he remained
  until 1919. In 1911 he became Professor of Pathological Anatomy
  in the University of Vienna, but without the corresponding
  salary.<br>
  <br>
  Up to the year 1919, after twenty years of work on pathological
  anatomy, Landsteiner with a number of collaborators had published
  many papers on his findings in morbid anatomy and on immunology.
  He discovered new facts about the immunology of syphilis, added
  to the knowledge of the Wassermann reaction, and discovered the
  immunological factors which he named haptens (it then became
  clear that the active substances in the extracts of normal organs
  used in this reaction were, in fact, haptens). He made
  fundamental contributions to our knowledge of paroxysmal
  haemoglobinuria.<br>
  <br>
  He also showed that the cause of poliomyelitis could be
  transmitted to monkeys by injecting into them material prepared
  by grinding up the spinal cords of children who had died from
  this disease, and, lacking in Vienna monkeys for further
  experiments, he went to the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris, where monkeys were available. His work
  there, together with that independently done by Flexner and
  Lewis, laid the foundations of our knowledge of the cause and
  immunology of poliomyelitis.<br>
  <br>
  Landsteiner made numerous contributions to both pathological
  anatomy, histology and immunology, all of which showed, not only
  his meticulous care in observation and description, but also his
  biological understanding. But his name will no doubt always be
  honoured for his discovery in 1901 of, and outstanding work on,
  the blood groups, for which he was given the Nobel Prize for
  Physiology or Medicine in 1930.<br>
  <br>
  In 1875 Landois had reported that, when man is given transfusions
  of the blood of other animals, these foreign blood corpuscles are
  clumped and broken up in the blood vessels of man with the
  liberation of haemoglobin. In 1901-1903 Landsteiner pointed out
  that a similar reaction may occur when the blood of one human
  individual is transfused, not with the blood of another animal,
  but with that of another human being, and that this might be the
  cause of shock, jaundice, and haemoglobinuria that had followed
  some earlier attempts at blood transfusions.<br>
  <br>
  His suggestions, however, received little attention until, in
  1909, he classified the bloods of human beings into the now
  well-known A, B, AB, and O groups and showed that transfusions
  between individuals of groups A or B do not result in the
  destruction of new blood cells and that this catastrophe occurs
  only when a person is transfused with the blood of a person
  belonging to a different group. Earlier, in 1901-1903,
  Landsteiner had suggested that, because the characteristics which
  determine the blood groups are inherited, the blood groups may be
  used to decide instances of doubtful paternity. Much of the
  subsequent work that Landsteiner and his pupils did on blood
  groups and the immunological uses they made of them was done, not
  in Vienna, but in New York. For in 1919 conditions in Vienna were
  such that laboratory work was very difficult and, seeing no
  future for Austria, Landsteiner obtained the appointment of
  Prosector to a small Roman Catholic Hospital at The Hague. Here
  he published, from 1919-1922, twelve papers on new haptens that
  he had discovered, on conjugates with proteins which were capable
  of inducing anaphylaxis and on related problems, and also on the
  serological specificity of the haemoglobins of different species
  of animals. His work in Holland came to an end when he was
  offered a post in the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in
  New York and he moved there together with his family. It was here
  that he did, in collaboration with Levine and Wiener, the further
  work on the blood groups which greatly extended the number of
  these groups, and here in collaboration with Wiener studied
  bleeding in the new-born, leading to the discovery of the
  Rh-factor in blood, which relates the human blood to the blood of
  the rhesus monkey.<br>
  <br>
  To the end of his life, Landsteiner continued to investigate
  blood groups and the chemistry of antigens, antibodies and other
  immunological factors that occur in the blood. It was one of his
  great merits that he introduced chemistry into the service of
  serology.<br>
  <br>
  Rigorously exacting in the demands he made upon himself,
  Landsteiner possessed untiring energy. Throughout his life he was
  always making observations in many fields other than those in
  which his main work was done (he was, for instance, responsible
  for having introduced dark-field illumination in the study of
  spirochaetes). By nature somewhat pessimistic, he preferred to
  live away from people.<br>
  <br>
  Landsteiner married Helen Wlasto in 1916. Dr. E. Landsteiner is a
  son by this marriage.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 he became Emeritus Professor at the Rockefeller
  Institute, but continued to work as energetically as before,
  keeping eagerly in touch with the progress of science. It is
  characteristic of him that he died pipette in hand. On June 24,
  1943, he had a heart attack in his laboratory and died two days
  later in the hospital of the Institute in which he had done such
  distinguished work.</p>
