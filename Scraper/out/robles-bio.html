  <h1>Alfonso Garc&iacute;a Robles - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="robles.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Alfonso
  Garc&iacute;a Robles</b> was born in Zamora in Mexico in 1911.
  After studying law he entered his country's foreign service in
  1939. From 1962 to 1964 he held the post of Ambassador to Brazil,
  and from 1964 to 1970 was State Secretary in the Ministry of
  Foreign Affairs. From 1971 to 1975 he was Mexico's permanent
  representative in the United Nations; in 1975-76 he was Foreign Minister,
  and since 1977 he has been the Permanent Representative of Mexico
  to the Committee on Disarmament which has its headquarters in
  Geneva.<br>
  <br>
  Garc&iacute;a Robles played a crucial role both in launching and
  implementing the agreement on a denuclearised zone in Latin
  America, which was concluded in Tlatelolco on March 12, 1967. He
  has in fact been called the father of the Tlatelolco Agreement.
  This, proposed by Adolfo L&oacute;pez Mateos, President of Mexico
  at the time, was the outcome inter alia of the Cuba crisis. The
  idea was that a ban on nuclear arms would ensure that this part
  of the world would not be involved in any conflict between rival
  great powers. Negotiations were conducted by Garc&iacute;a Robles,
  and his enterprise and diplomatic skill deserve a large measure
  of credit for the fact that the agreement was successfully
  concluded after some years of negotiation. The final goal,
  however, has still to be reached, as countries such as Brazil and
  Argentina have signed the agreement but as yet not implemented
  it.<br>

  Garc&iacute;a Robles has also played a central role in UNO's work
  to promote general disarmament. He has represented his country
  during the negotiations in Geneva, but his name is primarily
  associated with the special UNO disarmament session. The first
  special session of this kind was held in 1978, and Garc&iacute;a
  Robles was one of the representatives entrusted with the task of
  coordinating the various views and proposals in a joint document.
  He was largely responsible for the successful adoption of what is
  known as the "Final Document" of that session of the Assembly.
  Though UNO's next special session in 1982 failed to repeat this
  success, Garc&iacute;a Robles received support for his idea of a
  world disarmament campaign.</p>
