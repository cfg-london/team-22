  <h1>Jack Steinberger - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="steinberger.jpg" class="bio-img">I was
  born in Bad Kissingen (Franconia) in 1921. At that time my
  father, Ludwig, was 45 years old. He was one of twelve children
  of a rural 'Viehh&auml;ndler' (small-time cattle dealer). Since
  the age of eighteen he had been cantor and religious teacher for
  the little Jewish community, a job he still held when he
  emigrated in 1938. He had been a bachelor until he returned from
  four years of service in the German Army in the first World War.
  My mother was born in Nuremberg to a hop merchant, and was
  fifteen years the younger. Unusual for her time, she had the
  benefit of a college education and supplemented the meagre income
  with English and French lessons, mostly to the tourists which
  provided the economy of the spa. The childhood I shared with my
  two brothers was simple; Germany was living through the post-war
  depression.<br>
  <br>
  Things took a dramatic turn when I was entering my teens. I
  remember Nazi election propaganda posters showing a hateful
  Jewish face with crooked nose, and the inscription "Die Juden
  sind unser Ungluck", as well as torchlight parades of SA storm
  troops singing "Wenn's Juden Blut vom Messer fliesst, dann geht's
  noch mal so gut". In 1933, the Nazis came to power and the more
  systematic persecution of the Jews followed quickly. Laws were
  enacted which excluded Jewish children from higher education in
  public schools. When, in 1934, the American Jewish charities
  offered to find homes for 300 German refugee children, my father
  applied for my older brother and myself. We were on the SS
  Washington, bound for New York, Christmas 1934.<br>
  <br>
  I owe the deepest gratitude to Barnett Faroll, the owner of a
  grain brokerage house on the Chicago Board of Trade, who took me
  into his house, parented my high-school education, and made it
  possible also for my parents and younger brother to come in 1938
  and so to escape the holocaust. New Trier Township High School on
  the well-to-do Chicago North Shore, enjoyed a national
  reputation, and, with a swimming pool, athletic fields,
  cafeteria, as well as excellent teachers, offered horizons
  unimaginable to the young emigrant from a small German
  town.<br>
  <br>
  The reunited family settled down in Chicago. We were helped to
  acquire a small delicatessen store which was the basis of a very
  marginal income, but we were used to a simple life, so this was
  no problem. I was able to continue my education for two years at
  the Armour Institute of Technology (now the Illinois Institute of
  Technology) where I studied chemical engineering. I was a good
  student, but these were the hard times of the depression, my
  scholarship came to an end, and it was necessary to work to
  supplement the family income.<br>
  <br>
  The experience of trying to find a job as a twenty-year-old boy
  without connections was the most depressing I was ever to face. I
  tried to find any job in a chemical laboratory: I would present
  myself, fill out forms, and have the door closed hopelessly
  behind me. Finally through a benefactor of my older brother, I
  was accepted to wash chemical apparatus in a pharmaceutical
  laboratory, G.D. Searl and Co., at eighteen dollars a week. In
  the evenings I studied chemistry at the University of
  Chicago, the weekends I helped in the family store.<br>
  <br>
  The next year, with the help of a scholarship from the University
  of Chicago, I could again attend day classes, so that in 1942 I
  could finish an undergraduate degree in chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl
  Harbor. I joined the Army and was sent to the MIT radiation
  laboratory after a few months of introduction to electromagnetic
  wave theory in a special course, given for Army personnel at the
  University of Chicago. My only previous contact with physics had
  been the sophomore introductory course at Armour. The radiation
  laboratory was engaged in the development of radar bomb sights; I
  was assigned to the antenna group. Among the outstanding
  physicists in the laboratory were Ed Purcell and Julian
  Schwinger. The two years there offered me the opportunity to take
  some basic courses in physics.<br>
  <br>
  After Germany surrendered in 1945, I spent some months on active
  duty in the Army, but was released after the Japanese surrender,
  to continue my studies at the University of Chicago. It was a
  wonderful atmosphere, both between professors and students and
  also among the students. The professors to whom I owe the
  greatest gratitude are <a href="../1938/index.html">Enrico
  Fermi</a>, W. Zachariasen, Edward Teller and Gregor Wentzel. The
  courses of Fermi were gems of simplicity and clarity and he made
  a great effort to help us become good physicists also outside the
  regular class-room work, by arranging evening discussions on a
  widespread series of topics, where he also showed us how to solve
  problems. Fellow students included <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Yang</a>, <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Lee</a>, Goldberger, Rosenbluth, Garwin,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1959/index.html">Chamberlain</a>,
  Wolfenstein and Chew. There was a marvellous collaboration, and I
  feel I learned as much from these fellow students as from the
  professors.<br>
  <br>
  I would have preferred to do a theoretical thesis, but nothing
  within reach of my capabilities seemed to offer itself. Fermi
  then asked me to look into a problem raised in an experiment by
  Rossi and Sands on stopping cosmic-ray muons. They did not find
  the expected number of decays. After correcting for geometrical
  losses there was still a missing factor of two, and I suggested
  to Sands that this might be due to the fact that the decay
  electron had less energy than expected in the two-body decay, and
  that one might test this experimentally. When this idea was not
  followed, Fermi suggested that I do the experiment, instead of
  waiting for a theoretical topic to surface. The cosmic-ray
  experiment required less than a year from its conception to its
  conclusion, in the end of the summer of 1948. It showed that the
  muon's is a three-body decay, probably into an electron and two
  neutrinos, and helped lay the experimental foundation for the
  concept of a universal weak interaction.<br>
  <br>
  There followed an interlude to try theory again at the Institute
  for Advanced Study in Princeton, where Oppenheimer had become director. It
  was a frustrating year: I was no match for Dyson and other young
  theoreticians assembled there. Towards the end I managed to find
  a piece of work I could do, on the decay of mesons via
  intermediate nucleons. I still remember how happy Oppenheimer was
  to see me come up with something, at last.<br>
  <br>
  In 1949, Gian Carlo Wick, with whom I had done some work on the
  scattering of polarized neutrons in magnetized iron while still a
  graduate student at Chicago University, invited me to be his
  assistant at the University of California in Berkeley. There the
  experimental possibilities in the Radiation Laboratory, created
  by E.O. Lawrence, were so great that I reverted easily to my wild
  state, that is experimentation. During the year there, I had the
  magnificent opportunity of working on the just completed electron
  synchrotron of <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/index.html">Ed
  McMillan</a>. It enabled me to do the first experiments on the
  photoproduction of pions (with A.S. Bishop) to establish the
  existence of neutral pions (with W.K.H. Panofsky and J. Stellar)
  as well as to measure the pion mean life (with O. Chamberlain,
  R.F. Mozley and C. Weigand).<br>
  <br>
  I survived only a year in Berkeley, partly because I declined to
  sign the anticommunist loyalty oath, and moved on to Columbia
  University in the summer of 1950. At its Nevis Laboratory,
  Columbia had just completed a 380 MeV cyclotron; this, for the
  first time, offered the possibility of experimenting with beams
  of T mesons. In the next years I exploited these beams to
  determine the spins and parities of charged and neutral pions, to
  measure the pi<sup>-</sup> pi<sup>0</sup> mass difference and to
  study the scattering of charged pions. This work leaned heavily
  on the collaboration of Profs. D. Bodansky and A.M. Sachs, as
  well as of several Ph.D. students: R. Durbin, H. Loar, P.
  Lindenfeld, W. Chinowsky and S. Lokanathan.<br>
  <br>
  These experiments all utilized small scintillator counters. In
  the early fifties, the bubble-chamber technique was discovered by
  <a href="../1960/index.html">Don Glaser</a>, and in 1954 three
  graduate students, J. Leitner, N.P. Samios and M. Schwartz, and
  myself began to study this technique which had not as yet been
  exploited to do physics. Our first effort was a 10 cm diameter
  propane chamber. We made one substantial contribution to the
  technique, that was the realization of a fast recompression
  (within ~10 ms), so that the bubbles were recompressed before
  they could grow large and move to the top. This permitted chamber
  operation at a useful cycling rate. The first bubble-chamber
  paper to be published was from our experiment at the newly built
  Brookhaven Cosmotron, using a 15 cm propane chamber without
  magnetic field. It yielded a number of results on the properties
  of the new unstable (strange) particles at a previously
  unattainable level, and so dramatically demonstrated the power of
  the new technique which was to dominate particle physics for the
  next dozen years. Only a few months later we published our
  findings on three events of the type Sigma<sup>0</sup>-&gt;
  Delta<sup>0</sup> + gamma, which demonstrated the existence of
  the Sigma<sup>0</sup> hyperon and gave a measure of its mass.
  This experiment used a new propane chamber, eight times larger in
  volume, and with a magnetic field. This chamber also introduced
  the use of more than two stereo cameras, a development which is
  crucial for the rapid, computerized analysis of events, and has
  been incorporated into all subsequent bubble chambers.<br>
  <br>
  In the decade which followed, the same collaborators, together
  with Profs. Plano, Baltay, Franzini, Colley and Prodell, and a
  number of new students, constructed three more bubble chambers: a
  12" H<sub>2</sub> chamber as well as 30" propane and
  H<sub>2</sub> chambers, developed the analysis techniques, and
  performed a series of experiments to clarify the properties of
  the new particles. The experiments I remember with the most
  pleasure are:<br>
  <br>
  - the demonstration of parity violation in <font face=
  "Symbol">D</font> decay, 1957;<br>
  - the demonstration of the &szlig; decay of the pion, 1958;<br>
  - the determination of the <font face=
  "Symbol">p</font><sup>0</sup> parity on the basis of angular
  correlation in the double internal conversion of the <font face=
  "Symbol">g</font> rays, 1962;<br>
  - the determination of the <font face="Symbol">w</font> and
  <font face="Symbol">j</font> decay widths (lifetimes),
  1962;<br>
  - the determination of the <font face=
  "Symbol">S</font><sup>0</sup> - <font face=
  "Symbol">D</font><sup>0</sup> relative parity, 1963;<br>
  - the demonstration of the validity of the <font face=
  "Symbol">D</font>S = <font face="Symbol">D</font>Q rule in
  K<sup>0</sup> and in hyperon decays, 1964.<br>
  <br>
  This long chain of bubble-chamber experiments, in which I also
  enjoyed and appreciated the collaboration of two Italian groups,
  the Bologna group of G. Puppi and the Pisa group of M. Conversi,
  was interrupted in 1961, in order to perform, at the suggestion
  of Mel Schwartz, and with G. Danby, J.M. Gaillard, D. Goulianos,
  L. Lederman and N. Mistri, the first experiment using a
  high-energy neutrino beam now recognized by the Nobel Prize, and
  described in the paper of M. Schwartz.<br>
  <br>
  In 1964, CP violation was discovered by Christensen, <a href=
  "../1980/index.html">Cronin</a>, <a href=
  "../1980/index.html">Fitch</a> and Turlay. Soon after I found
  myself on sabbatical leave at CERN, and proposed, together with
  Rubbia and others, to look for the interference between
  K<sup>0</sup><sub>s</sub> and K<sup>0</sup><sub>L</sub>
  amplitudes in the time dependence of K<sup>0</sup> decay. Such
  interference was expected in the CP violation explanation of the
  results of Christensen et al., but not in other explanations
  which had also been proposed. The experiment was successful, and
  marked the beginning of a set of experiments to learn more about
  CP violation, which was to last a decade. The next result was the
  observation of the small, CP-violating, charge asymmetry in
  K<sup>0</sup><sub>L</sub> leptonic decay, in 1966. Measurement of
  the time dependence of this charge asymmetry, following a
  regenerator, permitted a determination of the regeneration phase;
  this, together with the earlier interference experiments,
  yielded, for the first time, the CP-violating phase <font face=
  "Symbol">jh</font><sub>+ -</sub> and, in consequence, as well as
  the observed magnitudes of the CP-violating amplitudes in the
  two-pion and the leptonic decays, certain checks of the superweak
  model. The same experiment also gave a more sensitive check of
  the <font face="Symbol">D</font>S = <font face="Symbol">D</font>Q
  rule, an ingredient of the present Standard Model.<br>
  <br>
  In 1968, I joined CERN. Charpak had just invented proportional
  wire chambers, and this development offered a much more powerful
  way to study the K<sup>0</sup> decay to which I had become
  addicted. Two identical detectors were constructed, one at CERN
  together with Filthuth, Kleinknecht, Wahl, and others, and one at
  Columbia together with Christensen, Nygren, Carithers and
  students. The Columbia beam was long, and therefore contained no
  K<sub>s</sub> but only K<sub>L</sub>, the CERN beam was short,
  and therefore contained a mixture of K<sub>s</sub> and
  K<sub>L</sub>. It was contaminated by a large flux of <font face=
  "Symbol">L</font><sup>0</sup>, and so was also a hyperon beam,
  permitting the first measurements of <font face=
  "Symbol">L</font><sup>0</sup> cross-sections as well as the
  Coulomb excitation of <font face="Symbol">L</font><sup>0</sup> to
  <font face="Symbol">S</font><sup>0</sup>, a difficult and
  interesting experiment carried out chicfly by Steffen and Dydak.
  The most important result to come from the Columbia experiment
  was the observation of the rare decay K<sub>L</sub> -&gt;
  &micro;<sup>+</sup>&micro;<sup>-</sup> with a branching ratio
  compatible with theoretical predictions based on unitarity.
  Previously, a Berkeley experiment had searched in vain for this
  decay and had claimed an upper limit in violation of unitarity.
  Since unitarity is fundamental to field theory, this result had a
  certain importance.<br>
  <br>
  The CERN experiment, which extended until 1976, produced a series
  of precise measurements on the interference of K<sub>s</sub> and
  K<sub>L</sub> in the two-pion and leptonic decay modes, thus
  leading us to obtain highly precise results on the CP-violating
  parameters in K<sup>0</sup> decay. I believe the experiment was
  beautiful, and take some pride in it, but the results were all in
  agreement with the superweak model and so did little towards
  understanding the origin of CP violation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1972, the K<sup>0</sup> collaboration of CERN, Dortmund and
  Heidelberg was joined by a group from Saclay, under R. Turlay, to
  study the possibilities for a neutrino experiment at the CERN SPS
  then under construction. The CDHS detector, a modular array of
  magnetized iron disks, scintillation counters and drift chambers,
  3.75 m in diameter, 20 m long, and weighing 1200 t, was designed,
  constructed, and exposed to different neutrino beams at the SPS
  during the period 1977 to 1983. It provided a large body of data
  on the charged-current and neutral-current inclusive reactions in
  iron, which permitted first of all the clearing away of a number
  of incorrect results, e.g. the "high-y anomaly" produced at
  Fermilab, allowed the first precise and correct determination of
  the Weinberg angle, demonstrated the existence of right-handed
  neutral currents, provided measurements of the structure
  functions which gave quantitative support to the quark
  constituent model of the nucleon, and, through the Q<sup>2</sup>
  evolution of the structure functions, gave quantitative support
  to QCD. The study of multimuon events gave quantitative support
  to the GIM model of the Cabibbo current through its predictions
  on charm production.<br>
  <br>
  In the CDHS experiment we were about thirty physicists. Since
  1983, I have been spokesman for a collaboration of 400 physicists
  engaged in the design and construction of a detector for the 100
  + 100 GeV e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> Collider, LEP, to be ready
  at CERN in the beginning of 1989. In the meantime I had also
  helped to design an experiment to compare CP violation in the
  charged and neutral two-pion decay of the
  K<sup>0</sup><sub>L</sub>. This experiment was the first to show
  "direct" CP violation, an important step towards the
  understanding of CP violation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1986, I retired from CERN and became part-time Professor at
  the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. However, my chief activity
  continues as before in my research at CERN.<br>
  <br>
  I am married to Cynthia Alff, my former student and now
  biologist, and we have two marvellous children, Julia, 14 years
  old, and John, 11 years old. From an earlier marriage to Joan
  Beauregard, there are two fine sons, Joseph Ludwig and Richard
  Ned.<br>
  <br>
  I play the flute, unfortunately not very well, and have enjoyed
  tennis, mountaineering and sailing, passionately.</p>
