  <h1>George Beadle - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="beadle.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George Wells Beadle</b> was born at
  Wahoo, Nebraska, U.S.A., October 22, 1903, the son of Chauncey
  Elmer Beadle, a farmer, and his wife Hattie Albro. George was
  educated at the Wahoo High School and might himself have become a
  farmer if one of his teachers at school had not directed his mind
  towards science and persuaded him to go to the College of Agriculture at Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1926
  he took his B.Sc. degree at the University of Nebraska and subsequently
  worked for a year with Professor F.D. Keim, who was studying
  hybrid wheat. In 1927 he took his M.Sc. degree, and Professor
  Keim secured for him a post as Teaching Assistant at Cornell University,
  where he worked, until 1931, with Professors R.A. Emerson and
  L.W. Sharp on Mendelian asynopsis in <i>Zea mays</i>. For this
  work he obtained, in 1931, his Ph.D. degree. In 1931 he was
  awarded a National Research Council Fellowship at the California Institute of
  Technology at Pasadena, where he remained from 1931 until
  1936. During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and
  began, in collaboration with Professors Th. Dobzhansky, S.
  Emerson, and A.H. Sturtevant, work on crossing-over in the fruit
  fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1935 Beadle visited Paris for six months to work with
  Professor Boris Ephrussi at the <i>Institut de Biologie
  physico-chimique</i>. Together they began the study of the
  development of eye pigment in <i>Drosophila</i> which later led
  to the work on the biochemistry of the genetics of the fungus
  <i>Neurospora</i> for which Beadle and <a href=

  1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936 Beadle left the California Institute of Technology to
  become Assistant Professor of Genetics at Harvard University.
  A year later he was appointed Professor of Biology (Genetics) at
  Stanford
  University and there he remained for nine years, working for
  most of this period in collaboration with Tatum. In 1946 he
  returned to the California Institute of Technology as Professor
  of Biology and Chairman of the Division of Biology. Here he
  remained until January 1961 when he was elected Chancellor of the
  University of
  Chicago and, in the autumn of the same year, President of
  this University.<br>
  <br>
  During his career, Beadle has received many honours. These
  include the Hon. D.Sc. of the following Universities: Yale (1947), Nebraska
  (1949), Northwestern University (1952), Rutgers University
  (1954), Kenyon
  College (1955), Wesleyan University (1956), Birmingham
  University and Oxford University, England (1959), Pomona College (1961), and Lake Forest College (1962). In 1962 he
  was also given the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of
  California, Los Angeles. He also received the Lasker Award of
  the American Public Health Association (1950), the Dyer Award
  (1951), the Emil Christian Hansen Prize of Denmark (1953), the
  Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in Science (1958), the Nobel
  Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958 with E.L. Tatum and <a href=
  "index.html">J. Lederberg</a>, the National Award of the American
  Cancer Society (1959), and the Kimber Genetics Award of the
  National Academy of Sciences (1960).<br>
  <br>
  He is a member of several learned societies, among which the
  National Academy of Sciences (Chairman of
  Committee on Genetic Effects of Atomic Radiation), the Genetics
  Society of America (President in 1946), the American Association for
  the Advancement of Science (President in 1955), the American Cancer
  Society (Chairman of Scientific Advisory Council), the
  Royal
  Society of London, and the Danish Royal Academy of
  Science.<br>

  Beadle has married twice. By his first wife he had a son, David,
  who now lives at The Hague, the Netherlands. His second wife,
  Muriel McClure, a well-known writer, was born in California.
  Beadle's chief hobbies are rockclimbing, skiing, and
  gardening.</p>
