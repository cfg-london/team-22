  <h1>Ernesto Teodoro Moneta - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="moneta.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ernesto
  Teodoro Moneta</b> (September 20, 1833-February 10, 1918) had a
  personality as paradoxical as the term &laquo;militant
  pacifist&raquo; which was so often applied to him. He was a
  nationalistic internationalist, a deeply religious anticlerical
  propagandist, a crusader for physical fitness who daily took a
  tram to avoid walking across a square to lunch in a restaurant
  opposite his office.<br>
  <br>
  Born of aristocratic Milanese parents, he spent his childhood in
  two country houses where his impoverished family could still live
  on a patriarchal scale, although without luxury. He was
  profoundly affected by his experiences in the uprising against
  Austria when, at the age of fifteen, he fought next to his father
  to defend his family home and saw three Austrian soldiers die
  nearby. It was probably then that Moneta's dual advocacy of peace
  and yet of fighting for his own kind of nationalism was born.
  From 1848 to 1866 he spent a great deal of his time in efforts
  for Italian independence and unification, fighting with Garibaldi
  in 1859 and 1860 and later under General Sirtori whose
  aide-de-camp he became. Disillusioned by the campaign of 1866,
  however, he cut short what seemed to be a promising army career
  and returned to civilian life, although he remained personally
  loyal to General Sirtori all his life.<br>
  <br>
  Moneta was a handsome, warm, cheerful man who enjoyed riding
  horses, acting in amateur theatricals, and contributing play
  reviews to <i>Il Secolo</i>, daily newspaper founded in 1866 by
  Edoardo Sonzogno. When two of his friends took over <i>Il
  Secolo</i> in 1867, he accepted the position of editor, which he
  held from 1867 until 1895. Journalism proved to be the ideal
  outlet for Moneta's dynamism and idealism, his career as a
  pacifist being an organic outgrowth of his daily intellectual
  stimulation and passionate commitment as editor of <i>Il
  Secolo</i>.<br>
  <br>
  A man of strong personal convictions, Moneta was respected for
  his integrity as much as for his courage and willingness to
  accept innovations. He forged <i>Il Secolo</i> into a powerful
  instrument for shaping public opinion without compromising its
  editorial balance. Although he respected religion and was a
  practicing Catholic, he permitted <i>Il Secolo</i> to adopt an
  anticlerical stance because he believed for many years that
  specific abuses among the clergy were impeding Italian
  unification and social progress. He became virtually estranged
  from his wife - and from his two sons during her lifetime -
  largely because she was unable to accept this apparent
  inconsistency in her husband's attitude toward the religion which
  meant so much to her.<br>
  <br>
  Since Moneta understood and sympathized with the problems of the
  Italian army, he campaigned vigorously in the columns of <i>Il
  Secolo</i> for reforms which public opinion could bring about. He
  contended that the lengthy basic training of recruits and
  conscripts was wasteful and inefficient, that organized
  athletics, target practice, and civilian drills in the villages
  could drastically cut down the time needed to train recruits,
  that militarism could be de-emphasized, yet the effective
  strength of the army actually increased.<br>
  <br>
  During the last thirty years of the nineteenth century, Moneta
  gathered material and insights for his opus <i>Le guerre, le
  insurrezioni e la pace nel secolo XIX</i> [Wars, Insurrections
  and Peace in the Nineteenth Century], which he published in four
  volumes in 1903, 1904, 1906, and 1910. The part of this work
  which remains of greatest interest is the first volume, in which
  he describes the development of the international peace movement
  during the course of the century. Moneta concentrates his
  interest on military rather than on social or economic issues
  throughout the work and utilizes the point of view and approach
  of the journalist, narrating in a first-person, anecdotal style.
  His recurrent theme is the lack of substantive results achieved
  by wars and militarism. Yet, during his career as editor of <i>Il
  Secolo</i>, Moneta was one of the most vocal nationalists in
  Italy. He managed to make his intense patriotism and his devotion
  to the cause of national defense and of Italian unification
  consistent with his dedication to the fostering of international
  peace and arbitration, becoming a full-time pacifist immediately
  upon his retirement from <i>Il Secolo</i>. Although his highly
  personal brand of nationalism almost approached chauvinism, he
  fought for years against the contempt for Austria displayed by
  many <i>Il Secolo</i> readers and against the
  &laquo;Gallophobia&raquo; which swept Italy during the
  1880's.<br>
  <br>
  The range of activities in which Moneta engaged for the
  propagation of world peace is impressive. In 1890 he began to
  issue an annual almanac called <i>L'Amico della pace</i>. After
  his retirement as editor of <i>Il Secolo</i>, he continued to
  contribute to its columns from time to time and to republish many
  of his articles in pamphlets and periodicals. Ever aware of the
  value of propaganda for peace, he even printed one-page tracts
  and distributed them to rural schoolmasters. In 1898 he founded a
  fortnightly review, <i>La Vita internazionale</i>, which gained
  sufficient prestige to ensure publication on a regular basis for
  many years during a period when most such periodicals languished
  in Italy for lack of interest and financial support.<br>
  <br>
  His work for peace was not solely of a literary nature. He became
  the Italian representative on the Commission of the <a href=
  "../1910/index.html">International Peace Bureau</a> in 1895. He
  attended peace congresses for many years, and his courtly,
  deceptively diffident presence became increasingly familiar and
  respected. He had encouraged l'Unione lombarda per la pace e
  l'arbitrato internazionale [the Lombard Union for International
  Peace and Arbitration] since its foundation in 1887<a href=
  "#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and had himself founded, besides
  several organizations of an ephemeral nature, the Societ&agrave;
  per la pace e la giustizia internazionale [Society for
  International Peace and Justice]<a href=
  "#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which lasted from 1887 until
  1937<a href="#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>, long after his death. He
  lectured at the newly founded Italian Popular University. In 1906
  he planned and had constructed a Pavilion for Peace at the Milan
  International Exposition, during which he presided over the
  fifteenth annual International Peace Congress.<br>
  <br>
  From 1900 until his death in 1918, Moneta suffered from glaucoma,
  and he spent long periods in the country recuperating from eye
  operations which barely prevented total blindness. Physical
  suffering refined Moneta's high sense of purpose but did not
  diminish his essential exuberance, even in advanced age, or his
  ability to state vigorously his convictions. During World War I,
  for example, supporting Italy's role in the war, he said<a href=
  "#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a>: &laquo;I, as an Italian, cannot put
  myself au dessus de la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. I must participate in the
  life of my country, rejoice in her joys, and weep in her
  sorrows.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  Moneta succumbed to pneumonia in 1918 at the age of eighty-five.
  The monument which his friends erected to him in 1925 was carted
  off to a warehouse during the Fascist regime, thus escaping
  destruction when a bomb fell on the site during World War II. The
  inscription on its base preserves the essential paradox of his
  life, for it honors him both as a partisan of Garibaldi's and as
  an apostle of peace.</p>

  significant newspaper, he could not become a board member, but he
  met with the founding president Francesco Vigan&ograve; and
  founding secretary Angelo Mazzoleni when Hodgson Pratt came to
  Milan to found an Italian branch of his International Arbitration
  and Peace Society, and after he left <i>Il Secolo</i>, he became
