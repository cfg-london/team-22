  <h1>Enrico Fermi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fermi.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Enrico
  Fermi</b> was born in Rome on 29th September, 1901, the son of
  Alberto Fermi, a Chief Inspector of the Ministry of
  Communications, and Ida de Gattis. He attended a local grammar
  school, and his early aptitude for mathematics and physics was
  recognized and encouraged by his father's colleagues, among them
  A. Amidei. In 1918, he won a fellowship of the Scuola Normale
  Superiore of Pisa. He spent four years at the University of Pisa,
  gaining his doctor's degree in physics in 1922, with Professor
  Puccianti.<br>
  <br>
  Soon afterwards, in 1923, he was awarded a scholarship from the
  Italian Government and spent some months with <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">Professor Max Born</a> in G&ouml;ttingen.
  With a Rockefeller Fellowship, in 1924, he moved to Leyden to
  work with P. Ehrenfest, and later that same year he returned to
  Italy to occupy for two years (1924-1926) the post of Lecturer in
  Mathematical Physics and Mechanics at the University of
  Florence.<br>
  <br>
  In 1926, Fermi discovered the statistical laws, nowadays known as
  the &laquo;Fermi statistics&raquo;, governing the particles subject
  to Pauli's exclusion principle (now referred to as
  &laquo;fermions&raquo;, in contrast with &laquo;bosons&raquo; which
  obey the Bose-Einstein statistics).<br>
  <br>
  In 1927, Fermi was elected Professor of Theoretical Physics at
  the University of Rome (a post which he retained until 1938, when
  he - immediately after the receipt of the Nobel Prize - emigrated
  to America, primarily to escape Mussolini's fascist
  dictatorship).<br>
  <br>
  During the early years of his career in Rome he occupied himself
  with electrodynamic problems and with theoretical investigations
  on various spectroscopic phenomena. But a capital turning-point
  came when he directed his attention from the outer electrons
  towards the atomic nucleus itself. In 1934, he evolved the
  &szlig;-decay theory, coalescing previous work on radiation theory
  with Pauli's idea of the neutrino. Following the discovery by
  Curie and Joliot of artificial radioactivity (1934), he
  demonstrated that nuclear transformation occurs in almost every
  element subjected to neutron bombardment. This work resulted in
  the discovery of slow neutrons that same year, leading to the
  discovery of nuclear fission and the production of elements lying
  beyond what was until then the Periodic Table.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938, Fermi was without doubt the greatest expert on neutrons,
  and he continued his work on this topic on his arrival in the
  United States, where he was soon appointed Professor of Physics
  at Columbia
  University, N.Y. (1939-1942).<br>
  <br>
  Upon the discovery of fission, by Hahn and Strassmann early in
  1939, he immediately saw the possibility of emission of secondary
  neutrons and of a chain reaction. He proceeded to work with
  tremendous enthusiasm, and directed a classical series of
  experiments which ultimately led to the atomic pile and the first
  controlled nuclear chain reaction. This took place in Chicago on
  December 2, 1942 - on a squash court situated beneath
  Chicago's stadium. He subsequently played an important part in
  solving the problems connected with the development of the first
  atomic bomb (He was one of the leaders of the team of physicists
  on the Manhattan Project for the development of nuclear energy
  and the atomic bomb.)<br>
  <br>
  In 1944, Fermi became an American citizen, and at the end of the war
  (1946) he accepted a professorship at the Institute for Nuclear
  Studies of the University of Chicago, a position which he held
  until his untimely death in 1954. There he turned his attention
  to high-energy physics, and led investigations into the
  pion-nucleon interaction.<br>
  <br>
  During the last years of his life Fermi occupied himself with the
  problem of the mysterious origin of cosmic rays, thereby
  developing a theory, according to which a universal magnetic
  field - acting as a giant accelerator - would account for the
  fantastic energies present in the cosmic ray particles.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Fermi was the author of numerous papers both in
  theoretical and experimental physics. His most important
  contributions were:<br>
  <br>
  "Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico", <i>Rend.
  Accad. Naz. Lincei,</i> 1935 (also in <i>Z. Phys.,</i> 1936),
  concerning the foundations of the statistics of the electronic
  gas and of the gases made of particles that obey the Pauli
  Principle.<br>
  <br>
  Several papers published in <i>Rend. Accad. Naz. Lincei,</i>
  1927-28, deal with the statistical model of the atom
  (Thomas-Fermi atom model) and give a semiquantitative method for
  the calculation of atomic properties. A resum&eacute; of this work
  was published by Fermi in the volume: <i>Quantentheorie und
  Chemie,</i> edited by H. Falkenhagen, Leipzig, 1928.<br>
  <br>
  "Uber die magnetischen Momente der AtomKerne", <i>Z. Phys.,</i>
  1930, is a quantitative theory of the hyperfine structures of
  spectrum lines. The magnetic moments of some nuclei are deduced
  therefrom.<br>
  <br>
  "Tentativo di una teoria dei raggi &szlig;", <i>Ricerca
  Scientifica,</i> 1933 (also <i>Z. Phys.,</i> 1934) proposes a
  theory of the emission of &szlig;-rays, based on the hypothesis,
  first proposed by Pauli, of the existence of the neutrino.<br>
  <br>
  The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Fermi for his work on
  the artificial radioactivity produced by neutrons, and for
  nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons. The first paper
  on this subject "Radioattivit&agrave; indotta dal bombardamento di
  neutroni" was published by him in <i>Ricerca Scientifica,</i>
  1934. All the work is collected in the following papers by
  himself and various collaborators: "Artificial radioactivity
  produced by neutron bombardment", <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.,</i> 1934
  and 1935; "On the absorption and diffusion of slow neutrons",
  <i>Phys. Rev.,</i> 1936. The theoretical problems connected with
  the neutron are discussed by Fermi in the paper "Sul moto dei
  neutroni lenti", <i>Ricerca Scientfica,</i> 1936.<br>
  <br>
  His <i>Collected Papers</i> are being published by a Committee
  under the Chairmanship of his friend and former pupil, <a href=
  "../1959/index.html">Professor E. Segr&egrave;</a> (Nobel Prize
  winner 1959, with O. Chamberlain, for the discovery of the
  antiproton).<br>
  <br>
  Fermi was member of several academies and learned societies in
  Italy and abroad (he was early in his career, in 1929, chosen
  among the first 30 members of the Royal Academy of Italy).<br>
  <br>
  As lecturer he was always in great demand (he has also given
  several courses at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and
  Stanford
  University, Calif.). He was the first recipient of a special
  award of $50,000 - which now bears his name - for work on the
  atom.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Fermi married Laura Capon in 1928. They had one son
  Giulio and one daughter Nella. His favourite pastimes were
  walking, mountaineering, and winter sports.<br>
  <br>
  He died in Chicago on 28th November, 1954.</p>
