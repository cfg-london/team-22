<h1>Ada E. Yonath - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="yonath.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Jerusalem in 1939 to a poor family that shared a rented fourroom
  apartment with two additional families and their children. My memories
  from my childhood are centered on my father's medical conditions
  alongside my constant desire to understand the principles of the nature
  around me. The hard conditions didn't dampen my enormous curiosity.
  Already at five, I was actively investigating the world. In one of my experiments
  I tried to measure the height of our tiny balcony using the furniture
  from inside the apartment. I put a table on another table, and then a chair
  and a stool on top, but did not reach the ceiling. Hence, I climbed up on
  my construct, fell down to the back yard on the ground floor and broke my
  arm ... Incidentally, the results of this experiment are still unknown, since the
  current tenants in the apartment have remodeled the ceiling.
</p>
<p>My parents were raised in religious families, being educated mainly in Judaism
(my father) and women household skills (my mother). All of the schools
in my immediate neighborhood were based on the same principles as those
of my parents. However, despite the poverty of my parents and the lack of formal
education, they went out of their way so that I could obtain a proper education
in a very prestigious secular grammar school, called &quot;Beit Hakerem&quot;.</p>
<p>My father was frequently hospitalized and operated on, and when I was 11
  years old he died. My mother barely coped, and I started to help her at that
  age. I had all types of jobs, cleaning, babysitting and providing private tuition
  to younger children. But both of us could not earn enough to support our
  little family, and consequently a year later my mother decided to move to
  another city, Tel Aviv, in order to be closer to her sisters. There I completed
  my high school education, and my mother, despite her tough life, supported
  my desire to keep on learning.</p>
<p>Indeed, after I spent my compulsory army service in the &quot;top secret office&quot;
  of the Medical Forces, where I was fortunate to be exposed to clinical and
  medical issues, I enrolled to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. There I
  completed my undergraduate and M.Sc. studies in chemistry, biochemistry
  and biophysics. My doctoral work was carried out at the Weizmann Institute.
  I tried to reveal the high resolution structure of collagen. I continued to
  work on fibrous proteins (muscle) in my first postdoctoral year at the Mellon
  Institute in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania and then moved to the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology (MIT) to study the structure of a globur protein
  staphylococcus nuclease. After completing my postdoctoral research, at the
  end of 1970, I returned to the Weizmann Institute. There, I initiated and
  established the first biological crystallography laboratory in Israel, which for
  almost a decade was the only laboratory for such studies.</p>
<p>At the end of the 1970s, I was a young researcher at the Weizmann Institute
  with an ambitious plan to shed light on one of the major outstanding
  questions concerning living cells: the process of protein biosynthesis. For this
  aim I wanted to determine the three-dimensional structure of the ribosome
  &ndash; the cells' factory for translating the instructions written in the genetic code
  into proteins &ndash; and thus reveal the mechanics guiding the process. This was
  the beginning of a long quest that took over two decades, in which I was met
  with reactions of disbelief and even ridicule in the international scientific
  community. I can compare this journey to climbing Mt. Everest only to discover
  that a higher Everest stood in front of us.</p>
<p>I began these studies in collaboration with Prof. H.G. Wittmann of the
  Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, who supported
  these studies academically and financially. In parallel I maintained my
  laboratory at the Weizmann Institute, initially with a very modest budget
  and a grant given by the USA National Institute of Health (NIH). Over
  the years, a center for macromolecular assemblies was established by Mrs.
  Helen Kimmel at the Weizmann Institute, and consequently I came to
  lead a large team of researchers from all corners of the globe. Though
  my research began as an attempt to understand one of the fundamental
  components of life, it has led to a detailed understanding of the actions of
  some of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. My findings may not only
  aid in the development of more efficient antibacterial drugs, but could give
  scientists new weapons in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria &ndash; a
  problem that has been called one of the most pressing medical challenges of
  the 21st century.</p>
<p>Because the ribosome is so central to life, scientists around the world
  had been trying for many years to figure out how it works, but without an
  understanding of its spatial structure there was little hope of forming a
  comprehensive picture. To reveal the three-dimensional structure at the
  molecular level, crystals are required, but when dealing with ribosomes,
  there are added challenges. The ribosome is a complex of proteins and
  RNA chains; its structure is extraordinarily intricate; it is unusually flexible,
  unstable and lacks internal symmetry, all making crystallization an extremely
  formidable task.</p>
<p>At the start of the 1980s, working at both the Weizmann Institute in Israel
  and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, we created the first ribosome
  micro crystals. The procedure, which I developed especially for this aim,
  included a method for the preparation of the crystallizable ribosome that
  had been developed at the Weizmann Institute by Prof. Ada Zamir, Ruth
  Miskin and David Ellison. My inspiration came from an article on hibernating
  bears that pack their ribosomes in an orderly way in their cells just before
  hibernation, and these stay intact and potentially functional for months.
  Assuming that this is a natural strategy to maintain ribosomal activity for
  long time, I searched for ribosomes from organisms that live under harsh
  conditions, first of semi thermophiles, given by Dr. V. Erdmann and later
  I developed a unique experimental system based on ribosomes taken from
  the hardy bacteria living the extreme environments of the Dead Sea, thermal
  springs and atomic piles. In this way we managed to produce the initial
  micro crystals of ribosome in a fairly short time. However, even after obtaining
  preliminary diffraction indications, when I described my plans to
  determine the ribosome structure many distinguished scientists responded
  with sarcasm and disbelief. Consequently I became the World's dreamer, the
  village fool, the so-called scientist, and the person driven by fantasies.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s we visualized a tunnel spanning the large ribosomal
  subunit and assumed, based on previous biochemical works (Malkin &amp; Rich,
  1967, Blobel &amp; Sabatini, 1970) that this is the path through which the nascent
  protein progresses as it is being formed &ndash; until it emerges out of the
  ribosome. In the course of my research, I developed a number of new techniques
  that are today widely used in structural biology labs around the world.
  One of these is cryo-bio-crystallography, which involves exposing the crystal
  to extremely low temperatures, &ndash;185&deg;C, to minimize the crystalline structure's
  disintegration under the X-ray bombardment. The day we conducted
  this experiment was special and unique. One of the rare &quot;Eureka!&quot; events.
  In retrospect, it was second only to the great pleasure I had when seeing our
  first high resolution structure a dozen years later. In fact the &quot;Eureka type&quot;
  of an experiment was not common, although we frequently had a great pleasure
  of overcoming complicated challenges.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, once we proved the feasibility of ribosome crystallography,
  several groups from leading universities or research institutions initiated
  parallel efforts. As they could repeat our procedures, I was no more
  alone in this field. At the end of the 1990s, we as well as those who used
  our experimental systems succeeded in breaking the resolution barrier,
  thanks to improvements in the crystals, in the facilities for detecting
  the X-ray diffraction and in ways to determine the diffraction phases.
  The first electron density map of the ribosome's small subunit was a real
  breakthrough, and for me, a tremendous excitement. Then, in 2000 and
  2001, we published the first complete three-dimensional structures of both
  subunits of the bacterial ribosome.</p>
<p>These discoveries are clearly a high point in 20 years of research, but my
  quest to understand the ribosome is still far from complete. Armed with
  new insight into ribosomal structure, I can afford moving on to revealing
  what else these structures can tell us about the ribosome actions, and how
  antibiotic drugs block those actions in bacterial ribosomes. Because
  ribosomes are so essential to life, many antibiotic drugs work by targeting
  their actions. The advances we made in our long quest to solve the
  structure and function of the ribosome may also pave the way toward
  improving existing antibiotic drugs or designing novel ones. We therefore
  crystallized bacterial ribosomes that can serve as pathogen models, complexed
  with each of over two dozens antibiotic compound. We found that the
  drugs bind in specific &quot;pockets&quot; in the structure, located at or close to functional
  centers, thus can block them and prevent the ribosomes from manufacturing
  proteins. Since these findings were published in <em>Nature, </em>in 2001, we
  have revealed the means of action of almost all of the antibiotics that target
  the ribosome, and our research in this area is ongoing.</p>
<p>For all scientists, the true scientific discovery is the top. In my case I can
  recall saying things like: 'why work on ribosomes, they are dead ... we know
  all what can be known about them', or: 'this is a dead end road', or: 'you will
  be dead before you get there'. Indeed, to my satisfaction, these predictions
  were proven wrong, the ribosomes are alive and kicking (so am I) and their
  high resolution structures stimulated many advanced studies.</p>
<p>And in the future? We plan on looking to the distant past. Ribosomes are
  found in every living being &ndash; from yeast and bacteria to mammals &ndash; and
  the structures of their active sites have been extraordinarily well-preserved
  throughout evolution. We have identified a region within the contemporary
  ribosome that seems to be the vestige of the primordial apparatus for
  producing peptide bonds and essentially giving rise to life. How did these
  first ribosomes come into being? How did they begin to produce proteins?
  How did they evolve into the sophisticated protein factories we see today in
  living cells? We plan on answering these and related questions in our future
  work.</p>
<p>Awarding the Nobel Prize exposed the ribosome to the public. It stimulated
  true scientific interest and turned on the imagination of many youngsters. As
  I have curly hair, there is a new saying in Israel: &quot;Curly hair means a head full
  of ribosomes&quot;. Furthermore, our studies added to the buzz around the lovely
  North Pole Bears, which inspired my own research and are now endangered
  by the changing climate.</p>
<p>These studies could not be performed without the help and/or active participation
  of many individuals. Thanks are due to the Weizmann Institute, particularly
  its presidents Michael Sela and Haim Harari, for keeping up with me
  for over two decades and for allowing me to work; to the Max Planck Society,
  especially the late Prof H.G. Wittmann for co-initiating this project, for producing
  the ribosome and their crystals and for financing my dream; to Ms.
  Helen Kimmel for establishing and maintaining the Kimmelman Center, thus
  paving the road for us from the early stages of our studies; to my colleagues
  in Hamburg (e.g. Frank Schluenzen, Heike Bartels, Joerg Harms and Ante
  Tocilj) and in Israel (especially Anat Bashan, Ilana Agmon, Tamar Awerbach,
  Ziva Berkovitch-Yellin, Raz Zarivach and Shulamit Weinstein), as well as my
  collaborators in Berlin (especially Francois Franceschi) for their devotion
  and enthusiasm in good and bad periods.</p>
<p>Above all, to my family who supported me with no questions or complaints
  despite my frequent disappearances and although at times my mind was not
  solely with them. These include my parents, who were brought up far away
  from science, especially my mother, who experienced enormous difficulties
  in raising and educating me after my dad's death when I was still a child; my
  young sister Nurit, and my daughter Hagith, who had to tolerated me in my
  presence as well as in my absence; and to my granddaughter Noa, who at the
  age of five invited me to her kindergarten to talk about the ribosome!</p>
