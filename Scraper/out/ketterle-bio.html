  <h1>Wolfgang Ketterle - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ketterle.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  October 21, 1957, in Heidelberg, a small town in Germany with a
  charming old city and a famous castle. My parents had come to
  Heidelberg after the second world war, when many people relocated
  within Germany searching for better economic opportunities. My
  mother's parents were farmers in Silesia, which has now become
  part of Poland. My father grew up in Memmingen, a small city in
  the southern part of Germany, where his parents had a
  canteen.</p>

  <p>I enjoyed a childhood of stability and
  peace, in contrast to my parents who had grown up amidst the
  conflicts of war. When I was three, we moved from Heidelberg to
  the village (now city) of Eppelheim, three miles away, where my
  parents still live. I grew up with an older brother (G&uuml;nter,
  15 months older) and a younger sister (Monika, three and a half
  years younger).</p>

  <p>My parents worked hard to provide security
  and prosperity for our family. My father first joined an oil and
  coal distribution company as an apprentice and retired as a
  director. My mother ran the household and cared for the children;
  later, she managed a small business distributing first-aid
  products. In our family, work was not regarded as sheer
  necessity, but as a defining feature and rewarding aspect of
  life.</p>

  <p>My parents supported all our interests in
  music, sports and sciences. As they hadn't been exposed to many
  of these activities themselves, they did not steer us in certain
  directions, but rather observed our interests and then reinforced
  and supported them. That may be one of the reasons why my brother
  and sister are successful in quite different areas: finance and
  education.</p>

  <p>My explorations of the technical world
  started with Legos, with which I was quite creative in
  constructing moving objects with the basic building blocks that
  were then available. (Legos have become much more fancy since
  then!) I remember playing with electricity kits, doing repairs of
  household appliances, and using my father's power tools for
  woodworking projects. Explorations into chemistry were done in
  our basement, sometimes with friends, and my parents must have
  had quite a bit of confidence in my abilities when they allowed
  me to experiment with explosive mixtures. (I was quite impressed
  when such a mixture was able to melt metal.) Other projects
  included taking old radios and a TV set apart and combining a
  portable radio and a vacuum tube audio amplifier to create stereo
  sound. I was interested in learning more about electronics, but I
  was disappointed that the electronic kits explained only how to
  put the parts together, not how they really worked. So although I
  explored technology and science as a child, I didn't penetrate
  very deeply, partially because nobody guided me, and partially
  because I spent a lot of time on school and sports.</p>

  <p>I attended elementary school in Eppelheim
  and Heidelberg, and then grammar school at the Bunsengymnasium in
  Heidelberg. My science classes didn't involve laboratories and
  the variety of projects and science fairs which my children now
  enjoy at their schools, but they were instructive and kindled my
  interest. There was one mathematics teacher, Albrecht Strobel,
  who was inspirational. He challenged me with special problems,
  and tried to teach the class to approach mathematical problems in
  a playful rather than formal spirit. Science and mathematics did
  not require much of an effort for me, but I worked hard to get
  the highest grades in languages and other subjects. As a result,
  I was the best student in my class.</p>

  <p>As a student, I liked to play soccer and
  basketball, and I also enjoyed trying out the various disciplines
  within track and field. My focus became longdistance running, but
  I competed occasionally in pole-vaulting. There was a year when I
  ran five times a week, but my talent was limited; I was
  occasionally well placed at town-wide events, but never in
  regional competitions. Still, I have maintained a passion for
  endurance sports until the present day. When I was around thirty,
  I met my own personal challenge and finished a few marathons
  under three hours, and I have completed many long bicycle
  tours.</p>

  <p>It was clear to me early on that after high
  school I would go to university to study either physics,
  mathematics, or computer sciences. I decided on physics, as I
  thought it would combine the real world and mathematics. At that
  point, I lacked a clear idea of what modern physics was about,
  but my initial enthusiasm survived when I learnt more about my
  chosen area.</p>

  <p>Before starting university, I received a
  fellowship from Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (German
  National Merit Foundation). Part of the fellowship was the
  opportunity to attend special summer schools. The summer schools
  took place in the Italian Alps and introduced me to the beauty of
  mountains and to hiking. It has been one of my favorite
  activities ever since. Most importantly, those schools brought
  together a select group of highly talented students. The
  interactions with them reinforced my motivation to set high goals
  in life for myself.</p>

  <p>In 1976, I entered the University of Heidelberg, my home town. (This
  traditional university was founded in 1386 as the second German
  university.) It was clear to me from the outset, however, that
  after passing the pre-diploma (intermediate exam) in two years
  time I would transfer to another university and leave my parents'
  house. My choice was the Technical University in Munich because Munich is one
  of the most attractive towns in Germany and because the Technical
  University is excellent in many different subfields. At this
  stage, I wasn't certain what I would specialize in, and had only
  a diffuse notion of my current field, atomic physics.</p>

  <p>Starting an independent life in a new town
  was a formative experience. The proximity to the Alps was an
  invitation to go hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter,
  and I loved both the small and big theaters in Munich and its
  arts museums. I also became involved with the peace movement and
  a group working on third world issues.</p>

      built into it. Such humorous mortar boards are a German
      academic tradition.</p>

  
    


  <p>At the end of my diploma studies, I was
  very interested in theoretical physics and did my diploma thesis
  on spin relaxation in disordered materials under the supervision
  of Prof. Wolfgang G&ouml;tze. I learnt a great deal from his
  lucidity in analyzing problems and how he obtained physical
  insight from mathematical solutions. The thesis project took one
  year and at the end I found myself at a crossroads. Up to this
  point I had been focusing on purely academic problems, and now
  wanted to gain experience with applied physics and how it
  connected with problems of the real world. Therefore, for my PhD.
  I chose an experimental project, trace analysis of semiconductors
  using laser spectroscopy. This project was supervised by Prof.
  Herbert Walther and Dr. Hartmut Figger at the Max-Planck Institute for
  Quantum Optics in Garching. After one year, it became clear
  that this project was too difficult to be carried out within the
  existing infrastructure. Since I didn't want to start over from
  scratch, I continued my Ph.D. in the same laboratory, and focused
  on the basic spectroscopy of small molecules. We generated
  excited neutral molecules by charge transfer to a mass-selected
  ion beam. This gave us much higher selectivity in observing
  certain molecules than the usual discharges, and we obtained
  almost pure fluorescence spectra of triatomic hydrogen.</p>

  </p>

  <p>Towards the end of my PhD, I applied the
  same method to helium hydride and observed the first discrete
  spectra of this molecule confirming its existence. Helium hydride
  is the simplest heteronuclear molecule (besides HD), yet its
  spectrum had not been observed. I remember my excitement when I
  produced helium hydride for the first time and rotated the
  grating of the monochromator used to record its spectrum, and
  there was light almost everywhere in the visible and near
  infrared spectral regions. In the next few months, I would
  decipher some of those spectra and obtain first values for the
  bond lengths and vibrational frequencies of this molecule. It was
  exciting to determine the basic properties of a new molecule,
  like in the old days when molecular spectroscopy was established.
  After earning my PhD, I stayed at the Max-Planck Institute as a
  postdoc, working on laser excitation of Rydberg states of
  triatomic hydrogen and helium hydride. I also succeeded in
  analyzing all the emission spectra of helium hydride, which I had
  discovered during my Ph.D. The analysis of the spectra was
  complicated because the rotation of the molecule leads to a
  break-down of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation known as
  L-uncoupling. As a result, different electronic states are mixed.
  In addition, the spectrum was perturbed by interactions between
  s, p, and d states. Several electronic states and their
  perturbations had to be simulated together, before the calculated
  spectra started to show some similarity with the data. I regard
  the solution of this puzzle as one of the most challenging pieces
  of work I have done.</p>

  <p>Even before finishing my PhD I already knew
  that I would not stay in molecular spectroscopy. I either wanted
  to work in a more fundamental area of physics, or focus on an
  area which was directly related to the needs of society. Another
  option was going into industry, and I had several interviews and
  job offers. In the end, I decided to pursue applied research in a
  university setting, maintaining at least some of the freedom of
  academic research. I joined the group of Prof. J&uuml;rgen
  Wolfrum at the University of Heidelberg. There, I worked in
  physical chemistry, focusing on combustion diagnostics with
  lasers. Molecular spectroscopy, in which I was an expert by this
  time, was used to measure temperature and molecular
  concentrations in a flame. One of my main projects was carried
  out in collaboration with the Volkswagen company. We had to
  transport a truckload of lasers and equipment to an engine test
  stand at the plant and encountered problems such as soot on the
  windows of the transparent engine and optics dripping with oil
  coming from a Diesel engine.</p>

  <p>Changing fields was a crucial experience
  for me. Amazed to see how much of what I had learnt before could
  be applied within the new field, I realized that general skills
  are much more important than specific knowledge. I thought it
  would take a long time before I became productive in my new
  environment, but within months, graduate students who had been
  working in this area for much longer came and sought my advice
  and leadership. This experience gave me the self-confidence to
  venture into new areas, and provided the impetus for my later
  decision to come to the United States and start once again in a
  new field.</p>

  <p>When your work is directly related to
  cleaner and more efficient combustion, you can easily convince
  non-scientists of the relevance of your research. I enjoyed this,
  as well as the interactions with industry and engineers. However,
  I began to miss something, the quest for pure knowledge and the
  pursuit of goals which are only vaguely defined and change as the
  research progresses. I thus realized that my place would be in
  basic research.</p>

  <p>At 32 years, I decided to change fields
  once more. I wanted to switch to an area of fundamental physics
  where I could apply some of my knowledge in optics and
  spectroscopy and thus identified the field of cold atoms as the
  most promising area. At this time, my assessment was that the
  field of laser cooling and trapping had reached its peak, but
  there was still enough to be done. I didn't anticipate that the
  best was still to come.</p>

  <p>Leaving a long-term position in Germany and
  taking a short-term postdoc position in the U.S. was a risk for
  myself and my family. However, the time in Heidelberg in
  combustion research had helped me to discover what I really
  wanted to do, and also strengthened my self-confidence. I was
  willing to take risks which I wouldn't have taken a few years
  earlier. By talking to people and browsing through conference
  proceedings, I identified the leading groups in the field and
  sent out applications. I was pleased that I received two offers,
  despite my lack of experience with cold atoms. In the spring of
  1990, I joined Dave Pritchard's group at MIT.</p>

  <p>During the first year at MIT, I was
  supported by a fellowship of DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer
  Auslandsdienst). It is a great tradition in Germany to support
  scientific study abroad, but unfortunately such a tradition does
  not exist in the U.S. Going abroad means more than just immersing
  yourself in a new culture. It also means that you free yourself
  from your previous environment and have the opportunity to change
  and redefine yourself. As a foreigner in a new area of research,
  I didn't feel bound to a certain tradition and could develop my
  own personal style - in lab work, giving talks, and discussions
  within the group. At MIT, where half of the graduate students are
  foreigners, there is no prejudice, but rather a tolerance and
  appreciation for unconventional ideas and styles of work.</p>

  <p>I also found a unique atmosphere in Dave
  Pritchard's group. Until then, I had worked in two rather large
  German groups. Dave's group was smaller, the interactions with
  him and within the group were very informal; and exciting science
  was pursued in an atmosphere of comradeship. Dave's knowledge of
  the field was enormous. During discussions, he could answer
  almost any question that came up, or immediately make an estimate
  whether a phenomenon was observable or not. Initially, I felt
  both intimidated and challenged by his scientific prowess, but
  soon we became more equal partners. This was the beginning of a
  wonderful collaboration that continues until the present day.
  Some account of it is given in the written version of my Nobel
  lecture.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of my PhD studies, in 1986,
  I married Gabriele Sauer, whom I had known since my high school
  years. We had three wonderful children, Jonas, born in 1986;
  Johanna in 1988; and Holger in 1992, who continue to surprise me
  with their developing talents and personalities; they enrich my
  life every day. My wife and I were very different and grew apart
  over the years. In 2001, we separated, two months before it was
  announced that I was awarded the Nobel prize. Despite some
  difficulties, the last year has been full of joy, and the Nobel
  ceremonies have added extra glamour, bringing together my family,
  friends and colleagues. It is those people to whom I am most
  grateful, and they have instilled in me a passion for life and a
  critical, but always optimistic perspective for the future.</p>
