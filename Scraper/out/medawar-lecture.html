  <h2>Immunological Tolerance</h2>

  <p>"Immunological tolerance" may be described
  as a state of indifference or non-reactivity towards a substance
  that would normally be expected to excite an immunological
  response. The term first came to be used in the context of tissue
  transplantation immunity, i.e. of the form of immunity that
  usually prohibits the grafting of tissues between individuals of
  different genetic make-up; and it was used to refer only to a
  non-reactivity caused by exposing animals to antigenic stimuli
  before they were old enough to undertake an immunological
  response. For example, if living cells from a mouse of strain CBA
  are injected into an adult mouse of strain A, the CBA cells will
  be destroyed by an immunological process, and the A-line mouse
  that received them will destroy any later graft of the same
  origin with the speed to be expected of an animal immunologically
  forearmed. But if the CBA cells are injected into a foetal or
  newborn A-line mouse, they are accepted; more than that, the
  A-line mouse, when it grows up, will accept any later graft from
  a CBA donor as if it were its own. I shall begin by using the
  term "immunological tolerance" in the rather restricted sense
  that is illustrated by this experiment, and shall discuss its
  more general usage later on.</p>

  <p>The experiment I have just
  described<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> can be thought of
  as an artificial reproduction of an astonishing natural
  curiosity, the phenomenon of red-cell chimerism in certain
  dizygotic twins. The blood systems of twin cattle before birth
  are not sharply distinct from each other, as they are in most
  other twins; instead, the blood systems make anastomoses with
  each other, with the effect that the twins can indulge in a
  prolonged exchange of blood before birth. In 1945, R.D.
  Owen<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> made the remarkable
  discovery that most twin cattle are born with, and may retain
  throughout life, a stable mixture - not necessarily a fifty-fifty
  mixture - of each other's red cells; it followed, then, that the
  twin cattle must have exchanged red-cell precursors and not
  merely red cells in their mutual transfusion before birth. This
  is the first example of the phenomenon we came to call
  immunological tolerance; the red cells could not have "adapted"
  themselves to their strange environment, because they were in
  fact identified as native or foreign by those very antigenie
  properties which, had an adaptation occurred, must necessarily
  have been transformed. A few years later R.E. Billingham and
  I<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, with the help of three
  members of the scientific staff of the Agricultural Research
  Council, showed that most dizygotic cattle twins would accept
  skin grafts from each other, and that this mutual tolerance was
  specific, for skin transplanted from third parties was cast off
  in the expected fashion. We did not set out with the idea in mind
  of studying the immunological consequences of the phenomenon
  described by Owen; on the contrary, we had been goaded by Dr.
  H.P. Donald into trying to devise a foolproof method of
  distinguishing monozygotic from dizygotic twins, an enterprise
  that seemed reasonable enough against the rather thorough
  background of knowledge we already possessed about the behaviour
  of skin grafts in experimental animals<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. It was F.M. Burnet and F.
  Fenner<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> who first read a
  general significance into Owen's discovery and who wove it into a
  general hypothesis of the immunological response which counted
  the phenomenon of tolerance among its theoretical
  consequences.</p>

  <p>In the outcome, it proved impossible to
  distinguish between the two kinds of twins by skin grafting, but
  the causal connexion between Owen's phenomenon and our own was
  obvious, and we were now confident of our ability to make adult
  animals accept tissue homografts by reproducing in the laboratory
  the very state of affairs that had come about by natural accident
  in twin cattle. Billingham, L. Brent, and I eventually succeeded
  in doing so, and our first report on the matter was published in
  1953<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In the meantime M.
  Haek<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, working against an
  entirely different conceptual background, had reproduced Owen's
  phenomenon in chickens by the ingenious method of making a
  deliberate synchorial parabiosis between chick embryos in the
  shell. At hatching the parabionts separated, and from now on they
  were incapable of making antibodies against each other's red
  cells, or, as later work showed<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, of rejecting grafts of each
  other's skin. It is now known that chimerism can occur naturally,
  though rarely, in twin sheep, and more rarely still in twin human
  beings<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>; in twin chickens it
  is probably the general rule. That chimerism should occur in man
  is clear proof that the principle of tolerance applies to human
  beings as well as to laboratory animals, and human chimeric twins
  can accept grafts of each other's skin<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><b>Some properties of the tolerant
  state</b><br>
  The main points that emerged from our analysis of the tolerant
  state were these. In the first place, tolerance must be due to an
  alteration of the host, not to an antigenic adaptation of the
  grafted cells, for grafts newly transplanted in adult life have
  no opportunity to adapt themselves, and the descendants of the
  cells injected into foetal or newborn animals can be shown by
  N.A. Mitcbison's methods to retain their antigenic power<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Once established, the state of
  tolerance is systemic; if one part of the body will tolerate a
  foreign graft, so will another; we found no evidence that a
  tolerated graft builds up a privileged position for itself within
  its own lymphatic territory. The stimulus that is responsible for
  instating tolerance is an antigenic stimulus - one which, had it
  been applied to older animals, would have caused them to become
  sensitive or immune. A plural stimulus can induce plural
  tolerance; the donor will usually contain several important
  antigens that are lacking in the recipient, and long-lasting
  tolerance must imply tolerance of them all. The state of
  tolerance is specific in the sense that it will discriminate
  between one individual and another, for an animal made tolerant
  of grafts from one individual will not accept grafts from a
  second individual unrelated to the first; but it will not
  discriminate between one tissue and another from the same donor.
  The injection of leucocytes or lymphoid cells can confer
  tolerance of skin grafts, for example; and later work has shown
  that the same is true of grafts of thyroid tissue, ovary, kidney,
  and adrenal gland. These various tissues do indeed differ in
  their antigenic make-up, but not, apparently, in respect of
  antigens that play an important part in transplantation immunity.
  If leucocytes lacked some important antigen present in skin, it
  is difficult to see how they could confer tolerance of skin; and
  P.L. Krohn, using more direct and more critical methods, has
  found it impossible to distinguish between the antigenic make-up,
  so far as it governs their transplantability, of ovary and
  skin<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Tolerance can be brought promptly and
  permanently to an end by an experimental device which combines
  certain principles established by N.A. Mitchison and M.W. Chase.
  Please cast your mind back to the model experiment I described at
  the beginning of this lecture, and imagine an A-line mouse which
  is tolerant of CBA tissue and which carries a CBA skin graft as
  outward evidence that it is so. The tolerated CBA graft can be
  destroyed within a week by injecting into its host, lymphoid
  cells from A-line mice which have reacted upon and rejected CBA
  tissues in the expected fashion A less spectacular but in some
  ways more informative variant of this "adoptive immunization" is
  to inject the tolerant mouse with lymphoid cells from A-line mice
  that have <i>not</i> been sensitized beforehand by CBA tissues.
  Here too, though much more slowly, the tolerant state is brought
  to an end. The inference we drew from this experiment - and
  nothing has occurred since to make us question it - was that
  tolerance is due to a central failure of the mechanism of
  immunological response and not to some intercession at a
  peripheral level.</p>

  <p>There is one important question about
  tolerance which the experimental system I have been describing is
  very ill-equipped to answer: does the maintenance of the tolerant
  state depend upon the continuing presence of the antigen that
  provoked it? When living cells are used to procure tolerance they
  survive into adult life and therefore maintain a chronic
  antigenic stimulus, but is it necessary that they should do so?
  So far as transplantation immunity is concerned, no completely
  confident answer can be given until the antigens that excite it
  can be extracted in a sufficiently potent form; but with
  "tolerance" of foreign proteins and red cells, it does indeed
  seem that antigen must continue to be present, even though in
  quantities below the threshold of direct estimation, if a fully
  non-reactive state is to be maintained<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. This is one of the most
  important single pieces of evidence that must be taken into
  consideration when devising hypotheses to account for tolerance,
  and it points to the clear distinction that must be drawn between
  the dosages of antigen necessary on the one hand to instate
  tolerance, and on the other hand to maintain it. Much else is
  still uncertain - for example, the significance to be attached to
  the "partially tolerant" state. Tolerance is not an
  all-or-nothing phenomenon: every degree of tolerance is to be
  found, from that which allows a graft to live just perceptibly
  longer than would be expected of it in a normal animal to that in
  which the graft is permanently accepted by and incorporated into
  its host. Is an animal partially tolerant because all its
  reactive cells are almost completely debilitated, or because,
  while most of them are completely out of action, a minority
  retain full possession of their powers?</p>

  <p><b>Tolerance and runt disease</b><br>
  It has been the' experience of all laboratories that tolerance is
  most easily procured by injecting lymphoid cells into immature
  animals. This is not because lymphoid cells are in themselves
  more strongly antigenic than others - there is evidence that they
  are not so - but probably because they are distributed throughout
  the body of the animal into which they are injected. This should
  make them adept at producing tolerance; an animal can be immune
  when only a minority of the cells that are competent to do so are
  reacting immunologically, but cannot be tolerant unless the very
  great majority of them are not. Unfortunately, the lymphoid cells
  used to induce tolerance are immunologically qualified to attack
  the tissues of their host, with consequences that were first
  revealed by Billingham and Brent<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> and, in a some-what different
  form, by M. Simonsen<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>. The
  injection of foreign adult lymphoid cells into newborn mice of an
  unrelated strain gives rise to a fatal or chronic illness, "runt
  diseases", marked by retardation of growth and wide-spread damage
  to the host's lymphoid tissue. Its discoverers have proved beyond
  question that runt disease is immunological in origin. So far as
  it concerns mice, the clear recognition of runt disease had to
  await the development of a technique for injecting newborn mice
  intravenously<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>; until that
  had been done, there was every inducement to believe that death
  or stunting was due to accidental damage caused by injecting
  cells into mice in utero. Runt disease or splenomegaly (one of
  its earlier symptoms) provides a test of the immunological
  competence of cells, and lends itself to exact studies of their
  immunological capabilities; perhaps the most important discovery
  that can be credited to it is of the presence of an
  immunologically competent cell in peripheral blood. The aspect of
  runt disease that concerns us here is its relationship to
  tolerance. A state of tolerance must obviously abet the onset and
  probably the progress of runt disease, because if adult lymphoid
  cells are to attack the tissues of the animal into which they are
  injected they must live long enough to be able to do so. The
  frequency with which runt disease was associated with the
  induction of tolerance gave rise to the suspicion that tolerance
  might itself be a pathological condition: might not the adult
  lymphoid cells used to procure it simply exterminate the
  developing lymphoid cells of the host and take their place? This
  cannot be so. Tolerance unaccompanied by any symptom of runt
  disease is produced by the injection of embryonic cells or by a
  natural or artificial parabiosis between embryos, and it leads
  here to a stable chimerism in which native and foreign cells seem
  to coexist without the one ousting the other. It can be produced,
  moreover, by adult lymphoid cells which, though antigenically
  foreign to their hosts, are for simple genetic reasons incapable
  of attacking them. The experiment I described at the beginning of
  this lecture is in fact best carried out by injecting, not adult
  CBA lymphoid cells, but adult lymphoid cells from a
  first-generation hybrid between mice of strains A and CBA. By and
  large there seems no reason to believe that tolerance can be
  explained in terms of cellular competition and replacement.</p>

  <p><b>Other forms of immunological
  non-reactivity</b><br>
  The antigenic substances I have so far had in mind are "foreign"
  only in the sense that they derive from other members of their
  recipient's species. Tolerance of more remotely foreign cellular
  antigens is more difficult but certainly not impossible to
  achieve. But even if we confine the concept to the reactions that
  take place within the compass of a species, it is clear that
  tolerance can be induced by antigens belonging to more than one
  chemical class and may extend to more than one modality of
  response. A tolerant animal fails not only to engage in the
  "cellular" type of response we associate with the reaction
  against homografts of skin; it fails equally to make humoral
  antibodies, e.g. isohaemagglutinins; and the antibodies that fail
  to make an appearance include those of so-called "natural"
  occurrence (e.g. human anti-A or anti-B) as well as those that
  appear only in response to deliberate immunization. It is not
  surprising, then, that many authors<a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> should have found that a state
  not yet formally distinguishable from tolerance should be brought
  about by the injection of purified protein antigens into young
  animals.</p>

  <p>Even in this wider sense, tolerance is by
  no means the only kind of specific immunological
  non-reactivity<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. L.D.
  Felton described and named the phenomenon of "immunological
  paralysis" in 1949. Felton showed that adult mice could be
  immunized and therefore protected against otherwise lethal doses
  of living pneumococci by the injection of 0.5 micrograms of a
  pneumococcal polysaccharide of the appropriate antigenic type.
  But, so far from conferring resistance, the injection of larger
  doses (500 micrograms, for example) abolished it, for the mice
  became vulnerable to pneumococcal infection and could now no
  longer be protected against it by an injection of the smaller
  dose. An analogous phenomenon was discovered by J.F. Dixon and
  P.H. Maurer when they showed that large doses of soluble protein
  antigens failed to excite a response from adult rabbits. The
  foreign protein disappeared from the circulation at just the rate
  that would be expected if no anti-bodies against it had been
  formed. At one time most of us believed that immunological
  paralysis could not be classified as an essential non-reactivity.
  Antibodies were probably formed, we believed, but were promptly
  bound by antigen present in vast excess. But the most recent
  work, notably from A.H. Coons's laboratory, makes this
  interpretation rather doubtful, for refined methods have so far
  failed to reveal that any immunological reaction is afoot. These
  observations have given rise to the hope that paralysis and
  tolerance of soluble antigens may be indistinguishable phenomena.
  The problem now to be decided is whether or not the inception of
  tolerance in the narrower sense depends upon some quantitatively
  distinctive property of immature lymphoid cells. Are embryonic
  cells specially easy to paralyze, for example, or, what comes to
  the same thing, is it specially difficult to make adult cells
  tolerant? I know that work bearing on this problem is in progress
  in Coons's and Mitchison's laboratories. For many reasons - one
  of them the need to distinguish between the doses of antigen
  needed for the inception and the maintenance of the unresponsive
  state - the problem is by no means so easy to tackle as might
  appear at first sight. It is a matter of some importance that a
  quantitative study of the same kind should be made upon tolerance
  of foreign tissue grafts. If I may refer once again to the
  experiment described at the beginning of this lecture, we can be
  sure that an <i>adult</i> A-line mouse will not be made tolerant
  of CBA tissues by the injection into it of a proportionate
  multiple of the number of CBA cells that would have sufficed if
  their recipient had been newly born; but we still do not know
  whether a disproportionately large number of CBA cells might not
  confer tolerance upon a mouse (say) ten days old. However, the
  possibility that tolerance and paralysis are no more than
  quantitatively distinguishable, if even that, makes it more
  urgent than ever before to prepare the antigens that excite
  transplantation immunity in an adequately potent form.</p>

  <p>Two other forms of non-reactivity should be
  mentioned. One is the specific tolerance of tissue grafts which
  may be conferred upon a totally irradiated mouse whose
  haematopoietic tissues have been restored by an injection of
  foreign bone-marrow cells. J.F. Loutit has suggested that the
  phenomenon is akin to tolerance in the narrower sense defined by
  our own experiments, but here, too, the analogy with
  immunological paralysis is not far to seek. Curiously enough, the
  encouragingly long survivals of kidney homografts reported by our
  surgical colleagues in Boston and Paris<a href=
  "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> have been brought about by the
  use of rather lower doses of whole-body irradiation than
  experience with mice might have tempted one to regard as
  essential. Perhaps the behaviour of inbred and homozygous mice is
  not the best theoretical guide to what may be expected of animals
  so obstinately heterozygous as human beings. Is it possible that
  "radiation induced tolerance" might be easier to secure when the
  mouse donors are hybrids of type X/Y and the recipients hybrids
  of type Y/Z? This model is also unrealistic, but more akin in
  principle to the genetic situation that human beings confront us
  with in real life.</p>

  <p>Finally - I have put it last because it is
  the least easy to classify, though it might turn out to be the
  paradigm of all such phenomena - I must mention the inhibition of
  drug allergy described by M.W. Chase and M. Sulzberger<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Guinea pigs fed by mouth with,
  for example, picryl chloride, no longer develop a cutaneous
  hypersensitivity of the delayed type upon the application of that
  substance to the skin. Analysis has shown that this, too, is an
  essential non-reactivity. Many of us nourish the hope that a
  similar principle might be turned to good account in
  transplantation immunity, if it should prove possible to prepare
  a "haptenized" derivative of the antigens that cause it to come
  about.</p>

  <p><b>Biological significance</b><br>
  Tolerance is a natural phenomenon, though its natural occurrence
  among chimeric twins may be something of an oddity. Has it any
  wider zoological significance?</p>

  <p>The immunological defences of the body are
  directed against foreign matter. It is not at all common for an
  animal to react upon the native ingredients of its own body.
  Burnet was the first to realize that this is not a state of
  affairs to be taken for granted, but something that calls for a
  special explanation; and it was his attempt to explain it that
  led him to predict that antigens which impinged upon an animal
  sufficiently early in its life should come to be accepted as if
  they were its own. Now that tolerance is an established fact we
  may turn his argument the other way about. Tolerance is ideally
  well qualified to provide a built-in natural safeguard against
  the danger that an animal might be sensitized or immunized by the
  constituents of its own body, and this may turn out to be its
  biological raison d&acute;&ecirc;tre<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>. If this argument is true then
  the only substances capable of exciting autoimmune reactions
  should be those which never normally have access to centres of
  immunological response, so that the body has no opportunity to
  learn to tolerate them. I do not know of any evidence that
  contradicts this inference.</p>

  <p>Tolerance makes one think anew about the
  special relationship that holds between a mammalian mother and
  its unborn young. There are hints in the literature that a
  mammalian infant may be specially tolerant of antigens of
  maternal origin, and evidence of such a relationship should be
  found more readily among human beings than elsewhere; for unlike
  rats and mice we have a long gestation period, and unlike sheep
  and cattle our foetal membranes are permeable by at least some
  molecules as large as proteins. Yet it seems most unlikely that
  maternally induced tolerance should be of regular or well-defined
  occurrence. The permeation of the foetus by foreign anti-gens
  gaining access through the mother might weaken its resistance in
  later life to infectious disease (we may recall here the
  significance read by Burnet and Fenner into Traub's observations
  on lymphocytic choriomeningitis<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>). This is only one among half a
  dozen reasons why traffic between maternal and foetal
  circulations should be under very close control. The occurrence
  of runt disease makes it of course unthinkable that the barrier
  between mother and foetus should be easily penetrable by anything
  so large as maternal cells.</p>

  <p><b>Theories of tolerance</b><br>
  Burnet and I have agreed upon a division of labour which absolves
  me from speculating upon the causes of the various kinds of
  essential non-reactivity I have described. Tolerance, like the
  secondary response and the nature of immunological "memory", has
  become something of a testing ground for theories of the immune
  response. It must be said that the occurrence of tolerance does
  not yet follow from any hypothesis of the nature of the immune
  response that has been verified by <i>independent</i> means. Far
  too much is still uncertain. We do not yet know whether any one
  antibody-forming cell is potentially capable of making any
  antibody within the organism's immunological repertoire or
  whether the competence of any one such cell is restricted to a
  sub-class of the reactions that can be engaged in by the organism
  considered as a whole. We do not yet know whether the act of
  synthesis undertaken by an antibody-forming cell is strictly and
  specifically underwritten by the cell's genetic make-up or
  whether, in J. Lederberg's terminology, the instructions that
  govern that act of synthesis are imparted by the antigen itself.
  And if it should be true that the antigen does no more than
  choose between one set of preexisting instructions and another,
  we still do not know whether those instructions are already
  present in the zygote and therefore part of the legacy of its
  descendants, or whether they must be added to mutation,
  necessarily) during the course of growth. Finally, we do not even
  know whether the antitheses as I have put them are wisely so put
  or not. But it is the study of tolerance that has raised these
  questions in a specially urgent form<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>, and which, in due course, will
  make an important contribution to their answers.</p>
