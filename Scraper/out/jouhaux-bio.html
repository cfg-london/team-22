  <h1>L&eacute;on Jouhaux - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="jouhaux.jpg" class="bio-img">Dean of the
  French labor movement for forty-five years, <b>L&eacute;on
  Jouhaux</b> (July 1, 1879-April 28, 1954) was born in Paris, heir
  to the radical beliefs of his grandfather who had fought in the
  Revolution of 1848 and of his father who had been a part of the
  Commune that had controlled Paris for a brief time in the
  aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War. Seeking higher wages,
  L&eacute;on's father left his low-paying municipal job in 1880 to
  join the labor force of a match factory in Aubervilliers.
  L&eacute;on attended primary school there until the age of twelve;
  studied at the Lyc&eacute;e Colbert on a scholarship for nine
  months before he was taken out of school when his father's
  earnings were stopped by a strike; spent a year at the Diderot
  Vocational School, again abandoning his studies to help support
  himself and the family.<br>
  <br>
  In 1895 at the age of sixteen, he entered the match factory, and
  even before becoming a full-fledged union member, prepared the
  minutes of the union meetings. After a period of military service
  in Algeria, from which he was recalled because his father had
  gone blind as a result of years of working with volatile white
  phosphorus, Jouhaux returned to work in the factory. In 1900 he
  participated in his first strike, a protest against the use of
  phosphorus, was blacklisted, and dismissed. Unable to find steady
  employment, he held a succession of jobs in a sugar refinery, a
  fertilizer plant, and on the docks, meanwhile attending classes
  at the Sorbonne, and the Universit&eacute; Populaire at
  Aubervilliers.<br>
  <br>
  Reinstated in the factory through the intervention of the union,
  he embarked upon his life career as a labor leader, rising
  rapidly to positions of responsibility because of his
  intelligence, industriousness, organizing ability, impressive
  personality, and talent as a speaker. In 1906 his local union
  elected him as their representative to the
  Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration g&eacute;n&eacute;rale du travail (C.G.T.);
  in 1909 he was named interim treasurer of the C.G.T.; and, a few
  months later on July 12, 1909, was appointed to the post of
  secretary-general of the C.G.T., a position he held until 1947
  and from which was derived his nickname, &laquo;the
  General&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  Although Jouhaux gradually moved from a radical philosophical
  position to a more moderate one in his four decades of labor
  leadership, he nonetheless preserved a remarkable consistency in
  the programs of action he espoused. He first strove to bring to
  realization the demands of labor commonly proposed during the
  first third of this century. In 1936 he was a signatory of the
  Matignon Agreement giving French workers the eight-hour day, paid
  vacations, the right to organize and to bargain collectively. The
  larger conception of trade unionism to which Jouhaux devoted his
  life can be found in the pages of <i>La Bataille
  syndicaliste</i>, the main organ of the C.G.T., which he edited
  from 1911 to 1921, and in his speeches and extensive
  publications. It included principles of inclusiveness,
  solidarity, political independence, democratic procedure, and
  international concern.<br>
  <br>
  He was himself a confirmed internationalist. Alarmed by the
  crisis in international relations prior to World War I, Jouhaux
  spoke in England, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, urging labor
  unions to unite in the cause of peace. With the opening of
  hostilities, however, he declared his support for the war effort
  and accepted membership on several governmental committees.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he led the C.G.T. in developing a peace program
  calling for arms limitation, international arbitration, an end to
  secret treaties, and respect for nationalities. In 1916 at the
  Leeds Conference, Jouhaux presented a report laying the
  groundwork for what later became the <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">International Labor Organization (ILO)</a>;
  in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference he was one of those
  influential in getting the constitutional basis of the ILO
  incorporated in Article XIII of the Versailles Treaty; in that
  same year he was chosen as one of the worker-representative
  members of the ILO's Governing Body.<br>
  <br>
  Jouhaux filled other trade union positions of international
  significance. He was elected first vice-president of the
  International Federation of Trade Unions in 1919, retaining that
  office in 1945 when this organization was reconstituted as the
  World Federation of Trade Unions. When various of its members
  later found the World Federation politically repugnant, he joined
  the heads of trade unions in other nations in forming the
  International
  Confederation of Free Trade Unions, becoming one of its
  vice-presidents.<br>
  <br>
  Active also in international political affairs, Jouhaux was from
  1925 to 1928 a member of the French delegation to the League of
  Nations, where he played a part in drafting proposals on various
  aspects of the question of arms control, and from 1946 to 1951 to
  the United
  Nations, where he sought to obtain, among other things, the
  universal recognition of the human right to free association. In
  1949 he became president of the European Movement, whose Council
  of Europe was established as a first step toward federated
  Europe.<br>
  <br>
  For some thirty years Jonhaux struggled to keep the C.G.T. free
  of political domination. Under intense attack by the French
  Communists from 1918 on, Jouhaux maintained the integrity of the
  C.G.T. by forcing the Communists to split off in 1921. He
  reunited the two groups against fascism in 1936, but after the
  outbreak of World War II in 1939, once again dissociated himself
  from the Communists.<br>
  <br>
  After the fall of France, the C.G.T. was dissolved. Jouhaux
  joined the Resistance, was arrested in December, 1941, and held
  in house custody until April, 1943, when he was sent to the
  Buchenwald prison camp in Germany. He was liberated in May of
  1945, still a healthy man at the age of sixty-six despite his
  imprisonment of twenty-five months.<br>
  <br>
  Upon his return to active leadership in a reconstituted C. G.T.,
  he shared the office of secretary-general with the Communist
  Benoit Frachon. Opposing the Communists on both ideological and
  tactical grounds and dismayed by their unwillingness to support
  the Marshall Plan, Jouhaux reluctantly withdrew in 1947 from the
  central organization of the C.G.T. to form, along with other
  leaders, the C.G.T.-Force Ouvri&egrave;re, of which he became
  president. The C.G.T.-F.O., advocating freedom from political
  control, the establishment of a United States of Europe, the
  pursuit of unity among the workers of the world, and action to
  increase the status of labor, grew rapidly in membership in the
  next few years.<br>
  <br>
  One of Jonhaux's most important offices was that of president of
  the French National Economic Council to which he was elected in
  1947. The Economic Council, whose objective was to integrate the
  economic forces within the structure of France, had long been
  advocated by Jouhaux. Speaking of Jonhaux's association with the
  Council, Paul Pisson, the first vice-president, described him as
  &laquo;a creative force&raquo;, a man &laquo;full offervor end
  vitality&raquo;, the possessor of a &laquo;store of enthusiastic
  idealism&raquo; who had a &laquo;ringing voice and expressive
  manner&raquo;<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was during a
  session of the Council that Jouhaux first sustained the symptoms
  of the heart trouble that was to bring his career to a close.
  Before he died on April 28, 1954, he was informed that he had
  been elected to the presidency of the Council for the seventh
  consecutive time.</p>
