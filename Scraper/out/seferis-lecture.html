  <h2>Some Notes on Modern Greek Tradition</h2>

  <p>A poet who is especially dear to me, the
  Irishman <a href="../1923/index.html">W.B. Yeats</a>, Nobel
  laureate of 1923, on his return from Stockholm wrote an account
  of his trip entitled &laquo;The Bounty of Sweden&raquo;. I was
  reminded of it when the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1963/seferis-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish Academy</a> honoured me so greatly by its
  choice. &laquo;The bounty of Sweden&raquo; is for us much older and
  extends much further. I do not think that any Greek, on learning
  of the homage you have paid to my country, could forget the good
  that Sweden has done in our country with altruism, patience, and
  such perfect humanity, whether it was done by your archaeologists
  in times of peace or by your <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1917/index.html">Red Cross</a> missions during
  the war. I pass over many other gestures of solidarity that we
  have seen more recently.<br>
  <br>
  When your King, His Majesty Gustav Adolf VI, handed me the
  diploma of the Nobel Prize, I could not but remember with emotion
  the days when as Crown Prince he was determined to make his
  personal contribution to the excavations of the Acropolis of
  Asine. When I first met Axel Persson, that generous man who had
  devoted himself to the same excavation, I called him my godfather
  - godfather because Asine had given me a poem.<br>
  <br>
  In the town of Missolonghi a granite monument has been dedicated
  to the Swedes who died for Greece in her struggle for
  independence. Our gratitude is even more durable than that
  granite.<br>
  <br>
  One evening at the beginning of the last century, in a street on
  the island of Zante, Dionysios Solomos heard an old beggar at the
  door of a tavern reciting a popular ballad on the burning of the
  Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. Extending his hand, the beggar
  said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">The Holy Sepulchre of Christ, it did not
    burn;<br>
    Where the holy light shines, no other fire can burn.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Solomos, we are told, was seized with such
  enthusiasm that he entered the tavern and ordered free drinks for
  all those present. This anecdote is significant for me; I have
  always considered it as a symbol of the gift of poetry that our
  people are left in the hands of a prince of the spirit at the
  very moment when the resurrection of modern Greece begins.<br>
  <br>
  This symbol represents a long development that has not yet been
  completed. It is my intention to speak to you of some men who
  have been important in the struggle for Greek expression ever
  since we started breathing the air of liberty. Forgive me if my
  account is sketchy, but I do not wish to tax your patience.<br>
  <br>
  Our difficulties began with the Alexandrians who, dazzled by the
  Attic classics, began to teach what is correct and incorrect in
  writing, began, in other words, to teach purism. They did not
  consider that language is a living organism and that nothing can
  stop its growth. They were indeed very successful and brought
  forth generation after generation of purists, who have survived
  even to our day. They represent one of the two great currents in
  our language and our tradition that have never been
  interrupted.<br>
  <br>
  The other current, long disregarded, is the vulgar, popular, or
  oral tradition. It is as old as the former and has its own
  written documents. I was moved when one day I happened to read a
  letter from a sailor to his father, preserved on a second-century
  papyrus. I was struck by the actuality and the presence of its
  language, and I grieved that for many centuries a wealth of
  sentiments had remained unexpressed, stifled forever by the vast
  shroud of purism and the niceties of the rhetorical style. The
  Gospels, too, as you know, were written in the popular language
  of their period. If one thinks of the Apostles, who wanted to be
  understood and appreciated by the common people, one can only
  view with anguish the human perversity that caused uproars in
  Athens at the beginning of the century on the occasion of a
  translation of the Gospels, and which even today would brand as
  unlawful the translation of the words of Christ.<br>
  <br>
  But I am anticipating. The two currents ran parallel until the
  fall of the Greek Byzantine Empire. On the one hand, there were
  the scholars, refined by a thousand embellishments of the mind.
  On the other hand, there were the common people, who regarded
  them with respect but nevertheless continued in their own modes
  of expression. I do not think that during the Byzantine era there
  ever was a rapprochement between the two currents, that is, a
  phenomenon such as one observes in the frescoes and mosaics of
  the years preceding the end of the Empire under the Paleologues.
  At that time imperial art and the popular art of the provinces
  merged to produce a splendid renewal.<br>
  <br>
  However, Constantinople underwent a long agony before she fell.
  When she was finally taken, a servitude, which was to last for
  several centuries, descended on the entire nation. Many then were
  the scholars who, &laquo;carrying the heavy urns filled with the
  ashes of their ancestors&raquo;, as the poet says, came to the
  Occident to spread the seeds of what came to be called the
  Renaissance. But that Renaissance - I mean the word in its strict
  sense, as we use it to indicate the transition from the Middle
  Ages to the modern age, whether it was good or bad - that
  Renaissance was not known in Greece, with the exception of
  certain islands, notably Crete, which was then under Venetian
  rule. There, toward the sixteenth century, was developed a poetry
  and a verse drama in a language splendidly alive and perfectly
  sure of itself. Considering that at the same time important
  schools of painting were flourishing in Crete and that toward the
  middle of the century the great Cretan painter Domenicos
  Theotocopoulos, who came to be known as El Greco, was born and
  grew up on that island, the fall of Crete is an even more painful
  event than the fall of Constantinople.<br>
  <br>
  Constantinople had, after all, received a fatal blow from the
  Crusaders in 1204. She was merely outliving herself. Crete, on
  the other hand, was full of vigour, and one can only brood with a
  curious mixture of grief and faith over the destiny of that Greek
  land whose people are always ready to rebuild what the squalls of
  history are to overthrow again. One is reminded of what the poet
  Kalvos wrote to General Lafayette: &laquo;God and our
  Despair&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  At any rate, the revival in Crete began to decline in the middle
  of the seventeenth century. At that time many Cretans sought
  refuge in the Ionian Islands and in other parts of Greece. They
  brought with them their poems, which they knew by heart and which
  were immediately adopted in their new surroundings. These poems
  sometimes blended with the popular songs preserved by the Greeks
  of the mainland, together with their legends, for many
  generations. There is evidence that some of them may date back to
  pagan times; others emerged in the course of the centuries, such
  as the cycle of Digenis Acritas, a product of the Byzantine era.
  They make us realize that throughout the ages the same attitudes
  toward work, suffering, joy, love, and death persisted without
  change. But at the same time their expression is so fresh, so
  free and full of humanity, that they make us feel intuitively to
  what extent the spirit of Greece has always remained faithful to
  itself. I have so far avoided giving you examples. However much I
  am indebted to my translators - it is through them that you are
  able to know me - I have the painful feeling of a distortion
  beyond recovery when I translate my language into language that
  is not mine. Forgive me if for the moment I cannot help making an
  exception. It is a very short poem about the death of a loved
  one:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">To protect you I placed three guards: the sun
    on<br>
    the mountain, the eagle on the plain, and the fresh<br>
    north wind on the ships. The sun has set;<br>
    the eagle has fallen asleep; and the ships have<br>
    carried away the fresh north wind. Charon saw<br>
    his chance and took you away.<br>
    I have given you a pale reflection of the poem, which is
    radiant in Greek.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here you have in very simplified terms the
  antecedents of modern Greece. It is the heritage which the old
  beggar in front of the tavern on Zante bequeathed to Dionysios
  Solomos one evening. That image comes to my mind whenever I think
  of him and of what he has given to us.<br>
  <br>
  In the history of modern Greek poetry there is no lack of strange
  figures and cases. It would have been much more natural, for
  instance, if the poetry of a country of sailors, peasants, and
  soldiers had begun with rough and simple songs. But the opposite
  happened. It began with a man driven by the daemon of the
  absolute, who was born on the island of Zante. The level of
  culture on the Ionian Islands was at that time much superior to
  that on the mainland. Solomos had studied in Italy. He was a
  great European and very much aware of the problems faced by the
  poetry of his century. He could have made his career in Italy. He
  wrote poems in Italian, and he did not lack encouragement; but he
  preferred the narrow gate and decided to do his work in Greek.
  Solomos certainly knew the poems that the Cretan refugees had
  brought with them. He was a fervent partisan of the popular
  language and an enemy of purism. His views on the subject have
  been preserved in his <i>Dialogue between the Poet and the Pedant
  Scholar</i> (we should understand that word in the sense in which
  Rabelais uses the word Sorbonicole). I cite at random: &laquo;Is
  there anything in my mind&raquo;, he exclaims, &laquo;but liberty
  and language?&raquo; Or again: &laquo;Submit to the language of the
  people, and if you are strong enough, conquer it.&raquo; He
  undertook this conquest and through this undertaking he became a
  great Greek. Solomos is without doubt the author of the
  &laquo;Hymn to Freedom&raquo;, the first stanzas of which have
  became our national anthem, and of other poems that have been set
  to music and widely sung in the course of the last century. But
  it is not for this reason that his heritage is so valuable to us;
  it is because he charted as definitively as his age permitted him
  the course that Greek expression was to take. He loved the living
  language and worked all his life to raise it to the level of the
  poetry of which he dreamt. It was an effort beyond the powers of
  any single individual. Of his great poems - for instance
  &laquo;The Free Besieged&raquo;, inspired by the siege and
  sufferings of the town of Missolonghi - only fragments remain to
  us, the dust from a diamond that the craftsman took into his
  tomb. We have nothing but fragments and blank spaces to represent
  the struggle of this great soul which was as tense as a
  bow-string that is about to snap. Many generations of Greek
  writers have bent over those fragments and those blank spaces.
  Solomos died in 1857. In 1927, <i>I Gynaika tis Zakynthos</i>
  [Woman of Zante] was published for the first time and established
  him as a great prose writer just as he had long been acknowledged
  as a great poet. It is a magnificent work that makes a profound
  impact on our minds. In a significant manner fate willed that
  seventy years after his death Solomos would reply by means of
  this message to the inquietude of new generations. He has always
  been a beginning.<br>
  <br>
  Andreas Kalvos, a contemporary of Solomos, was one of the most
  isolated figures in Greek literature. There is not even a
  portrait of him. A friend of the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo, he
  soon was embroiled in a quarrel with him. He was born on the
  island of Zante and lived for many years on Corfu. He does not
  seem to have had any contact with Solomos. His entire work
  consists of a slender volume of twenty odes published when he was
  barely thirty. In his youth he travelled extensively in Italy,
  Switzerland, and England. He had a lofty mind, imbued with the
  moral ideas of the end of the eighteenth century, devoted to
  virtue, fiercely opposed to tyranny. His poetry is inspired by
  the grandeur and sorrow of a martyred nation. It is moving to see
  how this man, who lost his mother as a child, in the depth of his
  consciousness identifies the love for his lost mother with that
  for his country. His language is irregular; his rhymes
  idiosyncratic; he had a classical ideal in mind and despised what
  he called &laquo;the monotony of the Cretan poems&raquo; that had
  given so much to Solomos. But his images are flashes of lightning
  and of such immediate power that they seem to tear his poetry
  apart. After a solitary life on Corfu, devoted to teaching, he
  left the Ionian Islands for good. He married a second time in
  London and with his wife opened a boarding school for girls in a
  small provincial town in England. There he lived for fourteen
  years until his death, without ever renewing contact with
  Greece.<br>
  <br>
  I have made a pilgrimage to those regions haunted by the shadows
  of Tennyson. An old man who loved that part of the country told
  me that he had once interviewed old women of eighty who had been
  pupils of Kalvos and whose memories were full of respect for
  their old master. But again I was unable to free myself from the
  image of that faceless man, clad in black, striking his lyre on
  an isolated promontory. His work fell into oblivion; doubtless
  his voice did not conform to the taste for unreal and romantic
  rhetoric that swept Athens at that period. He was rediscovered
  about 1890 by Kostis Palamas. Greece had matured meanwhile, and
  it was the time when the young forces of modern Greece were
  beginning to burst forth. The struggle for a living language was
  widening. There were exaggerations, but that was only natural.
  The struggle, continuing for many years, went beyond literature
  and was characterized by the will to challenge every aspect of
  the present. It turned enthusiastically toward public education.
  One rejected ready-made forms and ideas. One certainly wanted to
  preserve the heritage of the ancients, but at the same time there
  was an interest in the common people; one wanted to illuminate
  the one by the other. One wondered about the identity of the
  Greek of today. Scholars and schoolmasters took part in this
  struggle. Important studies of Greek folklore appeared during
  this period, and there was a growing realization of the
  continuity of our tradition as well as of the need for a critical
  spirit.<br>
  <br>
  Kostis Palamas played a great role in this movement. I was an
  adolescent when I first saw him; he was giving a lecture. He was
  a very short man, who impressed one by his deep eyes and by his
  voice, which was rich with a somewhat tremulous quality. His work
  was vast and influenced decades of Greek literary life. He
  expressed himself in all genres of poetry - lyric, epic, and
  satirical; at the same time he was our most important critic. He
  had an astonishing knowledge of foreign literatures, proving once
  again that Greece is a crossroads, and that since the time of
  Herodotus or Plato it has never been closed to foreign currents,
  especially in its best moments. Palamas inevitably had enemies,
  often among those who had profited from the road he had opened. I
  consider him a force of nature in comparison with which the
  critics look petty. When he appeared, it was as if a force of
  nature, held back and accumulated for over a thousand years of
  purism, had finally burst the dikes. When the waters are freed to
  flood a thirsty plain, one must not ask that they carry only
  flowers. Palamas was profoundly aware of all the components of
  our civilization, ancient, Byzantine, and modern. A world of
  unexpressed things thronged his soul. It was that world, his
  world, which he liberated. I would not maintain that his
  abundance never harmed him, but the people that assembled about
  his coffin in 1943 clearly felt something of what I have just
  told you when at the moment of final farewell they spontaneously
  sang our national anthem, the hymn to freedom, under the eyes of
  the occupation authorities.<br>
  <br>
  One hundred and fifty-four poems constitute the known work of
  Constantine Cavafy, who is at the opposite pole from Palamas. He
  is that rare among poets whose motivating force is not the word;
  the danger lies in the abundance of words. He was part of the
  Hellenic culture that flourished in Egypt and is disappearing
  today. Except for a few absences, he spent all his life in
  Alexandria, his native city. His art is characterized by
  rejections and by his sense of history. By history I do not mean
  the account of the past, but the history that lives in the
  present and sheds light on our present life, on its drama and its
  destiny. I compare Cavafy to that Proteus of the Alexandrian
  shore who, Homer says, changed his form incessantly. His
  tradition was not that of the popular art which Solomos and
  Palamas had followed; it was the scholarly tradition. Whereas
  they took their inspiration from a propular song or tale, he
  would have recourse to Plutarch or to an obscure chronicler or to
  the deeds of a Ptolemy or a Seleucid. His language is a mixture
  of what he learned from his family (a fine family from
  Constantinople) and what his ear picked up in the streets of
  Alexandria, for he was a city man. He loved countries and periods
  in which the frontiers are not well defined, in which
  personalities and beliefs are fluid. Many of his characters are
  partly pagan and partly Christian, or live in a mixed
  environment: &laquo;Syrians, Greeks, Armenians, Medes&raquo;, as he
  has said. Once you have become familiar with his poetry, you
  begin to ask yourself if it is not a projection of our present
  life into the past, or perhaps if history has not decided all of
  a sudden to invade our present existence. His world is a
  preliminary world that comes back to life with the grace of a
  young body. His friend E.M. Forster told me that, when he read to
  him for the first time a translation of his poems, Cavafy
  exclaimed in surprise, &laquo;But you understand, my dear Forster,
  you understand&raquo; He had so completely forgotten what it was
  like to be understood!<br>
  <br>
  Time has passed since then, and Cavafy has been abundantly
  translated and commented upon. I am thinking at this moment of
  your true poet and generous Hellenist, the late Hjalmar Gullberg,
  who introduced Cavafy to Sweden. But Greece has several facets,
  and not all of them are obvious. I am thinking of the poet
  Anghelos Sikelianos. I knew him well, and it is easy to recall
  his magnificent voice as he recited his poetry. He had something
  of the splendour of a bard of a former age, but at the same time
  he was uncommonly familiar with our land and the peasants.
  Everybody loved him. He was called simply &laquo;Anghelos&raquo;,
  as if he were one of them. He knew instinctively how to establish
  a relation between the words and the behaviour of a Parnassus
  shepherd or a village woman and the sacred world which he
  inhabited. He was possessed by a god, a force made up of Apollo,
  Dionysius, and Christ. A poem he wrote one Christmas night during
  the last war, &laquo;Dionysius in the Manger&raquo;, begins
  &laquo;my sweet child, my Dionysus and my Christ.&raquo; And it is
  truly amazing to see how in Greece the old pagan religion has
  blended with orthodox Christianity. In Greece Dionysus, too, was
  a crucified god. Cavafy, who has so strongly felt and expressed
  the resurrection of man and the world, is nonetheless the same
  man who has written, &laquo;Death is the only way.&raquo; He
  understood that life and death are two faces of the same thing. I
  used to visit him whenever I passed through Greece. He suffered
  from a long illness, but the force that inspired him never left
  him to the end. One evening at his home, after his fainting spell
  had alarmed us, he told me, &laquo;I have seen the absolute black;
  it was unspeakably beautiful.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  Now, I should like to end this brief account with a man who has
  always been dear to me; he has supported me in difficult hours,
  when all hope seemed gone. He is an extreme case of contrasts,
  even in my country. He is not an intellectual. But the intellect
  thrown back upon itself sometimes needs freshness, like the dead
  who needed fresh blood before answering Ulysses. At the age of
  thirty-five he learned to read and write a little in order to
  record, so he said, what he had seen during the war of
  independence, in which he had taken a very active part. His name
  is Ioannis Makriyannis. I compare him to one of those old olive
  trees in our country which were shaped by the elements and which
  can, I believe, teach a man wisdom. He, too, was shaped by human
  elements, by many generations of human souls. He was born near
  the end of the eighteenth century on the Greek mainland near
  Delphi. He tells us how his poor mother, while she was gathering
  faggots, was seized by labour pains and gave birth to him in a
  forest. He was not a poet, but song was in him, as it has always
  been in the soul of the common people. When a foreigner, a
  Frenchman, visited him, he invited him for a meal; he tells us,
  &laquo;My guest wanted to hear some of our songs, so I invented
  some for him.&raquo; He had a singular talent for expression; his
  writing resembles a wall built stone by stone; all his words
  perform their function and have their roots; sometimes there is
  something Homeric in their movement. No other man has taught me
  more how to write prose. He disliked the false pretences of
  rhetoric. In a moment of anger he exclaimed, &laquo;You have
  appointed a new commander to the citadel of Corinth - a pedant.
  His name was Achilles, and in hearing the name you thought that
  it was the famous Achilles and that the name was going to fight.
  But a name never fights; what fights is valour, love of one's
  country, and virtue.&raquo; But at the same time one perceives his
  love for the ancient heritage, when he said to soldiers who were
  about to sell two statues to foreigners: &laquo;Even if they pay
  you ten thousand thalers, don't let the statues leave our soil.
  It is for them that we fought.&raquo; Considering that the war had
  left many scars on the body of this man, one may rightly conclude
  that these words carried some weight. Toward the end of his life
  his fate became tragic. His wounds caused him intolerable pain.
  He was persecuted, thrown into prison, tried, and condemned. In
  his despair he wrote letters to God. &laquo;And You don't hear us,
  You don't see us.&raquo; That was the end. Makriyannis died in the
  middle of the last century. His memoirs were deciphered and
  published in 1907. It took many more years for the young to
  realize his true stature.<br>
  <br>
  I have spoken to you about these men because their shadows have
  followed me ever since I started on my journey to Sweden and
  because their efforts represent to my mind the efforts of a body
  shackled for centuries which, with its chains finally broken,
  regains life and gropes and searches for its natural activity. No
  doubt, my account has many limitations. I have distorted by
  oversimplifying. The limitation I particularly dislike is
  inherent in any personal matter. I have certainly omitted great
  names, for instance, Adamantios Korais and Alexandros
  Papadiamantis. But how to talk about all this without making a
  choice? Forgive my shortcomings. In any case, I have only
  indicated some landmarks, and that I have done as simply as
  possible. In addition to those men, and in the periods that
  separated them, there were of course many generations of
  dedicated workers who sacrificed their lives to advance the
  spirit a little more toward that many-faced expression which is
  the Greek expression. I also wanted to express my solidarity with
  my people, not only with the great masters of the mind, but with
  the unknown, the ignored, those who pored over a book with the
  same devotion with which one bends over an icon; with the
  children who had to walk for hours to get to schools far away
  from their villages &laquo;to learn the letters, the things of
  God&raquo;, as their song has it. To echo once more my friend
  Makriyannis, one must not say &laquo;I&raquo; one must say
  &laquo;we&raquo;, because no one does anything alone. I think it is
  good that it be so. I need that solidarity because, if I do not
  understand the men of our country with their virtues and vices, I
  feel that I could not understand the other men in the wide
  world.<br>
  <br>
  I have not spoken to you of the ancients. I did not want to tire
  you. Perhaps I should add a few words. Since the fifteenth
  century, since the fall of Byzantium, they have increasingly
  become the heritage of mankind. They have been integrated into
  what we have come to call European civilization. We rejoice that
  so many nations contribute to bring them closer to our life.
  Still, there are certain things that have remained our
  inalienable possessions. When I read in Homer the simple words
  &laquo;<font face="Symbol">daoz helioio</font>&raquo; - today I
  would say &laquo;<font face="Symbol">dwz tou hliou</font>&raquo; (the
  sunlight) - I experience a familiarity that stems from a
  collective soul rather than from an intellectual effort. It is a
  tone, one might say, whose harmonies reach quite far; it feels
  very different from anything a translation can give. For we do,
  after all, speak the same language - a language changed, if you
  insist, by an evolution of several thousand years, but despite
  everything faithful to itself - and the feeling for a language
  derives from emotions as much as from knowledge. This language
  shows the imprints of deeds and attitudes repeated throughout the
  ages down to our own. These imprints sometimes have a surprising
  way of simplifying problems of interpretation that seem very
  difficult to others. I will not say that we are of the same
  blood, for I abhor racial theories, but we have always lived in
  the same country and have seen the same mountains slope into the
  sea. Perhaps I have used the word &laquo;tradition&raquo; without
  pointing out that it does not mean habit. On the contrary,
  tradition holds us by the ability to break habits, and thus
  proves its vitality.<br>
  <br>
  Nor have I talked to you of my own generation, the generation on
  which fell the burden of a moral reorientation after the exodus
  of one and a half million people from Asia Minor and which
  witnessed a unique phenomenon in Greek history, the reflux to the
  Greek mainland, the concentration of our population, once
  dispersed in flourishing centres the world over.<br>
  <br>
  And, finally, I have not spoken to you of the generation that
  came after us, whose childhood and adolescence were mangled
  during the years of the last war. It undoubtedly has new problems
  and other points of view: Greece is becoming more and more
  industrialized. Nations are moving more closely together. The
  world is changing. Its movements are speeding up. One might say
  that it is characteristic of the new generation to point out
  abysses, whether in the human soul or in the universe about us.
  The concept of duration has changed. It is a sorrowful and
  restless young generation. I understand its difficulties; they
  are, after all, not so different from ours. A great worker for
  our liberty, Righas Pheraios, has taught us: &laquo;Free thoughts
  are good thoughts.&raquo; But I should like our youth to think at
  the same time of the saying engraved on the lintel above the gate
  of your university at Uppsala: &laquo;Free thoughts are good; just
  thoughts are better.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  I have come to the end. I thank you for your patience. I am also
  grateful that &laquo;the bounty of Sweden&raquo; has permitted me
  in the end to feel as if I were &laquo;nobody&raquo; -
  understanding this word in the sense that Ulysses gave it when he
  replied to the Cyclops, Polyphemus: &laquo;<font face="Symbol">outiz</font>&raquo; - nobody, in that mysterious current
  which is Greece.</p>
