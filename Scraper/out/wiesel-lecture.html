  <h2>Hope, Despair and Memory</h2>

  <p>A Hasidic legend tells us that the great
  Rabbi Baal-Shem-Tov, Master of the Good Name, also known as the
  Besht, undertook an urgent and perilous mission: to hasten the
  coming of the Messiah. The Jewish people, all humanity were
  suffering too much, beset by too many evils. They had to be
  saved, and swiftly. For having tried to meddle with history, the
  Besht was punished; banished along with his faithful servant to a
  distant island. In despair, the servant implored his master to
  exercise his mysterious powers in order to bring them both home.
  "Impossible", the Besht replied. "My powers have been taken from
  me". "Then, please, say a prayer, recite a litany, work a
  miracle". "Impossible", the Master replied, "I have forgotten
  everything". They both fell to weeping.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Master turned to his servant
  and asked: "Remind me of a prayer - any prayer ." "If only I
  could", said the servant. "I too have forgotten everything".
  "Everything - absolutely everything?" "Yes, except - "Except
  what?" "Except the alphabet". At that the Besht cried out
  joyfully: "Then what are you waiting for? Begin reciting the
  alphabet and I shall repeat after you...". And together the two
  exiled men began to recite, at first in whispers, then more
  loudly: <i>"Aleph, beth, gimel, daleth...".</i> And over again,
  each time more vigorously, more fervently; until, ultimately, the
  Besht regained his powers, having regained his memory.</p>

  <p>I love this story, for it illustrates the
  messianic expectation -which remains my own. And the importance
  of friendship to man's ability to transcend his condition. I love
  it most of all because it emphasizes the mystical power of
  memory. Without memory, our existence would be barren and opaque,
  like a prison cell into which no light penetrates; like a tomb
  which rejects the living. Memory saved the Besht, and if anything
  can, it is memory that will save humanity. For me, hope without
  memory is like memory without hope.</p>

  <p>Just as man cannot live without dreams, he
  cannot live without hope. If dreams reflect the past, hope
  summons the future. Does this mean that our future can be built
  on a rejection of the past? Surely such a choice is not
  necessary. The two are not incompatible. The opposite of the past
  is not the future but the absence of future; the opposite of the
  future is not the past but the absence of past. The loss of one
  is equivalent to the sacrifice of the other.</p>

  <p>A recollection. The time: After the war.
  The place: Paris. A young man struggles to readjust to life. His
  mother, his father, his small sister are gone. He is alone. On
  the verge of despair. And yet he does not give up. On the
  contrary, he strives to find a place among the living. He
  acquires a new language. He makes a few friends who, like
  himself, believe that the memory of evil will serve as a shield
  against evil; that the memory of death will serve as a shield
  against death.</p>

  <p>This he must believe in order to go on. For
  he has just returned from a universe where God, betrayed by His
  creatures, covered His face in order not to see. Mankind, jewel
  of his creation, had succeeded in building an inverted Tower of
  Babel, reaching not toward heaven but toward an anti-heaven,
  there to create a parallel society, a new "creation" with its own
  princes and gods, laws and principles, jailers and prisoners. A
  world where the past no longer counted - no longer meant
  anything.</p>

  <p>Stripped of possessions, all human ties
  severed, the prisoners found themselves in a social and cultural
  void. "Forget", they were told, "Forget where you came from;
  forget who you were. Only the present matters". But the present
  was only a blink of the Lord's eye. The Almighty himself was a
  slaughterer: it was He who decided who would live and who would
  die; who would be tortured, and who would be rewarded. Night
  after night, seemingly endless processions vanished into the
  flames, lighting up the sky. Fear dominated the universe. Indeed
  this was another universe; the very laws of nature had been
  transformed. Children looked like old men, old men whimpered like
  children. Men and women from every corner of Europe were suddenly
  reduced to nameless and faceless creatures desperate for the same
  ration of bread or soup, dreading the same end. Even their
  silence was the same for it resounded with the memory of those
  who were gone. Life in this accursed universe was so distorted,
  so unnatural that a new species had evolved. Waking among the
  dead, one wondered if one was still alive.</p>

  <p>And yet real despair only seized us later.
  Afterwards. As we emerged from the nightmare and began to search
  for meaning. All those doctors of law or medicine or theology,
  all those lovers of art and poetry, of Bach and Goethe, who
  coldly, deliberately ordered the massacres and participated in
  them. What did their metamorphosis signify? Could anything
  explain their loss of ethical, cultural and religious memory? How
  could we ever understand the passivity of the onlookers and - yes
  - the silence of the Allies? And question of questions: Where was
  God in all this? It seemed as impossible to conceive of Auschwitz
  with God as to conceive of Auschwitz without God. Therefore,
  everything had to be reassessed because everything had changed.
  With one stroke, mankind's achievements seemed to have been
  erased. Was Auschwitz a consequence or an aberration of
  "civilization" ? All we know is that Auschwitz called that
  civilization into question as it called into question everything
  that had preceded Auschwitz. Scientific abstraction, social and
  economic contention, nationalism, xenophobia, religious
  fanaticism, racism, mass hysteria. All found their ultimate
  expression in Auschwitz.</p>

  <p>The next question had to be, why go on? If
  memory continually brought us back to this, why build a home? Why
  bring children into a world in which God and man betrayed their
  trust in one another?</p>

  <p>Of course we could try to forget the past.
  Why not? Is it not natural for a human being to repress what
  causes him pain, what causes him shame? Like the body, memory
  protects its wounds. When day breaks after a sleepless night,
  one's ghosts must withdraw; the dead are ordered back to their
  graves. But for the first time in history, we could not bury our
  dead. We bear their graves within ourselves.</p>

  <p>For us, forgetting was never an option.</p>

  <p>Remembering is a noble and necessary act.
  The call of memory, the call <i>to</i> memory, reaches us from
  the very dawn of history. No commandment figures so frequently,
  so insistently, in the Bible. It is incumbent upon us to remember
  the good we have received, and the evil we have suffered. New
  Year's Day, <i>Rosh Hashana,</i> is also called <i>Yom
  Hazikaron</i>, the day of memory. On that day, the day of
  universal judgment, man appeals to God to remember: our salvation
  depends on it. If God wishes to remember our suffering, all will
  be well; if He refuses, all will be lost. Thus, the rejection of
  memory becomes a divine curse, one that would doom us to repeat
  past disasters, past wars.</p>

  <p>Nothing provokes so much horror and
  opposition within the Jewish tradition as war. Our abhorrence of
  war is reflected in the paucity of our literature of warfare.
  After all, God created the Torah to do away with iniquity, to do
  away with war<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.Warriors fare
  poorly in the Talmud: Judas Maccabeus is not even mentioned;
  Bar-Kochba is cited, but negatively<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>. David, a great warrior and
  conqueror, is not permitted to build the Temple; it is his son
  Solomon, a man of peace, who constructs God's dwelling place. Of
  course some wars may have been necessary or inevitable, but none
  was ever regarded as holy. For us, a holy war is a contradiction
  in terms. War dehumanizes, war diminishes, war debases all those
  who wage it. The Talmud says, <i>"Talmidei hukhamim shemarbin
  shalom baolam"</i> (It is the wise men who will bring about
  peace). Perhaps, because wise men remember best.</p>

  <p>And yet it is surely human to forget, even
  to want to forget. The Ancients saw it as a divine gift. Indeed
  if memory helps us to survive, forgetting allows us to go on
  living. How could we go on with our daily lives, if we remained
  constantly aware of the dangers and ghosts surrounding us? The
  Talmud tells us that without the ability to forget, man would
  soon cease to learn. Without the ability to forget, man would
  live in a permanent, paralyzing fear of death. Only God and God
  alone can and must remember everything.</p>

  <p>How are we to reconcile our supreme duty
  towards memory with the need to forget that is essential to life?
  No generation has had to confront this paradox with such urgency.
  The survivors wanted to communicate everything to the living: the
  victim's solitude and sorrow, the tears of mothers driven to
  madness, the prayers of the doomed beneath a fiery sky.</p>

  <p>They needed to tell the child who, in
  hiding with his mother, asked softly, very softly: "Can I cry
  now?" They needed to tell of the sick beggar who, in a sealed
  cattle-car, began to sing as an offering to his companions. And
  of the little girl who, hugging her grandmother, whispered:
  "Don't be afraid, don't be sorry to die... I'm not". She was
  seven, that little girl who went to her death without fear,
  without regret.</p>

  <p>Each one of us felt compelled to record
  every story, every encounter. Each one of us felt compelled to
  bear witness, Such were the wishes of the dying, the testament of
  the dead. Since the so-called civilized world had no use for
  their lives, then let it be inhabited by their deaths.</p>

  <p>The great historian Shimon Dubnov served as
  our guide and inspiration. Until the moment of his death he said
  over and over again to his companions in the Riga ghetto:
  <i>"Yidden, shreibt un fershreibt"</i> (Jews, write it all down).
  His words were heeded. Overnight, countless victims become
  chroniclers and historians in the ghettos, even in the death
  camps. Even members of the <i>Sonderkommandos</i>, those inmates
  forced to burn their fellow inmates' corpses before being burned
  in turn, left behind extraordinary documents. To testify became
  an obsession. They left us poems and letters, diaries and
  fragments of novels, some known throughout the world, others
  still unpublished.</p>

  <p>After the war we reassured ourselves that
  it would be enough to relate a single night in Treblinka, to tell
  of the cruelty, the senselessness of murder, and the outrage born
  of indifference: it would be enough to find the right word and
  the propitious moment to say it, to shake humanity out of its
  indifference and keep the torturer from torturing ever again. We
  thought it would be enough to read the world a poem written by a
  child in the Theresienstadt ghetto to ensure that no child
  anywhere would ever again have to endure hunger or fear. It would
  be enough to describe a death-camp "Selection", to prevent the
  human right to dignity from ever being violated again.</p>

  <p>We thought it would be enough to tell of
  the tidal wave of hatred which broke over the Jewish people for
  men everywhere to decide once and for all to put an end to hatred
  of anyone who is "different" - whether black or white, Jew or
  Arab, Christian or Moslem - anyone whose orientation differs
  politically, philosophically, sexually. A naive undertaking? Of
  course. But not without a certain logic.</p>

  <p>We tried. It was not easy. At first,
  because of the language; language failed us. We would have to
  invent a new vocabulary, for our own words were inadequate,
  anemic.</p>

  <p>And then too, the people around us refused
  to listen; and even those who listened refused to believe; and
  even those who believed could not comprehend. Of course they
  could not. Nobody could. The experience of the camps defies
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>Have we failed? I often think we have.</p>

  <p>If someone had told us in 1945 that in our
  lifetime religious wars would rage on virtually every continent,
  that thousands of children would once again be dying of
  starvation, we would not have believed it. Or that racism and
  fanaticism would flourish once again, we would not have believed
  it. Nor would we have believed that there would be governments
  that would deprive a man like Lech Walesa of his freedom to
  travel merely because he dares to dissent. And he is not alone.
  Governments of the Right and of the Left go much further,
  subjecting those who dissent, writers, scientists, intellectuals,
  to torture and persecution. How to explain this defeat of
  memory?</p>

  <p>How to explain any of it: the outrage of
  Apartheid which continues unabated. Racism itself is dreadful,
  but when it pretends to be legal, and therefore just, when a man
  like Nelson Mandela is imprisoned, it becomes even more
  repugnant. Without comparing Apartheid to Nazism and to its
  "final solution" - for that defies all comparison - one cannot
  help but assign the two systems, in their supposed legality, to
  the same camp. And the outrage of terrorism: of the hostages in
  Iran, the coldblooded massacre in the synagogue in Istanbul, the
  senseless deaths in the streets of Paris. Terrorism must be
  outlawed by all civilized nations - not explained or
  rationalized, but fought and eradicated. Nothing can, nothing
  will justify the murder of innocent people and helpless children.
  And the outrage of preventing men and women like Andrei Sakharov,
  Vladimir and Masha Slepak, Ida Nudel, Josef Biegun, Victor
  Brailowski, Zakhar Zonshein, and all the others known and unknown
  from leaving their country. And then there is Israel, which after
  two thousand years of exile and thirty-eight years of sovereignty
  still does not have peace. I would like to see this people, which
  is my own, able to establish the foundation for a constructive
  relationship with all its Arab neighbors, as it has done with
  Egypt. We must exert pressure on all those in power to come to
  terms.</p>

  <p>And here we come back to memory. We must
  remember the suffering of my people, as we must remember that of
  the Ethiopians, the Cambodians, the boat people, Palestinians,
  the Mesquite Indians, the Argentinian <i>"desaparecidos"</i> -
  the list seems endless.</p>

  <p>Let us remember Job who, having lost
  everything - his children, his friends, his possessions, and even
  his argument with God - still found the strength to begin again,
  to rebuild his life. Job was determined not to repudiate the
  creation, however imperfect, that God had entrusted to him.</p>

  <p>Job, our ancestor. Job, our contemporary.
  His ordeal concerns all humanity. Did he ever lose his faith? If
  so, he rediscovered it within his rebellion. He demonstrated that
  faith is essential to rebellion, and that hope is possible beyond
  despair. The source of his hope was memory, as it must be ours.
  Because I remember, I despair. Because I remember, I have the
  duty to reject despair. I remember the killers, I remember the
  victims, even as I struggle to invent a thousand and one reasons
  to hope.</p>

  <p>There may be times when we are powerless to
  prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to
  protest. The Talmud tells us that by saving a single human being,
  man can save the world. We may be powerless to open all the jails
  and free all the prisoners, but by declaring our solidarity with
  one prisoner, we indict all jailers. None of us is in a position
  to eliminate war, but it is our obligation to denounce it and
  expose it in all its hideousness. War leaves no victors, only
  victims. I began with the story of the Besht. And, like the
  Besht, mankind needs to remember more than ever. Mankind needs
  peace more than ever, for our entire planet, threatened by
  nuclear war, is in danger of total destruction. A destruction
  only man can provoke, only man can prevent. Mankind must remember
  that peace is not God's gift to his creatures, it is our gift to
  each other.</p>
