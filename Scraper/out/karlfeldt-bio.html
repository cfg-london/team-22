  <h1>Erik Axel Karlfeldt - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="karlfeldt.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Erik Axel Karlfeldt</b> (1864-1931) was
  born in Karlbo in the province of Dalekarlia. The name Karlfeldt,
  which he assumed in 1889, was derived from the name of his
  father's farm; his parents were Erik Janson and Anna Stina
  Jansdotter, both of whom came from old mining families. Karlfeldt
  attended schools at his birthplace and at V&auml;ster&aring;s,
  where he graduated in 1885. He studied at the University of
  Uppsala and received his degree in 1898. Between 1893 and
  1896, he taught at the private grammar school at Djursholm and at
  the school for adult education at Molkom. For a short time he
  worked for a Stockholm paper.<br>
  <br>
  After completing his studies, he held a position at the Royal
  Library in Stockholm for five years. In 1903 he was appointed
  librarian of the Agricultural Academy. Meanwhile he had found
  recognition as a poet, and in 1904 was elected to the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1931/karlfeldt-bio.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a>. In 1905 he became a member of the Nobel Institute of
  the Academy and in 1907 of the Nobel Committee. In 1912 he was
  appointed permanent secretary of the Academy and henceforth
  devoted all his time to this position (although he did remain a
  member of the Nobel Committee) and to his poetry. In 1917 he
  received an honorary doctorate from the University of
  Uppsala<br>
  <br>
  Individual poems of his had appeared even during his school days;
  his first collection <i>Vildmarks-och k&auml;rleksvisor</i>
  [Songs of the Wilderness and of Love] was printed in the autumn
  of 1895. It was followed by <i>Fridolins visor</i> (1898)
  [Fridolin's Song], <i>Fridolins lustg&aring;rd</i>
  (1901)[Fridolin's Pleasure Garden], Flora och Pomona (1906)
  [Flora and Pomona], <i>Flora och Bellona</i> (1918) [Flora and
  Bellona], and <i>H&ouml;sthorn</i> (1927) [The Horn of Autumn].
  Selections of his poetry, translated into English by Charles
  Wharton Stork under the title <i>Arcadia Borealis</i>, were
  published in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  Karlfeldt wrote a short life of the Swedish poet Lucidor (1909)
  and a necrologue for Carl Fredrik Dahlgren in the proceedings of
  the Swedish Academy. A collection of his speeches appeared in
  print shortly after his death in 1931.</p>
