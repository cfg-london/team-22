  <h1>Joseph Brodsky - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="brodsky.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Joseph Brodsky</b> was born in 1940, in
  Leningrad, and began writing poetry when he was eighteen. Anna
  Akhmatova soon recognized in the young poet the most gifted lyric
  voice of his generation. From March 1964 until November 1965,
  Brodsky lived in exile in the Arkhangelsk region of northern
  Russia; he had been sentenced to five years in exile at hard
  labor for "social parasitism," but did not serve out his
  term.<br>
  <br>
  Four of Brodsky's poems were published in Leningrad anthologies
  in 1966 and 1967, but most of his work has appeared only in the
  West. He is a splendid poetic translator and has translated into
  Russian, among others, the English metaphysical poets, and the
  Polish emigre poet, <a href="../1980/index.html">Czeslaw
  Milosz</a>. His own poetry has been translated into at least ten
  languages. <i>Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems</i> was published by
  Penguin Books in London (1973), and by Harper &amp; Row in New
  York (1974), translated by George L. Kline and with a foreword by
  W.H. Auden. A volume of Brodsky's selected poems translated in
  French has been published by Gallimard; a German translation, by
  Piper Verlag; and an Italian translation, by Mondadori and
  Adelphi. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux published Brodsky's acclaimed
  collection, <i>A Part of Speech</i>, in 1980.<br>
  <br>
  On June 4, 1972, Joseph Brodsky became an involuntary exile from
  his native country. After brief stays in Vienna and London, he
  came to the United States. He has been Poet-in-Residence and
  Visiting Professor at the University of Michigan, Queens College, Smith College,
  Columbia
  University, and Cambridge University in England. He currently is
  Five College Professor of Literature at Mount Holyoke
  College. In 1978, Brodsky was awarded an honorary degree of
  Doctor of Letters at Yale University, and on May 23, 1979, he was
  inducted as a member of the American Academy and Institute of
  Arts and Letters. In 1981, Brodsky was a recipient of the John D.
  and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's award for his works of
  "genius".<br>
  <br>
  In 1986, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux published <i>Less Than
  One</i>, a collection of Mr. Brodsky's essays on the arts and
  politics, which won the National Book Critic's Award for
  Criticism.<br>
  <br>
  In 1988 Farrar, Straus, and Giroux published a collection of his
  poetry, <i>To Urania</i>, and in 1992 a collection of essays
  about Venice, <i>Watermark</i>.</p>
