<h1>Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer - Biographical</h1>


<p><img src="transtromer.jpg" class="bio-img">Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer was born on April 15, 1931, the son of G&ouml;sta and Helmy,
 née Westerberg. His parents divorced when Thomas was three years old, so
 he grew up in Stockholm with his mother, who was a schoolteacher. They
 spent their summers at his maternal grandfather's pilot station on the island
 of Runmar&ouml; in the Stockholm archipelago, an environment that has always
 been an important starting point for his poetry, particularly <em>&Ouml;stersj&ouml;ar</em>, 1974 (<em>Baltics</em>, 1975). Here, among islets and skerries, he developed an early interest
 in geography and science, especially entomology. Because of his work in
 collecting insects, a newly discovered beetle now bears Transtr&ouml;mer's name:
 <em>Mordellistena transtroemeriana</em>.</p>


<p>As a teenager, Transtr&ouml;mer cultivated artistic interests. Music became essential
 to him; he began to play the piano, and he soon approached poetry.
His first poems were published in student magazines during the late 1940s.</p>
<p>After completing secondary school, Transtr&ouml;mer studied literary history
 (writing his graduation essay on Swedish Baroque poetry), history of
 religion and psychology at Stockholm University College (now Stockholm
 University). During the late 50s he worked at the Institute for Psychometrics
 at Stockholm University College, then as a psychologist at Roxtuna outside
 Link&ouml;ping, a youth correctional facility, and then from 1965 to 1990 as a psychologist
at the Labor Market Institute in Västerås.</p>

<p>During the 50s he also took a number of trips, for example to Iceland,
Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and Egypt. His later
worldwide travels, including many visits to the United States, mainly included
reading tours and contacts with his translators.</p>

<p>In 1958 Transtr&ouml;mer married Monica, n&eacute;e Bladh. Their two daughters,
Emma and Paula, were born in 1961 and 1964.</p>

<p>Right from his debut book <em>17 dikter</em> (17 poems) in 1954, Transtr&ouml;mer came
to be regarded as the leading Swedish poet of his generation. To a substantial
degree, he had already developed his distinctive language here: his original
and sharply contoured metaphors, nature mysticism, musicality, strictness
of form and natural diction - qualities that reappeared in his later books of
poetry.</p>

<p>His poetry incessantly moved closer to the secrets of existence - note such
titles as <em>Hemligheter på vägen</em>, 1958 (Secrets Along the Way), <em>Den halvfärdiga
himlen</em>, 1962 (The Half-Finished Heaven) and his latest book, <em>Den stora gåtan</em>,
2004 (<em>The Great Enigma</em>, 2006). His interest in what, in a true sense, is unspeakable
is nevertheless dictated by a desire for poetic concreteness - as if
the inaccessible regions of the mind and of existence can only be sensed or
touched with the exact instruments of sensuality.</p>

<p>Yet Transtr&ouml;mer's exploration of the complex nature of human identity
and his instantly constructed bridges between nature, the cosmos and the
dead never result in structured patterns or loud-voiced confessions. His
poetry is a tranquil affirmation of few words, but is nevertheless a form of
resistance to power, the market and media clichés.</p>

<p>Especially starting in the 60s, his poetry thus contains social and societal
motifs - for example in <em>Klanger och spår</em>, 1966 (see <em>Windows and Stones: Selected
Poems</em>, 1972) and M<em>&ouml;rkerseende</em>, 1970 (<em>Night Vision</em>, 1972). Experiences that
were based the poet's simultaneous career as a psychologist also influenced
many of his poems. He combines factual observation and a psychologist's
fascination with the metaphorical reality of dreams.</p>

<p>In later collections such as <em>F&ouml;r levande och d&ouml;da</em>, 1989 (<em>For the Living and the Dead</em>, 1994) and <em>Sorgegondolen</em>, 1996 (<em>The Sorrow Gondola</em>, 1997), death - though never an unfamiliar guest in his poetry - has demanded more
and more space, but not as an unambiguous threat. With trusting stillness,
Transtr&ouml;mer notes that life includes death, and vice versa. Sometimes his
poems thus possess a kind of non-dogmatic religiosity.</p>

<p>Since the Swedish language can not be read by more than about one
thousandth of the world's population, the skillfulness of his translators has
been especially vital. Since efforts to translate his works began in earnest
during the 60s, Transtr&ouml;mer's international reputation has constantly gained
strength. Today his works are available to readers of some sixty languages.</p>

<p>If anyone should be mentioned especially in this context, one cannot
ignore the contributions of Transtr&ouml;mer's American friend and fellow poet
Robert Bly in introducing and translating his work. The two have interpreted
each other's poetry, and much of their copious correspondence has been
published in <em>Air Mail</em>, 2001.</p>

<p>In 1990 Transtr&ouml;mer suffered a stroke that paralyzed his right side. He
almost entirely lost his ability to speak. Since then, writing has taken him
longer, although he has published some poetry collections and a memoir,
 <em>Minnena ser mig</em>, 1993 (<em>Memories Look at Me</em>, 2011). Transtr&ouml;mer has increasingly
embraced short forms of poetry such as haiku, which only reinforce his
focus on concentration of expression. But even before he became ill, he took
plenty of time to write his vivid, precise poetry. Some poems took him years
to complete.</p>

<p>Transtr&ouml;mer's lifelong interest in music, which has left significant traces in
his writings, has actually deepened since his stroke. Several composers have
been inspired by his poetry and have set it to music, as well as dedicating to
him a number of newly composed piano works for the left hand.</p>

<p>Between 1965 and 2000, Transtr&ouml;mer lived in Västerås, Sweden. In 1997
the Municipality of Västerås established the Transtr&ouml;mer Prize, which rewards outstanding poetic writing. Since 2000 he has lived in his childhood
city of Stockholm.</p>
