  <h1>Otto Stern - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stern.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Otto Stern</b> was born in Sorau,
  Upper Silesia, Germany, on February 17, 1888. In 1892 he moved
  with his parents to Breslau, where he attended high school. He
  began to study physical chemistry in 1906, receiving his Ph.D.
  degree from the University of Breslau in 1912. In the same year
  he joined Einstein at the University of Prague and later followed
  him to the University of Zurich, where he became Privatdocent
  of Physical Chemistry at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische
  Hochschule in 1913.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 he went to the University of Frankfurt am Main as
  Privatdocent of Theoretical Physics, remaining there until 1921,
  except for a period of military service. From 1921 to 1922 he was
  Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of
  Rostock, becoming, in 1923, Professor of Physical Chemistry
  and Director of the laboratory at the University of
  Hamburg, where he remained until 1933. In that year he moved
  to the United States, being appointed Research Professor of
  Physics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh where
  he remained until 1945, then becoming professor emeritus.<br>
  <br>
  His earliest work was in the field of theoretical physics,
  especially that of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory,
  on which he has published important papers. After 1919, his
  attention was directed more to experimental physics. His
  development and application of the molecular beam method proved
  to be a powerful tool for investigating the properties of
  molecules, atoms and atomic nuclei. One of the early applications
  of this was the experimental verification of Maxwell's law of
  velocity distribution in gases. He collaborated with Gerlach to
  work on the deflection of atoms by the action of magnetic fields
  on their magnetic moment, then went on to measure the magnetic
  moments of sub-atomic particles, including the proton. His work
  on the production of interference by rays of hydrogen and helium
  was a striking demonstration of the wave nature of atoms and
  molecules.<br>

  Dr. Stern was awarded an LL.D. by the University of
  California, Berkeley, 1930. He is a member of the National Academy of
  Sciences (USA), the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
  and the Philosophical Society. He holds foreign membership of the
  Royal Danish Academy of Sciences. He lives at Berkeley,
  California.</p>
