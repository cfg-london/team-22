  Jimmy Carter (James Earl Carter, Jr.), thirty-ninth
  president of the United States, was born October 1, 1924, in the
  small farming town of Plains, Georgia, and grew up in the nearby
  community of Archery. His father, James Earl Carter, Sr., was a
  farmer and businessman; his mother, Lillian Gordy, a registered
  nurse.</p>

  <p>He was educated in the Plains public
  schools, attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of
  Technology, and received a B.S. degree from the United States Naval
  Academy in 1946. In the Navy he became a submariner, serving
  in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of
  lieutenant. Chosen by Admiral Hyman Rickover for the nuclear
  submarine program, he was assigned to Schenectady, N.Y., where he
  took graduate work at Union College in reactor technology and nuclear
  physics, and served as senior officer of the pre-commissioning
  crew of the Seawolf, the second nuclear submarine.</p>

  <p>On July 7, 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith
  of Plains. When his father died in 1953, he resigned his naval
  commission and returned with his family to Georgia. He took over
  the Carter farms, and he and Rosalynn operated Carter's Warehouse
  in Plains, a general-purpose seed and farm supply company. He
  quickly became a leader of the community, serving on county
  boards supervising education, the hospital authority, and the
  library. In 1962 he won election to the Georgia Senate. He lost
  his first gubernatorial campaign in 1966, but won the next
  election, becoming Georgia's 76th governor on January 12, 1971.
  He was the Democratic National Committee campaign chairman for
  the 1974 congressional and gubernatorial elections.</p>

  <p>On December 12, 1974, he announced his
  candidacy for president of the United States. He won his party's
  nomination on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National
  Convention, and was elected president on November 2, 1976.</p>
