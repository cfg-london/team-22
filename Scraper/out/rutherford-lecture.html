  <h2>The Chemical Nature of the Alpha Particles from Radioactive
  Substances</h2>

  <p>The study of the properties of the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays has played a notable part in
  the development of radioactivity and has been instrumental in
  bringing to light a number of facts and relationships of the
  first importance. With increase of experimental knowledge there
  has been a growing recognition that a large part of radioactive
  phenomena is intimately connected with the expulsion of the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles. In this lecture an
  attempt will be made to give a brief historical account of the
  development of our knowledge of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays and to trace the long and arduous path
  trodden by the experimenter in the attempts to solve the
  difficult question of the chemical nature of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles. <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays
  were first observed in 1899 as a special type of radiation and
  during the last six years there has been a persistent attack on
  this great problem, which has finally yielded to the assault when
  the resources of the attack seemed almost exhausted.</p>

  <p>Shortly after his discovery of the
  radiating power of uranium by the photographic method, Becquerel
  showed that the radiation from uranium like the R&ouml;ntgen-rays
  possessed the property of discharging an electrified body. In a
  detailed investigation of this property, I examined the effect on
  the rate of discharge by placing successive layers of thin
  aluminium foil over the surface of a layer of uranium oxide and
  was led to the conclusion that two types of radiation of very
  different penetrating power were present. The conclusions at that
  period were summed up as follows:</p>

  <p>"These experiments show that the uranium,
  radiation is complex and that there are present at least two
  distinct types of radiation - one that is very readily absorbed,
  which will be termed for convenience the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-radiation, and the other of a more penetrative
  character, which will be termed the <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-radiation."<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>
  When other radioactive substances were discovered, it was seen
  that the types of radiation present were analogous to the
  <font face="Symbol">b</font>- and <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays of uranium and when a still more
  penetrating type of radiation from radium was discovered by
  Villard, the term <font face="Symbol">g</font>-rays was applied
  to them. The names thus given soon came into general use as a
  convenient nomenclature for the three distinct types of radiation
  emitted from uranium, radium, thorium, and actinium. On account
  of their insignificant penetrating power, the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays were at first considered of little
  importance and attention was mainly directed to the more
  penetrating <font face="Symbol">b</font>-rays. With the advent of
  active preparations of radium, Giesel in 1899 showed that the
  <font face="Symbol">b</font>-rays from this substance were easily
  deflected by a magnetic field in the same direction as a stream
  of cathode rays and consequently appeared to be a stream of
  projected particles carrying a negative charge. The proof of the
  identity of the <font face="Symbol">b</font>-particles with the
  electrons constituting the cathode rays was completed in 1900 by
  Becquerel, who showed that the <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-particles from radium had about the same small
  mass as the electrons and were projected at a speed comparable
  with the velocity of light. Time does not allow me to enter into
  the later work of Kaufmann and others on this subject, which has
  greatly extended our knowledge of the constitution and mass of
  electrons.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, further investigation had
  disclosed that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles
  produced most of the ionization observed in the neighbourhood of
  an unscreened radioactive substance, and that most of the energy
  radiated was in the form of <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays. It
  was calculated by Rutherford and McClung in 1901 that one gram of
  radium radiated a large amount of energy in the form of
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays.</p>

  <p>The increasing recognition of the
  importance of the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays in
  radioactive phenomena led to attempts to determine the nature of
  this easily absorbed type of radiation. Strutt (<a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Lord Rayleigh</a>) in 1901
  and Sir William Crookes in 1902 suggested that they might
  possibly prove to be projected particles carrying a positive
  charge. I independently arrived at the same conclusion from
  consideration of a variety of evidence. If this were the case,
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays should be deflected by a
  magnetic field. Preliminary work showed that the deflection was
  very slight if it occurred at all. Experiments were continued at
  intervals over a period of two years and it was not until 1902,
  when a preparation of radium of activity 19,000 was available,
  that I was able to show conclusively that the particles were
  deflected by a magnetic field, though in a very minute degree
  compared with the <font face="Symbol">b</font>-rays. This showed
  that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays consisted of projected
  charged particles while the direction of deflection indicated
  that each particle carried a positive charge. The <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles were shown to be deflected also by an
  electric field and from the magnitude of the deflection, it was
  deduced that the velocity of the swiftest particles was about 2.5
  x 10<sup>9</sup> cm per second, or one-twelfth the velocity of
  light, while the value of <i>e/m</i> - the ratio of the charge
  carried by the particle to its mass - was found to be 5,000
  electromagnetic units. Now it is known from the data of the
  electrolysis of water that the value of <i>e/m</i> for the
  hydrogen atom is 9,650. If the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle carried the same positive charge as
  the unit fundamental charge of the hydrogen atom, it was seen
  that the mass of the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle was
  about twice that of the hydrogen atom. On account of the
  complexity of the rays it was recognized that the results were
  only approximate, but the experiments indicated clearly that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle was atomic in mass and
  might prove ultimately to be either a hydrogen or a helium atom
  or the atom of some unknown element of light atomic weight. These
  experiments were repeated by Des Coudres in 1903 with similar
  results, while <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Becquerel</a> showed the
  deflection of the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays in a magnetic
  field by the photographic method.</p>

  <p>This proof that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles consisted of actual charged atoms of
  matter projected with an enormous velocity at once threw a flood
  of light on radioactive processes, in particular upon another
  important series of investigations which were being
  contemporaneously carried on in the Laboratory at Montreal in
  conjunction with Mr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/index.html">F. Soddy</a>. Had time
  permitted, it would have been of interest to consider in some
  detail the nature of these researches which placed on a firm
  foundation the now generally accepted "transformation theory" of
  radioactivity. From a close examination of the substances
  thorium, radium, and uranium, Rutherford and Soddy had reached
  the conclusion that radioactive bodies were in a state of
  transformation, as a result of which a number of new substances
  were produced entirely distinct in chemical and physical
  character from the parent element. From the independence of the
  rate of transformation of chemical and physical agencies, it was
  recognized that the transformation was atomic and not molecular
  in character. Each of these new bodies was shown to lose its
  radioactive properties according to a definite law. Even before
  the discovery of the material nature of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays, it had been considered probable that the
  radiation from any particular substance accompanied the breaking
  up of its atoms. The proof that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle was an ejected atom of matter at once
  strengthened this conclusion and at the same time gave a more
  concrete and definite representation of the processes occurring
  in radioactive matter. The point of view reached by us at that
  time is clearly seen from the following quotation, which with
  little alteration holds good today. "The results obtained so far
  point to the conclusion that the beginning of the succession of
  chemical changes taking place in radioactive bodies is due to the
  emission of the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays, i.e. the
  projection of a heavy charged mass from the atom. The portion
  left behind is unstable, undergoing further chemical changes
  which are again accompanied by the emission of <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-rays, and in some cases also of <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-rays.</p>

  <p>The power possessed by the radioactive
  bodies of apparently spontaneously projecting large masses with
  enormous velocities supports the view that the atoms of these
  substances are made up, in part at least, of rapidly rotating or
  oscillating systems of heavy charged bodies, large compared with
  the electron. The sudden escape of these masses from their orbit
  may be due either to the action of internal forces or external
  forces of which we have at present no knowledge."<a href=
  "#not2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

  <p>Consider for a moment the explanation of
  the changes in radium. A minute fraction of the radium atoms is
  supposed each second to become unstable, breaking up with
  explosive violence. A fragment of the atom - and <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle - is ejected at a high speed, and the
  residue of the atom, which has a lighter weight than before,
  becomes an atom of a new substance, the radium emanation. The
  atoms of this substance are far more unstable than those of
  radium and explode again with the expulsion of an <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle. As a result the atom of radium A
  makes its appearance and the process of disintegration thus
  started continues through a long series of stages.</p>

  <p>I can only refer in passing here to the
  large amount of work done by various experimenters in analysing
  the long series of transformations of radium and thorium and
  actinium; the linking up of radium with uranium and the discovery
  by Boltwood of the long looked-for and elusive parent of radium,
  viz. ionium. This phase of the subject is of unusual interest and
  importance but has only an indirect bearing on the subject of my
  lecture. It has been shown that the great majority of the
  transition elements produced by the transformation of uranium and
  thorium break up with the expulsion of <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles. A few, however, throw off only
  <font face="Symbol">b</font>-particles, while some are "rayless",
  i.e. undergo transformation without the expulsion of high-speed
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>- and <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-particles. It is necessary to suppose that in
  these latter cases the atoms break up with the expulsion of
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles at a speed too low to be
  detected, or, as is more probable, undergo a process of atomic
  rearrangement without the expulsion of material particles of
  atomic dimensions.</p>

  <p>Another striking property of radium was
  soon seen to be connected with the expulsion of <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles. In 1903 <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">P. Curie</a> and Laborde
  showed that radium was a self-heating substance and was always
  above the temperature of the surrounding air. It seemed probable
  from the beginning that the effect must be the result of the
  heating effect due to the impact of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles on the radium. Consider for a moment
  a pellet of radium enclosed in a tube. The <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles are shot out in great numbers equally
  from all parts of the radium and in consequence of their slight
  penetrating power are all stopped in the radium itself or by the
  walls of the tube. The energy of motion of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles is converted into heat. On this view
  the radium is subject to a fierce and unceasing bombardment by
  its own particles and is heated by its own radiation. This was
  confirmed by the work of Rutherford and Barnes in 1903, who
  showed that three quarters of the heating effect of radium was
  not directly due to the radium but to its product, the emanation,
  and that each of the different substances produced in radium gave
  out heat in proportion to the energy of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled from it. These experiments
  brought clearly to light the enormous energy, compared with the
  weight of matter involved, which was emitted during the
  transformation of the emanation. It can readily be calculated
  that one kilogram of the radium-emanation and its products would
  initially emit energy at the rate of 14,000 horse-power, and
  during its life would give off energy corresponding to about
  80,000 horse-power for one day.</p>

  <p>It was thus clear that the heating effect
  of radium was mainly a secondary phenomenon resulting from the
  bombardment by its own <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles. It
  was evident also that all the radioactive substances must emit
  heat in proportion to the number and energy of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled per second.</p>

  <p>We must now consider another discovery of
  the first importance. In discussing the consequences of the
  disintegration theory, Rutherford and Soddy drew attention to the
  fact that any stable substances produced during the
  transformation of the radio-elements should be present in
  quantity in the radioactive minerals, where the processes of
  transformation have been taking place for ages. This suggestion
  was first put forward in 1902.<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>
  "In the light of these results and the view that has already been
  put forward of the nature of radioactivity, the speculation
  naturally arises whether the presence of helium in minerals and
  its invariable association with uranium and thorium, may not be
  connected with their radioactivity, and again<a href=
  "#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>. "It is therefore to be expected that if
  any of the unknown ultimate products of the changes of a
  radioactive element are gaseous, they would be found occluded,
  possibly in considerable quantities, in the natural minerals
  containing that element. This lends support to the suggestion
  already put forwards, that possibly helium is an ultimate product
  of the disintegration of one of the radioactive elements, since
  it is only found in radioactive minerals."</p>

  <p>It was at the same time recognized that it
  was quite possible that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle
  itself might prove to be a helium atom. As only weak preparations
  were then available, it did not seem feasible at that time to
  test whether helium was produced from radium. About a year later,
  thanks to Dr. Giesel of Braunschweig, preparations of pure radium
  bromide were made available to experimenters. Using 30 milligrams
  of Giesel's preparation, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Sir William Ramsay</a> and
  Soddy in 1903 were able to show conclusively that helium was
  present in radium some months old and that the emanation produced
  helium. This discovery was of the greatest interest and
  importance, for it brought to light that in addition to a series
  of transition elements, radium also gave rise in its
  transformation to a stable form of matter.</p>

  <p>A fundamental question immediately arose as
  to the position of helium in the scheme of transformations of
  radium. Was the helium the end or final product of transformation
  of radium or did it arise at some other stage or stages? In a
  letter to <i>Nature</i><a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> I pointed
  out that probably helium was derived from the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles fired out by the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-ray products of radium and made an approximate
  estimate of the rate of production of helium by radium. It was
  calculated that the amount of helium produced per gram of radium
  should lie between 20 and 200 cubic millimetres per year and
  probably nearer the latter estimate. The data available for
  calculation at that time were imperfect, but it is of interest to
  note that the rate of production of helium recently found by Sir
  James Dewar, in 1908, viz. 134 cubic millimetres per year, is not
  far from the value calculated as most probable at that time.</p>

  <p>These estimates of the rate of production
  of helium were later modified as new and more accurate data
  became available. In 1905, I measured the charge carried by the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles from a thin film of
  radium. Assuming that each <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle
  carried the ionic charge measured by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a>, I showed
  that 6.2 x 10<sup>10</sup> <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles
  were expelled per second per gram of radium itself and four times
  this number when radium was in equilibrium with its three
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-ray products. The rate of production
  of helium calculated on these data was 240 cubic millimetres per
  gram per year.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, by the admirable
  researches of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html">Bragg</a> and
  Kleeman in 1904, our knowledge of the character of the absorption
  of the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles by matter had been
  much extended. It had long been known that the absorption of
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles by matter was different in
  many respects from that of the <font face="Symbol">b</font>-rays.
  Bragg showed that these differences arose from the fact that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle, on account of its great
  energy of motion, was not deflected from its path like the
  <font face="Symbol">b</font>-particle, but travelled in nearly a
  straight line, ionizing the molecules in its path. From a thin
  film of matter of one kind, the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles were all projected at the same speed
  and lost their power of producing ionization suddenly, after
  traversing a certain definite distance of air. The velocity of
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles in this view were
  reduced by their passage through matter by equal amounts. These
  conclusions of Bragg were confirmed by experiments I made by the
  photographic method. As a source of rays, a thin film of radium
  C, deposited from the radium-emanation on a thin wire, was used.
  By examining the deflection of the rays in a magnetic field, it
  was found that the rays were homogeneous and were expelled from
  the surface of the wire at an identical speed. By passing the
  rays through a screen of mica or aluminium, it was found that the
  velocity of all the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles were
  reduced by the same amount and the issuing beam was still
  homogeneous.</p>

  <p>A remarkable result was noted. All
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles apparently lost their
  characteristic properties of ionization, phosphorescence and
  photographic action, at exactly the same point while they were
  still moving at a speed of about 9,000 kilometres per second. At
  this critical speed, the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle
  suddenly vanishes from our ken and can no longer be followed by
  the methods of observation at our command.</p>

  <p>The use of a homogeneous source of
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-rays like radium C at once suggested
  itself as affording a basis for a more accurate determination of
  the value of <i>e/m</i> for the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle and for seeing whether the value was
  consistent with the view that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle was a charged atom of helium. In the
  course of a long series of experiments, I proved that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles, whether expelled from
  radium, thorium or actinium, were identical in mass and must
  consist of the same kind of matter.</p>

  <p>The velocity of expulsion of the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles from different kinds of
  active matter varied over comparatively narrow limits but the
  value of <i>e/m</i> was constant and equal to 5,070. This value
  was not very different from the one originally found. A
  difficulty at once arose in interpreting this result. We have
  seen that the value of <i>e/m</i> for the hydrogen atom is 9,650.
  If the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle carried the same
  positive charge as the hydrogen atom, the value of e/m for the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle would indicate that its
  mass was twice that of the hydrogen atom, i.e. equal to the mass
  of a hydrogen molecule. It seemed very improbable that hydrogen
  should be ejected in a molecular and not an atomic state as a
  result of the atomic explosion. If, however, the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle carried a charge equal to twice that
  of the hydrogen atom, the mass of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle would work out at nearly four, i.e. a
  mass nearly equal to that of the atom of helium.</p>

  <p>I suggested that, in all probability, the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle was a helium atom which
  carried two unit charges. On this view, every radioactive
  substance which emitted <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles
  must give rise to helium. This at once offered an explanation of
  the fact observed by Debierne that actinium as well as radium
  produced helium. It was pointed out that the presence of a double
  charge of helium-atom was not altogether improbable for reasons
  to be given later (p. 138).</p>

  <p>While the evidence as a whole strongly
  supported the view that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle
  was a helium atom, it was found exceedingly difficult to obtain a
  decisive experimental proof of the relation. If it could be shown
  experimentally that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle did
  in reality carry two unit charges, the proof of the relation
  would be greatly strengthened. For this purpose an electrical
  method was devised by Rutherford and Geiger for counting directly
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled from a
  radioactive substance. The ionization produced in a gas by a
  single <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle is exceedingly small
  and would be difficult to detect electrically except by a very
  refined method. Recourse was had to an automatic method of
  magnifying the ionization produced by an <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle. For this purpose it was arranged that
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles should be fired
  through a small opening into a vessel containing air or other gas
  at a low pressure, exposed to an electric field near the sparking
  value. Under these conditions the ions produced by the passage of
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle through the gas
  generate a large number of fresh ions by collision. In this way
  it was found possible to magnify the electrical effect due to an
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle several thousand times. The
  entrance of an <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle into the
  testing vessel was then indicated by a sudden deflection of the
  electrometer needle. This method was developed into an accurate
  method of counting the number of <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles fired in a known time through the
  small aperture of the testing vessel. From this was deduced the
  total number of <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled
  per second from any thin film of radioactive matter. In this way
  it was shown that 3.4 x 10<sup>10</sup> <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles are expelled per second from one gram
  of radium itself and from each of its <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-ray products in equilibrium with it.</p>

  <p>The correctness of this method was
  indicated by another, quite distinct method of counting. Sir
  William Crookes and Elster and Geitel had shown that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles falling on a screen of
  phosphorescent zinc sulphide produced a number of scintillations.
  Using specially prepared screens, Rutherford and Geiger counted
  the number of these scintillations per second with the aid of a
  microscope. It was found that, within the limit of experimental
  error, the number of scintillations per second on a screen agreed
  with the number of <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles
  impinging on it, counted by the electrical method. It was thus
  clear that each <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle produced a
  visible scintillation on the screen, and that either the
  electrical or the optical method could be used for counting the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles. Apart from the purpose
  for which these experiments were made, the results are of great
  interest and importance, for it is the first time that it has
  been found possible to detect a single atom of matter by its
  electrical and optical effect. This is of course only possible
  because of the great velocity of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle.</p>

  <p>Knowing the number of <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled from radium from the
  counting experiment, the charge carried by each <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle was determined by measuring the total
  positive charge carried by all the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles expelled. It was found that each
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle carried a positive charge
  of 9.3 x 10<sup>-10</sup> electrostatic units. From a
  consideration of the experimental evidence of the charge carried
  by the ions in gases, it was concluded that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle did carry two unit charges, and that
  the unit charge carried by the hydrogen atom was equal to 4.65 x
  10<sup>-10</sup> units. From a comparison of the known value of
  e/m for the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle with that of
  the hydrogen atom, it follows that an <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle is a projected atom of helium carrying
  two charges, or, to express it in another way, the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle, after its charge is neutralized, is a
  helium atom.</p>

  <p>The data obtained from the counting
  experiments allow us to calculate simply the magnitude of a
  number of important radioactive quantities. It was found that the
  calculated values of the life of radium, of the volume of the
  emanation, and of the heating effect of radium were in excellent
  agreement with the values found experimentally. A test of the
  correctness of these methods of calculation was forthcoming
  shortly after the publication of these results. Rutherford and
  Geiger calculated, on the assumption that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle was a helium atom, that one gram of
  radium in equilibrium should produce a volume of 158 cubic
  millimetres of helium per year. Sir James Dewar in 1908 carried
  out a long experimental investigation on the rate of production
  of helium by radium, and showed that one gram of radium in
  equilibrium produced about 134 cubic millimetres per year.
  Considering the difficulty of the investigation, the agreement
  between the experimental and calculated values is very good and
  is strong evidence in support of the identity of the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle with a helium atom.</p>

  <p>While the whole train of evidence we have
  considered indicates with little room for doubt that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle is a projected helium atom,
  there was still wanting a decisive and incontrovertible proof of
  the relationship. It might be argued, for example, that the
  helium atom appeared as a result of the disintegration of the
  radium atom in the same way as the atom of the emanation and had
  no direct connection with the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle. If one helium atom were liberated at
  the same time that an <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle was
  expelled, experiment and calculation might still agree and yet
  the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle might be an atom of
  hydrogen or of some unknown substance.</p>

  <p>In order to remove this possible objection,
  it is necessary to show that the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particles, collected quite independently of the
  active matter from which they are expelled, give rise to helium.
  With this purpose in view some experiments were recently (1908)
  made by Rutherford and Royds. A large quantity of emanation was
  forced into a glass tube which had walls so thin that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles were fired right through
  them, though the walls were impervious to the emanation itself.
  The <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles were projected into
  the glass walls of an outer sealed vessel and were gradually
  released into the exhausted space between the emanation tube and
  the outer vessel. After some days a bright spectrum of helium was
  observed in the outer vessel. There is, however, one objection to
  this experiment. It might be possible that the helium observed
  had diffused through the thin glass walls from the emanation.
  This objection was removed by showing that no trace of helium
  appeared, when the emanation was replaced by a larger volume of
  helium itself. We may thus confidently conclude that the
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles themselves give rise to
  helium, and are atoms of helium. Further experiments showed that
  when the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles were fired
  through the glass walls into a thin sheet of lead or tin, helium
  could always be obtained from the metals after a few hours'
  bombardment.</p>

  <p>Considering the evidence together, we
  conclude that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle is a
  projected atom of helium, which has, or in some way during its
  flight acquires, two unit charges of positive electricity. It is
  somewhat unexpected that the atom of a monatomic gas like helium
  should carry a double charge. It must not however be forgotten
  that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particle is released at a
  high speed as a result of an intense atomic explosion, and
  plunges through the molecules of matter in its path. Such
  conditions are exceptionably favourable to the release of loosely
  attached electrons from the atomic system. If the <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font>-particle can lose two electrons in this way,
  the double positive charge is explained.</p>

  <p>We have seen that there is every reason to
  believe that the <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles, so
  freely expelled from the great majority of radioactive
  substances, are identical in mass and constitution and must
  consist of atoms of helium. We are consequently driven to the
  conclusion that the atoms of the primary radioactive elements
  like uranium and thorium must be built up in part at least of
  atoms of helium. These atoms are released at definite stages of
  the transformations at a rate independent of control by
  laboratory forces. There is good reason to believe that in the
  majority of cases, a single helium atom is expelled during the
  atomic explosion. This is certainly the case for radium itself
  and its series of products. On the other hand, Bronson has drawn
  attention to certain cases, viz. the emanations of actinium and
  of thorium, where apparently two and three atoms of helium
  respectively are expelled at one time. No doubt these exceptions
  will receive careful investigation in the future. It is of
  interest to note that uranium itself appears to expel two
  <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles for one from each of its
  products. Knowing the number of atoms of helium expelled from the
  atom of each product, we can at once calculate the atomic weights
  of the products. For example, in the uranium-ionium-radium
  series, uranium expels two <font face="Symbol">a</font>-particles
  and each of the six following <font face="Symbol">a</font>-ray
  products one, i.e. eight in all. Taking the atomic weight of
  uranium as 238.5, the atomic weight of ionium should be 230.5, of
  radium 226.5, of the emanation 222.5, and so on. It is of
  interest to note that the atomic weight of radium deduced in this
  way is in close agreement with the latest experimental values.
  The atomic weight of the end-product of radium, resulting from
  the transformation of radium F (polonium) should be 238.5 - 8 x
  4= 206.5, or a value close to that for lead. Long ago, Boltwood
  suggested from examination of analyses of old uranium minerals,
  that lead was in all probability a transformation product of the
  uranium-radium series. The coincidence of numbers is certainly
  striking, but a direct proof of the production of lead from
  radium will be required before this conclusion can be considered
  as definitely established.</p>

  <p>It is very remarkable that a chemically
  inert element like helium should play such a prominent part in
  the constitution of the atomic systems of uranium and thorium and
  radium. It may well be that this property of helium of forming
  complex atoms is in some way connected with its inability to
  enter into ordinary chemical combinations. It must not be
  forgotten that uranium and thorium and each of their
  transformation products must be regarded as distinct chemical
  elements in the ordinary sense. They differ from ordinary
  elements in the comparative instability of their atomic systems.
  The atoms break up spontaneously with great violence, expelling
  in many cases an atom of helium at a high speed. All the evidence
  is against the view that uranium or thorium or radium can be
  regarded as an ordinary molecular compound of helium with some
  known or unknown element, which breaks up into helium. The
  character of the radioactive transformations and their
  independence of temperature and other agencies have no analogy in
  ordinary chemical changes.</p>

  <p>Apart from their radioactivity and high
  atomic weight, uranium, thorium, and radium show no specially
  distinctive chemical behaviour. Radium for example is closely
  allied in general chemical properties to barium. It is
  consequently not unreasonable to suppose that other elements may
  be built up in part of helium, although the absence of
  radioactivity may prevent us from obtaining any definite proof.
  On this view, it may prove significant that the atomic weights of
  many elements differ by four - the atomic weight of helium-or a
  multiple of four. Time is too limited to discuss in greater
  detail these and other interesting questions which have been
  raised by the proof of the chemical nature of the
  or-particle.<a href="#not*">*</a></p>
