  <h1>Aage N. Bohr - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bohr.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Copenhagen on June 19,
  1922, as the fourth son of <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels
  Bohr</a> and Margrethe Bohr (n&eacute;e N&oslash;rlund). During my
  early childhood, my parents lived at the Institute for Theoretical
  Physics (now the Niels Bohr Institute), and the remarkable
  generation of scientists who came to join my father in his work
  became for us children Uncle Kramers, Uncle Klein, Uncle Nishina,
  Uncle Heisenberg, Uncle Pauli, etc. When I was about ten years
  old, my parents moved to the mansion at Carlsberg, where they
  were hosts for widening circles of scholars, artists, and persons
  in public life.<br>
  <br>
  I went to school for twelve years at Sortedam Gymnasium (H.
  Adler's f&aelig;ellesskole) and am indebted to many of my
  teachers, both in the humanities and in the sciences, for
  inspiration and encouragement.<br>
  <br>
  I began studying physics at the University of Copenhagen in 1940 (a few
  months after the German occupation of Denmark). By that time, I
  had already begun to assist my father with correspondence, with
  his writing of articles of a general epistemological character,
  and gradually also in connection with his work in physics. In
  those years, he was concerned partly with problems of nuclear
  physics and partly with problems relating to the penetration of
  atomic particles through matter.<br>
  <br>
  In October 1943, my father had to flee Denmark to avoid arrest by
  the Nazis, and the whole family managed to escape to Sweden,
  where we were warmly received. Shortly afterwards, my father
  proceeded to England, and I followed after him. He became
  associated with the atomic energy project and, during the two
  years until we returned to Denmark, in August 1945, we travelled
  together spending extensive periods in London, Washington, and
  Los Alamos. I was acting as his assistant and secretary and had
  the opportunity daily to share in his work and thoughts. We were
  members of the British team, and my official position was that of
  a junior scientific officer employed by the Department of
  Scientific and Industrial Research in London. In another context,
  I have attempted to describe some of the events of those years
  and my father's efforts relating to the prospects raised by the
  atomic weapons<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  On my return to Denmark, I resumed my studies at the University
  and obtained a master's degree in 1946. My thesis was concerned
  with some aspects of atomic stopping problems.<br>
  <br>
  For the spring term of 1948, I was a member of the Institute for Advanced
  Study in Princeton. On a visit during that period to Columbia
  University and through discussions with professor <a href=
  "../1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a>, I became interested in a
  newly discovered effect in the hyperfine structure in deuterium.
  This led on to my association with Columbia University from
  January 1949 to August 1950. As described in my lecture, this was
  for me a very fruitful association.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after my return to Copenhagen, I began the close cooperation
  with Ben Mottelson which has continued ever since. The main
  direction of our work is described in the lectures included in
  the present volume. During the last fifteen years, a major part
  of our efforts has been connected with the attempt to present the
  status of our understanding of nuclear structure in a monograph,
  of which Volume I (Single-Particle Motion) appeared in 1969, and
  Volume II (Nuclear Deformations) in 1975. We feel that in our
  cooperation, we have been able to exploit possibilities that lie
  in a dialogue between kindred spirits that have been attuned
  through a long period of common experience and jointly developed
  understanding. It has been our good fortune to work closely
  together with colleagues at the Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita, including
  the many outstanding scientists who have come from all parts of
  the world and have so greatly enriched the scientific atmosphere
  and personal contacts.<br>
  <br>
  I have been connected with the Niels Bohr Institute since the
  completion of my university studies, first as a research fellow
  and from 1956 as a professor of physics at the University of
  Copenhagen. After the death of my father in 1962, I followed him
  as director of the Institute until 1970.<br>
  <br>
  For our whole circle, it has been a challenge to exploit the
  opportunities provided by the traditions of the Institute, of
  which I would like especially to mention two aspects. One
  concerns the fruitful interplay between experimental and
  theoretical investigations. The other concerns the promotion of
  international cooperation as a vital factor in the development of
  science itself and also as a means to strengthen the mutual
  knowledge and understanding between nations.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957, Nordita (Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk Atomfysik) was
  founded on the premises of the Niels Bohr Institute, and the two
  institutes operate in close association. I have been a member of
  the Board of Nordita from 1957 until 1975, and since then
  director of this institute.<br>
  <br>
  In March 1950, in New York City, I was married to Marietta
  Soffer. We have three children, Vilhelm, Tomas, and Margrethe.
  Both for my wife and myself, the personal friendships that have
  grown out of scientific contacts with colleagues from many
  different countries have been an important part of our lives, and
  the travels we have made together in connection with the
  world-wide scientific co-operation have given us rich treasures
  of experiences.</p>
