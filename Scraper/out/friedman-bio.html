  <h1>Jerome I. Friedman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="friedman.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Chicago,
  Illinois on March 28, 1930, the second of two children of Selig
  and Lillian Friedman, nee Warsaw, who were immigrants from
  Russia. My father came to the United States in 1913 and later
  served in the U.S. Army Artillery Corps in World War I. After the
  war he was employed by the Singer Sewing Machine Co. and later
  established his own business, repairing and selling used
  commercial and home sewing machines. My mother arrived in the
  United States in 1914 on one of the last voyages of the
  Lusitania. She supported herself until she was married by working
  in a garment factory. My parents had little formal education,
  except for courses in English after they arrived in the United
  States, but were self taught and had wide ranging interests. My
  father was an avid reader, having interests in science and
  political history, and our home was filled with books. My mother,
  who had a lovely singing voice, loved music and, in particular,
  opera. The education of my brother and myself was of paramount
  importance to my parents, and in addition to their strong
  encouragement, they were prepared to make any sacrifice to
  further our intellectual development. When there were financial
  difficulties they still managed to provide us with music and art
  lessons. They greatly respected scholarship in itself, but they
  also impressed upon us that there were great opportunities
  available for those who were well educated. I received my primary
  and secondary education in Chicago. As I very much liked to draw
  and paint as a child, I entered a special art program in high
  school, which was very much like being in an art school imbedded
  in a regular high school curriculum. While I always had some
  interest in science, I developed a strong interest in physics
  when I was in high school as a result of reading a short book
  entitled <i>Relativity</i>, by <a href=
  "../1921/index.html">Einstein</a>. It opened a new vista for me
  and deepened my curiosity about the physical world. Instead of
  accepting a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago Museum
  School and against the strong advice of my art teacher, I decided
  to continue my formal education and sought admission to the
  University of Chicago because of its excellent reputation and
  because <a href="../1938/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a> taught
  there. I was fortunate to have been accepted with a full
  scholarship. As my parents had limited means, my university
  training would not have been possible without such help. After
  finishing my requirements in an highly innovative and
  intellectually stimulating liberal arts program (established by
  Robert M. Hutchins who was then President of the University), I
  entered the Physics Department in 1950, receiving a Master's
  degree in 1953 and a Ph.D. in 1956. It is difficult to convey the
  sense of excitement that pervaded the Department at that time.
  Fermi's brilliance, his stimulating, crystal clear lectures that
  he gave in numerous seminars and courses, the outstanding faculty
  in the Department, the many notable physicists who frequently
  came to visit Fermi, and the pioneering investigations of pion
  proton scattering at the newly constructed cyclotron all combined
  to create an especially lively atmosphere. I was indeed fortunate
  to have seen the practice of physics carried out at its "very
  best" at such an early stage in my development. I also had the
  great privilege of being supervised by Fermi, and I can remember
  being overwhelmed with a sense of my good fortune to have been
  given the opportunity to work for this great man. It was a
  remarkably stimulating experience that shaped the way I think
  about physics. My thesis project was an investigation in nuclear
  emulsion of proton polarization produced in scattering from
  nuclei at cyclotron energies. The objective was to determine
  whether the polarization resulted from elastic or inelastic
  scattering. Professor Fermi tragically died in 1954 after a short
  illness. What an immense loss it was to all of us. My thesis work
  was not yet completed, and John Marshall kindly took over my
  supervision and signed my thesis. After I received my Ph.D., I
  continued working as a post-doc at the University of Chicago
  nuclear emulsion laboratory, which was then led by Valentine
  Telegdi. That year Val Telegdi and I did an emulsion experiment
  in which we searched for parity violation in muon decay. We were
  one of the first groups to observe this surprising effect which
  had been suggested by <a href="../1957/index.html">T.D. Lee and
  C.N. Yang</a>. Val was not only an excellent mentor but he was
  instrumental in getting me my first real job with Robert
  Hofstadter.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957, I joined Hofstadter's group at the High Energy Physics
  Laboratory at Stanford University as a Research Associate. This
  was where I learned counter physics and the techniques of
  electron scattering. While there I did a number of experiments
  studying elastic and inelastic electrondeuteron scattering. In an
  experiment to measure a weighted sum-rule for inelastic electron
  deuteron scattering which was related to the n-p interaction I
  had to confront the problem of making radiative corrections to
  inelastic spectra, and I developed a technique which proved to be
  valuable in my later work. Henry Kendall independently developed
  a similar technique and later we combined efforts to develop a
  radiative corrections program for our deep inelastic scattering
  work at SLAC. It was in Hofstadter's group that I began my long
  collaboration with Henry Kendall who was also a member of the
  group. During this period I became acquainted with Richard
  Taylor, who was just finishing his thesis in another group, and
  with other future collaborators in the deep inelastic program at
  SLAC, Dave Coward and Hobey DeStacbler. One of the highlights of
  this period was attending the wonderfully informal and
  informative high energy physics seminars in the home of W.K.H.
  Panofsky, who was Director of the Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960, I was hired as a faculty member in the Physics
  Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When I
  arrived I joined David Ritson's research group. A short time
  later he accepted a position at Stanford University and I
  inherited a small group. With these resources I soon began
  working on collaborative effort to measure muon pair production
  at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA) in order to test the
  validity of Quantum Electro-Dynamics. Henry Kendall joined my
  group in 1961 and we have been collaborators at MIT since that
  time. The last measurement we did at the CEA was a measurement of
  the deuteron form factor at the highest momentum transfers that
  could be reached at that accelerator to get some limits on the
  size of relativistic effects and meson currents.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, Henry Kendall and I started a collaboration with W.K.H.
  Panofsky, Richard Taylor and other physicists from the Stanford
  Linear Accelerator Center and the California Institute of
  Technology to develop electron scattering facilities for a
  physics program at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, a 20 GeV
  electron linac that was being constructed under the leadership of
  Panofsky. This required that we both travel between MIT and SLAC
  on a regular basis. The MIT Physics Department gave us special
  support by reducing our teaching responsibilities. We soon set up
  a small MIT group at SLAC and for extended periods of time one of
  us was always there. We had a rare opportunity. We were part of a
  group of physicists who were provided a new accelerator, given
  the support to design and construct optimal experimental
  facilities, and had the opportunity to participate in the
  exploration of a new energy range with electrons. From 1967 to
  about 1975 the MIT and SLAC groups carried out a series of
  measurements of inelastic electron scattering from the proton and
  neutron which provided the first direct evidence of the quark
  sub-structure of the nucleon. It was a very exciting time for all
  of us. This program is described in detail in the adjoining
  Physics Nobel Lectures.<br>
  <br>
  As the program at SLAC was nearing completion we joined a
  collaborative effort at Fermilab involving a number of
  institutions to build a beam line and a single-arm spectrometer
  in the Meson Laboratory. During the latter half of the 1970's
  this collaboration carried out a series of experiments to
  investigate elastic scattering, <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">Feynman</a> scaling and production
  mechanisms in inclusive hadron scattering. When this work was
  completed, our group joined another collaboration to build a
  large neutrino detector at Fermilab. The objective of this
  program was to study the weak neutral currents in measurements of
  inclusive neutrino and anti-neutrino nucleon scattering, which
  were done in the first half of the 1980's. These investigations
  confirmed the predictions of the Standard Model.<br>
  <br>
  In 1980, I became Director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science
  at MIT and then served as Head of the Physics Department from
  1983 to 1988. During the time I was in these administrative
  positions I managed to maintain a foothold in research, which
  greatly eased my transition back to full-time teaching and
  research in 1988. While it was a very interesting period in my
  life, I was happy to get back to more direct contact with
  students in the classroom and in my research projects. Currently,
  our MIT group is participating in the construction of a large
  detector to study electron-positron annihilations at the Stanford
  Linear Collider and has also been engaged in design work for a
  detector for the Superconducting Super Collider, which is now
  under construction.<br>
  <br>
  Over the years I have served on a number of program and
  scientific policy advisory committees at various accelerators. I
  also was a member of the Board of the University Research
  Association for six years, serving as Vice President for three
  years. I am currently a member of the High Energy Advisory Panel
  for the Department of Energy and also Chairman of the Scientific
  Policy Committee of the Superconducting Super Collider
  Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  Experimental high energy physics research is a group effort. I
  have been very fortunate to have had outstanding students and
  colleagues who have made invaluable contributions to the research
  with which I have been associated. I thank them not only for
  their contributions, but also for their friendship.<br>
  <br>
  My life has been enhanced by my marriage to Tania
  Letetsky-Baranovsky who has broadened my horizons and has been an
  unfaltering source of support. She has endured with cheerful
  resignation my many absences when I have had to travel to distant
  particle accelerators. There are four grown children in our
  family, Ellena, Joel, Martin, and Sandra who pursue their
  activities in various parts of the country.<br>
  <br>
  With regard to my non-vocational activities, in addition to
  getting much pleasure from various cultural activities, such as
  theater, music, ballet, etc., I enjoy painting and study Asian
  ceramics.</p>
