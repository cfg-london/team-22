  <h1>Robert B. Laughlin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="laughlin.jpg" class="bio-img">
  I was born on 1 November, 1950 in Visalia, California, a
  medium-sized town just south of Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley.
  It was at that time an agricultural community more like the
  Middle West or West Texas than Hollywood or Beverly Hills. The
  main highway into town was lined with magnificent walnut orchards
  and stands of valley oaks. My childhood home backed onto wheat
  and cotton fields. And when the navel orange crop was threatened
  by a freeze there was smudge in the air by day and talk of little
  else. A 10-minute drive in any direction brought one out of the
  town and into rows of tidy farms with peach orchards, olive
  orchards, avocado orchards, nuts of all sorts, row crops, and
  dairies. And above us stood the mighty Sierra Nevada, John Muir's
  Range of Light, the rivers of which irrigated the land and turned
  what would otherwise have been oak savannah into the richest
  farmland in the world. The mountains were obscured most of the
  time by the haze caused by irrigation and too many automobiles or
  the dense radiation fog that hides the sun most of the winter in
  that part of the world. My great Aunt recalled how they were
  visible most of the summer when she first came there after the
  great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. But on brilliant winter
  mornings just after a Pacific storm had blown through there they
  would be, a blazing wall of white stretching north and south as
  far as the eye could see, topped by the silhouettes of Sawtooth,
  Mineral King, and the Great Western Divide.<br>
  <br>
  Both sides of my family landed in Visalia by accident. My mother
  was the daughter of a local doctor, Irvin Betts, who had come
  down from San Francisco after medical school "temporarily" and
  induced my grandmother to accompany him by promising her a return
  in a couple of years. She always laughed when she told this
  story. My father had grown up a widow's son in Chico, served as a
  naval officer in the war, followed his brother into the law, and
  had come to Visalia fresh out of law school to work in the Tulare
  County District Attorney's office. There he met and married my
  mother, and together they raised four children, of which I was
  the first. Like so many other American families mine had roots
  that were deep but temporary. We attended church, joined the Boy
  Scouts, contributed casseroles to PTA pot luck suppers, and
  celebrated many a Thanksgiving with family and friends, but in
  the end moved away. My father died in Visalia 18 years ago, and
  all of us, including my mother, now live elsewhere.<br>
  <br>
  Early on in his career my father left the District Attorney's
  office and set up a private law practice in town. He worked very
  hard but was, as one of my uncles later put it, an "artist
  lawyer", meaning that he was more concerned with correctness than
  profits and often did work for needy clients for free. As a
  consequence while we had a roof over our heads, food on the
  table, and clothes to wear to school we were constantly conscious
  of being of modest means. Whether caused by this or our home
  environment generally it came to pass that all of us became quite
  self-reliant at an early age. I, for example, used to take
  appliances apart when they broke in an attempt to fix them, which
  I rarely did successfully, being a kid. I am better at this now.
  My sister Margaret, who is an attorney, still enjoys doing
  needlework from scratch. My brother John, a software engineer,
  prides himself in being able to fix any broken thing. It was
  through such creative play that I first learned about pump
  impellers, refrigerant cycles, material strength, corrosion, and
  the rudiments of electricity, and more importantly the idea that
  real understanding of a thing comes from taking it apart oneself,
  not reading about it in a book or hearing about it in a
  classroom. To this day I always insist on working out a problem
  from the beginning without reading up on it first, a habit that
  sometimes gets me into trouble but just as often helps me see
  things my predecessors have missed.<br>
  <br>
  Another important aspect of our home was respect for ideas. At
  dinnertime one of my parents, usually my father, would lead a
  discussion about some controversial matter, such as racial
  integration of schools, whether John Lennon should have compared
  himself with Jesus Christ, support of Israel, or the morality of
  the Vietnam war, and all of us were expected to air and defend
  our views on these things, even if we did not want to. Over the
  course of time this gave us a deep respect for ideas, both our
  own and those of others, and an understanding that conflict
  through debate is a powerful means of revealing truth. This was,
  of course, before any of us understood rhetoric and how easily it
  can be misused. But the need for conflict to expose prejudice and
  unclear reasoning, which is deeply embedded in my philosophy of
  science, has its origin in these debates.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, who was professional schoolteacher, was particularly
  concerned about our formal education and even went so far as to
  start a private school together with some other parents so that
  our intellectual needs would be met. They acquired an old
  two-room schoolhouse out in the country among the walnut groves
  at the foot of Venice Hill, added some indoor plumbing, and hired
  a small faculty to teach us a broad curriculum that included such
  things as Latin and French. I am afraid the money was largely
  wasted on me because I was not ready to learn French, or much of
  anything else, at that time, although I did rather enjoy watching
  the machines shaking walnuts off the trees in the fall. But it
  was impressed upon me that there was such a thing as good study
  habits and that I would have to acquire them if I wanted to be a
  scholar. My mother also had us take piano lessons, and this had a
  similar effect. I hated those lessons, but I now play regularly
  for pleasure and have even tried my hand at composing. So mothers
  everywhere take heart. The indoctrination you administer now may
  have unanticipated positive effects years later.<br>
  <br>
  I was an extremely reclusive and introverted boy. It was to my
  parents' credit that they weathered the storm and encouraged my
  self-motivated study, even though it scared them to death,
  especially my mother. While still at Venice Hill, for example, I
  got very interested in how televisions worked, and electronics
  generally, so my parents bought me a Heathkit color TV, which I
  soldered together and eventually made work. It was a magnificent
  thing filled with vacuum tubes. One could probably have heated
  the living room with it. I found building this kit rather
  unsatisfactory, actually, because the manual did not explain how
  the circuits worked but only how to assemble them. So I went back
  to old discarded black-and-white models, which my father
  dutifully acquired for me, and began reading about what the
  various parts did and then testing the theory by removing them
  one at a time. It was in this way that I learned why it is bad to
  allow the 10 kilovolts stored on a cathode-ray tube to discharge
  through one's body. Thank God my mother never knew. I also taught
  myself how to blow glass using a propane torch from the hardware
  store and managed to make some elementary chemistry plumbing such
  as tees and small glass bulbs. The latter I filled with isopropyl
  alcohol and attached with a piece of surgical tubing to the
  intake of a cooling compressor I had scavenged from a broken
  refrigerator. This lowered the pressure sufficiently to boil the
  alcohol and lower the temperature well below the freezing point
  of water. I had ambitions of making liquid nitrogen, and could
  probably have done it with more compressors and some dewars. I
  also tried to make sodium metal by electrolysis of molten salts.
  I discovered that common wood lye had the lowest melting
  temperature of all the available materials, so I melted some in a
  orange juice can and electrolyzed it using an auto battery
  charger and an ice pick as the cathode. It worked, except that
  the sodium lived only a second or two before being oxidized by
  the surrounding air. It was at this time that I picked up the can
  to check for corrosion on the bottom and accidentally poured its
  contents all over my right hand, burning it severely. My father
  rushed me to the hospital, had it dressed, and then invented a
  story to tell my poor mother so that she would not have a heart
  attack. By good fortune the molten sodium hydroxide was so hot
  that it had vaporized the water in my skin and sloughed off
  without burning me chemically. My hand recovered fully. My
  parents would probably never have encouraged these things had
  they known how foolish and dangerous they were, but it is
  nonetheless a testament to their belief in the value of
  self-motivated exploration that they allowed me to cultivate such
  interests even though I got no credit from them toward college or
  employment.<br>
  <br>
  In parallel with the development of my interests in technical
  gadgetry I began to acquire a profound love of and respect for
  the natural world which motivates my scientific thinking to this
  day. My maternal grandmother had a mountain cabin deep in the
  Tule river canyon just south of Sequoia Park, to which we were
  often invited as a family or as individuals. My grandfather had
  built it as a kind of hunting lodge before I was born, so it had
  a very masculine feeling despite being my grandmother's home. It
  had a big stone fireplace, knotty pine walls, a big cast iron
  chandelier for light, and a marvelous old Aeolean player piano
  with plenty of rolls. My grandmother was a complex person, but
  she loved the mountains and welcomed anyone else who did,
  including reclusive grandsons. So I spent time there whenever I
  was able, which was not very much because I had responsibilities
  at home, and over the course of time came to understand what a
  treasure it was - the house-sized boulders left in the riverbed
  by retreating glaciers, the massive ponderosa pines six feet in
  diameter at the base, delicate mosses and lichens of every
  imaginable color, the complex geometries of pine cones and oak
  boughs, the hundreds of fragrant herbs along the riverbank, the
  quiet rush of the river at night on a cool summer evening, and
  the vast tracts of wilderness beyond known to no one. I realized
  that nature is filled with a limitless number of wonderful things
  which have causes and reasons like anything else but nonetheless
  cannot be forseen but must be discovered, for their subtlety and
  complexity transcends the present state of science. The questions
  worth asking, in other words, come not from other people but from
  nature, and are for the most part delicate things easily drowned
  out by the noise of everyday life.<br>
  <br>
  I owe my interest in mathematics to my father, or more precisely
  the sense that mathematics was something important and
  mysterious. He knew very little mathematics himself but was
  always reading about it and encouraging everybody else to do the
  same. He even mounted blackboards in the hall so that a person
  could write down a brilliant idea if he happened to be passing
  by. I remember particularly one day hearing a shout from my
  father's bedroom and rushing in to discover that he had just
  discovered Euler's theorem. He did not understand the proof
  completely, so it appeared to him more astonishing than it does
  to those of us with technical training, but he had correctly
  understood its significance and elegance. I did well in my
  mathematics courses in school but was not that challenged and,
  truthfully, not that interested either. But through my interests
  in electron motion in vacuum tubes I discovered a need to
  describe trajectories of moving particles with equations. So I
  taught myself calculus. I was terribly proud of this at the time,
  but I realize now that people at this age are simply
  developmentally ready to learn such things, which is why calculus
  is now taught in high school. But I was certainly the only person
  in my town to have done this, and my father's own interest in
  mathematics was the underlying cause.<br>
  <br>
              <b>Berkeley</b><br>
  The experience that firmly placed me on a course toward a
  professional career in science was the four years I spent as an
  undergraduate at Berkeley. I entered in the fall of 1968 as an
  electrical engineer, my parents having prevailed upon me to take
  the economic facts of life seriously. I had applied to more elite
  schools but had not gotten in, presumably because my grades were
  not high enough, and also because I was what we now call an
  "angular" student, i.e. not well-rounded. My parents were not
  that disappointed, for they had themselves attended Berkeley, as
  eventually did my brother and two sisters. Berkeley was as
  different from the quiet country town of my youth as one could
  possibly imagine. It was full of coffee shops, politics, book
  stores, theaters, ethnic restaurants, stray dogs, junkies, street
  musicians, and fascinating people from every conceivable walk of
  life. As time passed I became more and more intoxicated with all
  this freedom and more and more convinced that the university was
  where my future lay. Here was the place ideas mattered, where
  everybody was eccentric, where originality was not only accepted
  but had actual market value. It was easy to get lost in the crowd
  at Berkeley, particularly in the great lecture courses, but this
  did not bother me because I had no intention of getting lost in
  the crowd, and anyway considered it a small price to pay for the
  freedom to think as I saw fit.<br>
  <br>
  At Berkeley I had my first encounter with real professional
  scientists. I remember the Berkeley faculty as being particularly
  visionary and inspirational. In the physics department in
  particular there was a palpable sense of history going back to
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Pauli</a>, and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a>. I
  later came to understand that Berkeley has always been a special
  place in American physics and that many of the greatest
  physicists in the world, perhaps even most of them, can trace
  their roots back to Berkeley in some way. It was this faculty
  that defined for me what physics was and should be, and thereby
  helped me make up my mind to pursue physics as a career. I came
  home in the middle of my sophomore year and announced, much to
  the horror of my parents, that I was switching to physics from
  engineering. After some discussion they gave in, as well-meaning
  parents tend to do in this situation, and I remember my father
  musing afterward that it would probably come out all right
  because these things usually did. Meanwhile at school I was
  experiencing such wonderful things as the surprise appearance of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/index.html">Charles Townes</a>,
  winner of the Nobel Prize for invention of the laser, in one of
  my large lecture courses to explain simply and accurately how
  lasers work and how they came to be invented. I took quantum
  mechanics from <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1959/index.html">Owen
  Chamberlain</a>, who had won the Nobel Prize several years before
  for the discovery of the antiproton, and who was happy to discuss
  all sorts of unrelated things such as whether fusion would ever
  work and whether one should go East to graduate school. I learned
  electrodynamics from J. D. Jackson's wonderful book and had many
  occasions to ask him questions about the subject. I took
  introductory solid state physics from Charles Kittel, the
  acknowledged father of the field in which I was eventually to
  work. I took Goeffrey Chew's advanced quantum mechanics course
  and learned more about the S matrix than he probably intended. I
  also had many useful exchanges with Ray Sachs, who helped me
  learn differential geometry and general relativity on my own and
  guided me to a thesis. My work with Ray began with the question
  of whether a charged particle dropped in a gravitational field
  should radiate light, since the relativity principle said it was
  actually not accelerating. The correct answer is yes because
  electromagnetic field knows about the curvature tensor. This line
  of thought led us to a calculation of the cross-section for
  scattering gravitational radiation off of a charged particle, the
  roles of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in this
  case being exactly reversed. It was a wonderful time in my life.
  On commencement day we were addressed by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1959/index.html">Emilio Segr&eacute;</a>,
  sharer of the Nobel Prize for the antiproton discovery and author
  of a book on nuclear physics that is a delight to read to this
  day. He took the long view, told us all not to worry too much,
  and recounted how he and his fellow students in Rome had
  regularly scanned the obituaries in hopes that a job would become
  available soon. Many years later when I returned to Berkeley to
  talk about fractional quantization it was Professor Segr&eacute;
  who rushed up after the lecture to ask if the particles we had
  identified in the fractional quantum hall effect might have
  something to do with quarks. It was his life's work to ask
  questions like that, and this was the reason I had found him and
  his colleagues so inspiring.<br>
  <br>
  My years at Berkeley coincided almost exactly with the worst of
  the Vietnam war. It is not necessary to recount here the many
  terrible events of that time, but the political unrest at
  Berkeley caused ultimately by the war was a major constraint on
  student life, both intellectually and physically. It was also a
  real lesson in how people's perceptions of exactly the same facts
  can be profoundly different. I had no sympathy at all for the
  disrespect for property and formal education implicit in these
  demonstrations, but I did think long and hard about the issues
  raised and, more importantly, about what these events said about
  politics. Western society has many flaws, and it is good for an
  educated person to have thought some of these through, even at
  the expense of losing a lecture or two to tear gas. As to the
  war, I had no idea what to think about it, except that there were
  already scattered reports of people in my high school class
  having come back in body bags. So it came as quite a shock when
  President Nixon canceled student deferments arguing, correctly in
  my view, that they were unfair, held a lottery, and picked for me
  a draft number equal to my age - nineteen.<br>
  <br>
  I remember vividly the day it was announced and the coldness I
  felt as the full implications slowly became clear. It was common
  knowledge that theoretical physicists do their best work before
  age 27, sometimes even earlier. I could not possibly meet this
  deadline now. There was also the moral question of whether to
  serve at all. Many people at that time were fleeing the country
  to avoid the draft, others were faking health problems, and still
  others were enlisting for long periods in exchange for safety.
  After stewing over this a long time I decided that I did not
  think defending one's country was wrong - although the Vietnam
  war had very little to do with defending one's country - that I
  could not lie about so important a matter, that I did not want to
  flee the country, and that I should obey its laws if I stayed. So
  that was that. I often question now whether this was the right
  decision, but in any event it is the one I made. But the weight
  of it bore down on me more and more heavily as my senior year
  progressed, and at the very end I lost focus, failed a
  laboratory, and graduated with only a degree in mathematics
  rather than with the double degrees in mathematics and physics I
  had actually earned. So I left Berkeley with everything I had
  come to value in ruins. The only thing I had left was the faith
  in myself instilled by my parents and the certainty that I had
  understood what theoretical physics was and was extremely good at
  it.<br>
  <br>
              <b>Military</b><br>
  At the time I felt that my induction into the military was a
  giant step backward. It was certainly unfair taxation of my time,
  but then life is unfair, and getting reminded of this from time
  to time is perhaps not such a bad thing. I had decided not to
  become an officer because to do so would have required me to stay
  in a year longer, and time was critical. So I became an enlisted
  man and let the system do with me as it saw fit. Skill as a
  theoretical physicist matters very little in the lower ranks of
  the army - or perhaps has negative value. It is an interesting
  fact that during my tour I was never allowed access to computers,
  radios, or anything else that I might damage through curiosity,
  or perhaps something more sinister. What matters most is that one
  blends in. In basic training, which I had at Fort Ord near
  Monterey, one's identity and past are excised and a new one
  substituted. All one's clothes and possessions are removed and
  shipped home. All one's hair is shaved off so that one looks like
  a concentration camp victim. All people get the same hemorrhoid
  examination. All people get the same equipment. All people run
  with this equipment to the firing range. All people get the same
  cold. All people do the same chin-ups before meals. It was about
  as different from Berkeley as one could imagine, the suppression
  of individuality and freedom for the purpose of preventing
  mischief. In retrospect I consider my induction to have been not
  so much a step backward as an important lesson in civics, for it
  eventually became clear that these things I found so abhorrent
  were the very things required to make a large organization run
  well under stress. So I learned the hard way that freedom and
  efficiency conflict, that more of one means less of the other,
  and that this is fundamental. To this day I break out in a cold
  sweat every time I hear the term "programmic science", for I know
  it really means tight bunks, shiny boots, and digging holes that
  will be filled back up by someone else the next day.<br>
  <br>
  Some time near the end of basic training a computer somewhere
  decided that I was suited for missile school, so I was ordered to
  Fort Sill, Oklahoma to learn how to fire Pershing missiles. This
  was a good deal less stressful than basic training, as the pace
  was slower, and this part of Oklahoma is laid back and rather
  beautiful, with rolling brown hills not unlike the ones in
  California. The Pershing missiles, on the other hand, were not
  beautiful. They were horrible weapons of war - solid-fuel rockets
  five feet in diameter at the base, long as a moving van, and
  capable of throwing a tactical nuclear warhead 500 miles. They
  were launched from trucks and required a team of 10 men to
  service and fire. The most interesting thing I learned during
  this time was how small a nuclear warhead was. The nose cone of a
  Pershing is only about 18 inches in diameter at the base. I had
  not been interested at all in nuclear weaponry as a student, and
  so I had never thought through carefully about their
  "efficiency". It is sobering thought that these missiles were
  actually deployed in continental Europe in those days and that on
  at least one occasion, namely the 1973 Arab-Israel war, there was
  an alert serious enough to leave the commanding officers
  trembling.<br>
  <br>
  While at Fort Sill I met, or more precisely was grouped with, the
  people who were to be my companions for the rest of my tour in
  the military. They were a very personable bunch mostly from the
  upper Middle West, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska, and rather like a
  selection of the smarter students from my high school, except
  that the contingent from Detroit was rabidly racist, something
  that I had never encountered before and still have trouble
  understanding. Getting to know these people was my first of many
  reminders that the world is full of intelligent, well-meaning
  people who, for one reason or another, did not attend university
  but are nonetheless well-read and educated. Out there on the
  prairie lost opportunities of youth were the rule rather than the
  exception, and I slowly became disabused of the myth of the
  Bright Young Thing and have not believed in it since.<br>
  <br>
  After missile school I was ordered to southern Germany, where I
  spent the remainder of my tour. This assignment was a welcome
  turn of events, but it was not a vacation, and it was in some
  respects extremely unpleasant. Most of the locals in my parents'
  generation were very accepting and helpful, for they were afraid
  of the Russians and remembered the many kindnesses done to them
  after the war. They were also prospering economically, which I
  know from personal experience helps one overlook indignities. But
  the people my age and younger hated the whole idea of a foreign
  army on their soil, especially one with nuclear weapons, felt
  little personal guilt for Germany's past, and felt that the
  Vietnam war had thoroughly discredited the alleged ethical
  superiority of English-speaking countries. So we were tolerated
  but not liked all that much. Also there were terrible morale
  problems in the unit to which I was assigned in Schwaebisch
  Gmuend, a small town near Stuttgart, which caused particularly
  heavy and widespread drug usage. These were largely corrected by
  a change in command about halfway through my tour, but they were
  nonetheless extremely scary.<br>
  <br>
  During this time I tried to think about physics, and about
  university life generally, and I made a point of visiting the
  nearby technical universities and the great medieval university
  at T&uuml;bingen, but it was hopeless. I had a job to do, my time
  was too fragmented, and my unit discouraged much contact with
  university types, this being politically dangerous.
  T&uuml;bingen, in particular, was frowned upon because of the
  safe house for AWOL soldiers alleged to be there. So I decided to
  make the best of a bad situation and invest the time studying
  language. This turned out to be a better expenditure of time than
  reading physics books, for like most of my countrymen I had an
  incomplete understanding of how language is a vehicle for ideas
  rather than the other way around. While my language ability is
  still poor, I can still remember the day that radio stations
  began to sound clear, when newspapers began to inform more than
  frustrate, when I began to get jokes, and when I told my first
  joke. So in the light hindsight, I judge this time to have been
  well spent.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of my tour I was released from duty in Europe, as I
  had elected to travel around a bit as a free man before going
  home. On the day of my emancipation I celebrated in traditional
  fashion by burning my boots - although in an especially
  thoughtful and creative way. I went downtown and bought 3 kilos
  of saltpetre, mixed it with sugar, and filled both boots up to
  the brim, fully laced, and lit one off. There was a tremendous
  pink flame, fierce heat, and dense smoke that began shooting
  straight up 30 feet as from a volcano as the fire ate down into
  the boot. Several of the battery officers came running up just as
  the experiment was ending to see what was left of the sole
  curling up like a shriveled bug. They had been playing baseball
  nearby and had thought that a radio unit was on fire. I assured
  them that the radio unit was not on fire and then proved it by
  lighting off the other boot.<br>
  <b><br>
  MIT</b><br>
  I entered graduate school at MIT in the fall of 1974 with a sense of
  urgency sharpened by my two-year absence from academic life. I
  was behind all my friends and I was very impatient with any
  activity not leading directly to fundamental discovery, i.e.
  taking classes. However I soon found that things were not that
  simple. Physics graduate schools in America are for the most part
  set up as a first priority to service federal contracts, not to
  make fundamental discoveries, and a graduate student career makes
  no sense outside the context of one of these contracts. Indeed it
  was, and is, the practice at MIT to admit graduate students
  directly into research groups on an as-needed basis as a kind of
  labor pool. It took me a while to fully understand this
  depressing fact of life, but I eventually did and then proceeded
  to look for a home in a research group as a means of supporting
  myself while learning the things essential to achieving my larger
  ambitions. I had by this time become quite cynical about and
  suspicious of institutions of all kinds, and I felt that
  government-sponsored science was no more likely to be immune from
  economic pressures than business. So I directed my attention
  toward the branch of physics with the largest number of
  experiments, namely solid state physics, figuring that this was
  the best way to cut out the intellectual middleman and go
  directly to nature. I have since discovered that most good
  theorists think this way.<br>
  <br>
  It was my good fortune at this time to fall in with John
  Joannopoulos, a young faculty member who had just come from
  Marvin Cohen's group at Berkeley. I had heard John talking at a
  research fair and had noticed that he was the only theorist who
  seemed genuinely interested in his own work, so I contacted him
  and asked for a job. Neither of us knew it at the time, but John
  was to become one a truly great trainer of graduate students, for
  the list of alumni from his group includes Prof. E.J. Mele at the
  University of
  Pennsylvania, Prof. A.D. Stone at Yale, Prof. Karen Rabe at
  Yale, Prof. D.
  Vanderbilt of Rutgers, Prof. T. Arias at MIT, Prof. E. Kaxiras at
  Harvard,
  Prof. D.H. Lee at Berkeley, and me. His main expertise was in
  using local exchange methods (c.f. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1998/index.html">Walter Kohn</a>'s 1998
  Nobel lecture) to model electronic materials, which in those days
  meant defective silicon, silicate glasses, and amorphous
  selenium. I figured at the time that this was a good way to learn
  the basics, and I knew that <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html">William Shockley</a> had
  started out doing similar things for John Slater at MIT. So I
  worked for John for a long time and published several papers with
  him that were not that memorable but kept dinner on the table
  while I was coming up the learning curve on the vast subject of
  solid state physics. John's strategy was to give students simple
  problems they could market right away and then invest enormous
  amounts of personal time making sure the research was on track.
  The physics training I got from John emphasized bread-and-butter
  things such as the basics of semiconductors, tight binding
  modeling methods, and pseudopotentials. The truly invaluable
  things I learned from him, however, were not technical at all but
  organizational: how to mount a research campaign and execute
  successfully, how to render a big body of work down to its
  essence, how to package work so that it is interesting and
  comprehensible to an audience, how to look for new physical
  content in old results, and how to think experimentally. John
  took as his highest priority that all his students have a
  professional niche to live in after graduation, something I now
  understand to be of paramount importance, for the science will
  come later if the person has what it takes, but it will never
  come if the student has no job in the critical years right after
  graduate school.<br>
  <br>
  One of the terrific aspects of MIT in those days was the enormous
  variety of experimental work that either took place there or was
  talked about in seminars by outside speakers aggressively
  recruited by the faculty. It was motivated by questions that did
  not interest me that much, such as whether the
  Kosterlitz-Thouless transition could actually be observed in the
  laboratory or what renormalization group principles told one
  about scattering lineshapes. The important thing for me was the
  experiment itself, how it worked, and whether it might be saying
  something that the experimentalist himself had overlooked. So I
  learned about X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, raman
  scattering, infrared absorption spectroscopy, heat capacity,
  transport, time-dependent transport, magnetic resonance, electron
  diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy - all the
  experimental techniques that constitute the eyes and ears of
  modern solid state physics. As this occurred I slowly became
  disillusioned with the reductionist ideal of physics, for it was
  completely clear that the oucome of these experiments was almost
  always impossible to predict from first principles, yet was right
  and meaningful and certainly regulated by the same microscopic
  laws that work in atoms. Only many years later did I finally
  understand that this truth, which seems so natural to solid state
  physicists because they confront experiments so frequently, is
  actually quite alien to other branches of physics and is
  vigorously repudiated by many scientists on the grounds that
  things not amenable to reductionist thinking are not
  physics.<br>
  <br>
  It was at MIT that I met and married my wife Anita. We used to
  swim at the same time after work at the MIT swimming pool and
  were annoyed by the same guy in a leopard suit who obviously
  thought he was beautiful and talented. So one day I said, "That
  guy may look tough, but he keeps his suit on in the shower." It
  was absolutely true, of course, for I could not have made up such
  a good story. This broke the ice. Anita corrected many of my
  worst habits, in particular the one of returning to my office
  after swimming and working until midnight. We would instead go up
  to Harvard Square for a late-night snack or attend a movie or a
  poetry reading, the usual staples of student life. Also, Anita's
  family lived nearby and was quite close-knit and warm, so we used
  to escape from Cambridge regularly to visit them. They had a
  wonderful old saltbox house out in Concord with a huge fireplace
  heating an equally huge kitchen with low wooden beams and an old
  plank floor. In winter the hearth was always lit and there was
  always something interesting simmering on the stove. Her father,
  who was then Dean of Graduate Studies at Lesley College, is a
  yankee with a wicked sense of humor who had grown up on a dairy
  farm in Massachusetts and then gone on to a life of scholarship
  at Yale and Harvard. Her mother had grown up as a doctor's
  daughter in Palo Alto and graduated from Stanford. Thanks
  in part to this latter fact, Anita and I were married by
  candlelight at Memorial Church at Stanford, an interesting turn
  of events considering what was to happen later. Anita's mother
  got a bit carried away with this wedding and went so far as to
  get us onto the New York Times society page. But her father kept
  things in perspective. One afternoon, totally unprovoked, he held
  out a wedding gift that looked suspiciously like a dentist's bowl
  and said "spit please".<br>
  <br>
              <b>Bell Labs</b><br>
  I must have been doing something right at MIT, for at the end of
  my graduate career there the faculty got together and recommended
  me for a position in the Theory Group at Bell Labs, the best
  placement a young theoretical physicist could possibly have
  gotten. I had wanted to go to Xerox Palo Alto, but a job did not
  materialize, and in light of what happened later it was probably
  just as well. Bell Labs had been a kind of holy place of solid
  state physics since the 1950's when it was built up by Shockley
  after the invention of the transistor. I had no idea at the time
  of the significance of this placement, but I did notice during my
  job talk that everybody understood what I was saying immediately
  - this had never happened before - and that the audience had an
  irresistible urge to interrupt, heckle, and argue about the
  subject matter loudly among themselves during the talk so as to
  lob hand grenades into it, just like back-benchers do in the
  House of Commons. Being a combative person I rather liked this
  and lobbed a few grenades of my own to maintain control of my
  seminar. I later came to understand that this heckling was a sign
  of respect from these people, that the ability to handle it was a
  test of a person's worth, and that polite silence from them was
  an extremely bad sign, amounting to Pauli's famous criticism that
  the speaker was "not even wrong."<br>
  <br>
  It was at Bell Labs that I first made direct contact with real
  semiconductor experts and thus began to fully understand what
  amazing materials they were and what they could do. I knew a
  little about semiconductors already, having worked on the theory
  of silicon-oxide interfaces at MIT and also having intimate
  familiarity with Marc Kastner's experimental amorphous silicon
  work there. But a thorough grasp of this great subject was not
  possible to acquire at MIT or any other university, because no
  faculty could ever be big enough. I learned about cyclotron
  resonance measurements of electron masses and the associated
  disorder broadening from Jim Allen, defect-pair recombination
  luminescence from Michael Sturge, deep levels from John Poate and
  Dave Lang, silicide Schottky barriers from Marty Lepselter
  through Jim Phillips, infrared spectroscopy of shallow donors and
  acceptors from Gordon Thomas, and transport in the 2-dimensional
  electron gas from <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1998/index.html">Dan Tsui</a>. The theorists
  at Bell had all done work in semiconductors at some time or
  another and were very helpful in the learning process,
  particularly through their constant give-and-take with the
  experimentalists. While I was there, for example, Gordon Thomas
  and Tom Rosenbaum verified the continuous nature of the
  metal-insulator transition in phosphorus-doped silicon predicted
  by <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1977/index.html">Phil Anderson</a>
  and his "gang of four". Don Hamann and Michael Schl&uuml;ter were
  doing ab-initio density functional computations for semiconductor
  surfaces, interfaces, and defects. Patrick Lee was working hard
  on the field theory of weak localization. I was also familiar
  with the cutting-edge work in gallium arsenide heterostructures
  being done at the time through seminars and informal
  conversations with Mike Schl&uuml;ter, who was good friends with
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1998/index.html">Horst
  St&ouml;rmer</a>. The fact that the two German expatriates at
  Bell were in the thick of this subject was no accident, for
  semiconductor physics had been particularly emphasized at that
  time in the German research establishment, and most of the
  careful, scholarly work on the subject, particularly the
  2-dimensional electron gas, was being done in Germany.<br>
  <br>
  It is a great irony that the work leading to the Nobel Prize this
  year began in a time of terrible defeat for me personally, as I
  had just learned that I would not get a permanent job at Bell.
  John Joannopoulos had recommended that I work closely with Mark
  Cardillo, who was diffracting neutral helium atoms from
  semiconductor surfaces as a means of diagnosing their structures,
  presumably on the theory that my proper niche at Bell would be as
  a modeler. Unfortunately, Mark was such a good experimentalist
  and so good at understanding the meaning of his results before I
  had even seen them that there was little left for me to do but
  confirm his insight after the fact. Also, there was no profound
  conceptual issue at stake. By about one year into my appointment
  I could see the inevitable but was unable to do anything about
  it. I had actually made a breakthrough in my helium diffraction
  work - I had discovered empirically by studying atomic beam
  experiments that the potential felt by the incoming helium atom
  was a universal constant times the electron density of the target
  - and was writing it up when Jim Phillips pointed out that the
  same idea had just been published by somebody else in Physical
  Review Letters. So it didn't count. The fateful vote on my
  promotion to permanent status came shortly thereafter, and rumor
  had it that I had only one supporter. While I had been expecting
  the axe to fall for some weeks my blood froze when it actually
  did. Once again my ambitions had been thwarted due to
  circumstances beyond my control, only this time the damage was
  much greater and almost certainly unrecoverable. I went home and
  told Anita, and together we began making plans for what to do.
  She was not all that unhappy, actually, for she did not like the
  New York metropolitan area all that much and had had ambitions to
  live in New England or out West.<br>
  <br>
  It was at this moment that I wrote my first important paper in
  theoretical physics. I was 32 years old, 5 years beyond the
  alleged age of senility for theorists. Dan Tsui had come into the
  tearoom one afternoon with a copy of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1985/index.html">Klaus von Klitzing</a>'s
  famous paper on the integral quantum Hall effect to see what the
  theorists thought about it. Everybody was interested, for
  localization in the 2-dimensional electron gas was a timely
  topic. The version of it unique to two dimensions called weak
  localization had been discovered at Bell by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/index.html">Doug Osheroff</a> and Gerry
  Dolan shortly before my arrival, and there was a raging
  controversy over the sign of magnetoresistance of these systems
  in weak fields. Von Klitzing's experiment was in the strong-field
  limit, for which there was no theory. I remember Phil Anderson's
  making a mumble about how there was probably a "gauge argument",
  by which he meant something like the physics of the Josephson
  effect, and this stuck in my mind. I knew that the enormous
  accuracy of Klitzing's effect precluded any complicated
  explanation, I knew from my work with John Joannopoulos what the
  Hamiltonian appropriate to the problem was, and I knew
  localization had to be occurring. I also knew how the experiment
  worked, in particular that the gate voltage on a field-effect
  transistor fixes the density and not the chemical potential, so
  that a gap in the density of states as proposed by Ando could not
  be the right answer. Within a few days I had hit on the idea of
  replacing a calculation of the current with a derivative of the
  energy with respect to vector potential, and shortly thereafter I
  made this physical by imagining an experiment in which the sample
  was wrapped into a ring. Thus was born what later became known as
  the "gauge argument" for accurate quantization of the Hall
  conductance. The upshot of this theory was that localization
  caused the effect and that the Hall conductance was accurately
  quantized because it was a measurement of the charge of the
  object being localized, in this case the electron.<br>
  <br>
  The response at Bell to these events is a fascinating case study
  in how even well-informed people find a truly new idea difficult
  to understand and accept. Anderson complains regularly about this
  problem, and he often cites <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck</a>'s complaints
  about it, so I am in good company. A week later I gave a journal
  club presentation about von Klitzing's discovery, and finished
  off with my explanation, which could be given to that audience in
  two minutes. I got some questions about the experiment, but none
  about my ideas that were on the mark at all. I remember being
  challenged over, that well-known fact that all states were
  localized in two dimensions, something that made no sense at all
  in light of the experiments I had just shown. I remember giving
  the right answers, namely that the experiments showed the current
  theory of localization to be wrong in strong magnetic fields, and
  that there had to be a band of extended states below the fermi
  level carrying the current. But they were not convinced, and it
  was not until Bert Halperin wrote a paper repeating these and
  elaborating upon them that they were accepted at Bell, by which
  time I was long gone.<br>
  <br>
              <b>Livermore</b><br>
  By the time I began looking for jobs my fame for this work had
  begun to spread and I eventually was offered a job at Purdue which I accepted. A few weeks
  later I un-accepted and took a job at the Livermore lab as a
  post-doc, an act for which I feel guilty to this day, as Al
  Overhauser and Sergio Rodriguez had gone out on a limb on my
  behalf. I had received a call from Andy McMahan months earlier
  asking if I might want to come out, and on a whim I went for an
  interview and gave a talk on my quantum Hall theory. By good
  fortune one person in that audience, Dick More, understood its
  significance and caused an offer to be generated, even though my
  interests and training did not match the Laboratory's needs at
  all. Like most of the physicists at Livermore, Dick was an expert
  in atomic and plasma physics, but he had been trained as a solid
  state physicist and had even held Ted Holstein's old position at
  the University of
  Pittsburgh. I first turned the Livermore offer down, knowing
  full well that it was not an academic job. But after Anita and I
  had discussed it at length, I decided that I felt completely
  betrayed by the academic establishment and saw no reason to trust
  it a second time, especially for so little money. She felt the
  same way, noted that everybody switches careers nowadays, and
  suggested that we move to California where the economy was strong
  and just go out on the open market if things went bad at
  Livermore. So it was decided. We flew back to Newark, and that
  very evening I put Anita on a plane to San Francisco to look for
  a place to live. I remember watching her plane take off through a
  cyclone fence at North Terminal and standing there for a long
  time afterward with tears in my eyes wondering if I had done the
  right thing.<br>
  <br>
  Livermore was and is a real industrial laboratory, by which I
  mean that it considered its job to be maintenance and development
  of technology for inertial-confinement fusion and nuclear weapons
  and not the generation of public-domain scientific knowledge. I
  was hired into what was then known as H-Division, the group
  responsible for generating equation-of-state and opacity tables
  for use in design codes. My job description said I was to work on
  modeling matter at a temperature of about 10 eV and a density of
  about 1/10 that of ordinary solids, a particularly difficult
  regime relevant to the X-ray laser program. However, it was the
  practice in those days to induce people to work on such applied
  problems by providing them with resources to work on real science
  as well. This is how Hugh DeWitt's famous Monte Carlo work on the
  3-dimensional one-component plasma came to be done, for example,
  or Ceperley and Alder's excellent numerical work on the phase
  diagram of metals at zero temperature. So I was encouraged to
  continue thinking about the quantum Hall effect on the side and
  even given permission to use my computer account for any
  calculations that I might need to do. Also, for the first six
  months I was with Livermore I worked in a trailer known as the
  "cooler" outside the fence waiting for my clearance to come
  through. So at least in the short term my decision had been a a
  good one.<br>
  <br>
  It was while I was in the cooler that I received the preprint
  from Horst and Dan about their discovery of fractional quantum
  Hall effect. I remember flipping through to the figure at the
  back, staring at it for 10 seconds, and realizing that they must
  have found a many-body condensate with excitations carrying
  charge e/3, for there was no plausible explanation for the
  existence of a plateau other than localization of such a carrier.
  The temperature in the experiment was not that low by modern
  standards, so the plateau was not that flat and the parallel
  conductance not that small, but I knew Dan was very careful about
  localization physics and would have said something if this
  conductance had not been converging rapidly to zero with
  decreasing temperature. Also the bare eye could see that the
  quantization was at least 1% accurate, and there was no reason it
  should have been even that good unless it was von Klitzing's
  effect. I quickly telephoned Horst to make sure I had understood
  correctly and to find out all the little experimental details
  that never get published in formal papers, including in
  particular any evidence that the localization was incomplete.
  There was none. I told Horst what I thought it meant, and he told
  me they had had a similar idea. Dan had apparently seen the chart
  recorder plot, measured the field strength of the integral
  plateau with his fingers, displaced this 3 times to the right to
  land under the new plateau, and said "quarks".<br>
  <br>
  So the task remaining was to find a prototype for this condensate
  simple enough to be convincing. I was familiar at the time with
  the theory of fractionally charged domain walls in 1-dimensional
  chains, an idea attributed by solid state physicists to Su and
  Schrieffer but actually going back further to a particle physics
  paper by Jackiw and Rebbi. I had learned about them from my
  fellow graduate student Gene Mele, who had worked on them at
  Xerox Webster. Gene had thought about these "solitons" deeply
  from every possible angle, knew as a result that they had to be
  real, and convinced me of it over the course of several meetings.
  It was actually a hot idea in those days, and there had been much
  experimental activity attempting to detect these solitons in
  polyacetylene, usually with light scattering. However, despite
  claims of success, the matter was never resolved because sample
  imperfection always corrupted the data and allowed the
  experiments to be interpreted more than one way. So my first
  attempt to write down a prototype for the fractional quantum Hall
  ground state borrowed heavily from the literature of solitons, in
  particular the idea of discrete broken symmetry on which it was
  based. I wrote up a theory and sent it in to Physical Review
  Letters. It was rejected, thank God. The referee, who I later
  discovered to be Steve Kivelson, observed that the discrete
  broken symmetry I had written down was actually a continuous
  broken symmetry and that its pinning on impurities would cause
  the sample insulate. This was correct, and furthermore I had
  known about the problem before I sent in the paper and had
  deceived myself into believing that it did not matter.<br>
  <br>
  It was at this time that I wrote the paper for which I have been
  awarded the Nobel Prize. Realizing that most people would require
  more than experimental phenomenology to be convinced I went back
  to the beginning and began computing the properties of the
  interacting 2-dimensional electron gas problems by the
  exact-diagonalization method. For most many-body problems this
  would have been a foolish thing to do, but I knew from the
  experiments that the system had an energy gap and that this would
  protect the calculation and give it meaning even when the number
  of particles was small. So I solved the problem for one and two
  particles, then powered up the computers to do three, four, five,
  and six. Each time the system locked in at particular densities
  as the pressure on it was increased, and thus exhibited the
  behavior seen in experiment. There was no sign of any tendency to
  crystallize, which would have shown up as a near degeneracy in
  the eigenvalue spectrum. So I knew that the right answer was
  indeed a uniform fluid with an energy gap. Having seen the
  behavior with small numbers of particles I began trying to guess
  the functional form of the wavefunction in hopes of then
  extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit. One particular
  functional form, a product of pair factors, caught my attention
  because it had occurred naturally as a basis element in the
  numerical calculations and had a particularly large weight in the
  correct ground state at filling factor 1/3, sometimes as much as
  99.9 %. But it was not exact. Also there did not exist any
  standard mathematical machinery for computing the properties of
  such a state in the thermodynamic limit. Feeling rather
  discouraged I went to the library to read up on many-body
  physics, hoping to find some reason that the state I had proposed
  would be exact. I was looking through Eugene Feenberg's book on
  helium and chanced to open up the chapter on Jastrow ground
  states and there, in front of my eyes, was the functional form I
  had guessed! It was not exact at all, but rather a well-known
  variational technique for approximating the ground state of
  strongly-interacting many-body systems. I eagerly read about the
  analogy between such wavefunctions and the statistical mechanics
  of classical fluids and then realized that the fluid analogous to
  my proposed ground state was the very one-component plasma I had
  been learning about from Forrest Rogers and Huge DeWitt in the
  "cooler", albeit in one lower dimension. So I went to them to get
  guidance on how to compute the properties of this plasma. Once I
  had mastered the hypernetted chain and semiclassical Monte Carlo
  techniques and understood their error bars the rest was
  straightforward. The ground state energy was computed and found
  to be variationally superior to all known crystals. The
  charge-1/3 excitations were constructed from this ground state
  with an adiabatic thought experiment very similar to that used in
  the integral quantum hall effect. Wavefunctions for these
  excitations were proposed and their computed variational energies
  found to match the experimental activation energy for the
  parallel conductance in the plateau regions. It all fit. So I
  wrote the new theory up and sent it to Physical Review Letters.
  It was published there a few months later.<br>
  <br>
  These rather heady events coincided almost exactly with the
  purchase of our first house and the birth of my first son,
  Nathaniel. Anita had been near the end of her pregnancy when we
  closed the deal, and I remember her scooting along the floor
  painting the baseboards white, the only chore she could do
  comfortably. Nat arrived a few weeks later in the dark of the
  morning on one of the rainiest days I can ever remember. We
  somehow made it to the hospital, where he was delivered by
  Caesarean with me in attendance. It is quite something witnessing
  surgery on one's spouse while she is awake. My mother drove up
  from Visalia when she got the news and was almost annihilated by
  weather-induced traffic accidents. It was a wild and beautiful
  day. Thus I became a father and a homeowner at the same time and
  experienced all the changes in perceptions and priorities that
  happen to a person at this time in life. Our house was quite
  small, and in particular had one bathroom that needed its floor
  replaced twice due to dry rot caused by the children's
  shenanigans in the bathtub. But in the back was a small creek, a
  little grove of redwoods, and three wonderful apple trees which
  kept Anita busy canning apple sauce in the fall. Nat and my
  second child, Todd, who was born two years later, used to play
  endlessly back there. The larger environment was also quite
  rural. On occasion I would take one of the kids in a backpack
  across the street and up into Briones park to explore the wild
  oak woods and the herds of horses that roamed freely on the
  ridges.<br>
  <br>
  We lived in this house many years, but the day finally came when
  we had to sell out and move to Stanford. I remember the last day
  very clearly. The moving van had left, Anita was just driving
  away with the last load of stuff, and Todd and I were left to
  vacuum up the last bits of dust. The house was echoing, as houses
  do when they have no people in them. I pointed out to him that
  this was the sound of ghosts. Here was where my children were
  born. Here was where we had run madly around the apple trees and
  smashed the violets. Here was where I had planted the Monterey
  pine which was now shading the patio. Todd stared at me for a
  moment and then said with obvious annoyance, "Let's go,
  Daddy."<br>
  <b><br>
              Stanford</b><br>
  My career at Livermore was effectively derailed by the fractional
  quantum hall theory, for I became so famous on account of it that
  I had to travel constantly and could not begin learning the
  classified parts of the Laboratory's business. I am to this day
  rather poorly educated about nuclear weapons, and I know
  virtually nothing about laser fusion capsules. The Lab had plenty
  of money in those days, and the head of H-Division, Hal Graboske,
  always supported my requests for travel, including once a trip to
  Denmark, Finland, and the Soviet Union. But the handwriting was
  on the wall. In 1984 offers began pouring in from universities,
  and there was a particularly good one from Stanford. Stanford at
  that time had a terrific solid state physics faculty and was
  quite a bit smaller, and therefore more malleable, than my old
  alma mater Berkeley. Also Anita and I were worried about the
  anti-intellectual attitudes towards the University of California
  expressed by the state legislature, worries that proved
  well-founded when a few years later salaries were capped,
  teaching loads were increased, and the state budget was not
  passed on time, causing faculty to be paid in IOU's. I had
  originally turned down all these university offer on the theory
  that the research environment would be better inside at Livermore
  where somebody else took care of salaries and research support.
  But Stan Wojcicki, Sandy Fetter, and Mac Beasley were
  particularly persistent, and I got sound advice from both Berni
  Alder and Anita not to let this train go by, so in the end I
  relented and accepted their offer. Little did I know that in a
  few years the Cold War would end, the Department of Energy's
  budget would be squeezed, and the "expendable" public-domain
  science activities paid for by fat budgets would be the first
  thing to go. This is a well-known effect in industrial
  laboratories, as the recent histories of Bell Labs, Xerox, and
  IBM Research have sadly reminded us. But at this time I accepted
  mainly because of Berni's advice.<br>
  <br>
  When I moved to Stanford I began to pursue the line of research I
  have been following ever since, namely trying to understand the
  larger implications of fractional quantum hall discovery. The
  historical significance of the effect is a matter of some debate,
  but my own view is that it sets a precedent for completely
  trivial equations of motion to generate particles carrying
  fractional quantum numbers and a concomitant set of gauge forces
  between them, both of these also being postulates of the Standard
  Model. Thus I think the trail leads ultimately to big questions
  about the universe and cosmology. Progress in this direction has
  been painfully slow because the experiments have not cooperated.
  Most of the leads for finding other effects in nature analogous
  to the fractional quantum Hall effect turned out to be false,
  including particularly high-temperature superconductors, which
  have been my main materials physics research interest here for
  the last several years. However, Phil Anderson's idea that the
  phenomenology of the cuprates might be related to the known
  behavior of 1-dimensional antiferromagnets, which has a beautiful
  formal relationship to the fractional quantum hall ground state
  discovered by Duncan Haldane and Sriram Shastry, is still very
  intriguing, especially since the particles carrying fractional
  quantum numbers in the latter system, which we call spinons, are
  relativistic.<br>
  <br>
  My experience with high-temperature superconductors has been very
  different from the fractional quantum Hall effect. The problem
  has been difficult to formulate clearly, and progress has been
  slow. I do not know whether this is due to an historical paradigm
  shift or just intellectual incompetence on our part, but I
  certainly find myself yearning for the good old days when the
  entirety of a problem could be understood in 10 seconds. It has
  been my good fortune to have an excellent group of
  experimentalists at Stanford with whom to work, notably Aharon
  Kapitulnik, Ted Geballe, and Mac Beasley, known collectively as
  the KGB, and Z.-X. Shen. I predicted optical rotary activity in
  bulk cuprate superconductors, which was unfortunately disproved
  by Aharon, although the symmetry breaking I predicted was
  eventually found by Laura Greene at the University of Illinois. I
  also predicted the so-called large pseudogap in the cuprates that
  was eventually discovered by Prof. Shen in photoemission from
  samples in extreme underdoping. I have also done some
  mathematical physics work for which I am very proud, most notably
  the invention of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid vacuum and
  "anyon" superconductivity, although these things broke with my
  tradition of going directly to nature for inspiration and are in
  this sense flawed.<br>
  <br>
  My job at Stanford is rather different from the ones I had held
  previously in that my own ambitions must take a back seat to the
  well-being of the students with whom I work. But this actually is
  not very difficult. My own sons are almost college age now, and
  my rule is simply to do for my students exactly what I hope
  someone else will do for my sons when the time comes: I teach
  them to have faith in themselves and in their own compass, to
  listen to nature to find truth, to love knowledge for the sake of
  itself, and to strive for greatness. A few days after the Nobel
  Prize announcement I got the following wonderful e-mail from
  Andrew Tikofsky, one of my best graduate students, who is now on
  Wall Street:<br>
  <br>
  Hi Bob, Ian McDonald, Steve Strong, and I are getting together
  for a beer near Grand Central Station this coming Tuesday in
  honor of your prize. You are cordially invited to attend.</p>
