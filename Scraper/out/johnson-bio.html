  <h1>Eyvind Johnson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="johnson.jpg" class="bio-img">Born in 1900 at Svartbj&ouml;rnsbyn near Boden in the 
              north of Sweden.<br>
  <br>
  Parents, Olof Petter J., stonecutter from V&auml;rmland, and
  Cevia Gustafsdotter from Blekinge. There were six children in the
  family, of whom E.J. was the next youngest. His father fell ill
  with silicosis about 1904, and E.J. was taken care of by his
  childless aunt and her husband, stonecutter Anders Johan Rost. At
  the age of fourteen he left his foster-parents, of whom he was
  very fond, to look for work near the home where he was
  born.<br>
  <br>
  He did many different kinds of work, first at the timber sorting
  town near S&auml;vast on the Lule River, then at the Bj&ouml;rn
  brickworks. Between 1915 and 1919 he was a sawmill worker, a
  ticket seller and usher at a cinema, and a projectionist; then
  assistant to plumbers and electricians. In 1918 he was a
  locomotive cleaner at the engine sheds in Boden, and for a time
  during the winter, a stoker on cargo trains between Boden and
  Haparanda. Again, sawmill worker for a while, then hay-presser,
  then out of work. Borrowing money, he travelled down to
  Stockholm, where he got work at LM Ericsson's big workshop in
  Tulegatan. The metalworkers' strike broke out in 1920 and he
  tried to live on what he wrote, with very meagre results. At the
  same time, together with some other young budding writers, he
  founded the literary magazine <i>V&aring;r Nutid</i> (Our Present
  Day), which appeared in six issues. He then became a member the
  society of future writers which called itself <i>De
  gr&ouml;na</i> (The Green Ones).<br>
  <br>
  From the autumn of 1920 to the autumn of 1921, together with two
  or three friends, he worked at haymaking and timber-felling on a
  small farm in Uppland, where he had spare time and peace in which
  to read and write.<br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1921 he went to Germany - by cargo boat to Kiel,
  by train to Berlin, and a few months later he continued via the
  Rhineland to Paris, where he earned his living writing for
  Swedish papers, as a cement worker, and then as a dishwasher at a
  big hotel near the Gare du Nord. Then back to Berlin, where he
  remained until the autumn of 1923, when he returned home to
  Sweden.<br>
  <br>
  His first book, <i>De fyra fr&auml;mlingarna</i> (The Four
  Strangers), a collection of short stories, was finished in the
  spring of 1924 and published during the autumn. During a winter
  visit to the North, he finished his second book, which was
  published in the autumn of 1925. By then E.J. was back in France,
  where he was to live for over five years.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927 he was married at Saint-Leu-La F&ocirc;ret to Aase
  Christofersen. Their son Tore was born there in 1928. In 1930 the
  family moved home to Sweden.<br>
  <br>
  After Aase Johnson's death, E.J. married Cilla Frankenhaeuser.
  They have two children, Maria, born 1944, and Anders, born 1946.
  From 1947 to 1950, E.J. and his family lived in Switzerland and
  England, and after that at Saltsj&ouml;baden.</p>
