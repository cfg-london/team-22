  <h1>Arne Tiselius - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tiselius.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Arne Wilhelm Kaurin
  Tiselius</b> was born August 10, 1902, in Stockholm. After the
  early loss of his father, the family moved to Gothenburg where he
  went to school, and after graduation at the local "Realgymnasium"
  in 1921, he studied at the University of
  Uppsala, specializing in chemistry. He became research
  assistant in <a href="../1926/index.html">The Svedberg</a>'s
  laboratory in 1925 and obtained his doctor's degree in 1930 on a
  thesis "The moving-boundary method of studying the
  electrophoresis of proteins" (published in <i>Nova Acta Regiae
  Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis</i>, Ser. IV, Vol. 7, No. 4)
  and was appointed Docent (Assistant Professor) in Chemistry from
  1930 on. During the years 1931-1935 Tiselius published a number
  of papers on diffusion and adsorption phenomena in naturally
  occurring base-exchanging zeolites, and these studies were
  continued during a year's visit to H.S. Taylor's laboratory in
  Princeton with support of a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship.
  Stimulated by many contacts with American biochemists and
  physical chemists during this visit, Tiselius on his return to
  Uppsala resumed his interest in proteins, and the application of
  physical methods to biochemical problems in general. This led
  among other things to a much improved method of electrophoretic
  analysis, published in the <i>Transactions of the Faraday
  Society</i>, 33 (1937) 524. This method as applied to the study
  of serum proteins and to a number of other biochemical problems
  kept Tiselius and an increasing number of collaborators occupied
  for the following years. In 1938 a special research professorship
  was established for Tiselius through a donation to the University
  of Uppsala by Major Herbert Jacobsson and his wife. Some space
  was put at the disposal of the new professor in the Institute of
  Physical Chemistry (Prof. The Svedberg). In 1946 biochemistry was
  established as an independent department and in 1950-1952
  obtained a new building, the present Institute of
  Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Under the leadership of Tiselius this institute has contributed
  to the development and improvement of a number of useful methods
  in biochemistry, such as electrophoresis, chromatography, phase
  partition, gel filtration, etc. These methods and others have
  been applied to studies of large molecular weight substances,
  chiefly proteins and enzymes, but also polysaccharides (dextran)
  and nucleic acids. There has always been a close contact between
  the methodological work and the research into special problems
  where the methods find their application. Tiselius took an active
  part in the reorganization of scientific research in Sweden in
  the years following World War II. Thus he was Chairman of the
  Swedish Natural Science Research Council 1946-1950, and Chairman
  of the Research Committee of the Swedish Cancer Society
  1951-1955. He was President of the International Union of Pure
  and Applied Chemistry 1951-1955, became Vice President of the
  Nobel Foundation in 1947 and President since 1960. He has also
  served as member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry since
  1946.<br>
  <br>
  He was married (1930) with Ingrid Margareta (Greta) Dal&eacute;n,
  daughter of city judge Per Dal&eacute;n of Gothenburg. They have
  two children: Eva (b. 1932), married to Dr. Torgny Bohlin, Lund;
  and Per (b. 1934), physician at the Academic Hospital,
  Uppsala.</p>
