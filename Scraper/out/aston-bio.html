  <h1>Francis W. Aston - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="aston.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Francis William Aston</b> was born in
  September 1877 at Harborne, Birmingham, England, the third of a
  family of seven children. He was educated at Harborne Vicarage
  School and Malvern College where his interest in science was
  aroused. In 1894 he entered Mason College, Birmingham (later to
  become the University of Birmingham) where he studied chemistry
  under Frankland and Tilden, and Physics under Poynting. His
  winning of the Forster Scholarship in 1898 enabled him to work on
  the optical properties of tartaric acid derivatives; the results
  of this work were published in 1901.<br>
  <br>
  Leaving academic life for a time, he worked for three years as a
  chemist in the laboratory of a brewery. At about this time,
  however, his interest in physics, rather than chemistry, began to
  predominate; his aptitude for mechanical contrivance showed
  itself in his design and construction of new types of pumps for
  evacuating vessels. From this stemmed his interest in gas
  discharge phenomena in evacuated tubes.<br>
  <br>
  In 1903 he obtained a scholarship to Birmingham University (as it
  had now become) to work on the properties of the Crookes Dark
  Space in discharge tubes. Within a short time he had discovered
  the phenomenon which is known as the Aston Dark Space. At the end
  of 1909 he accepted the invitation of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">Sir J.J.Thomson</a> to work
  as his assistant at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, on studies
  of positive rays. It was during this period that he obtained
  definite evidence for the existence of two isotopes of the inert
  gas neon.<br>
  <br>
  This research was interrupted by the War of 1914-1918, during
  which time Aston worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment,
  Farnborough, where he studied the effect of atmospheric
  conditions on aeroplane fabrics and dopes (i.e. synthetic
  coatings).<br>
  <br>
  Returning to the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919, he again attacked
  the problem of the separation of the isotopes of neon. He quickly
  achieved success in this by his invention of the mass
  spectrograph, an apparatus in which the ingenious use of
  electromagnetic focusing enabled him to utilize the very slight
  differences in mass of the two isotopes to effect their
  separation. Extending this principle to other chemical elements,
  he discovered, in a series of measurements, no less than 212 of
  the naturally occurring isotopes. From the results of this work
  he was able to formulate the so-called Whole Number Rule which
  states that, the mass of the oxygen isotope being defined, all
  the other isotopes have masses that are very nearly whole
  numbers.<br>
  <br>
  Aston continued to make measurements, using an improved
  instrument, with ever-increasing refinement and precision. He
  observed and was able to measure those deviations from the Whole
  Number Rule which were to become so important in the field of
  atomic energy.<br>
  <br>
  The results of his work were published in the <i>Proceedings of
  the Royal Society</i> and in the <i>Philosophical Magazine.</i>
  He was also the author of the books <i>Isotopes</i> (1922;
  revised edition 1941) and of <i>Structural Units of the Material
  Universe</i> (1923).<br>
  <br>
  Aston was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity
  College in 1920, in which year he also received the Mackenzie
  Davidson Medal of the R&ouml;ntgen Society. In 1921 he was made a
  Fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded the Society's Hughes
  Medal the following year, the same year that he received the
  Nobel Prize. The John Scott and the Paterno medals were given to
  him in 1923, the Royal medal in 1938, and he was Duddell medalist
  of the Physical Society in 1941.<br>
  <br>
  He was an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and
  of the Accademia dei Lincei, and held honorary doctorates of the
  Universities of Birmingham and Dublin.<br>
  <br>
  Aston, a bachelor, was an enthusiastic sportsman; skiing, rock
  climbing, tennis and swimming were among the sports in which he
  excelled. He was also keen musician, playing the piano, violin
  and the cello.<br>
  <br>
  He died at Cambridge on November 20, 1945.</p>
