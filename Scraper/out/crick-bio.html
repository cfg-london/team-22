  <h1>Francis Crick - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="crick.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Francis Harry Compton Crick</b> was born
  on June 8th, 1916, at Northampton, England, being the elder child
  of Harry Crick and Annie Elizabeth Wilkins. He has one brother,
  A. F. Crick, who is a doctor in New Zealand.<br>
  <br>
  Crick was educated at Northampton Grammar School and Mill Hill
  School, London. He studied physics at University College,
  London, obtained a B.Sc. in 1937, and started research for a
  Ph.D. under Prof E. N. da C. Andrade, but this was interrupted by
  the outbreak of war in 1939. During the war he worked as a
  scientist for the British Admiralty, mainly in connection with
  magnetic and acoustic mines. He left the Admiralty in 1947 to
  study biology.<br>
  <br>
  Supported by a studentship from the Medical Research
  Council and with some financial help from his family, Crick
  went to Cambridge and worked at the Strangeways Research
  Laboratory. In 1949 he joined the Medical Research Council Unit
  headed by <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">M. F.
  Perutz</a> of which he has been a member ever since. This Unit
  was for many years housed in the Cavendish Laboratory
  Cambridge, but in 1962 moved into a large new building - the
  Medical
  Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology - on the New
  Hospital site. He became a research student for the second time
  in 1950, being accepted as a member of Caius College,
  Cambridge, and obtained a Ph.D. in 1954 on a thesis entitled
  &laquo;X-ray diffraction: polypeptides and proteins&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  During the academic year 1953-1954 Crick was on leave of absence
  at the Protein Structure Project of the Brooklyn Polytechnic in
  Brooklyn, New York. He has also lectured at Harvard, as a
  Visiting Professor, on two occasions, and has visited other
  laboratories in the States for short periods.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 Crick knew no biology and practically no organic
  chemistry or crystallography, so that much of the next few years
  was spent in learning the elements of these subjects. During this
  period, together with W. Cochran and V. Vand he worked out the
  general theory of X-ray diffraction by a helix, and at the same
  time as <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">L.
  Pauling</a> and R. B. Corey, suggested that the alpha-keratin
  pattern was due to alpha-helices coiled round each other.<br>
  <br>
  A critical influence in Crick's career was his friendship,
  beginning in 1951, with <a href="index.html">J. D. Watson</a>,
  then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of the
  double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme.
  Crick and Watson subsequently suggested a general theory for the
  structure of small viruses.<br>
  <br>
  Crick in collaboration with A. Rich has proposed structures for
  polyglycine II and collagen and (with A. Rich, D. R. Davies, and
  J. D.Watson) a structure for polyadenylic acid.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years Crick, in collaboration with S. Brenner, has
  concentrated more on biochemistry and genetics leading to ideas
  about protein synthesis (the &laquo;adaptor hypothesis&raquo;), and
  the genetic code, and in particular to work on acridine-type
  mutants.<br>
  <br>
  Crick was made an F.R.S. in 1959. He was awarded the Prix Charles
  Leopold Meyer of the French Academy of Sciences in 1961, and the
  Award of Merit of the Gairdner Foundation in 1962. Together with
  J. D. Watson he was a Warren Triennial Prize Lecturer in 1959 and
  received a Research Corporation Award in 1962. With J. D. Watson
  and <a href="index.html">M. H. F. Wilkins</a> he was presented
  with a Lasker Foundation Award in 1960. In 1962 he was elected a
  Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a
  Fellow of University College, London. He was a Fellow of Churchill
  College, Cambridge, in 1960-1961, and is now a non-resident
  Fellow of the Salk
  Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego,
  California.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 Crick married Ruth Doreen Dodd. Their son, Michael F. C.
  Crick is a scientist. They were divorced in 1947. In 1949 Crick
  married Odile Speed. They have two daughters, Gabrielle A. Crick
  and Jacqueline M. T. Crick. The family lives in a house
  appropriately called &laquo;The Golden Helix&raquo;, in which Crick
  likes to find his recreation in conversation with his
  friends.</p>
