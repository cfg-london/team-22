  <h1>Heinrich Wieland - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wieland.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Heinrich Otto Wieland</b> was born as
  the son of W&uuml;rttemberger parents, Dr. Theodor Wieland and
  Elise Blum, on June 4, 1877, in Pforzheim where his father was a
  pharmaceutical chemist. He studied at the Universities of
  Munich, Berlin and Stuttgart, and then returned to the Baeyer
  Laboratory in Munich where, in 1901, he received his doctorate
  under Johannes Thiele. In Munich, where he had chosen to make his
  home, he received in 1904 the <i>venia legendi</i> and in 1913 a
  senior lectureship in the University Chemical Laboratory. In 1917
  he transferred his activities to the Technical College nearby as
  a full Professor. From 1917-1918 he was busy at the Kaiser
  Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Dahlem working on Defence. In 1921 he
  accepted a call to Freiburg and in 1925 returned to Munich at
  <a href="../1915/index.html">Willst&auml;tter's</a> request to
  succeed him in his Chair in the University of Munich. For
  twenty-seven years the destiny of the Munich laboratory lay in
  his hands.<br>
  <br>
  Wieland's scientific work, recorded in four hundred publications,
  covers a wide field in the realm of Organic Chemistry and
  Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  For several decades Wieland's attention was claimed by the
  organic nitrogenous compounds. His brilliant studies of the
  reaction of nitrogen oxides with orefins and aromatics, the
  clarification of furoxanes as well as the classical experiments
  with fulminic acid and its polymerization may be chosen as
  examples. In the same connection, Wieland succeeded in the first
  production of stable organic nitrogen radicals, of diphenyl
  nitrogen and its N-oxide. The proof of short-lived radicals in
  solution reactions involved him in an extensive series of
  experiments whose importance for the modern development of
  organic radical chemistry can hardly be overestimated.<br>
  <br>
  In later years Wieland was entirely devoted to the chemistry of
  natural substances. His contributions to the clarification of the
  structure of morphine and strychnine, the constitution and
  synthesis of the lobelia alkaloid and the research into the
  curare alkaloid were masterpieces. Work on the poisonous agent in
  the "death cap" mushroom led to the isolation of the crystalline
  cyclopeptides phalloidine and amanitine; work on the pigment of
  butterflies led to the discovery of the biologically important
  class of pterin compounds. The publications which began in 1912
  on the subject of bile acids culminated in 1932 in the
  clarification of the carbon framework of the steroids, whose
  general importance in Nature Wieland recognized.<br>
  <br>
  Much of Wieland's life work was occupied by the investigations
  into the oxidation processes in living cells, which enabled him
  to recognize dehydrogenation as a universal oxidation principle
  in Nature. This work restored the unity of Organic Chemistry and
  Biochemistry which had been lost since the time of Liebig.<br>
  <br>
  It is not surprising that Wieland was accorded all the honours
  that the scientific world has to offer. He was a member of the
  great learned societies of the world, he was awarded a Nobel
  Prize in 1927, he received the Order of Merit and the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1945/index.html">Otto Hahn</a> Prize, and
  for twenty years he was Editor of <i>Justus Liebigs Annalen der
  Chemie</i>. Wieland's great school is evidence of his importance
  as an academic teacher.<br>
  <br>
  In an age of increasing specialization, Wieland was among the
  last of those who were able to enjoy an encyclopaedic knowledge
  of the whole of Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In 1908, he married Josephine Bartmann of Munich. They had three
  sons, Wolfgang, a doctor of pharmaceutical chemistry; Theodor,
  professor of chemistry in the University of Frankfurt; and Otto,
  professor of medicine in the University of Munich, and one
  daughter, Eva, who is married to Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/index.html">Feodor Lynen</a>, professor
  of biochemistry in the University of Munich, Nobel Laureate in
  Physiology or Medicine, 1964.<br>
  <br>
  The great scholar's life was ruled by hard work, but also by love
  and kindness both to his pupils and to his family; it ended
  shortly after his 80th birthday, on August 5, 1957, in
  Starnberg.</p>
