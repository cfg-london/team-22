  <h1>Victor Grignard - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="grignard.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fran&ccedil;ois Auguste Victor
  Grignard</b> was born in Cherbourg on May 6, 1871. He attended
  local schools during 1883-87 and in 1889 he won a scholarship to
  the &Eacute;cole Normale Sp&eacute;cial at Cluny. After two years,
  the school, which was intended to produce teachers for modern
  secondary schools, was closed because of a dispute between
  supporters of the "classic" and "modern" methods of secondary
  education. Grignard and his classmates were transferred to other
  establishments in order to finish the entitlement of their
  scholarships and Grignard himself had the good fortune to join
  the University of Lyons, where he was attached to the
  Facult&eacute; des Sciences. He was unsuccessful in the licentiate
  examination in mathematics and in 1892 he left to fulfil his
  military service. Towards the end of 1893 he was demobilized and
  returned to Lyons to gain the degree Licenci&eacute; &egrave;s
  Sciences Math&eacute;matiques in 1894.<br>
  <br>
  In December, 1894, after some persuasion, he accepted a junior
  post in the Facult&eacute; des Sciences, working with Louis
  Bouveault: he was later promoted to pr&eacute;parateur and it was
  then that he began his long association with Philippe Barbier. He
  obtained the degree Licenci&eacute;-&egrave;s-Sciences Physiques and
  in 1898 he became chef des travaux pratiques and also wrote his
  first paper, jointly with Barbier. In 1901 he submitted his
  brilliant thesis on organic magnesium compounds <i>Sur les
  Combinaisons organomagn&eacute;siennes mixtes</i>, and was awarded
  the degree Docteur &egrave;s Sciences de Lyons.<br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Ma&icirc;tre de Conf&eacute;rences, University of
  Besan&ccedil;on in 1905 but he returned to Lyons in the following
  year, occupying a similar position until his election as
  Professeur-adjoint de Chimie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale in 1908. In 1909
  he took charge of the Department of Organic Chemistry at Nancy,
  in succession to Blaise who had moved to Paris, and in the
  following year he became Professor of Organic Chemistry. At the
  beginning of the First World War, Grignard was mobilized in his
  former rank of corporal, but he was soon to be commissioned to
  study, at Nancy, the cracking of benzols and, later, to work on
  problems of chemical warfare in Paris. He visited the United
  States during 1917-18 as the chemical representative on the
  Tardieu Committee and he delivered a lecture at the Mellon
  Institute. After the war he returned to Nancy and in 1919 he
  succeeded Barbier as Professor of General Chemistry at Lyons. In
  1921 he took an additional post as Director of l'&Eacute;cole de
  Chimie Industrielle de Lyons, becoming a member of the University
  Council, and in 1929 he became Dean of the Faculty of
  Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Grignard's first investigations concerned "ethyl <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-isopropylacetobutyrate and the stereoisomeric
  diisopropylbutenedicarboxylic acids" and studies of branched
  unsaturated hydrocarbons. In 1899, on Barbier's recommendation,
  he studied organomagnesium compounds and his discovery of the
  classic preparation of magnesium alkyl halides was first
  communicated by <a href="../1906/index.html">Henri Moissan</a> to
  the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences on May 11, 1900. He quickly
  developed the immediate applications of these elegant and simple
  reagents, which were destined to play such an important part in
  organic synthesis that, at the time of his death in 1935, there
  were over 6,000 references to them in the literature. He used the
  agents to prepare and study the more exotic alcohols, ketones,
  keto-esters, nitriles and terpene compounds and he developed a
  method for the synthesis of fulvenes. He has also been concerned
  with work on the constitution of unsaturated compounds by
  quantitative ozonization, condensation of aldehydes and ketones,
  ketone splitting of tertiary alcohols, the cracking of
  hydrocarbons in presence of aluminium chloride and catalytic
  hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes under reduced
  pressures.<br>
  <br>
  Grignard was the author of some 170 publications on his
  researches and, at his death, he was working to fulfil his
  ambition to see a great chemical reference work in the French
  language. Two volumes of his <i>Trait&eacute; de Chimie
  Organique</i> (Treatise on organic chemistry) had already been
  published, two more were ready for the press and the editorial
  work for another two was well advanced: it was later to be
  finished by his collaborators. In 1937, two of his students, Jean
  Cologne and Roger Grignard, published <i>Pr&eacute;cis de Chimie
  Organique</i> (Survey of organic chemistry) which is based on
  Grignard's lecture course in organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Grignard shared the Cahours Prize (Institut de France) in 1901
  and again in 1902, when he also won the Berthelot Medal. In 1905
  he was awarded the Prix Jecker and in 1912 the Lavoisier Medal.
  In 1912 the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was conferred upon him, on
  account of his discovery of the so called Grignard reagent,
  sharing the prize with Paul Sabatier who received it because of
  his method of hydrogenating organic compounds by means of finely
  divided metals. In the order of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur, he was
  appointed Chevalier (1912), Officier (1920) and Commandeur
  (1933). He was also Honorary Professor, University of Nancy
  (1931); he held the honorary doctorate of the Universities of
  Brussels and Louvain, and he was Honorary Fellow of the Chemical
  Society (London) and foreign member of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1912/grignard-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Royal Swedish Academy of
  Sciences</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Grignard married Augustine Marie Boulant in 1910 and their only
  son, Roger, followed in the academic footsteps of his father:
  they also had one daughter. He died on December 13, 1935.</p>
