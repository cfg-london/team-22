  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  Addressing you, as the winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, is a
  Polish worker from the Gdansk Shipyard, one of the founders of
  the independent trade union movement in Poland. It would be the
  simplest thing for me to say that I am not worthy of that great
  distinction. Yet, when I recall the hour when the news of the
  prize has spread throughout my country, the hour of rising
  emotions and universal joy of the people who felt that they have
  a moral and spiritual share in the award, I am obligated to say
  that I regard it as a sign of recognition that the movement to
  which I gave all my strength has served well the community of
  men.</p>

  <p>I accept the award with my deepest respects
  for its meaning and significance, and, at the same time, I am
  conscious that the honor is bestowed not on me personally, but
  upon "Solidarity", upon the people and the ideas for which we
  have fought and shall continue to do so in the spirit of peace
  and justice. And there is nothing I desire more than that the
  granting of the award should help the cause of peace and justice
  in my country and the world over.</p>

  <p>My first words which I address to you, and
  through you to all people, are those which I have known since my
  childhood days: <i>Peace to men of goodwill</i> - all and
  everywhere, in the North and South, East and West.</p>

  <p>I belong to a nation which over the past
  centuries has experienced many hardships and reverses. The world
  reacted with silence or with mere sympathy when Polish frontiers
  were crossed by invading armies and the sovereign state had to
  succumb to brutal force. Our national history has so often filled
  us with bitterness and the feeling of helplessness. But this was,
  above all, a great lesson in hope. Thanking you for the award I
  would like, first of all, to express my gratitude and my belief
  that it serves to enhance the Polish hope. The hope of the nation
  which throughout the nineteenth century had not for a moment
  reconciled itself with the loss of independence, and fighting for
  its own freedom, fought at the same time for the freedom of other
  nations. The hope whose elations and downfalls during the past
  forty years - i.e. the span of my own life - have been marked by
  the memorable and dramatic dates: 1944, 1956, 1970, 1976,
  1980.</p>

  <p>And if I permit myself at this juncture and
  on this occasion to mention my own life, it is because I believe
  that the prize has been granted to me as to one of many.</p>

  <p>My youth passed at the time of the
  country's reconstruction from the ruins and ashes of the war in
  which my nation never bowed to the enemy paying the highest price
  in the struggle. I belong to the generation of workers who, born
  in the villages and hamlets of rural Poland, had the opportunity
  to acquire education and find employment in industry, becoming in
  the course conscious of their rights and importance in society.
  Those were the years of awakening aspirations of workers and
  peasants, but also years of many wrongs, degradations and lost
  illusions. I was barely 13 years old when, in June 1956, the
  desperate struggle of the workers of Poznan for bread and freedom
  was suppressed in blood. Thirteen also was the boy - Romek
  Strzalkowski - who was killed in the struggle. It was the
  "Solidarity" union which 25 years later demanded that tribute be
  paid to his memory. In December 1970 when workers' protest
  demonstrations engulfed the towns of the Baltic coast, I was a
  worker in the Gdansk Shipyard and one of the organizers of the
  strikes. The memory of my fellow workers who then lost their
  lives, the bitter memory of violence and despair has become for
  me a lesson never to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Few years later, in June 1976, the strike
  of the workers at Ursus and Radom was a new experience which not
  only strengthened my belief in the justness of the working
  people's demands and aspirations, but has also indicated the
  urgent need for their solidarity. This conviction brought me, in
  the summer of 1978, to the Free Trade Unions - formed by a group
  of courageous and dedicated people who came out in the defense of
  the workers' rights and dignity. In July and August of 1980 a
  wave of strikes swept throughout Poland. The issue at stake was
  then something much bigger than only material conditions of
  existence. My road of life has, at the time of the struggle,
  brought me back to the shipyard in Gdansk. The whole country has
  joined forces with the workers of Gdansk and Szczecin. The
  agreements of Gdansk, Szczecin and Jastrzebie were eventually
  signed and the "Solidarity" union has thus come into being.</p>

  <p>The great Polish strikes, of which I have
  just spoken, were events of a special nature. Their character was
  determined on the one hand by the menacing circumstances in which
  they were held and, on the other, by their objectives. The Polish
  workers who participated in the strike actions, in fact
  represented the nation.</p>

  <p>When I recall my own path of life I cannot
  but speak of the violence, hatred and lies. A lesson drawn from
  such experiences, however, was that we can effectively oppose
  violence only if we ourselves do not resort to it.</p>

  <p>In the brief history of those eventful
  years, the Gdansk Agreement stands out as a great charter of the
  rights of the working people which nothing can ever destroy.
  Lying at the root of the social agreements of 1980 are the
  courage, sense of responsibility, and the solidarity of the
  working people. Both sides have then recognized that an accord
  must be reached if bloodshed is to be prevented. The agreement
  then signed has been and shall remain the model and the only
  method to follow, the only one that gives a chance of finding a
  middle course between the use of force and a hopeless struggle.
  Our firm conviction that ours is a just cause and that we must
  find a peaceful way to attain our goals gave us the strength and
  the awareness of the limits beyond which we must not go. What
  until then seemed impossible to achieve has become a fact of
  life. We have won the right to association in trade unions
  independent from the authorities, founded and shaped by the
  working people themselves.</p>

  <p>Our union - the "Solidarity" - has grown
  into a powerful movement for social and moral liberation. The
  people freed from the bondage of fear and apathy, called for
  reforms and improvements. We fought a difficult struggle for our
  existence. That was and still is a great opportunity for the
  whole country. I think that it marked also the road to be taken
  by the authorities, if they thought of a state governed in
  cooperation and participation of all citizens. "Solidarity", as a
  trade union movement, did not reach for power, nor did it turn
  against the established constitutional order. During the 15
  months of "Solidarity's" legal existence nobody was killed or
  wounded as a result of its activities. Our movement expanded by
  leaps and bounds. But we were compelled to conduct an
  uninterrupted struggle for our rights and freedom of activity
  while at the same time imposing upon ourselves the unavoidable
  self-limitations. The program of our movement stems from the
  fundamental moral laws and order. The sole and basic source of
  our strength is the solidarity of workers, peasants and the
  intelligentsia, the solidarity of the nation, the solidarity of
  people who seek to live in dignity, truth, and in harmony with
  their conscience.</p>

  <p>Let the veil of silence fall presently over
  what happened afterwards. Silence, too, can speak out.</p>

  <p>One thing, however, must be said here and
  now on this solemn occasion: the Polish people have not been
  subjugated nor have they chosen the road of violence and
  fratricidal bloodshed.</p>

  <p>We shall not yield to violence. We shall
  not be deprived of union freedoms. We shall never agree with
  sending people to prison for their convictions. The gates of
  prisons must be thrown open and persons sentenced for defending
  union and civic rights must be set free. The announced trials of
  eleven leading members of our movement must never be held. All
  those already sentenced or still awaiting trials for their union
  activities or their convictions - should return to their homes
  and be allowed to live and work in their country.</p>

  <p>The defense of our rights and our dignity,
  as well as efforts never to let ourselves to be overcome by the
  feeling of hatred - this is the road we have chosen.</p>

  <p>The Polish experience, which the Nobel
  Peace Prize has put into limelight, has been a difficult, a
  dramatic one. Yet, I believe that it looks to the future. The
  things that have taken place in human conscience and re-shaped
  human attitudes cannot be obliterated or destroyed. They exist
  and will remain.</p>

  <p>We are the heirs of those national
  aspirations thanks to which our people could never be made into
  an inert mass with no will of their own. We want to live with the
  belief that law means law and justice means justice, that our
  toil has a meaning and is not wasted, that our culture grows and
  develops in freedom.</p>

  <p>As a nation we have the right to decide our
  own affairs, to mould our own future. This does not pose any
  danger to anybody. Our nation is fully aware of the
  responsibility for its own fate in the complicated situation of
  the contemporary world.</p>

  <p>Despite everything that has been going on
  in my country during the past two years, I am still convinced
  that we have no alternative but to come to an agreement, and that
  the difficult problems which Poland is now facing can be resolved
  only through a real dialogue between state authorities and the
  people.</p>

  <p>During his latest visit to the land of his
  fathers, Pope John Paul II had this to say on this point:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Why do the working people in Poland - and everywhere else
    for that matter - have the right to such a dialogue? It is
    because the working man is not a mere tool of production, but
    he is the subject which throughout the process of production
    takes precedence over the capital. By the fact of his labor,
    the man becomes the true master of his workshop, of the process
    of labor, of the fruits of his toil and of their distribution.
    He is also ready for sacrifices if he feels that he is a real
    partner and has a say in the just division of what has been
    produced by common effort".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is, however, precisely this feeling that
  we lack. It is hardly possible to build anything if frustration,
  bitterness and a mood of helplessness prevail. He who once became
  aware of the power of solidarity and who breathed the air of
  freedom will not be crushed. The dialogue is possible and we have
  the right to it. The wall raised by the course of events must not
  become an insurmountable obstacle. My most ardent desire is that
  my country will recapture its historic opportunity for a peaceful
  evolution and that Poland will prove to the world that even the
  most complex situations can be solved by a dialogue and not by
  force.</p>

  <p>We are ready for the dialogue. We are also
  prepared, at any time, to put our reasons and demands to the
  judgement of the people. We have no doubts as to what verdict
  would be returned.</p>

  <p>I think that all nations of the world have
  the right to life in dignity. I believe that, sooner or later,
  the rights of individuals, of families, and of entire communities
  will be respected in every corner of the world. Respect for civic
  and human rights in Poland and for our national identity is in
  the best interest of all Europe. For, in the interest of Europe
  is a peaceful Poland, and the Polish aspirations to freedom will
  never be stifled. The dialogue in Poland is the only way to
  achieving internal peace and that is why it is also an
  indispensable element of peace in Europe.</p>

  <p>I realize that the strivings of the Polish
  people gave rise, and still do so, to the feelings of
  understanding and solidarity all over the world. Allow me from
  this place to express my most profound thanks to all those who
  help Poland and the Poles. May I also voice my desire that our
  wish for the dialogue and for respect of human rights in Poland
  should be strengthened by a positive thought. My country is in
  the grips of a major economic crisis. This is causing dramatic
  consequences for the very existence of Polish families. A
  permanent economic crisis in Poland may also have serious
  repercussions for Europe. Thus, Poland ought to be helped and
  deserves help.</p>

  <p>I am looking at the present-day world with
  the eyes of a worker - a worker who belongs to a nation so
  tragically experienced by the war. I most sincerely wish that the
  world in which we live be free from the threat of a nuclear
  holocaust and from the ruinous arms race. It is my cherished
  desire that peace be not separated from freedom which is the
  right of every nation. This I desire and for this I pray.</p>

  <p>May I repeat that the fundamental necessity
  in Poland is now understanding and dialogue. I think that the
  same applies to the whole world: we should go on talking, we must
  not close any doors or do anything that would block the road to
  an understanding. And we must remember that only peace built on
  the foundations of justice and moral order can be a lasting
  one.</p>

  <p>In many parts of the world the people are
  searching for a solution which would link the two basic values:
  peace and justice. The two are like bread and salt for mankind.
  Every nation and every community have the inalienable right to
  these values. No conflicts can be resolved without doing
  everything possible to follow that road. Our times require that
  these aspirations which exist the world over must be
  recognized.</p>

  <p>Our efforts and harsh experiences have
  revealed to the world the value of human solidarity. Accepting
  this honorable distinction I am thinking of those with whom I am
  linked by the spirit of solidarity:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>first of all, of those who in the struggle for the workers'
    and civic rights in my country paid the highest price - the
    price of life;<br>
    <br>
    of my friends who paid for the defense of "Solidarity" with the
    loss of freedom, who were sentenced to prison terms or are
    awaiting trial;<br>
    <br>
    of my countrymen who saw in the "Solidarity" movement the
    fulfillment of their aspirations as workers and citizens, who
    are subjected to humiliations and ready for sacrifices, who
    have learnt to link courage with wisdom and who persist in
    loyalty to the cause we have embarked upon;<br>
    <br>
    of all those who are struggling throughout the world for the
    workers' and union rights, for the dignity of a working man,
    for human rights.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Inscribed on the monument erected at the
  entrance to the Gdansk Shipyard in memory of those who died in
  December 1970 are the words of the Psalm:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The Lord will give power to His people;<br>
    The Lord will give His people the blessing of peace".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Let these words be our message of
  brotherhood and hope.</p>
