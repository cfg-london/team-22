  <h1>Wladyslaw Reymont - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="reymont.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on May 7th, 1867, in the village
  of Kobielo Wielkie in that part of Poland which was under Russian
  rule.</p>
  
  <p>My father was the church organist; the village curate was my
  mother's brother, a former monk from the order of Pijar, a very
  well educated and ascetic man who loved nothing but solitude. The
  most ardent Catholicism ruled in our house. We led a hard life,
  almost like peasants. My family had taken a very active part in
  the insurrections of 1863 against Russia; some of its members had
  been killed; one of my uncles had been condemned to forced labour
  in Siberia. My mother had done her share of collaborating by
  serving as a messenger between various armed detachments. During
  my childhood I had a long, dangerous spell of illness, and my
  health has always been delicate. I was hardly a year old when my
  uncle was transferred to a small locality called Tuszyn, very
  close to the great manufacturing town of Lodz. There my father
  acquired a few acres of land without abandoning his post as
  organist. The management of our property was left to my mother,
  who was helped by some servants and her oldest children.</p>
  
  <p>When I was six and already able to read and write Polish, my
  uncle the curate taught me Latin. Since he had no suitable
  textbook, he simply used the breviary. The lessons were tedious;
  the long stem of the curate's pipe assisted him daily in his
  instruction. At that time I discovered very interesting books in
  the parish library. I plunged into the history and classics of
  the country. Reading became a passion with me. I carried books
  hidden under my clothes and read wherever I could. The study of
  Latin was maintained throughout the winter, but the spring turned
  me into a shepherd; as before, I was to tend my father's sheep,
  and I plunged only more eagerly into the Crusades and Walter
  Scott. That reading led to painful misunderstandings by its very
  contrast to my ordinary existence.</p>
  
  <p>I was slowly preparing to enter the college attended by my elder
  brother. But unfortunately my uncle the curate died, and my
  father, deprived of sufficient resources to give me a higher
  education, decided to make an organist of me. He put me behind a
  piano and thus began my study of sacred music, so vigorously and
  so often punctuated by the cane that I quickly learned to abhor
  it.</p>
  
  <p>Apart from my musical studies I had to help my father at the
  church and keep the parish register of baptisms, marriages,
  births, and deaths, assist daily at Mass, help the priest with
  the dying, etc.</p>
  
  <p>I loved these diverse occupations since nobody checked my spare
  time, which I was able to devote entirely to reading. By the age
  of nine I had a thorough knowledge of contemporary Polish
  literature as well as of foreign literature in Polish
  translation, and I began to write poems in honour of a lady of
  thirty years. Naturally, she knew nothing about them.</p>
  
  <p>During this period my brother, who had left college, tried
  systematically to make me pursue a regular program of studies. He
  took infinite pains, but did not succeed in tearing poetry out of
  my heart. I was at that time intoxicated by the romantic poetry
  of our great writers. I arranged the world according to my
  private use, looking at it through the poems I had
  devoured.</p>
  
  <p>Within myself I felt vague enchantments, dull restlessness, and
  uncertain desires. I had hallucinations when I was awake. What
  wings carried me to unknown worlds!</p>
  
  <p>Already I felt sick and confined at home; daily life was a
  burden. I dreamed of great actions, of voyages - rovings across
  the oceans of a free and independent life.</p>
  
  <p>For entire weeks I would keep away from the house and try to live
  in the woods like a savage. I formed monstrous shapes in potter's
  clay, or cut them in trees; I filled my notebooks and the margins
  of my books with rough sketches, and I spent more than one night
  crying without reason.</p>
  
  <p>Such was my life until the age of twelve. I shall skip the
  following years until the age of twenty.</p>
  
  <p>I lived in Warsaw and - being twenty years old - I naturally had
  a wild imagination and a tender heart. Misery was my inseparable
  companion; I was a socialist and the punishment was inevitable.
  The Russian authorities expelled me from Warsaw after suspecting
  me of having taken part in the strike that had then broken out in
  Lodz for the first time. Considering me an irresponsible minor,
  they entrusted me to the custody of my father and the
  surveillance of the local police. At that time my parents had a
  watermill and land of some importance in the vicinity of
  Piotrk&oacute;w, close to the railway from Warsaw to Vienna. I
  could tolerate neither the tyranny of my father nor the extreme
  conservatism and Catholicism of my family. After a few weeks I
  ran away with a small troupe of actors and travelled with them
  across the country. After a year I had enough of the wandering
  artist's life with its miseries and lack of a future; besides, my
  talent for acting was nonexistent.</p>
  
  <p>I was able to find a job in the technical service of the railway.
  I lived in the province in a peasant's house between two
  stations. My income was pitiable, my life hard and tedious, my
  surroundings primitive. I had hit rock bottom. I was lucky to
  make the acquaintance of a German professor, a convinced and
  practising spiritualist. He dazzled and conquered me. A world of
  fantastic dreams and possibilities opened before my eyes. I left
  my job and went to join the professor, who lived at Czestochowa.
  He had constant and close contact with spiritualist circles in
  Germany and England, corresponded regularly with Madame Blavatsky
  and Olcot, wrote in spiritualist journals, and was always giving
  <i>ad hoc</i> s&eacute;ances. For him, spiritualism was both a
  science and a religion - a mystical atmosphere prevailed in his
  entire house. He was kind, childishly naive, and at every
  s&eacute;ance cheated by his medium. It was not difficult for me to
  see that very soon, and once my faith in his miracles was lost I
  abandoned them immediately. Once more I was free, penniless, and
  without a tomorrow. For a while I worked for a landsurveyor; I
  was a clerk in a shop that sold devotional articles, then a
  salesman for a lumberyard. Finally I returned to the theatre. For
  several months I toured small places with a travelling company
  and did a great deal of acting, but when the company was
  dissolved I was left on the road. I tried to give recitations,
  for I knew entire poems by heart. I offered my services as
  producer in amateur theatres and I wrote for provincial journals.
  But I soon learned to loathe these occupations and returned
  willy-nilly to the railway. As before I was employed in the
  technical service; I was to live in a village lost between two
  distant stations. There was no office building for the agents of
  the company; I had to content myself with a peasant cottage very
  close to the railway.</p>
  
  <p>For a while I had a roof over my head, literally a piece of dry
  bread, and quiet. I was surrounded by impenetrable forests in
  which the Czar of all Russians hunted every year. I had installed
  myself at the end of autumn. I did not have much to do and I had
  free time for writing and being foolish. I lived on tea, bread,
  and dreams. I was twenty-two years old. I was healthy, had only
  one suit, and boots with holes in them. I had faith in the world
  and a thousand bold projects in my mind. I wrote feverishly:
  dramas in ten acts, novels without end, stories in several
  volumes, poems. Then I tore up everything mercilessly and burned
  it. I lived in solitude; I had no friends; the authorities as
  well as my fellow-workers were unfavourably disposed toward me; I
  did my duties badly. I could adapt myself neither to the
  mentality of those around me nor to the conditions of my
  existence. All this was painful and hard for me to endure. Misery
  did not release me; it undermined me, and then the cold... I had
  to spend whole days in the open surveying the workers; the nights
  I spent in a room so cold that I wrote wrapped in a fur, keeping
  the inkwell under the lamp lest the ink should freeze.</p>
  
  <p>I suffered these torments for two years, but as a result I had
  finished six short stories that seemed to have possibilities. I
  sent them to a critic in Warsaw, but it took over six months
  until I received a favourable reply. He even condescended to
  recommend me to a publisher. After new efforts my stories were
  printed. My whole being was filled with unspeakable happiness: at
  last I had found my way. But this good fortune was not without
  results for my bureaucratic career. The management dismissed me;
  they needed workers, not men of letters.</p>
  
  <p>I gathered my belongings, consisting chiefly of manuscripts, and
  with the generous amount of three rubles and fifty kopecks I went
  to Warsaw to conquer the world. I began a new Odyssey of misery,
  roving and struggling with destiny.</p>
  
  <p>No help from anywhere! I broke completely with my family. They
  did not understand me and lamented my fate. For the first six
  months I did not know the taste of the most ordinary dinner. I
  went out only in moonlight. My rags were too shabby for any
  occasion. I lived with people as miserable as I was. I wrote in
  the cathedral that was opposite my refuge; it was warm, solemn,
  and silent. I fed my soul on organ music and the sight of
  religious ceremonies. It was there, too, that I read Augustine,
  the Bible, and the Church Fathers, for days on end. I
  contemplated suicide more and more seriously. The earth was
  already opening under my feet. An irresistible fascination with
  terrifying death killed me ahead of time.</p>
  
  <p>The more profound my faith became, the more violent my
  fascination with annihilation, and then incessant hunger pushed
  me toward the abyss.</p>
  
  <p>At the beginning of spring, in April, I saw pilgrims going to
  Czestochowa, the bright mountain that had the picture of the
  Madonna famous for its miracles. I broke my chains and joined
  them. I do not remember which journal gave me an advance of
  twenty-five rubles for the description of that pilgrimage.</p>
  
  <p>For eleven days I walked in marvellous spring weather, under the
  sun and in the green. The account of that pilgrimage
  (<i>Pielgrzymka do Jasnej G&oacute;ry</i>, 1895 [<i>Pilgrimage to
  the Mountain of Light</i>]) appeared in a Warsaw illustrated
  daily and attracted the attention of the critics. Some months
  later I wrote <i>Komedjantka</i> (1896) [<i>The Comedian</i>].
  During this period I made the acquaintance of a group of
  spiritualists who included the famous Dr. Ochorowiecz. I went to
  London to pursue spiritualist problems at the Theosophical
  Society. On my return I wrote <i>Fermenty</i> (1897) [Ferments],
  the sequel to <i>Komedjantka</i>. I then went to Lodz to study
  conditions in heavy industry and after beginning <i>Ziemia
  obiecana</i> (1899) [The Promised Land] I left for Paris. I spent
  long months in a French village near Tours. I wrote <i>Lili</i>
  and some short stories. I travelled through Italy in a more
  systematic fashion and stayed especially at Sorrente. In 1902 I
  was wounded in a train accident near Warsaw, and I have never
  regained my health completely.</p>
  
  <p>In 1903-04 I published the first verion of <i>Chlopi</i>; at
  first it was only one volume. I burned it and rewrote it. This
  time it was divided into four volumes (1904-09). Next I wrote
  <i>Wampir</i> (1911) [<i>The Vampire</i>] - the reflection of my
  spiritualist exercises - two volumes of novellas, and I began
  historical studies concerning the decline of Poland toward the
  end of the seventeenth century. I wrote a trilogy called <i>Rok
  1794</i> (1913-18 ) [<i>The Year 1794</i>]. The last volume of
  that work, <i>Insurekcja</i> [Insurrection], was written in
  Warsaw during the German occupation after the explosion of the
  Great War. I also published another volume of novellas. In April
  1919 I left for the United States in order to visit my
  compatriots in that country.</p>
  
  <p>I returned in 1920. In 1922-23 I wrote <i>Bunt</i> [Defiance],
  and I began to have heart trouble. I still have many things to
  say and desire greatly to make them public, but will death let
  me?</p>
