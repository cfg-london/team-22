  <h1>Cecil Powell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="powell.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Cecil Frank Powell</b> was born on
  December 5th, 1903, at Tonbridge, Kent, where his father, Frank
  Powell, was one of a family of gunsmiths who had long practised
  the trade in the town. His grandfather, George Bisacre, had
  established a private school in the nearby town of Southborough
  and his family ties and influences therefore tended to encourage
  a regard for the value both of learning and the practical
  arts.<br>
  <br>
  He attended a local elementary school and won a scholarship, at
  the age of eleven, to Judd School, Tonbridge. From there he won
  open scholarships to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated
  with First Class Honours in the Natural Science Tripos
  (1924-1925).<br>
  <br>
  As a postgraduate student, Powell worked in the Cavendish Laboratory under
  <a href="../1927/index.html">C.T.R. Wilson</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Lord Rutherford</a> until
  1927 when he gained his Ph.D. and moved to the University of
  Bristol as Research Assistant to A.M. Tyndall in the H.H.
  Wills Physical Laboratory. He was eventually appointed lecturer,
  then reader and, in 1936, he visited the West Indies as
  seismologist of an expedition investigating volcanic activity. He
  returned to Bristol in the following year and in 1948 he was
  established as Melville Wills Professor of Physics.<br>
  <br>
  Powell was Director of a European expedition for making
  high-altitude balloon flights in Sardinia (1952) and in the Po
  Valley (1954, 1955, and 1957).<br>
  <br>
  His first researches at the Cavendish Laboratory concerned
  condensation phenomena and it led indirectly to an explanation of
  the anomalously high rate of discharge of steam through nozzles.
  He showed this to be due to the existence of supersaturation in
  the rapidly expanding steam and his results were found to have a
  bearing on the design and performance of the steam turbine.<br>
  <br>
  At Bristol he devoted years of patient work to the development of
  accurate techniques for measuring the mobility of positive ions
  and to establishing the nature of the ions in most of the common
  gases. After his sojourn in the Caribbean, he returned to work on
  the construction of a Cockcroft generator for accelerating fast
  protons and deuterons - employing them in conjunction with a
  Wilson chamber, to study neutron-proton scattering. In 1938, he
  undertook experiments in cosmic radiation and employed methods of
  directly recording the tracks of the particles in photographic
  emulsions and, when the Cockcroft machine came into operation, he
  employed similar methods for determining the energy of neutrons,
  that is, by observing the tracks of the recoiling protons. The
  length of the track of a charged particle in the emulsion was
  found to give an accurate measure of its range and the great
  advantages of this method for experiments in nuclear physics were
  soon clearly established.<br>
  <br>
  This development led him to a study of the scattering and
  disintegration processes produced by a beam of high-energy
  deuterons and he later returned, with the development of
  photographic emulsions of increased sensitivity, to experiments
  on cosmic radiation: in 1947 heavy mesons were discovered and
  many of their more important properties established.<br>
  <br>
  Powell has contributed numerous papers to learned societies on
  the discharge of electricity in gases, and on the development of
  photographic methods in nuclear physics. He is a co-author of
  <i>Nuclear Physics in Photographs</i> (1947) and <i>The Study of
  Elementary Particles by the Photographic Method</i> (1959).<br>
  <br>
  Prof. Powell was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1949: he
  was awarded the Hughes Medal in the same year and the Royal Medal
  in 1961. He has received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from
  the Universities of
  Dublin, Bordeaux and Warsaw, and he is a Foreign Member of
  the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. He was Vernon Boys
  Prizeman and Honorary Fellow of the Physical Society (1947), and
  he served on the Scientific Policy Committee of the European
  Organization for Nuclear Research (Geneva, 1961).<br>
  <br>
  Powell married Isobel Therese Artner, who has assisted him in his
  researches, in 1932; they have two daughters. His chief
  recreations are squash racquets and tennis.</p>
