  <h2>Quantitative Micro-Analysis of Organic Substances</h2>

  <p>In accepting the honour of addressing this
  illustrious assembly on this proud occasion today, I am complying
  with &sect; 9 of the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, and I
  would like to take the opportunity at the same time of expressing
  my humble thanks to the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1923/pregl-lecture.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> for awarding me the
  Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the year 1923.</p>

  <p>Already two years ago I had the honour of
  delivering two lectures to experts in the Kemiska S&auml;llskapet
  (Chemical Society) on the subject of the quantitative organic
  micro-analysis developed by me. The nature of my task today does
  not permit me to present all the details described and
  demonstrated at that time, neither does the time allocated allow
  me to execute two important experiments; I can therefore only
  give a survey of the origin, the development and the final
  results up to date of quantitative organic microanalysis.</p>

  <p>I had felt an inner compulsion to carry out
  the analysis of organic substances with much smaller quantities
  than had hitherto been used at a time when I was working on an
  investigation of a substance which could be obtained in
  extraordinarily small quantities; I was therefore forced to
  decide whether to process tons of material or whether to search
  for new methods, which would enable me to arrive at correct
  analytical results while using much smaller quantities then
  previously. I decided on the latter course of action. The most
  obvious plan was to apply reductions to all and everything,
  namely to move the decimal point back one or two places, not only
  in relation to the quantity of the substance, but also in
  relation to all the apparatus, reagent quantities, etc.,
  involved.</p>

  <p>This resulted not only in the necessity of
  carrying out all weighings with far greater accuracy than the
  customary analytical balances permitted, but the balance also had
  to be constructed in such a manner that the diversely shaped
  devices that were to be weighed could be accommodated on them.
  The assay balance for precious metals by Wilhelm Kuhlmann in
  Hamburg, which at that time was already being used in other
  laboratories for weighing with accuracy of 0.01-0.02 mg,
  fulfilled these requirements to a high degree. The designer, most
  fortunately, carried out great improvements to it at my
  suggestion, so that it is now possible to weigh with an accuracy
  of &plusmn;0.001 mg over a range of 20 grams using the
  micro-chemical balance designed by him and now in common use.</p>

  <p>The assumption that our aim could be
  achieved by shifting the decimal point for all factors proved to
  be entirely misleading; for, following the reduction of the
  quantity of the substance, effects appeared which decisively
  influenced the result of the micro-analysis, whereas they had
  been insignificant in macro-analysis and had therefore often not
  even been noticed.</p>

  <p>This can already be very simply illustrated
  in relation to nitrogen determination according to Dumas. The
  volumetric determination of the nitrogen set free during this
  process is influenced to such an extent by the 50% potassium
  hydroxide solution adhering to the interior of the measuring tube
  of the micro-nitrometer, that 2% must be deducted from the volume
  reading. Requirements regarding the carbon dioxide used for
  deaeration and for expelling the nitrogen are very much more
  exacting than one had hitherto been accustomed, and it was found
  necessary to develop a carbon dioxide supply which was completely
  free from air. Up to now there has been no lack of work in this
  direction and it is peculiar that nearly always the massive,
  compact marble was suspect as carrier of air; it was even found
  necessary to boil it off in a vacuum, and the fact was overlooked
  that aqueous solutions like hydrochloric acid are capable of
  absorbing considerable quantities of air, and also of nitrogen.
  Further, it was found to be imperative that the alkali sealing
  off the volume of nitrogen that had been set free, should not
  foam; treatment with barium hydroxide was found to be the means
  by which the substances that caused the foaming could be
  extracted from the alkaline solution. Finally, the position of
  the reduced copper mass in the tube lining was found to be of
  importance and the most correct position proved to be in the
  middle of the copper oxide lining in the hottest part of the
  tube.</p>

  <p>The development of the determination of
  carbon and hydrogen was considerably more difficult, because the
  problem here was firstly to absorb the resulting combustion
  products free from foreign admixtures and, secondly, in such a
  manner that the increase in weight could only be related to the
  resulting water and the carbon dioxide which had been produced.
  Thus, for instance, even the use of clean air and pure oxygen can
  result in incorrect weight increase, if the gases are conducted
  through new rubber tubes, because these release noticeable
  amounts of vapours containing carbon and hydrogen into the stream
  of gas. Artificial ageing, for instance by passing steam through
  these tubes for one hour, can eliminate this undesirable
  property.</p>

  <p>If the substance which is to be analysed
  contains nitrogen, halogen, or sulphur, gaseous products may
  result during combustion, which might erroneously be weighed and
  recorded as carbon dioxide, because they are also retained by the
  absorbing agent for carbon dioxide, i.e. soda lime. In such
  cases, therefore, entry of such products into the absorption
  apparatus must be prevented at all costs. Whereas for
  macro-analysis different tube linings are recommended for the
  various substances in accordance with their composition, my main
  aim was to develop a tube lining which would always retain
  everything that was not carbon dioxide or water. I therefore call
  it the universal lining. It consists of a mixture of copper oxide
  and lead chromate between two layers of silver and finally a
  layer of lead peroxide on asbestos heated to 180&deg;C.</p>

  <p>Since the invention of Liebig's potassium
  apparatus and the calcium chloride tube, many variations have
  been made in the course of nearly a century to the usual
  absorption apparatus for elemental analysis. I chose for this
  purpose the simplest form, a tube. It is quite obvious that the
  slightest impurities must cause special errors. Warming caused by
  wiping, wrongly makes these small devices appear to be lighter in
  weight; then, when they have not been filled, they attain a
  constant weight within 10-15 minutes. However, if they contain an
  absorbing agent and if their connections are open at both ends
  and are not tapered, they will increase in weight at the same
  rate after that period has elapsed, that is to say, they absorb
  from the air water vapour and therefore become heavier. I have
  finally succeeded in completely preventing this diffusing-in of
  water vapour by fitting capillary tapering pieces between larger
  and smaller expansions of the flow line; this arrangement
  represents such a gradual diffusion gradient that even for the
  sensitive weighing instrument of the micro-analyst unnoticeable
  weight increases during the periods under practical consideration
  will result.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, these capillary
  taperings present considerable resistance to the gas stream
  resulting in an increase of pressure in the interior of the
  combustion tube. New difficulties arose hereby; the tube
  connections between the apparatuses, particularly between the
  warm outlet of the combustion tube and the calcium chloride tube
  - the most critical spot - could cause the loss of combustion
  products in consequence of the increased pressure, if the tube
  connection is only slightly damaged, and especially in view of
  the fact that rubber has the peculiarity of allowing carbon
  dioxide to diffuse easily. I eliminated these hazards by
  equalizing the pressure at the critical place to that outside,
  i.e. the atmospheric pressure. This effect can easily be achieved
  by means of a Mariotte's flask.</p>

  <p>Right from the start I had rejected the
  idea of forming the connections between the apparatuses and the
  combustion tube by ground glass joints and of using cocks for
  closing the absorption apparatus, because these cannot safely and
  easily be wiped and would also be in danger of being broken on
  account of their fragility. On the contrary, I am convinced that
  microanalysis, its development and wider use will be best served
  by avoiding cocks and ground joints.</p>

  <p>When all these conditions are observed, it
  is quite easy to obtain accurate analysis results for 2-4 mg of
  the substance. The smallest quantity ever used was 1 mg and the
  divergence was still within the usual permissible margin of
  error. In doing this we have quite exceptionally reduced the
  amount of substance required for the analysis. Bearing in mind
  that Liebig used 0.5 g of substance and originally even 1 g, and
  that towards the end of the last century 0.15-0.2 g was usually
  considered to be the quantity required, we may well say that the
  development of micro-analysis has reduced the quantities required
  for the determination to about one hundredth part of what ten
  years ago was considered to be the amount required. This
  reduction does not impair the accuracy in any way and I can even
  say that my students demand far greater accuracy from
  micro-analysis than they previously expected from macro-analysis.
  This probably follows from the fact that the basic conditions are
  far better and can be more completely allowed for than was
  possible with macro-analysis. There are two further advantages
  that should be borne in mind. Firstly, there are great savings in
  gas and reagents, and secondly, and this is even more valuable,
  there is a saving in time. Thus it is possible to attain the same
  result in at least one third of the time required for
  macro-analysis; a decision then to repeat micro-analyses is much
  easier made, as the work is much shorter and more pleasant.</p>

  <p>For the determination of halogens and
  sulphur Carius' method was originally generally used. The
  precipitates obtained then used to be sucked out in a small Gooch
  crucible, I particularly would like to mention here briefly that
  I was the first to recognize that the presence of barium chloride
  was essential for the decomposition of sulphur-containing
  substances with nitric acid; without this, losses were certain to
  result. Later a completely new analytical process for the
  decomposition of organic substances was discovered, which
  consisted in burning them in an oxygen stream and then leading
  the combustion products over red-hot platinum in order to
  complete the decomposition. With halogen determinations, these
  combustion products are collected in an alkaline sulphite
  solution, whereas the products from sulphur determinations are
  collected in perhydrol, with which porcelain beads are wetted.
  All this is done in one single hard-glass tube and this may be
  used many hundreds of times for the same purpose. All the halogen
  is obtained with the washing liquid in the form of sodium halide,
  all the sulphur in the form of sulphuric acid. Here also there
  were initial difficulties with the determination of the halogen,
  because the values obtained after acidifying the alkaline
  sulphite solution with nitric acid were too high. The explanation
  was that the oxidation of sulphite to sulphuric acid does not
  proceed directly, but by the precipitation of elementary sulphur,
  which would indicate that this reaction does not proceed
  monomolecularly, but probably by way of a polythionic acid. For,
  if we first use perhydrol as oxidizing agent in alkaline solution
  and then acidify with nitric acid, sulphur is not precipitated
  and fully correct results are obtained. The resulting silver
  halides are automatically sucked on to a filter tube and weighed
  after drying. Similar analytical instructions resulted with
  sulphur determinations; if these instructions are observed,
  correctness of the analytical results can be guaranteed.</p>

  <p>My assistant, lecturer Dr. Hans Lieb has
  developed methods for the determination of phosphorus and arsenic
  in organic substances, by which satisfactory results are
  achieved.</p>

  <p>Apart from the quantitative determination
  of the elements making up the structure of organic substances,
  the quantitative content of certain groups of atoms is also of
  the utmost importance. I have therefore developed the
  determination of the carboxyl group by acidimetry by using
  phenolphthalein as indicator; I have further elaborated the
  determination of the methoxy and methylimide groups. I do not
  want to go into details, but would nevertheless stress the
  enormous simplification of the micro-apparatus as compared with
  the macro-procedure in connection with the methoxy determination;
  the weighing of the substance in tin-foil caps is new in
  principle and of great advantage, as the hydriodic acid does not
  bump because of its tin iodide content. For the methylimide
  determination, the fact that the ratio of the hydriodic acid to
  the substance quantity used (approx. 3 mg) would be far more
  favourable than for the macro-analytical process, had not been
  foreseen. This was for the first time noticeable in connection
  with physostigmine, as only by micro-analytical methods a third
  methyl or ethyl group was detected, where previously only two had
  always been assumed, so that the structure of this body had to be
  revised for this reason.</p>

  <p>Determination of the molecular weight by
  the boiling-point method has also become practicable through
  micro-analysis, as we are able to obtain reliable values for a
  quantity of 7 mg.</p>

  <p>It is hard to believe that the simplest of
  all determinations, i.e. the determination of the residue through
  fuming with sulphuric acid, as is necessary with the
  determination of Na, K, Ca, etc. in organic substances, could
  only be adapted in such a way as not to make too great demands on
  the skill of the analyst and yet give satisfactory results that
  beginners always think they are mere accidents, long after the
  previously described difficult methods had been developed.</p>

  <p>Finally it might not be superfluous to
  raise the question what positive results micro-analysis has
  achieved so far.</p>

  <p>In this connection we may mention that one
  of the first results was the discovery that the yellow colouring
  matter in corpora lutea of cattle ovaries was by micro-analytical
  carbon hydrogen determination found to be carotin, the substance
  which is in carrots widely found in the vegetable kingdom. This
  was extracted from approximately 10,000 ovaries in the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/index.html">Willst&auml;tter</a>
  Laboratory in Zurich and would have been sufficient for only one
  macro-analysis. Thus, in this case already micro-analysis has
  made possible important progress in our knowledge, by proving
  that the same substance appears as colouring matter in both
  natural kingdoms, the vegetable as well as the animal
  kingdom.</p>

  <p>Also, in view of the minute quantity of
  material available, I want to draw your attention to the valuable
  information on molecular structure obtained by means of
  micro-analysis, through the work of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/index.html">Adolf Windaus</a> on
  cymarin and cholesterol, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1927/index.html">Wieland</a>'s work on the
  decomposition of bile acids, where micro-analysis proved its
  value.</p>

  <p>Last but not least I want to mention that
  quite recently a Swede, C.A. Yllner applied micro-analytical
  methods successfully at my Institute in Graz for the
  identification of alkaloids in forensic cases, that is, when
  these had to be extracted from dissected corpses. During the last
  few years my methods have also been applied in technology for
  electrolytic metal analysis; and for the analysis of wine very
  clever micro-analytical methods have been developed, apart from
  those discussed here.</p>

  <p>I therefore am very hopeful that in the
  future quantitative organic microanalysis will find many more
  fields of application and expansion, and that it will make
  possible much insight and discernment which otherwise might not
  have been possible, especially following the magnificent
  recognition that has been awarded to it by the Swedish Academy of
