  <h2><br>Contra Jogulatores Obloquentes</h2>
<h3>Against Jesters Who Defame and Insult</h3>

  <p><i>"Against jesters who defame and insult".
  Law issued by Emperor Frederick II (Messina 1221), declaring that
  anyone may commit violence against jesters without incurring
</i></p>

  <p>The drawings I'm showing you are mine.
  Copies of these, slightly reduced in size, have been distributed
  among you.</p>

  <p>For some time it's been my habit to use
  images when preparing a speech: rather than write it down, I
  illustrate it. This allows me to improvise, to exercise my
  imagination - and to oblige you to use yours.</p>

  <p>As I proceed, I will from time to time
  indicate to you where we are in the manuscript. That way you
  won't lose the thread. This will be of help especially to those
  of you who don't understand either Italian or Swedish.
  English-speakers will have a tremendous advantage over the rest
  because they will imagine things I've neither said nor thought.
  There is of course the problem of the two laughters: those who
  understand Italian will laugh immediately, those who don't will
  have to wait for Anna [Barsotti]'s Swedish translation. And then
  there are those of you who won't know whether to laugh the first
  time or the second. Anyway, let's get started.</p>

  <p>Ladies and
  gentlemen, the title I've selected for this little chat is
  "contra jogulatores obloquentes", which you all recognize as
  Latin, mediaeval Latin to be precise. It's the title of a law
  issued in Sicily in 1221 by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia, an
  emperor "anointed by God", who we were taught in school to regard
  a sovereign of extraordinary enlightenment, a liberal.
  "Jogulatores obloquentes" means "jesters who defame and insult".
  The law in question allowed any and all citizens to insult
  jesters, to beat them and even - if they were in that mood - to
  kill them, without running any risk of being brought to trial and
  condemned. I hasten to assure you that this law no longer is in
  vigour, so I can safely continue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i></p>

  <p>Friends of mine, noted men of letters, have
  in various radio and television interviews declared: "The highest
  prize should no doubt be awarded to the members of the Swedish
  Academy, for having had the courage this year to award the Nobel
  Prize to a jester." I agree. Yours is an act of courage that
  borders on provocation.</p>

  <p>It's enough to take stock of the uproar it
  has caused: sublime poets and writers who normally occupy the
  loftiest of spheres, and who rarely take interest in those who
  live and toil on humbler planes, are suddenly bowled over by some
  kind of whirlwind.</p>

  <p>Like I said, I applaud and concur with my
  friends.</p>

  <p>These poets had already ascended to the
  Parnassian heights when you, through your insolence, sent them
  toppling to earth, where they fell face and belly down in the
  mire of normality.</p>

  <p>Insults and abuse are hurled at the Swedish
  Academy, at its members and their relatives back to the seventh
  generation. The wildest of them clamour: "Down with the King ...
  of Norway!". It appears they got the dynasty wrong in the
  confusion.</p>

  <p>(At this point you may turn the page. As
  you see there is an image of a naked poet bowled over by a
  whirlwind.)</p>
  
    <p><a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill2.html"><img src="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill2-s.gif" alt="Drawing"></a></p>


<p>Some landed pretty hard on their nether
  parts. There were reports of poets and writers whose nerves and
  livers suffered terribly. For a few days thereafter there was not
  a pharmacy in Italy that could muster up a single
  tranquillizer.</p>

  <p>But, dear members of the Academy, let's
  admit it, this time you've overdone it. I mean come on, first you
  give the prize to a black man, then to a Jewish writer. Now you
  give it to a clown. What gives? As they say in Naples:
<i>pazzi&agrave;mme</i>? Have we lost our senses?</p>

  <p>Also the higher clergy have suffered their
  moments of madness. Sundry potentates - great electors of the
  Pope, bishops, cardinals and prelates of Opus Dei - have all gone
  through the ceiling, to the point that they've even petitioned
  for the reinstatement of the law that allowed jesters to be
  burned at the stake. Over a slow fire.</p>

  <p>On the other hand I can tell you there is
  an extraordinary number of people who rejoice with me over your
  choice. And so I bring you the most festive thanks, in the name
  of a multitude of mummers, jesters, clowns, tumblers and
  storytellers.</p>

  <p>(This is where we are now [indicates a
  page].)</p>
  
      <p><a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill3.html"><img src="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill3-s.gif" alt="Drawing"></a></p>


<p>And speaking of
  storytellers, I mustn't forget those of the small town on Lago
  Maggiore where I was born and raised, a town with a rich oral
  tradition.</p>

  <p>They were the old storytellers, the master
  glass-blowers who taught me and other children the craftsmanship,
  the art, of spinning fantastic yarns. We would listen to them,
  bursting with laughter - laughter that would stick in our throats
  as the tragic allusion that surmounted each sarcasm would dawn on
  us. To this day I keep fresh in my mind the story of the Rock of
Cald&eacute;.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"Many years ago", began the old
  glass-blower, "way up on the crest of that steep cliff that rises
  from the lake there was a town called Cald&eacute;. As it happened,
  this town was sitting on a loose splinter of rock that slowly,
  day by day, was sliding down towards the precipice. It was a
  splendid little town, with a campanile, a fortified tower at the
  very peak and a cluster of houses, one after the other. It's a
  town that once was and that now is gone. It disappeared in the
  15th century.</p>

  <p>"'Hey', shouted the peasants and fishermen
  down in the valley below. 'You're sliding, you'll fall down from
  there'.</p>

  <p>"But the cliff dwellers wouldn't listen to
  them, they even laughed and made fun of them: 'You think you're
  pretty smart, trying to scare us into running away from our
  houses and our land so you can grab them instead. But we're not
  that stupid.'</p>

  <p>"So they continued to prune their vines,
  sow their fields, marry and make love. They went to mass. They
  felt the rock slide under their houses but they didn't think much
  about it. 'Just the rock settling. Quite normal', they said,
  reassuring each other.</p>

  <p>"The great splinter of rock was about to
  sink into the lake. 'Watch out, you've got water up to your
  ankles', shouted the people along the shore. 'Nonsense, that's
  just drainage water from the fountains, it's just a bit humid',
  said the people of the town, and so, slowly but surely, the whole
  town was swallowed by the lake.</p>

  <p>"Gurgle ... gurgle ... splash ... they sink
  .... houses, men, women, two horses, three donkeys ... heehaw ...
  gurgle. Undaunted, the priest continued to receive the confession
  of a nun: 'Te absolvi ... animus ... santi ... guurgle ... Aame
  ... gurgle ...' The tower disappeared, the campanile sank with
  bells and all: Dong ... ding ... dop ... plock ...</p>

  <p>"Even today", continued the old
  glass-blower, "if you look down into the water from that outcrop
  that still juts out from the lake, and if in that same moment a
  thunderstorm breaks out, and the lightning illuminates the bottom
  of the lake, you can still see - incredible as it may seem! - the
  submerged town, with its streets still intact and even the
  inhabitants themselves, walking around and glibly repeating to
  themselves: 'Nothing has happened'. The fish swim back and forth
  before their eyes, even into their ears. But they just brush them
  off: 'Nothing to worry about. It's just some kind of fish that's
  learned to swim in the air'.</p>

  <p>"'Atchoo!' 'God bless you!' 'Thank you ...
  it's a bit humid today ... more than yesterday ... but
  everything's fine'. They've reached rock bottom, but as far as
  they're concerned, nothing has happened at all."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Disturbing though it may be, there's no
  denying that a tale like this still has something to tell us.</p>

  <p>I repeat, I owe much to these master
  glass-blowers of mine, and they - I assure you - are immensely
  grateful to you, members of this Academy, for rewarding one of
  their disciples.</p>

  <p>And they express their gratitude with
  explosive exuberance. In my home town, people swear that on the
  night the news arrived that one of their own storytellers was to
  be awarded the Nobel Prize, a kiln that had been standing cold
  for some fifty years suddenly erupted in a broadside of flames,
  spraying high into the air - like a fireworks <i>finale</i> - a
  myriad splinters of coloured glass, which then showered down on
  the surface of the lake, releasing an impressive cloud of
  steam.</p>

  <p>(While you applaud, I'll have a drink of
  water. [Turning to the interpreter:] Would you like some?</p>

  <p>It's important that you talk among
  yourselves while we drink, because if you try to hear the gurgle
  gurgle gurgle the water makes as we swallow we'll choke on it and
  start coughing. So instead you can exchange niceties like "Oh,
  what a lovely evening it is, isn't it?".</p>

  <p>End of intermission: we turn to a new page,
  but don't worry, it'll go faster from here.)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Above all others, this evening you're due
  the loud and solemn thanks of an extraordinary master of the
  stage, little-known not only to you and to people in France,
  Norway, Finland ... but also to the people of Italy. Yet he was,
  until Shakespeare, doubtless the greatest playwright of
  renaissance Europe. I'm referring to Ruzzante Beolco, my greatest
  master along with Moli&egrave;re: both actors-playwrights, both
  mocked by the leading men of letters of their times. Above all,
  they were despised for bringing onto the stage the everyday life,
  joys and desperation of the common people; the hypocrisy and the
  arrogance of the high and mighty; and the incessant injustice.
  And their major, unforgivable fault was this: in telling these
  things, they made people laugh. Laughter does not please the
  mighty.</p>

  <p>Ruzzante, the true father of the
  <i>Commedia dell'Arte</i>, also constructed a language of his
  own, a language of and for the theatre, based on a variety of
  tongues: the dialects of the Po Valley, expressions in Latin,
  Spanish, even German, all mixed with onomatopoeic sounds of his
  own invention. It is from him, from Beolco Ruzzante, that I've
  learned to free myself from conventional literary writing and to
  express myself with words that you can chew, with unusual sounds,
  with various techniques of rhythm and breathing, even with the
  rambling nonsense-speech of the <i>grammelot.</i></p>

  <p>Allow me to dedicate a part of this
  prestigious prize to Ruzzante.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A few days ago, a young actor of great
  talent said to me: "Maestro, you should try to project your
  energy, your enthusiasm, to young people. You have to give them
  this charge of yours. You have to share your professional
  knowledge and experience with them". Franca - that's my wife -
  and I looked at each other and said: "He's right". But when we
  teach others our art, and share this charge of fantasy, what end
  will it serve? Where will it lead?</p>

  <p>In the past couple of months, Franca and I
  have visited a number of university campuses to hold workshops
  and seminars before young audiences. It has been surprising - not
  to say disturbing - to discover their ignorance about the times
  we live in. We told them about the proceedings now in course in
  Turkey against the accused culprits of the massacre in Sivas.
  Thirty-seven of the country's foremost democratic intellectuals,
  meeting in the Anatolian town to celebrate the memory of a famous
  mediaeval jester of the Ottoman period, were burned alive in the
  dark of the night, trapped inside their hotel. The fire was the
  handiwork of a group of fanatical fundamentalists that enjoyed
  protection from elements within the Government itself. In one
  night, thirty-seven of the country's most celebrated artists,
  writers, directors, actors and Kurdish dancers were erased from
  this Earth.</p>

  <p>In one blow these fanatics destroyed some
  of the most important exponents of Turkish culture.</p>

  <p>Thousands of students listened to us. The
  looks in their faces spoke of their astonishment and incredulity.
  They had never heard of the massacre. But what impressed me the
  most is that not even the teachers and professors present had
  heard of it. There Turkey is, on the Mediterranean, practically
  in front of us, insisting on joining the European Community, yet
  no one had heard of the massacre. Salvini, a noted Italian
  democrat, was right on the mark when he observed: "The widespread
  ignorance of events is the main buttress of injustice". But this
  absent-mindedness on the part of the young has been conferred
  upon them by those who are charged to educate and inform them:
  among the absent-minded and uninformed, school teachers and other
  educators deserve first mention.</p>

  <p>Young people easily succumb to the
  bombardment of gratuitous banalities and obscenities that each
  day is served to them by the mass media: heartless TV action
  films where in the space of ten minutes they are treated to three
  rapes, two assassinations, one beating and a serial crash
  involving ten cars on a bridge that then collapses, whereupon
  everything - cars, drivers and passengers - precipitates into the
  sea ... only one person survives the fall, but he doesn't know
  how to swim and so drowns, to the cheers of the crowd of curious
  onlookers that suddenly has appeared on the scene.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At another university we spoofed the
  project - alas well under way - to manipulate genetic material,
  or more specifically, the proposal by the European Parliament to
  allow patent rights on living organisms. We could feel how the
  subject sent a chill through the audience. Franca and I explained
  how our Eurocrats, kindled by powerful and ubiquitous
  multinationals, are preparing a scheme worthy the plot of a
  sci-fi/horror movie entitled "Frankenstein's pig brother".
  They're trying to get the approval of a directive which (and get
  this!) would authorize industries to take patents on living
  beings, or on parts of them, created with techniques of genetic
  manipulation that seem taken straight out of "The Sorcerer's
  Apprentice".</p>

  <p>This is how it would work: by manipulating
  the genetic make-up of a pig, a scientist succeeds in making the
  pig more human-like. By this arrangement it becomes much easier
  to remove from the pig the organ of your choice - a liver, a
  kidney - and to transplant it in a human. But to assure that the
  transplanted pig-organs aren't rejected, it's also necessary to
  transfer certain pieces of genetic information from the pig to
  the human. The result: a human pig (even though you will say that
  there are already plenty of those).</p>

  <p>And every part of this new creature, this
  humanized pig, will be subject to patent laws; and whosoever
  wishes a part of it will have to pay copyright fees to the
  company that "invented" it. Secondary illnesses, monstrous
  deformations, infectious diseases - all are optionals, included
  in the price ...</p>

  <p>The Pope has forcefully condemned this
  monstrous genetic witchcraft. He has called it an offence against
  humanity, against the dignity of man, and has gone to pains to
  underscore the project's total and irrefutable lack of moral
  value.</p>

  <p>The astonishing thing is that while this is
  happening, an American scientist, a remarkable magician - you've
  probably read about him in the papers - has succeeded in
  transplanting the head of a baboon. He cut the heads off two
  baboons and switched them. The baboons didn't feel all that great
  after the operation. In fact, it left them paralysed, and they
  both died shortly thereafter, but the experiment worked, and
  that's the great thing.</p>

  <p>But here's the rub: this modern-day
  Frankenstein, a certain Professor White, is all the while a
  distinguished member of the Vatican Academy of Sciences. Somebody
  should warn the Pope.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>So, we enacted these criminal farces to the
  kids at the universities, and they laughed their heads off. They
  would say of Franca and me: "They're a riot, they come up with
  the most fantastic stories". Not for a moment, not even with an
  inkling in their spines, did they grasp that the stories we told
  were true.</p>

  <p>These encounters have strengthened us in
  our conviction that our job is - in keeping with the exhortation
  of the great Italian poet Savinio - "to tell our own story". Our
  task as intellectuals, as persons who mount the pulpit or the
  stage, and who, most importantly, address to young people, our
  task is not just to teach them method, like how to use the arms,
  how to control breathing, how to use the stomach, the voice, the
  falsetto, the <i>contracampo.</i> It's not enough to teach a
  technique or a style: we have to show them what is happening
  around us. They have to be able to tell their own story. A
  theatre, a literature, an artistic expression that does not speak
  for its own time has no relevance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Recently, I took part in a large conference
  with lots of people where I tried to explain, especially to the
  younger participants, the ins and outs of a particular Italian
  court case. The original case resulted in seven separate
  proceedings, at the end of which three Italian left-wing
  politicians were sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment each,
  accused of having murdered a police commissioner. I've studied
  the documents of the case - as I did when I prepared
  <i>Accidental Death of an Anarchist</i> - and at the conference I
  recounted the facts pertaining to it, which are really quite
  absurd, even farcical. But at a certain point I realized I was
  speaking to deaf ears, for the simple reason that my audience was
  ignorant not only of the case itself, but of what had happened
  five years earlier, ten years earlier: the violence, the
  terrorism. They knew nothing about the massacres that occurred in
  Italy, the trains that blew up, the bombs in the <i>piazze</i> or
  the farcical court cases that have dragged on since then.</p>

  <p>The terribly difficult thing is that in
  order to talk about what is happening today, I have to start with
  what happened thirty years ago and then work my way forward. It's
  not enough to speak about the present. And pay attention, this
  isn't just about Italy: the same thing happens everywhere, all
  over Europe. I've tried in Spain and encountered the same
  difficulty; I've tried in France, in Germany, I've yet to try in
  Sweden, but I will.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To conclude, let me share this medal with
  Franca.</p>

  <p>Franca Rame, my companion in life and in
  art who you, members of the Academy, acknowledge in your
  motivation of the prize as actress and author; who has had a hand
  in many of the texts of our theatre.</p>
  
        <p><a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill4.html"><img src="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill4-s.gif" alt="Drawing"></a></p>


<p>(At this very
  moment, Franca is on stage in a theatre in Italy but will join me
  the day after tomorrow. Her flight arrives midday, if you like we
  can all head out together to pick her up at the airport.)</p>

  <p>Franca has a very sharp wit, I assure you.
  A journalist put the following question to her: "So how does it
  feel to be the wife of a Nobel Prize winner? To have a monument
  in your home?" To which she answered: "I'm not worried. Nor do I
  feel at all at a disadvantage; I've been in training for a long
  time. I do my exercises each morning: I go down on my hand and
  knees, and that way I've accustomed myself to becoming a pedestal
to a monument. I'm pretty good at it."</p>

  <p>Like I said, she has a sharp wit. At times
  she even turns her irony against herself.</p>

  <p>Without her at my side, where she has been
  for a lifetime, I would never have accomplished the work you have
  seen fit to honour. Together we've staged and recited thousands
  of performances, in theatres, occupied factories, at university
  sit-ins, even in deconsecrated churches, in prisons and city
  parks, in sunshine and pouring rain, always together. We've had
  to endure abuse, assaults by the police, insults from the
  right-thinking, and violence. And it is Franca who has had to
  suffer the most atrocious aggression. She has had to pay more
  dearly than any one of us, with her neck and limb in the balance,
  for the solidarity with the humble and the beaten that has been
  our premise.</p>
  
          <p><a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill5.html"><img src="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/ill5-s.gif" alt="Drawing"></a></p>


<p>The day it was
  announced that I was to be awarded the Nobel Prize I found myself
  in front of the theatre on Via di Porta Romana in Milan where
  Franca, together with Giorgio Albertazzi, was performing <i>The
  Devil with Tits.</i> Suddenly I was surrounded by a throng of
  reporters, photographers and camera-wielding TV-crews. A passing
  tram stopped, unexpectedly, the driver stepped out to greet me,
  then all the passengers stepped out too, they applauded me, and
  everyone wanted to shake my hand and congratulate me ... when at
  a certain point they all stopped in their tracks and, as with a
  single voice, shouted "Where's Franca?". They began to holler
  "Francaaa" until, after a little while, she appeared.
  Discombobulated and moved to tears, she came down to embrace
  me.</p>

  <p>At that moment, as if out of nowhere, a
  band appeared, playing nothing but wind instruments and drums. It
  was made up of kids from all parts of the city and, as it
  happened, they were playing together for the first time. They
  struck up "Porta Romana bella, Porta Romana" in samba beat. I've
  never heard anything played so out of tune, but it was the most
beautiful music Franca and I had ever heard.</p>

  <p>Believe me, this prize belongs to both of
  us.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
