  <h1>Anthony J. Leggett - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="leggett.jpg" class="bio-img">I 
                was born in Camberwell, South London, on the 26th of March, 1938. 
                I am told I only made it into the world on the date in question 
                by seven minutes, thereby exhibiting at this early stage the tendency 
                to procrastination which I fear has characterized much of my subsequent 
                career. Not a great deal is known about my ancestry beyond a few 
                generations, though one tidbit of information which has been passed 
                down is that an ancestor on my father's side served for a time 
                as a cook on Nelson's flagship, the Victory (it is unknown whether 
                he was actually present at the battle of Trafalgar). As far as 
                we can trace them, my father's forebears were village cobblers 
                in a small village in Hampshire, though his father broke with 
                this tradition to become a greengrocer; my father would tell me 
                how he used to ride with him to buy vegetables at the Covent Garden 
                market in London. My mother's parents were both of Irish stock; 
                her father had emigrated to England and worked as a clerk in the 
                naval dockyard in Chatham. My maternal grandmother, who survived 
                into her eighties (and my twenties), was a remarkable person; 
                sent out to domestic service at the age of twelve, she eventually 
                married my grandfather and raised a large family, then in her 
                late sixties emigrated to Australia to join her daughter and son-in-law, 
                and finally returned to the UK for her last years. She was a very 
                warm person, and I still have very fond memories both of my meetings 
                with her (unfortunately few in her last years, because of the 
                geography) and of the many letters she wrote me; since she had 
                had no formal education, she simply wrote down on paper exactly 
                what she would have said to you in person, and to read a letter 
                from her was like having her stand in the room with you. It is 
                interesting that that kind of spontaneity in the written word, 
                which seemed to have been lost forever under the influence of 
                universal secondary education, is now returning in the guise of 
                e-mail.</p>
              <p>My father and mother were each the first in 
                their families to receive a university education; they met and 
                became engaged while students at the Institute of Education at 
                the University of London, but were unable to get married for some 
                years because my father had to care for his own mother and siblings. 
                He worked as a secondary-school (high-school) teacher of physics, 
                chemistry and mathematics. My mother also taught secondary-school 
                mathematics for a time, but had to give this up when I was born. 
                I was eventually followed by two sisters, Clare and Judith, and 
                two brothers, Terence and Paul (both now deceased). My parents 
                were both Catholics (in my mother's case ancestrally, in my father's 
                I believe because his own father had converted), so that we children 
                were brought up in that faith, making us members of a small and 
                somewhat embattled minority in the England of those days. Although 
                I ceased to be a practicing Catholic in my early twenties, I still 
                wonder from time to time how far the experience, in childhood 
                and adolescence, of maintaining and defending, sometimes in public 
                and in the face of some ridicule, beliefs and attitudes not shared 
                by the vast majority of my compatriots may have influenced my 
                subsequent attitude to physics and indeed to life in general (which, 
                at least as regards the former, is I suspect sometimes regarded 
                by my colleagues as reflecting a degree of iconoclasm verging 
                on counter-suggestibility).</p>
              <p>Soon after I was born, my parents bought a house in Upper Norwood, just
outside the southern boundary of London proper (but well within the
London conurbation). However, when I was eighteen months old, war broke
out and we were "evacuated" to Englefield Green, a small village in Surrey on
the edge of the great park of Windsor Palace, where we stayed for the duration
of the war. The village was fortunate to escape the bombs that fell on
towns all around (including Slough, perhaps in response to John Betjeman's
couplet!) and my war-related memories are relatively few: barrage balloons
tethered above the Thames, lying in bed at night listening to the German
"doodle-bugs" droning overhead (and praying they would not cut out immediately
above our house), and the day I was "officially" informed that there
was a war on (and decided that at no cost should my sister Clare, a year
younger than me, find out about it). When in later life I read the memoirs of
people who lived through those same years in the ravaged cities of continental
Europe or Asia, or even through the Blitz in London, I realize how extraordinarily
lucky we were.</p>
              <p>Although Englefield Green is only a few miles 
                outside the western borders of the Greater London conurbation, 
                it is (or was!) in some sense in the countryside, and many of 
                my memories of those years are of long walks through the fields 
                and parks surrounding the village. However, one of my main activities, 
                and the one which gained me most notoriety among our neighbors, 
                was digging deep holes, I think on occasion deeper than my height 
                at the time, in our front garden (not the easiest activity in 
                a soil which was basically London clay). Exactly what motivated 
                me to do this, and what deep insights it reveals into my psyche, 
                is something I have never figured out, but it was perhaps loosely 
                connected with my then choice of future career: after a brief 
                flirtation with the idea of becoming a railway signalman, I decided 
                firmly that I wanted to be an explorer (you have to remember that 
                in those days there were still odd patches of the planet which 
                had never been trodden by human feet, nor mapped by GPS). In the 
                end I suppose that, like many academics, I achieved this ambition 
                though in a more abstract way.</p>
              <p>After the end of the war, we returned to the 
                Upper Norwood house and lived there until 1950; my father taught 
                at a school in north-east London (unfortunately a long commute) 
                and my mother by that time had her hands full looking after what 
                were eventually five of us children. I attended the local Catholic 
                elementary (grade) school, and later, following a successful performance 
                in the "eleven-plus" examination which I took rather earlier than 
                most, transferred to the College of the Sacred Heart in Wimbledon 
                (a "grammar", i.e. state-financed academic-stream, school). This 
                required a slightly complicated commute (bus, train, then another 
                bus), which had the advantage that I could get a fair amount of 
                reading done on the journey to and fro. (A few years ago, while 
                on a brief return visit to the UK, I had for a reason I forget, 
                to repeat exactly this journey and got completely lost - such 
                have been the changes in the transportation system of southwest 
                London in 50 years). Although I took part in the required physical 
                sports at school, in particular in long-distance running, my main 
                recreation in those years was chess, an interest I kept throughout 
                my teens and into my Oxford years (I had a brief moment of glory 
                when some years later, I was picked for the English team to compete 
                against Scotland, Wales, and Ireland in the (under-16) Glorney 
                Cup). Another practice I developed in those years was to take 
                long hikes or cycle rides alone into the countryside surrounding 
                southwest London; in later years I kept up this habit in much 
                more untamed terrain, sometimes steering by compass, in thick 
                mist, over many miles of trackless Welsh or Scottish mountainside. 
                (Since I often did this alone and did not always leave details 
                of my itinerary, and there are plenty of accidents in those areas 
                even in good weather, I am perhaps lucky still to be here!)</p>
              <p>In 1949 my father, who had become increasingly 
                unhappy with the long commute to his job in north-east London, 
                obtained a job teaching physics and chemistry at Beaumont College, 
                a school run by the Jesuits near Windsor. This was a "public" 
                school in the British sense of the word (i.e., "private" in the 
                US sense) and we could certainly not have afforded the fees for 
                even one of us three boys to attend it; however, my father negotiated 
                as part of his conditions of service that all three of us could 
                go to Beaumont free of charge, so we did. At the same time we 
                moved to a large, rambling and somewhat broken-down house in Staines, 
                on the far western edge of the London conurbation, which remained 
                our family home until I was well into my thirties; this house 
                was a delight to my father, who in another life would have been 
                a handyman, but probably less so to my mother who had to endure 
                the consequences of all the things he had not yet got around to 
                fixing. One of the prime attractions, at least for us children, 
                was the large garden and in particular the huge chestnut tree, 
                in which we built many camps and "forts".</p>
              <p>Even within the somewhat esoteric world of 
                British public schools, Beaumont was a rather unusual place. One 
                feature which is, to my knowledge, unique to Jesuit schools, is 
                that while the teaching staff includes both laymen, such as my 
                father, and priests, those who are priests typically have not 
                been school teachers for all or even most of their careers: they 
                may have been for example parish priests, missionaries or even 
                university teachers, and be doing the teaching job only for a 
                few years before going back to one of those occupations. Also, 
                in the case of "boarding" schools such as Beaumont, it is common 
                for priests who are retired to live on the premises, whether or 
                not they have been teachers there. As I will relate, this circumstance 
                had totally unforeseen consequences for my career.</p>
              <p>Not long after my transfer to Beaumont, at 
                the age of thirteen, I had to make what under normal circumstances 
                would have amounted to an irrevocable decision about my career 
                in life. I imagine that to anyone reading this 50 years later, 
                in the context of a European (even British) or North American 
                school system, this will seem quite incredible; but in those days 
                the degree of "channeling" even in progressive schools in Britain 
                (and Beaumont was far from progressive!) was extreme: you had 
                to choose at an early age (normally 15, but in my case 13) between 
                specialization in classics, modern languages, mathematics and 
                science. That choice then essentially determined which kinds of 
                degree you could take at university (assuming you went), and that 
                in turn put severe constraints on the kind of job you could reasonably 
                apply for. At Beaumont, the unspoken tradition was that if you 
                showed any signs of academic ability, as I apparently did, and 
                had no strong predilection to the contrary, you were automatically 
                channeled into the stream which was deemed most academically prestigious, 
                namely the classics stream (Latin and Greek languages and literature). 
                Remarkably, my father, despite his own training and employment, 
                never exerted the least pressure on me to take the science option 
                (which was generally regarded, for reasons which are unclear to 
                me, but were probably a reflection of a common attitude in Britain 
                at that time, as the least prestigious of all). So I indeed ended 
                up, at the age of thirteen, committed to spending most of my school 
                years on the classics, with only a small fraction available for 
                other subjects such as English, history, or mathematics. My memories 
                of this classics education are mixed: on the one hand, I still 
                recall the soul-destroying discipline of the "gender rhymes", 
                jingles which we were required to memorize to remind us of the 
                correct gender of Latin nouns, and fragments of which still 50 
                years later seem to take up kilobytes of storage space in my brain 
                which I am sure could be put to better use (". and common are 
                to either sex, <i>artifex</i> and <i>opifex</i> ..."). On the 
                other hand, some of my teachers were enthusiastic and inspiring, 
                and introduced me at an early stage to the poetry of Catullus 
                and Horace and the historical analysis of Thucydides.</p>
              <p>Although I by and large enjoyed the academic 
                side of life at Beaumont and prospered at it, in most other respects 
                I was a decided misfit: Almost all my fellow-pupils were fee-paying, 
                which almost automatically meant that they enjoyed, at home, a 
                lifestyle of which we had no experience; except in my last two 
                years I was one of a small minority of "day-boys" (that is, I 
                commuted daily from home rather than residing at the school throughout 
                the term); and, perhaps most importantly, because of my academic 
                precocity I was placed in classes with boys who were mostly a 
                couple of years older than me. As a result, the five years I spent 
                there, while not unhappy, do not stand out in retrospect as a 
                particularly joyful period of my life.</p>
              <p>However, at least two things happened during 
                those years which were to have, in different ways, very happy 
                long-term consequences. The first was that, for a reason I cannot 
                now recall (I think it may have been to help my recovery from 
                an illness which had kept me in bed for a month) my father decided 
                to send me on a mountaineering course in Snowdonia. Unlike the 
                rolling hills of Surrey and Berkshire which I had explored on 
                my solitary hikes, the mountains around Llanberis were the real 
                thing, craggy, mostly pathless and, in bad weather, decidedly 
                not to be trifled with; I fell in love with them at first sight, 
                and mountaineering in all its forms, from easy strolls to technically 
                relatively demanding rock-climbing, has been a major passion of 
                my life ever since.</p>
              <p>The second serendipitous event actually occurred 
                after I had competed for, and obtained, a scholarship to Balliol 
                College, Oxford, in December 1954. I had to wait a few months 
                before taking up the scholarship, and in those days there were 
                no nationally organized programs to employ people in my position 
                in voluntary service overseas, etc., so I somewhat reluctantly 
                stayed at school. Also living at the school was a retired priest, 
                Fr. Charles O'Hara, who had at one period of his career been a 
                university teacher of mathematics and had in fact written a textbook 
                on projective geometry. One day he ran into me in the corridor 
                and said to me: "You seem to have a lot of time on your hands. 
                Well, I have a lot of time on my hands. Why don't you come along 
                to my room for a couple of hours a week, and I'll show you some 
                interesting things in modern mathematics?" Now, at that point 
                I had only the minimal mathematics required for the "O-level" 
                examination (though I don't recall clearly, I think it did not 
                even include differential calculus, and certainly not the integral 
                variety), and I had absolutely no reason to think that I would 
                ever in my career need anything more sophisticated. However, I 
                indeed had time to kill, Fr. O'Hara seemed enthusiastic, and perhaps 
                to humor him as much as anything, I agreed to his proposal. So 
                for the rest of those two terms he gave me, for a couple of hours 
                a week, a sort of Cook's tour of ideas in modern mathematics, 
                involving concepts such as groups, rings, and fields which my 
                O-level education had never even grazed and which I found quite 
                fascinating. Even more importantly in retrospect, he actively 
                encouraged me to do a few simple exercises involving those concepts, 
                and to my initial surprise I found I could in fact do them without 
                great difficulty. After the end of the school year I had other 
                things on my mind and promptly forgot all the details of what 
                he had taught me; but this was to be the first of a series of 
                fortunate accidents that helped to shape my eventual career.</p>
              <p>In early October of 1955 I went up to Oxford 
                to take up my scholarship at Balliol, with the intention of reading 
                (majoring in) the degree technically known as Literae Humaniores, 
                and informally as Greats (on which more below). For me, coming 
                as I did from a school background which even by the standards 
                of those days was somewhat restrictive and conservative, entering 
                university was like stepping through a door and finding myself 
                in a completely new world. I still have idyllic memories of my 
                first two weeks in Oxford, with the autumn colors in the parks 
                at their peak and the scent in the air of infinite possibilities, 
                both intellectual and social. Although of course that initial 
                sense of excitement didn't last forever, by and large my nine 
                years at Oxford, as undergraduate and graduate, were very happy 
                indeed; not only did I thoroughly enjoy and prosper at my academic 
                work, but I made a variety of friends from all over the world, 
                especially from south and east Asia, with many of whom I have 
                kept in lifelong contact. On the sports side, I had done some 
                sculling at school, and initially rowed bow in the Balliol third 
                eight. However, it was not long before the coach noticed that 
                I was two stone lighter than the then coxswain ("cox") and interchanged 
                us, and thereafter my destiny was fixed; I eventually rose to 
                be cox of the first eight, and while I did not exactly steer them 
                to victory (in fact, in the year of my coxswainship we did, formally, 
                just about as badly as it is possible to do!), I nevertheless 
                feel we put up a good fight. (Incidentally, I should have no such 
                career possibility today: one consequence of the gender-integration 
                of the Oxford colleges which took place in the 70's is that the 
                coxes of college eights are now, for obvious reasons, almost invariably 
                female).</p>
              <p>The Oxford Greats degree is one of those many 
                British institutions which need to be understood in historical 
                rather than logical terms. It takes four years (12 trimesters), 
                and for the first five trimesters one studies Greek and Latin 
                languages and literature, thus making it the obvious choice of 
                degree for anyone who, like me, has specialized in the classics 
                at school. For the last seven trimesters one studies in parallel 
                "ancient", that is Greek and Roman, literature and philosophy; 
                the philosophy side of the degree has only a relatively small 
                "ancient" component (Plato and Aristotle), and is (or was in my 
                day) mostly centered in the analytic and mostly Anglo-Saxon tradition 
                (Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Russell, Wittgenstein ... and 
                in more contemporary terms Ayer, Ryle, Austin ...). I thoroughly 
                enjoyed all the components of the course; I found particularly 
                rewarding the individual (or sometimes two-person) tutorials characteristic 
                of the "Oxbridge" system, in which I could discuss with my tutors, 
                at least prima facie on equal terms, the most recent journal articles 
                on the origins of coinage in the ancient Mediterranean or the 
                concept of machine consciousness. (One disappointment I encountered 
                on eventually switching to physics is that in that subject, as 
                I suspect in most of the "hard" sciences, such cutting-edge discussions 
                are not realistically possible at the undergraduate level).</p>
              <p>I am often asked whether and how my Greats 
                training has been useful to me in my subsequent career in physics. 
                To that question I have a joking answer, namely that unlike (apparently) 
                some of my physics colleagues I at least know the difference between 
                the Greek letters <font face="Symbol">j</font> and <font face="Symbol">y</font>! 
                However, there is a serious answer: I certainly do feel the philosophy 
                component of the degree, at least, has helped to shape the way 
                at which I look at the world and in particular at the problems 
                of physics. This is not something which is easy to quantify or 
                make concrete; I have never undergone a course of psycho-analysis, 
                but I imagine that anyone who does so can never again look at 
                the world in quite the same light, and I think that the same is 
                true for the kind of rigorous course of analytic philosophy which 
                I went through at Oxford. Another analogy might be with the feeling 
                I experienced later when I learned to speak Japanese with a reasonable 
                degree of fluency; it is as if one has learned to use a muscle 
                that one did not know one had. At any rate I have never for a 
                moment regretted the years I spent on this degree.</p>
              <p>Towards the end of my third year in Oxford 
                it gradually began to dawn on me that I could not go on being 
                a student for ever and must start looking for gainful employment. 
                Not being endowed with a great deal of initiative, I first looked 
                around to see what careers previous Greats students at Balliol 
                had chosen. With few exceptions, it seemed that they had either 
                gone into the British civil service or become teachers, at university 
                or high-school level, of one of the subjects they had studied 
                (classics, ancient history or philosophy). As regarded the first 
                option, it did not take me long to figure out that even were I 
                to pass the examination for the civil service (something which 
                was by no means a foregone conclusion, since it tested qualities 
                rather different from the ones which had advantaged me in a purely 
                academic context), a career there was likely to be both uncongenial 
                to me and of dubious benefit to the British public. So I started 
                contemplating a career in academia; and since the subject which 
                I had enjoyed most, and performed best in, was philosophy, this 
                seemed the natural choice.</p>
              <p>But the more I thought about the prospect 
                of doing a doctorate in philosophy and eventually obtaining a 
                university lectureship in that subject, the more I realized that 
                in my bones I just did not want to do it. Why not? It never occurred 
                to me - as it no doubt would have to someone with more imagination 
                - that maybe I was not actually cut out for an academic career 
                at all. Rather I asked myself what exactly it was about philosophy 
                as such which deterred me from doing it professionally for life. 
                And I eventually came up with the answer that it was because what 
                counted as good or bad work in philosophy - at least as it was 
                practiced in Oxford at that time - seemed to depend so strongly 
                on the precise nuances of one's wording (something, incidentally, 
                which I suspect may have subtly disadvantaged non-native English 
                speakers in that discipline); there seemed to be no objective 
                criterion of what was correct or not, or even what was good work 
                or bad, and I felt in my bones that it was just such a criterion 
                that I needed if I was going to pursue an academic career. I did 
                indeed briefly consider the possibility of going into pure mathematics, 
                but rejected it on the grounds that in mathematics, almost by 
                the definition of the subject, to be wrong means you are stupid: 
                I wanted the possibility of <u>being wrong without being stupid</u> - 
                of being wrong, if you like, for interesting and nontrivial reasons. 
                Physics seemed to fill that bill, and while I had zero formal 
                training in that subject, the confidence which I had acquired 
                from Fr. O'Hara in advanced mathematics led me to believe that 
                that aspect of the subject, at least, would not give me major 
                difficulty. So, in the early summer of 1958 I took my courage 
                in both hands and applied to do a second Oxford undergraduate 
                degree, in physics, following the anticipated completion in spring 
                1959 of my Greats degree.</p>
              <p>In those days in Britain to do a second undergraduate 
                degree in anything, let alone in a subject in which one had no 
                secondary-school experience, was practically unheard of, and I 
                immediately faced several practical obstacles. In the first place, 
                I had to persuade some college to accept me; secondly, I had to 
                find some way of financing two more years of undergraduate education, 
                and finally, since 1959 was known to be the last year of conscription 
                in Britain, I had to persuade my draft board that my application 
                to do a second degree was not just a ruse to avoid military service 
                for ever (a consequence it in fact had). At this point I had another 
                piece of luck: in October of 1957 engineers in the Soviet Union 
                had propelled into space the first Sputnik, thus stealing a march 
                on the West in what not just governments, but every layman could 
                see was an extraordinarily important area of technology. Immediately 
                the cry went up from politicians and the press: how have the Soviets 
                managed to get ahead of us in this crucially important enterprise? 
                And the answer was not long coming: It was because we have encouraged 
                all our best brains to study useless subjects (such as classics) 
                rather than useful ones (such as science and engineering and particularly 
                physics). Immediately all sorts of scholarships became available 
                for students in the arts who wished to transfer to science; and 
                while I did not in the end need to apply for any of these, I think 
                that the general shift in cultural attitudes which they reflected 
                was an enormous psychological boost to me in making the switch, 
                and in particular may have been the crucial element in helping 
                my prospective tutors to convince the draft board that they could 
                dispense with my services on the parade ground.</p>
              <p>The two people who played the most indispensable 
                role in helping me make the transition are David Brink and Michael 
                Baker. In those days most Oxford colleges did not have a tutor 
                in theoretical physics as such, but Balliol had recently appointed 
                David in this role, and since I initially applied to Balliol it 
                was he who had to take a decision on whether I was or was not 
                a reasonable prospect for a degree in physics, despite my lack 
                of background. He asked me to read various sections of that beautiful 
                book, "What is mathematics?" by Courant and Robbins in the summer 
                vacation between my third and fourth years, and when I returned 
                in October tested me on them; on the basis of my performance he 
                recommended that Balliol should accept me for a second degree. 
                However, by that time I had applied somewhat speculatively to 
                Merton, where Michael Baker was a tutor in physics, for a Domus 
                scholarship. These scholarships were normally given to students 
                undertaking a postgraduate degree, but in my case the Fellows 
                generously made an exception. Thus, I ended up doing my degree 
                in physics at Merton; Michael was my principal tutor, but since 
                he was an experimentalist and Merton did not at the time have 
                a tutor in theoretical physics as such, I went to David for most 
                of the more theoretically oriented parts of the course. In order 
                to get a classified degree I had to complete the course in two 
                years rather than the standard three, and this resulted in a certain 
                degree of mental indigestion: I recall simultaneously struggling 
                with old-fashioned problems involving rods and pulleys from Humphrey 
                and Topping's "Intermediate Mechanics" and with the properties 
                of Hilbert space as set out in Mandl's text on quantum mechanics.</p>
              <p>The final examination at Oxford was in those 
                days (maybe it still is) an ordeal unimaginable by those who have 
                not experienced it: there was no continuous assessment at all, 
                and one's whole academic fate depended on a succession of closed-book 
                three-hour written papers (in the case of Greats fourteen of them), 
                one after the other, two per day, with only the weekend as a short 
                respite. Not surprisingly, the population of the psychiatric wards 
                of the local hospitals used to peak markedly before and during 
                those periods. Actually, in my Greats degree I had thrived on 
                the stress and come out with a straight first class, so I was 
                probably over-confident going into the physics final exam. In 
                the event this nearly turned into a complete disaster: the first 
                paper was, I think, on thermodynamics, an area where problems 
                notoriously require just the right trick to solve them, and after 
                an hour and a half of the three hours I had got nowhere with the 
                first problem I had tackled. I remember sitting at my desk in 
                the exam room, my head figuratively if not literally in my hands, 
                and contemplating the prospect of having dashed the hopes of all 
                those who had supported and shown faith in me; it was one of the 
                blackest moments of my life. In the end I pulled myself together 
                and was able to answer one or two questions on that paper, as 
                well as coping reasonably with the remaining papers; but when 
                I was told that I was on the borderline between two (unspecified) 
                classes and would therefore have to undergo a viva (oral exam) 
                to decide between them, I was convinced that the two classes in 
                question were a second and a third. Imagine my incredulity and, 
                eventually, my delight when a few days after the viva, a letter 
                arrived informing me that I had a first (and would therefore qualify 
                more or less automatically for public funding for an advanced 
                degree should I so chose). If nothing else, I think that experience 
                has convinced me that no examination system, and certainly not 
                the one I went through, can be an infallible measure even of purely 
                academic ability.</p>
              <p>I was now in a position to proceed to postgraduate 
                research in physics. I had specialized on the theoretical side 
                as an undergraduate, and my memories of the (rather small) amount 
                of lab work I had had to do were not particularly rosy, so it 
                seemed natural to apply for research on the theoretical side. 
                But where, in which area and to whom? The first question answered 
                itself easily, since I felt (perhaps wrongly) that no university 
                other than Oxford itself was likely to appreciate my peculiar 
                academic background. As to the second, the main areas of theoretical 
                work at Oxford in those days were particle theory and condensed-matter 
                (or, as it was known in those days, "solid-state") physics. The 
                time was early 1961, and the advice I got from the theorists I 
                consulted was that the current state of particle theory was not 
                very exciting (an opinion which had to be revised a few months 
                later, when the concept of unitary symmetry burst on the scene); 
                so I opted for the condensed-matter area. Finally, one person 
                who was willing to overlook my unorthodox credentials was Dirk 
                ter Haar, then a reader in theoretical physics and a fellow of 
                Magdalen College; so I signed up for research under his supervision. 
                As with all his students in that period, the tentatively assigned 
                topic of my thesis was "Some Problems in the Theory of Many-Body 
                Systems," which left me a considerable degree of latitude.</p>
              <p>Even by the standards of British universities 
                in those days, Dirk's supervisory style was somewhat unusual. 
                He took a great interest in the personal welfare of his students 
                and their families, and was meticulous in making sure they received 
                adequate support; indeed, in the middle of my second year of research 
                he encouraged me to apply for a Prize Fellowship (junior fellowship) 
                at Magdalen. To my great surprise I was successful, I am sure 
                in considerable measure thanks to his advocacy, and thereafter 
                was able to enjoy a lifestyle rather more opulent than had been 
                possible on the standard graduate studentship which had supported 
                me earlier. On the other hand, Dirk's method of supervising graduate 
                research was to throw his students in at the deep end: by a few 
                months into our relationship I had got the message that it was 
                up to me not only to solve my thesis problem, once posed, but 
                to find a viable problem in the first place. (I try to encourage 
                my own graduate students to do the same, although I do not take 
                Dirk's extreme position of refusing, in effect, to make any suggestions 
                at all). In the end my thesis work consisted of studies of two 
                somewhat disconnected problems in the general area of liquid helium, 
                one on higher-order phonon interaction processes in superfluid 
                <sup>4</sup>He and the other on the properties of dilute solutions 
                of <sup>4</sup>He in normal liquid <sup>3</sup>He (a system which 
                unfortunately turned out to be much less experimentally accessible 
                than the other side of the phase diagram, dilute solutions of 
                <sup>3</sup>He in <sup>4</sup>He). Although both halves resulted 
                in publications, neither made much impact, and the only feature 
                which in retrospect distinguishes my D. Phil. thesis in any way 
                is that a small part of it (the acknowledgements) is, as permitted 
                by the Oxford examination statutes and as a result of what our 
                forebears would no doubt have described as a "conceit", written 
                in Latin.</p>
              <p>One part of my graduate student experience 
                which I have always felt was particularly valuable to me was the 
                undergraduate teaching I did during this period. I had started 
                this, I think as soon as I began graduate research, with a view 
                to supplementing my rather subsistence-level studentship, but 
                kept it up even after the Magdalen fellowship eliminated the need 
                for this; as I recall, it was six hours per week of one-on-one 
                or one-on-two individual tutorials in the undergraduate "theoretical 
                option", and I found I enjoyed it immensely and learned at least 
                as much from it as from my formal research activities. Nowadays 
                I always insist, as a matter of principle rather than financial 
                economy, that my own graduate students spend at least one semester 
                per year as teaching assistants.</p>
              <p>In the spring of 1964, as I approached the 
                three-year deadline for submission of my D. Phil. thesis, I began 
                to think about postdoctoral work. In applying I had two criteria: 
                the group in question should be a world-class center of excellence 
                in many-body theory, and the environment should be as different 
                as possible from Oxford (where I had by now spent nine years, 
                more than a third of my life). So posed, the problem had an essentially 
                unique solution, namely the group of David Pines at the University 
                of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and it was there that I applied; 
                I don't think I even bothered applying anywhere else in those 
                pre-information revolution days, the preparation of multiple applications 
                was quite a daunting and time-consuming task. Despite this, I 
                was quite surprised and gratified to be accepted. (David tells 
                me that the letter Dirk wrote for me said in effect that I had 
                a good training on the arts side but didn't know any physics - 
                a statement which in view of my highly compacted education in 
                that subject was certainly true, but to which David's reaction 
                was "well, that's something we can teach him!"). So I spent the 
                period August 1964 - August 1965 at UIUC, and David and his colleagues 
                (<a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1972/index.html">John Bardeen</a>, 
                Gordon Baym, Leo Kadanoff and others) did indeed teach me a great 
                deal. And it was indeed very different from Oxford ...</p>
              <p>From the academic point of view that year 
                at UIUC was a turning-point in my career; as recounted in my Nobel 
                lecture, I not only became interested in the (at the time hypothetical) 
                superfluid phase of liquid <sup>3</sup>He, but produced my first 
                research (on <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Fermi</a>-liquid 
                effects in the superfluid phase) to make any real impact internationally. 
                However, I did not find the physical environment congenial (it 
                was only a few years since Dutch elm disease had wiped out more 
                of the town's mature trees, something which is an essential ingredient 
                of the quality of life in small Midwestern towns), and I remember 
                swearing an oath to myself, as I left at the end of the year, 
                that I would never come back and live permanently in Champaign-Urbana 
                - an oath which I was to break rather spectacularly twenty years 
                later.</p>
              <p>My Magdalen fellowship still had a couple 
                of years to run, and the natural thing would have been to return 
                to Oxford and spend them there. However, I had become increasingly 
                interested in north-east Asia, and anxious to spend some time 
                there before committing myself to the standard British academic 
                career; and the Fellows of the college eventually consented, with 
                considerable generosity, to allow me to spend a year of my fellowship 
                in the group of Professor Takeo Matsubara at Kyoto University 
                in Japan. This year at Kyoto was a marvelous experience for me. 
                It was my first real experience of living and working in a foreign 
                culture, and I tried to exploit it to the fullest: I lived in 
                a standard Japanese student room, put a considerable amount of 
                effort into learning the language and tried as far as possible 
                to avoid using English or mingling very much with other foreigners. 
                At this time this was not at all the typical behavior of Western 
                visitors, and many years later I was told that it had caused considerable 
                interest and speculation among some of my Japanese colleagues, 
                who finally hit on what had to be the only logical explanation 
                - that I must be a trainee CIA agent! Fortunately this opinion 
                did not prevent me making many good friends during that year, 
                and I have very warm memories of all the parties, mountain hikes 
                and home visits we shared. Although the academic work I did during 
                this year was overall not particularly remarkable, it included 
                the paper on two-band superconductors which was to play a crucial 
                role in my research on superfluid <sup>3</sup>He a few years later.</p>
              <p>After one more postdoctoral year which I spent 
                in "roving" mode, spending time at Oxford, Harvard and Illinois, 
                in the autumn of 1967 I took up a lectureship at the University 
                of Sussex, where I was to spend the next fifteen years of my career. 
                Sussex was one of the "new" universities founded in the fifties, 
                and at that point was only a few years old, but had managed to 
                attract among other things a lively group of theoretical physicists 
                under the leadership of Roger Blin-Stoyle and a constellation 
                of able low-temperature experimentalists headed by Douglas Brewer. 
                However, what attracted me most was the liberal and collegial 
                atmosphere both in the University as a whole and in the Physics 
                Department, which actively encouraged people to explore their 
                intellectual interests across traditional academic boundaries; 
                quite a few of my colleagues, though trained in the traditional 
                areas of physics, ended up spending much of their time on science 
                policy, physics education and elsewhere. However, although I enjoyed 
                this relaxed environment, I spent my first five years at Sussex 
                mostly teaching the standard undergraduate physics courses and, 
                in the time available for research, working on various problems 
                in theoretical low-temperature physics, including some such as 
                the possible "supersolid" phase of helium which appear to still 
                be of interest nearly forty years later. Being without family 
                attachments, I was able to spend a lot of time abroad during the 
                vacations, and in particular had an extended stay at the Max-Planck-Institute 
                in München and a couple of trips to winter schools in Karpacz, 
                Poland (at the time something of a minor adventure, since the 
                Iron Curtain was still firmly in place).</p>
              <p>In the summer of 1972 there occurred the series 
                of events which were to shape my research career for the next 
                decade; I have recounted these in my Nobel lecture and will not 
                repeat them here. At just about the same time an important event 
                occurred on the personal front: I became engaged to Haruko Kinase, 
                at that time an undergraduate student at Sussex, and we married 
                in June 1972. (Since Haruko's nationality was and is Japanese, 
                and her undergraduate major was international relations, the family 
                joke is that at least she passed the practical!). We had a sort 
                of extended honeymoon in Japan, living in central Tokyo with Haruko's 
                parents while I worked in the group of Professor Yasushi Wada 
                at the Hongo campus of Tokyo University. One spin-off from this 
                stay was that I got to know Shin Takagi, who was in his final 
                year as a graduate student in the Wada group, and was sufficiently 
                impressed with him that I invited him to Sussex as a postdoc; 
                he spent a couple of years there, and we collaborated extensively 
                on superfluid 3He as well as having many conversations ranging 
                over the whole of physics. Incidentally, if my early years in 
                the extreme outer reaches of the London conurbation are not counted, 
                the only large cities anywhere in the world where I have ever 
                lived for more than a few months are Kyoto and Tokyo; I can think 
                of a lot worse.</p>
              <p>As this note has to be of finite length, I 
                will speed up at this point and just review the important events 
                in my life since 1974. Soon after our return from Japan, in early 
                1975, Haruko and I acquired a small house that we still own in 
                the warren of streets above London Road station in central Brighton, 
                and it was there (or more accurately on the twelfth floor of the 
                nearby Royal Sussex County Hospital) that our daughter Asako was 
                born in September 1978, and there that she spent the first five 
                years of her life. After returning from Japan I spent several 
                more very enjoyable years at Sussex, with various excursions including 
                two one-semester trips in 1976 and 1977 to the University of Science 
                and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana, with which Sussex had a teaching 
                exchange arrangement. This was another interesting cultural shock; 
                one unexpected aspect was that because of the generally relaxed 
                atmosphere in Ghana, I had for the first time in many years a 
                surfeit of free time, and I used it among other things to write 
                a paper on nonlocal hidden-variables theories which I eventually 
                published a full quarter-century later.</p>
              <p>In the spring of 1982 I received, out of the 
                blue, an offer from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
                of the MacArthur Chair with which the university had recently 
                been endowed, and after the three of us had been across for a 
                visit (where I observed, inter alia, that the trees had recovered 
                from the blight of the early 60's!) we decided to make the move. 
                As I had already committed myself to an eight-month stay at Cornell 
                in early 1983, we finally arrived in Urbana in the early fall 
                of that year, and have been there ever since, so that Asako has 
                in effect grown up as an American (she and I both eventually received 
                U.S. citizenship, which we hold dual with that of the U.K., in 
                the summer of 2002). Haruko eventually obtained a Ph.D. in cultural 
                anthropology from the University of Illinois, and is currently 
                doing research on the hospice system; Asako has graduated, also 
                from UIUC, with a joint major in geography and chemistry. My own 
                research interests have shifted away from superfluid <sup>3</sup>He 
                since around 1980 (although I still maintain an interest in some 
                problems involving violent departures from equilibrium); I have 
                worked inter alia on the low-temperature properties of glasses, 
                high-temperature superconductivity, the BEC atomic gases and above 
                all on the theory of experiments to test whether the formation 
                of quantum mechanics will continue to describe the physical world 
                as we push it up from the atomic level towards that of everyday 
                life (a program for which my shorthand is "building <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schrödinger</a>'s 
                Cat in the laboratory"). It is satisfying that this program, which 
                when proposed twenty-five years ago met with considerable skepticism, 
                seems in the last three or four years to have come to fruition, 
                in the sense that several experimental groups have realized, in 
                Josephson devices, quantum superpositions which can be legitimately 
                regarded as of the "Schrödinger's Cat" type.</p>
              <p>When I look back on the chain of events which led to the research which
the Nobel Committee has recognized, I realize how incredibly fortunate I
have been - not just because of the intervention in my career of seemingly irrelevant
events such as the propulsion of Sputnik into orbit in the fall of 1957,
but because so many people were prepared to put their faith in me, and in
particular my ability to make a successful career in physics, at a time when the
evidence in favor of that proposition was nonexistent or perhaps even negative.
I shall remain forever grateful.</p>
