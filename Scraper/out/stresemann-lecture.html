  <h2>The New Germany</h2>

  <p>It is a great honor for me to address you
  today. I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt thanks
  for the great distinction which the Nobel Committee has conferred
  upon me. I would also add my warm gratitude for the cordial
  welcome you have extended to me. I know that this honor has a
  special character, since it is awarded not for scientific and
  theoretical research, but for practical politics. It is not
  awarded to an individual country nor to a representative of an
  individual country. It reflects, rather, the common policy of all
  those countries who are traveling along the same road. And thus,
  in the case of Germany too, it is not awarded for the work of a
  single individual. As a confirmed individualist I certainly do
  not wish to underrate the influence of the individual, for the
  masses do not lead the individual; rather, in the individual is
  vested the capacity to lead the masses. But when great ideas and
  the vital affairs of a nation are at stake, then the individual
  needs the support of the spiritual leaders of the nation.</p>

  <p>During the past few years I have led a
  sometimes hard battle for German foreign policy. I am thus,
  perhaps, particularly well placed to answer the questions so
  often raised about Germany's frame of mind. The attitude abroad
  concerning our state of mind vacillates among approval,
  skepticism, criticism, and hostility. Let me identify and discuss
  with you the leading trends in politics and thought in the new
  Germany, insofar as they have emerged in the historically short
  time since the war.</p>

  <p>I must begin by saying something about the
  old Germany. That Germany, too, suffered from superficial
  judgment, because appearances and reality were not always kept
  apart in people's minds. True, it still preserved the spirit of
  paternalism imparted to it by Frederick William I<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> , but it was a paternalism
  administered with an iron loyalty and sense of duty to the state
  and the people. It had officialdom disparaged in other countries
  as a bureaucracy that knew only one ideal: service to the state.
  This old Germany was partly defeated in its conflict with the
  progressive ideas of socialism, for it had given the people
  nothing that could serve as a successful alternative to
  socialism. It was, however, a land of social and political
  progress far less given to the philosophy of laissez-faire than
  some other countries with other forms of government. It was a
  land of barracks, a land of universal military conscription, and
  a land of strong sympathy for the military; but it was also a
  land of technology, of chemistry, and in general of the most
  up-to-date research. The old and the new struggled for control.
  Whoever writes its history must not merely look at the surface of
  things but rather look into its depths.</p>

  <p>This was the country in which most of us
  who today occupy responsible positions in Germany spent the
  greater part of our lives. Just as the child is father to the
  man, so the impressions of one's youth remain the most vivid in
  manhood. Just as a child respects his father even when he
  perceives his weaknesses and faults, so a German will not despise
  the old Germany which was once a symbol of greatness to him. The
  idea in the British saying, "England, with all thy faults, I love
  thee still"<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, applies also to
  all that was creditable and worthy in the old Germany. Just as
  the British subject loves England despite her faults, so we must
  insist that all Germans who were part of the old Germany and
  helped shape her, recognize the greatness and worthiness of
  present-day Germany.</p>

  <p>As a result of the World War, this old
  Germany collapsed. It collapsed in its constitution, in its
  social order, in its economic structure. Its thinking and feeling
  changed. No one can say that this transformation is yet complete.
  It is a process which will continue through generations: But just
  as haste and restlessness are typical of our present-day life, so
  change also takes place more rapidly than before. This applies to
  change in the relationships between nations as it does to change
  within an individual nation.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Nobel Foundation is the
  furthering of peace. The intention of the man who created it was
  to counter the natural forces which his own genius had released
  with the restraining powers of the human spirit. Is the recent
  development of the German people such as to justify the award
  being given here for a policy aimed at peace? One may well say
  that the question is answered by the very existence of the German
  policy of reconciliation and peace, for this policy would have
  been impossible had it not been in accord with the deepest desire
  of the German people, the desire for peaceful international
  cooperation in justice and freedom.</p>

  <p>Here we encounter two conflicting concepts
  with which we must come to grips in our time: the idea of
  national solidarity and the idea of international cooperation.
  The superficial view is that the intellectual, spiritual, and
  emotional faculties of a nation are bounded by geographic,
  linguistic, and ethnic barriers. To contrast national solidarity
  and international cooperation as two opposites seems foolish to
  me. As Germany's representative in Geneva<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, I tried to discuss this particular
  point. I expressed the belief that it cannot have been intended
  in the divine plan that man's noblest abilities should be working
  in opposition to one another. I tried to make the point that the
  man who cultivates to the highest degree the qualities inherent
  in his national culture will gain insight into universal
  knowledge and feeling which transcend the limitations of his own
  heritage; and he will create works which, like cathedrals,
  although built upon the soil of his native land, will soar into
  the heaven of all mankind. A Shakespeare could have arisen only
  on English soil. In the same way, your great dramatists and poets
  express the nature and essence of the Norwegian people, but they
  also express that which is universally valid for all mankind.
  Dante can be understood only within the context of Italian
  thought, and <i>Faust</i> would be unthinkable if divorced from
  its German background; but both are part of our common cultural
  heritage. They break the bonds which bind them to their own
  nations, yet they are great only because their inspiration is so
  firmly rooted in their own countries. National culture can act as
  a bridge, instead of an obstacle, to mutual spiritual and
  intellectual understanding. The great men of a nation reach out
  to all mankind. They are unifying, not divisive; internationally
  conciliating and still great nationally. The French Minister
  Herriot<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> expressed this well
  at the international music festival at Frankfurt am Main when he
  said, "A worker for internationalism must first have a sense of
  nationalism." He also said, "To work effectively for peace, a man
  must first know peace within himself." Here we face the great
  question that each nation asks the others, "Do you really mean it
  when you talk of cooperation? What are you really thinking? Can I
  look into the depths of your soul and find out if you really want
  to work and build with me?" This is the question which Germany
  has been asked so often that I would like to discuss it here in
  some detail.</p>

  <p>If one seeks to analyze experiences and
  reactions to the first postwar years, I hope one may say without
  being accused of bias that it is easier for the victor than for
  the vanquished to advocate peace. For the victor peace means the
  preservation of the position of power which he has secured. For
  the vanquished it means resigning himself to the position left to
  him. To walk behind others on a road you are traveling together,
  to give precedence to others without envy - this is painful for
  an individual and painful for a nation. But to believe that the
  work of half a century has brought one to the summit, and then to
  plunge down from that summit - that is even more painful to the
  human soul. The psychology of a people who have experienced this
  is not so easy to understand and not so easy to alter as many
  believe.</p>

  <p>This was the problem facing the new
  Germany. The way which led to those events, referred to by your
  chairman when he mentioned Locarno and Geneva and spoke of
  Germany's admission to the League of Nations, was not made easy
  for Germany. The courtesy which most becomes a victor was denied
  to Germany for a long time. Germany had to assume super-human
  reparations which the people would never have borne had there not
  existed an ageless legacy of service to the state. Historians
  still often see the end of the war as meaning nothing more for
  Germany than lost territories, lost participation in
  colonization, and lost assets for the state and individuals. They
  frequently overlook the most serious loss that Germany suffered.
  This was, in my view, that the intellectual and professional
  middle class, which traditionally upheld the idea of service to
  the state, paid for its total devotion to the state during the
  war with the total loss of its own wealth, and with its
  consequent reduction to the level of the proletariat. Its money
  became worthless when the state, which had issued it, refused to
  redeem it at face value<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>. To
  what extent demanding this sacrifice from an entire generation as
  a service to the state was legitimate is a matter of controversy
  which concerns laymen and legislators alike and one which has not
  yet been resolved. But all that has taken place in Germany since
  the war must be looked at in the light of the mood of this
  completely uprooted class. As a consequence of the terms of the
  Treaty of Versailles, the officer corps of the old army became
  part of this class, as did that part of the younger generation
  who, in the old Germany, would have become officers or civil
  servants. Theirs was an economic uprooting. But there was a
  mental and political uprooting, as well, of all those who had a
  deep loyalty to the 500-year-old tradition of the monarchy and
  who were now without a solid foundation for their thinking and
  emotions. They all had shared in the rise and fall of Germany's
  fortunes during the war, but not one had expected this disaster.
  They did not want to break with the old because they did not know
  how to find their way in this changed Germany. As so often
  happens in history, their difficulties were increased by the
  overzealousness of those who promoted their innovations too
  rashly, instead of combining to a certain extent the old with the
  new.</p>

  <p>Downtrodden and humiliated, beggars who had
  once been leaders, these people in their pessimism became the
  sharpest critics of unjustified attacks from without and of lack
  of respect for tradition at home. Furthermore, developments after
  the downfall of the leading class - and here I am speaking not of
  the nobility or the great landowners, but of the middle classes
  who saw the fruits of a lifetime of work vanish and who had to
  start from scratch to earn a bare livelihood - the developments
  after their downfall led to the convulsion of the whole social
  structure of the old Germany. Then came a further political
  shock: the invasion of the Ruhr<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Once again the feeling of being
  pillaged and plundered flared up in intense resistance. But this
  feeling now began to differentiate between those nations which
  apparently wanted to continue the conflict with Germany and those
  which held that a legal justification for the invasion did not
  exist. Voices were heard from the United States of America which
  made it clear that America wanted a peaceful and united Europe as
  a basis for mutual cooperation. Then came the conference in
  London about the Dawes Plan<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
  Statesmen took the place of the economists and the bankers, and
  as MacDonald<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> was leaving
  Downing Street one day during this time, he said that the words
  of the old Scottish song, "Should auld acquaintance be forgot?"
  were going through his mind.</p>

  <p>For the first time, the wounded German
  people saw their representatives not merely as objects of
  legislation by others, but as participants in common
  negotiations; and they heard from Herriot's own lips the promise
  to evacuate the Ruhr. In the passionate struggle between the
  pessimists who could not believe in the possibility of a change
  in world outlook and those who were deliberately starting on a
  new road, the latter triumphed. From the beginning they had had a
  few supporters, but these were now augmented by the members of
  the working class. This group, no less patriotic than any other
  in Germany, had revived old connections in the hope of finding
  among their political and trade union comrades, men to work for
  their ideal of cooperation between nations.</p>

  <p>Briand<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
  succeeded Herriot as French minister of foreign affairs and
  implemented the pledge to evacuate the Ruhr. Then, with the note
  of February 9, 1925, German initiative inaugurated the policy of
  Locarno<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. It would be quite
  untrue to suggest that from the first moment the Locarno policy
  met with joyful and enthusiastic approval. Distrust abroad
  delayed a prompt response to the German move. It was met at home
  with misrepresentation; in what was really the beginning of an
  active policy, some saw weak resignation and the politics of
  renunciation. Our opponents introduced new questions into the
  debate to test the sincerity of Germany's desire for peace. Entry
  into the League of Nations was made a condition for putting the
  Locarno Treaties into effect. What a change that was! In 1919
  Germany had tried to join the League of Nations and was rejected
  by shortsighted and undiscerning people. Now its entry was
  desired. The League, founded as an association of victors, was
  seeking cooperation and reconciliation with the most powerful of
  its World War opponents. Here too, strong feelings had to be
  overcome, for in Germany's view the right to self-determination
  had not always been recognized in the League's decisions
  concerning the fate of former German territories. At last, after
  many ups and downs of trust and distrust, agreement on the
  treaties was reached. Then, in March, 1926, petty maneuvering and
  petty jealousy once again made it impossible for Germany to join
  the League. But at the same time, however, came the well-known
  decision of the former Allies to negotiate as if Germany belonged
  to the League, even though she had not been officially
  admitted.</p>

  <p>In September, Germany was admitted to the
  League of Nations. On that occasion Mr. Briand said in a speech,
  which was heard in all parts of the world, that the era of
  cannons and machine guns must end. He uttered words which should
  endure for the rest of this century, declaring that the two great
  nations, the German and the French, had won so many laurels from
  each other on the battlefields of war that the future should see
  them contending only for the great idealistic goals of
  mankind<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>No one who witnessed these events in Geneva
  is ever likely to forget them.</p>

  <p>The history of nations shows that words are
  not always immediately followed by action. History uses a unit of
  measure for time that is different from that of the lifespan of
  the individual, whereas man is only too ready to measure the
  evolution of history by his own yardstick. In the period that
  followed we climbed to the heights and fell to the depths; we saw
  our budding confidence nipped by the frosts of suspicion and war
  psychosis; and even now, instead of unanimous support for peace
  from all the people of the world, we can observe a crisis of
  faith in its whole development.</p>

  <p>These were the first developments leading
  toward mutual understanding and coexistence on the part of former
  antagonists. But they were not always progressive. I have
  deliberately tried to give an honest account without glossing
  over the first breakdown and the ups and downs of the struggle.
  Nothing in the reporting of a nation's history could so mislead
  the younger generation as to represent great events in such a way
  that they appear to have happened as a matter of course. Nothing
  is more misleading to the youth of a nation than to state the
  outcome immediately after the beginning as if nothing could have
  taken place in between. Mankind advances only through struggle.
  The life of the individual is a continuous combat with errors and
  obstacles, and no victory is more satisfying than the one
  achieved against opposition. The life of man is not a level plane
  on which he moves ahead at will unopposed. A man should not end
  his days as a pessimist just because his short span of years has
  not brought fulfillment of his ideals. The complete realization
  of the ideal would remove the life-force which drives each of us
  forward, for human life would lose its meaning if there were
  nothing left for man to envision and strive for. Therefore, in
  this account of the difficulties, I do not address myself to the
  pessimists; I want to turn to those who ask why we have not made
  greater progress. I want to show them that in such times it is
  unreasonable to suppose that universal distrust and outdated
  attitudes will give way at one stroke to a new enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Since these developments were not without periods of
  regression, because the intense hopes were followed by
  disappointment, Germany's development was also not without
  fluctuation. The feelings and emotions of an individualistic
  people like the Germans cannot easily be reduced to a common
  denominator. Nevertheless, it can be said today, and it has been
  demonstrated by recent debates in the Reichstag, that the
  overwhelming majority of the German people are united in a desire
  for peace and reconciliation.</p>

  <p>I do not refer here to the extreme feelings of the Left and
  Right. A people that has experienced all that the Germans have
  been through, naturally offers fertile soil for the extremists.
  The ballast in the center of the German ship which saved it from
  heavy rolling in the past, that valuable and steady middle class
  group, no longer exists. The uprooted saw their hope in a
  complete reversal of affairs. It was at this time that the great
  tide of Bolshevism broke over Germany, appearing on the left as
  Communism and on the right as National Socialism. That a nation,
  whose currency had collapsed, whose social and economic
  reorganization had been as ruthless as ours - that this nation,
  which had to learn to live in an entirely new situation, has been
  able to master Bolshevism of the Right and of the Left, shows the
  healthiness of its spirit, the zeal of its industriousness, and
  the victory of realpolitik over the imaginary and illusory.</p>

  <p>A German statesman of the postwar period has said that
  Napoleon's. maxim that "politics is our destiny" is no longer
  valid. He thought he could equate our destiny with economics. I
  cannot agree, but I will admit that the policies of nations and
  groups have perhaps never been as greatly influenced by economic
  tendencies and developments as they are at present. And so I
  begin with economics, not because economics is of first
  importance, but because the inborn drive of the Germans to work,
  to create, and to rebuild, has been so apparent in this past
  decade. We did not, in accordance with the doctrine of
  laissez-faire, bring all welfare programs to a halt. Indeed, we
  tried in every way to reduce unemployment and its consequences.
  It may be that some individual initiative has been stifled by
  this far-reaching social concern on the part of the state; but
  taken overall, this policy points in the right direction. In the
  new Germany, the working class, regardless of the type of
  political representation they were subject to, has been won over
  to empire and state. In spite of the criticism which has so often
  been directed at the allegedly predominating influence of this
  class, I want to stress that the resulting fusion of the whole
  nation with the state is to be valued more highly than the
  one-sidedness or insufficiency of the legislation that brought
  this about is to be disparaged. Today a whole nation shares
  responsibility for the state and its future. In cities and
  communities throughout the country absolute opposition and
  negativism have been stopped. In previous centuries the king
  could truthfully say that he was the first servant of the state.
  But today all members of society are servants of the state.</p>

  <p>No change in the balance of political parties can alter the
  general determination that no class should be excluded from
  contributing to and sharing responsibility for the state. This
  determination has provided a strong defense against extremists, a
  common interest in the rebuilding of the state, and a basis for
  the consolidation and preservation of national unity. The German
  people were united in their will to protect this unity against
  all attacks from within and without. They were stronger in
  adversity than in prosperity.</p>

  <p>The fusion of these groups which were once fundamentally
  antagonistic to the state was in contrast during the first few
  years to the aversion held by many intellectuals and powerful
  industrialists for the new state, an aversion sustained by their
  disregard of important intangible drives in the national spirit.
  These negative attitudes, aversions, and enmities are today
  confined to a few groups of extreme rightist radicals. The
  winning over of those who in former times had been against the
  state was followed by the winning over of those who at first felt
  compelled to reject the new state and the new form of government.
  Here too, the events and politics of the day cannot obscure the
  historical fact that a working cooperation has been achieved. I
  cite for example Germany's most industrialized province, the
  province in which socialism can look back on its longest
  tradition, the former kingdom and present free state of Saxony
  where a ministry is functioning in which Socialists and
  Nationalists are working together. The urge to get things done
  will in the long run prove stronger than party loyalty. Today the
  differences of opinion are no longer confined by the boundaries
  of parties and factions; they run right across the individual
  parties themselves. In the end, all differences of opinion were
  conquered by the conviction that all hands were needed for
  rebuilding and that the children and grandchildren who will one
  day look back on our time will award the palm of approval only to
  those who did not stand aside in these difficult days, but who
  offered their help to rebuild the house which had collapsed.
  True, the conflict between old and new has not yet been resolved.
  How could it be, even in a whole decade?</p>

  <p>But the idea of an irreconcilable struggle between the old
  Germany and the new was confronted by the concept of a synthesis
  of old and new. Nobody in Germany is fighting for the
  reestablishment of the past. Its weaknesses and faults are
  obvious. What many do wish to have recognized in the new Germany
  is respect for what was great and worthy in the old. All events
  are linked with personalities that become their symbols. For the
  German people, this synthesis of old and new is embodied in the
  person of their president. He came as the successor to the first
  president of the Reich, who rose from the opposition and with
  great tact, political wisdom, and patriotism, smoothed the road
  from chaos to order and from order to reconstruction. In
  President von Hindenburg<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>,
  elected by the people, the nation sees a unity which transcends
  parties and a personality which commands respect, reverence, and
  affection. Raised in the traditions of the old monarchy he now
  fulfills his duties to the young republic during the most
  difficult and trying times. The President of the Reich
  personifies the idea of national unity. On the occasion of his
  eightieth birthday which will soon be here, all will join to show
  that for the overwhelming majority the concept of Germany itself
  comes before loyalty to political parties and ideologies.</p>

  <p>Certainly, this loyalty to the new Germany has been attained
  slowly and with difficulty, but every day more people rally to
  it. They are not attracted by mere novelty, but by the
  conclusions of their own soul-searching, which give a far better
  guarantee of its permanence. One cannot say as did the bishop to
  the Merovingian king, "Bow your head in humility, proud
  Sicambrian, worship that which you have burnt, and burn that
  which you have worshipped."<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> Such conversion is not brought
  about in a day; it must arise from conflict in the soul. He who,
  after a hard fight, is willing for the sake of the fatherland to
  serve the German people with love and loyalty and to defend
  present-day Germany, is more valuable for the durability of the
  state than a superficial convert.</p>

  <p>The concept of active cooperation has taken the place of
  opposition to the new form of government and of dreamy
  resignation entranced with the beauty of times past. Therefore,
  not only the present but also the future will have this
  republican Germany to reckon with.</p>

  <p>The form of government is not, however, the decisive factor in
  the life of nations; it does not generate the philosophies of
  socialism or nationalism. Indeed, it may be asked in the sphere
  of economics, for instance, whether the party system does not
  give greater influence to capitalism than other forms of
  government accord it. The German economy, even because of its
  ties and because of the structure of postwar Europe, was among
  the first to break through national frontiers and find the path
  toward international involvement. The trend toward formation of
  large business combines which is taking place all over the world
  does not in itself, as I see it, make for progress for mankind as
  a whole. I regret that this is leading to the decline in the
  number of independent businessmen. It was the risk-taking
  initiative of these independent small businessmen that first
  caused our economy to thrive.</p>

  <p>But there is no point in indulging in wishful thinking about
  the past. The changes were brought about by the World War and its
  repercussions. The war tore Europe from its previous position and
  transformed it into a continent bleeding from many wounds and
  left impoverished - not only in Germany - valuable segments of
  the population. "Where iron grows in the mountain shafts, the
  masters of the Earth arise."<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> Europe is no longer the main
  source of the world's raw materials, and we can no longer delude
  ourselves that Europe is the leader of the world. For this reason
  the peoples of Europe are drawing closer together to protect
  themselves against conquest and inundation. And inasmuch as
  economics has an effect on politics, this drawing together, even
  though it might be questionable from the standpoint of economics,
  does constitute progress toward international understanding and
  peace. Even though the psychology of this process, which involves
  billions, causes sociologists to have reason for misgiving, the
  process is still an asset to mutual understanding among the
  nations.</p>

  <p>With this I come to the socio-political currents in the
  Germany of today.</p>

  <p>Germany is often reproached with the fact that hundreds of
  thousands assemble in organizations which keep alive the memory
  of the war, the spirit of military life at the front, and the
  like. But I would like to put a question to everyone:
  Psychologically, could it be otherwise? I was not at the front
  during the war; but if I had been, it would have been for me the
  greatest and most moving experience of my life. The devotion of
  the individual ego to the idea of the state, the risking of one's
  life, the straining of all one's powers - is there any country in
  the world where those who have shared such experiences do not
  talk about them with one another? We have no waters of Lethe
  which can wash away man's memories or erase the pictures engraved
  in the mind's eye.</p>

  <p>We read that in France, just as in Germany, the war veterans
  meet together. When these old comrades call upon Mr. Briand for
  his opinions, is it not a pleasure for him to speak to them and
  feel himself one of them? I have read the speech given by Mr.
  Briand before the soldiers who fought in the East, in which he
  said that one of the three happiest moments of his life came when
  he received the news that the Germans had failed to take
  Verdun<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>. Why then should a
  German be blamed if he counts as one of his happiest moments the
  time when he heard that the Battle of Tarmenberg<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> had saved German soil from enemy
  hands? I address Mr. Briand himself and remind him of his words
  in Geneva when he spoke of the great deeds of both nations in
  their struggles with each other in the mighty days of the past -
  deeds so great that they make new deeds unnecessary. I, like Mr.
  Briand, am sure that those who experienced the glory and horror
  of the front in the World War will be those who will support a
  new era of peace. A few individuals who make speeches to the
  contrary cannot delude us about that.</p>

  <p>So when we discuss Germany's state of mind, let us not be
  unjust. All the speeches by French statesmen declare that France
  stands for peace and that she sees peace as the great ideal of
  all mankind. And yet this France has her Arc de Triomphe and so
  honors the memory of Napoleon I in a magnificent monument. Why
  then do people object when we lay wreaths at the monument of
  Frederick the Great<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> and
  when we honor the patriotism which has defended house and home,
  wife and child, on the blood-soaked German soil which, more than
  any other, has been trampled by war? In every country the memory
  of the defeats of her would-be conquerors lives on Here in Norway
  people sing of the death of the powerful man who sought to
  destroy the independence of their land. In every man the memory
  of the struggles and the heroes of the past is alive. But these
  memories are not incompatible with the desire for peace in the
  future. Just as a person appreciates peace and relaxation the
  more after a life of action and strife, so the calm of the sea is
  truly appreciated only after a storm. We do not want to deceive
  ourselves by thinking that the world is a paradise. What we do
  want is the firm hope that the future bring a new era, built on
  those ideals which have sprung from the blood of battle. Where
  should this aspiration be stronger than in Europe, and where else
  in Europe than in those countries which suffered most from the
  war?</p>

  <p>It was a turning point in European history when the Germans
  initiated the policy which led by way of Locarno to Geneva. Just
  read what Mr. Briand said about the significance of this German
  decision. Along this road, Germany has experienced numerous and
  profound disappointments. This is not the place to discuss them
  in detail. I do not think of Locarno only in terms of its
  consequences for Germany. Locarno means much more to me. It is
  the achievement of lasting peace on the Rhine, guaranteed by the
  formal renunciation of force by the two great neighboring nations
  and also by the commitment of other states to come to the aid of
  the victim of an act of aggression in violation of this treaty.
  <i>Treuga Dei</i>, the peace of God, shall reign where for
  centuries bloody wars have raged. It can and it ought to be the
  basis for a general cooperative effort among these nations to
  spread peace wherever their material power and moral influence
  reach. The overwhelming majority of the German people support
  these aims. The youth of Germany can be won over to the same
  cause. Youth sees its ideal of individual physical and spiritual
  achievement in the peaceful competition of the Olympic Games and,
  I hope, in technical and intellectual development as well.</p>

  <p>Those who strive for these ideals, however, cannot succeed in
  the long run when, years after the war, foreign bayonets remain
  unsheathed in a nation which, although defeated, rejects revenge
  and asks only for peace. The policy of Locarno is incompatible
  with policies of distrust, violence, and oppression. Locarno is
  the policy of understanding and free will. It is the policy of
  faith in a new future and, in contrast to the policies of the
  past, it must become the policy of the future. Germany faces this
  future with a stable nation which has been based upon hard work,
  upon an economy which will give increasing millions income and
  security in our cramped territory, and upon a vital spirit which
  strives for peace in accordance with the philosophies of Kant and
  Fichte<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>If I understand you correctly, it was your people - a people
  that, having lived in peace for a hundred years, wished to
  endorse these ideas by means of the awards of the Nobel Committee
  - who decided that the men of Locarno should receive recognition
  for their efforts. In this you have remained true to the great
  ideals of your country. You have used your long period of peace
  for creative work in widely differing fields of science and
  research. You have sent men to the far corners of the earth who,
  with Faustian striving, have wanted to enlarge human
  understanding to the ultimate. You have opened your sympathetic
  hearts to the nations that suffered during the postwar period and
  to the people expelled from their native soil, all victims of the
  war and its aftermath. Thus you have combined love of your own
  country with love of your fellowmen, national pride with
  international action.</p>

  <p>Today, in the capital of your country, I am happy to be
  allowed to express my thanks for the honor which you have shown
  us. With my thanks I link the hope that the ideals on which this
  honor is based may become the common property of dissenting
  nations. That great German who perhaps more than any other
  extended his influence beyond his own national boundaries said of
  his own times: "We belong to a generation struggling out of the
  darkness into the light."<a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>
  May his words be true of our own times.</p>
