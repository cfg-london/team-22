  <h1>Paul A.M. Dirac - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dirac.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac</b> was
  born on 8th August, 1902, at Bristol, England, his father being
  Swiss and his mother English. He was educated at the Merchant
  Venturer's Secondary School, Bristol, then went on to Bristol
  University. Here, he studied electrical engineering,
  obtaining the B.Sc. (Engineering) degree in 1921. He then studied
  mathematics for two years at Bristol University, later going on
  to St. John's
  College, Cambridge, as a research student in mathematics. He
  received his Ph.D. degree in 1926. The following year he became a
  Fellow of St.John's College and, in 1932, Lucasian Professor of
  Mathematics at Cambridge.<br>

  Dirac's work has been concerned with the mathematical and
  theoretical aspects of quantum mechanics. He began work on the
  new quantum mechanics as soon as it was introduced by <a href=
  "../1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a> in 1925 - independently
  producing a mathematical equivalent which consisted essentially
  of a noncommutative algebra for calculating atomic properties -
  and wrote a series of papers on the subject, published mainly in
  the Proceedings of the Royal Society, leading up to his
  relativistic <i>theory of the electron</i> (1928) and the theory
  of holes (1930). This latter theory required the existence of a
  positive particle having the same mass and charge as the known
  (negative) electron. This, the positron was discovered
  experimentally at a later date (1932) by <a href=
  "../1936/index.html">C. D. Anderson</a>, while its existence was
  likewise proved by <a href="../1948/index.html">Blackett</a> and
  Occhialini (1933 ) in the phenomena of "pair production" and
  "annihilation".<br>
  <br>
  The importance of Dirac's work lies essentially in his famous
  wave equation, which introduced special relativity into
  Schr&ouml;dinger's equation. Taking into account the fact that,
  mathematically speaking, relativity theory and quantum theory are
  not only distinct from each other, but also oppose each other,
  Dirac's work could be considered a fruitful reconciliation
  between the two theories.<br>
  <br>
  Dirac's publications include the books <i>Quantum Theory of the
  Electron</i> (1928) and <i>The Principles of Quantum
  Mechanics</i> (1930; 3rd ed. 1947).<br>
  <br>
  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1930, being
  awarded the Society's Royal Medal and the Copley Medal. He was
  elected a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in
  1961.<br>
  <br>
  Dirac has travelled extensively and studied at various foreign
  universities, including Copenhagen, G&ouml;ttingen, Leyden, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Princeton (in
  1934, as Visiting Professor). In 1929,after having spent five
  months in America, he went round the world, visiting Japan
  together with Heisenberg, and then returned across Siberia.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937 he married Margit Wigner, of Budapest.</p>
