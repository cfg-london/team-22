  <h1>Jean Dausset - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="dausset.jpg" class="bio-img">
  His mother originated from Lorraine, his
  father from the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, two French provinces very
  distant from one another and with vast cultural differences. His
  parents met in Paris. During the First World War, his father, a
  doctor and captain in the army, sent Jean Dausset's mother and
  the first three children to Toulouse. It was there that Jean
  Dausset was born, on 19th October 1916, and this region has held
  a strong attachment for him ever since.<br>
  <br>
  After the war, his father worked as a physiotherapist and
  radiologist, dividing his time between Paris and the spa towns.
  Jean Dausset spent his early childhood in Biarritz, until the age
  of secondary school. Then, when he was 11 years old, his family
  came to settle permanently in Paris. He pursued his secondary
  studies at the Lyc&eacute;e Michelet and obtained his baccalaureate
  in mathematics.<br>
  <br>
  His choice of career was almost dictated by that of his father,
  Henri Dausset, who pioneered Rheumatology in France. His medical
  studies progressed without incident until the advent of the
  Second World War, when they were interrupted. He was mobilized in
  1939 and returned from the French Campaign in 1940 to a Paris
  occupied by the Germany Army. He began to devote his time
  ardently to the preparation of a competitive examination for the
  title of Intern of the Paris Hospitals. Upon receiving this
  title, he immediately left to join the fighting forces in North
  Africa. During the Tunisian Campaign, he performed blood
  transfusions in the army. This was his first introduction to
  immunohaematology.<br>
  <br>
  While training in Algiers, he performed his first laboratory
  experiments and carried out his first scientific study on blood
  platelets.<br>
  <br>
  On his return in 1944, to a liberated Paris, he was given the
  responsibility for collection of blood samples in the Paris area,
  working from the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre at H&ocirc;pital Saint-Antoine.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as the war was over, he undertook his first real research
  study, in collaboration with Professor Marcel Bessis. Professor
  Bessis had just developed exchange-transfusion in new-born babies
  and adults. It is impossible to say how much time he spent
  treating, with this method, women who had become anuric following
  abortion manoeuvres resulting in septicaemia due to Clostridium
  perfringens - this was his first contact with kidney
  failure!<br>
  <br>
  His clinical years oriented towards haematology and pediatrics,
  with a constant attraction to the laboratory. In 1948, he was
  sent, as a French trainee, to the Children's
  Hospital in Boston (Professors L. K Diamond and Sydney
  Farber) where he worked in one of the Harvard Medical
  School laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to France, he took up work again at the regional
  Blood Transfusion Centre, where he immediately became interested
  in the new immuno-haematology techniques for red blood cells. He
  decided to transpose these techniques to white blood cells and
  platelets.<br>
  <br>
  The principal observation of leuco-agglutination and
  thrombo-agglutination was made in 1952. Since that time, he has
  retained a constant interest in the immunogenetics of blood
  cells.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958, while Head of the Immuno-haematology Laboratory at the
  National Blood Transfusion Centre, he described the first
  leucocyte antigen, MAC, which has become known as HLA-A2.<br>
  <br>
  Preoccupied with the state of medical research in France, he
  undertook with Professor Robert Debr&eacute;, to institute radical
  reforms in the hospital and university structures. This work as
  Advisor to the Cabinet of the National Ministry of Education,
  spanned three consecutive years and culminated in the
  introduction of a law which established full-time employment in
  French hospitals, introducing to the hospitals professors of
  basic sciences, who were given hospital responsibilities. This
  reform permitted a soar in French biology and brought a new lease
  of life to French medical research.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the administrative struggles which ensued during this
  period, he never abandoned his laboratory work. In 1958, he was
  named Assistant Professor of Haematology at the Faculty of
  Medicine in Paris, then Professor of Haematology in 1963 and was
  appointed Head of the Immunology Department at H&ocirc;pital
  Saint-Louis. Again, he devoted his time entirely to research
  and, in 1965, described the first tissue group system (Hu-1,
  later named HLA).<br>
  <br>
  Thanks to the admirable volunteer blood donors, skin donors and
  skin recipients, grafted under the care of Professor F. T.
  Rapaport, correlations were established between graft survival
  and tissue incompatibility.<br>
  <br>
  He participated in the creation of the Research Institute in
  Blood Diseases, directed by Professor Jean Bernard, and was
  Assistant Director there until 1968. One of the departments under
  his direction was the Research Unit on Immunogenetics of Human
  Transplantation, an INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical
  Research) unit of which he has been director since 1968.<br>
  <br>
  In 1977, the Coll&egrave;ge de France called him to the Chair of
  Experimental Medicine, a position held by Claude Bernard from
  1958 to 1978, but his research laboratory remained at
  H&ocirc;pital Saint-Louis.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, he married Rose Mayoral from Madrid who gave him two
  children, Henri and Ir&egrave;ne.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to his scientific interests, he has only two passions
  in life: his family and modern plastic art.</p>
