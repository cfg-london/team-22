  Luther King, Jr.</b>, (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born
  Michael Luther King, Jr., but later had his name changed to
  Martin. His grandfather began the family's long tenure as pastors
  of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to
  1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from
  1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin
  Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating
  from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A.
  degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro
  institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather
  had graduated. After three years of theological study at
  Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected
  president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded
  the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in
  graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the
  doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he
  met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon
  intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters
  were born into the family.</p>

  In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter
  Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong
  worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by
  this time, a member of the executive committee of the National
  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading
  organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early
  in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great
  Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the
  United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his
  presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted
  382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the
  United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring
  segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as
  equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home
  was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same
  time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian
  Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new
  leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The
  ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its
  operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period
  between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and
  spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there
  was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five
  books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a
  massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention
  of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of
  conscience. and inspiring his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail", a
  manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in
  Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed
  the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom
  he delivered his address, "l Have a Dream", he conferred with
  President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B.
  Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at
  least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named
  Man of the Year by <i>Time</i> magazine in 1963; and became not
  only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world
  figure.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the
  youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When
  notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over
  the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights
  movement.<br>
  <br>
  On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of
  his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a
  protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that
  city, he was assassinated.</p>
