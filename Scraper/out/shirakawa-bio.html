  <h1>Hideki Shirakawa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="shirakawa.jpg" class="bio-img">For the ten years from the third grade of
  elementary school to the end of high school, I lived in the small
  city of Takayama, a town of less than sixty thousand, located in
  the middle of Honshu, Japan. Even though it was far away from
  Japan's principal cities, Takayama has been called a "little
  Kyoto" because of the similarity of its landform to Kyoto, the
  city sits in a basin surrounded by mountains with a river flowing
  through it, and because of its long-established cultural heritage
  and tradition. In this small town, rich in natural beauty, I
  spent my days enthusiastically collecting insects and plants, and
  making radios. My affinity for science was awakened and grew
  during in these ten years.</p>

  <p>Long after I became a polymer scientist, I
  occasionally remembered a short composition I had written during
  my last year in junior high school. At that time students
  compiled a commemorative collection of compositions describing
  our future dreams. As I recalled, I wrote something about my wish
  to be a scientist in the future and to conduct research on
  plastics useful for ordinary people. I cannot be sure what I
  wrote exactly because I lost the book of essays during repeated
  moves afterwards. I had long regretted this loss because I wanted
  to know more about why and how a junior high school boy decided
  on a future research career in plastics.</p>

  <p>Much to my surprise, I found that the full
  composition I had lost was printed in every Japanese newspaper
  the day after the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/shirakawa-autobio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> announced its
  award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2000 to two friends and
  myself. After 45 years, I could finally read the complete
  composition again. I was deeply impressed with the great power of
  the Nobel Prize.</p>

  <p>I was born in Tokyo in August 1936, the
  third child of Hatsutarou, a medical doctor, and Fuyuno, a
  daughter of a chief priest of a Buddhist temple. After me, a
  sister and a brother were born, joining my elder brother, my
  elder sister and me. After I was born, my family moved many
  times, following my father's work, but we finally settled in
  Takayama, my mother's hometown, in 1944 during the confusion
  toward the end of the war.</p>

  <p>My higher education began when I entered
  Tokyo Institute of Technology in April 1957. In March 1966, I
  completed my doctoral course and received the degree of Doctor of
  Engineering. In the same year, I married Chiyoko Shibuya, and we
  were later blessed with two sons, Chihiro and Yasuki.</p>

  <p>There were three specific fields I wished
  to study at university. One was polymer chemistry, just as I had
  written in my junior high school composition. The other
  possibilities were horticulture and electronics. I had decided to
  major in polymer chemistry only if I successfully passed the
  entrance examination for Tokyo Institute of Technology. In April 1957,
  after entering Tokyo Institute of Technology, I mainly studied
  applied chemistry during my undergraduate career. In Japanese
  universities, an undergraduate major in an science course has to
  belong to one of the laboratories in his department during his
  final year in order to work on a graduation thesis. I was
  interested in synthesizing new polymers, so I applied to a
  laboratory conducting synthesis research. But since there were
  too many applicants who wanted to enter into the laboratory I had
  chosen, I had to switch to a laboratory working on polymer
  physics. Initially I was reluctant to work in this field, but
  actually, I realize that my experiences in this laboratory were
  of great importance to me when I worked with polyacetylene later
  on.</p>

  <p>I finally began working on polymer
  synthesis, my original interest, in my graduate program, but I
  started the work on polyacetylene, the work for which I now share
  the Nobel Prize, just after I received my doctorate and I became
  a research associate in April 1966. The initial purpose of this
  study was to determine the polymierization mechanism of
  polyacetylene using the Ziegler-Natta catalysts. In the fall of
  1967, only a short time after we started polyacetylene film
  through an unforeseeable experimental failure.</p>

  <p>With the conventional method of
  polymerization, chemists had obtained polyacetylene in the form
  of black powder; however, one day, when a visiting scientist
  tried to make polyacetylene in the usual way, he only produced
  some ragged pieces of a film. In order to clarify the reason for
  the failure, I inspected various polymerization conditions again
  and again. I finally found that the concentration of the catalyst
  was the decisive factor for making the film. In any chemical
  reaction, a very small quantity of the catalyst, about mmol would
  be sufficient, but the result I got was for a quantity of mol, a
  thousand times higher than I had intended. It was an
  extraordinary unit for a catalyst. I might have missed the "m"
  for "mmol" in my experimental instructions, or the visitor might
  have misread it. For whatever reason, he had added the catalyst
  of some molar quantities in the reaction vessel. The catalyst
  concentration of a thousand-fold higher than I had planned
  apparently accelerated the rate of the polymerization reaction
  about a thousand times. Roughly speaking, as soon as acetylene
  gas was put into the catalyst, the reaction occurred so quickly
  that the gas was just polymerized on the surface of the catalyst
  as a thin film.</p>

  <p>But we noticed another important factor
  besides the concentration of the catalyst. Polyacetylene has a
  property of being insoluble in any solvent, a property which
  contributed to the formation of the film. Even more surprising,
  when we observed the film through a transmission electron
  microscope, we saw that the film was composed of long entangled
  micro-fibers of polyacetylene. These two properties are essential
  for the formation of any film, and they were inherent in
  polyacetylene.</p>

  <p>One more important factor contributed to
  the formation of the film was the Ziegler-Natta catalyst we had
  used. Most of the Ziegler-Natta catalysts tend to form
  precipitates which give an inhomogeneous solution. From such an
  inhomogeneous catalyst, it is very difficult to form
  polyacetylene film. But the Ziegler-Natta catalyst we had used in
  our experiment was a unique one. It had good solubility in
  organic solvents to give a homogeneous solution and it also had
  high activity to give a high molecular weight and crystalline
  form of polyacetylene. I could say that nature had prepared us
  for the way to make polyacetylene film. Later, through the
  measurements of various absorption spectra of this thin film, we
  determined the molecular structure of polyacetylene, and thus, we
  fulfilled the initial purpose of our work.</p>

  <p>By chance, this glittering, silvery film,
  caught the eyes of Professor Alan G. MacDiarmid, one of the
  co-recipients of the prize, and he invited me to work with him in
  the U.S.A. In September 1976, I went to the University of
  Pennsylvania, where Professor Alan J. Heeger, another
  co-recipient, was also working, and I spent one year there.</p>

  <p>I still vividly remember the day of
  November 23, 1976. With Dr. C.K. Chiang, a postdoctoral fellow
  who was working under Professor Heeger, I was measuring the
  electric conductivity of polyacetylene by the four-probe method,
  adding bromine. At exactly the moment we added bromine, the
  conductivity jumped so rapidly that he couldn't switch the range
  of the electrometers. Actually, the conductivity was ten million
  times higher than before adding bromine. This day marked the
  first time we observed the doping effect, although it was a pity
  that the expensive equipment was broken. The discovery of
  chemical doping is one of the representative results of our
  collaboration in this period.</p>

  <p>After returning to Japan, I continued to
  work on polyacetylene. What I did first was to shed light on the
  chemical reaction associated with the doping phenomena. In
  cooperation with many co-workers, I investigated various spectra
  of the doped polyacetylene films: infrared absorption, Raman
  scattering, ultraviolet-visible absorption, the M&ouml;ssbauer
  effect, and EXAFS. As a result, we found that the emergence of
  electrical conductivity on the doped polyacetylene was due to the
  creation of carbocations or positively charged solitons
  associated with withdrawing of <font face="Symbol">p</font>
  electrons from polyacetylene by the dopant when iodine was used
  as an acceptor dopant.</p>

  <p>In November 1979, I moved from Tokyo
  Institute of Technology to the Institute of Materials Science,
  University of Tsukuba, where I was appointed
  Associate Professor. In October 1982, I was promoted to full
  professor and worked on polyacetylene and other conducting
  polymers. Since my retirement from University of Tsukuba at the
  end of March 2000, I have withdrawn from scientific research and
  other educational activities.</p>

  <p>Let me mention two of my major
  contributions to polyacetylene research during my time at
  Tsukuba. One is the preparation of oriented films. The
  significance of polyacetylene being a typical quasi-one
  dimensional material was recognized very early. In this sense, an
  oriented film was indispensable to study the intrinsic
  one-dimensional properties. The polyacetylene films synthesized
  until then were an isotropic material in which the fibrils were
  entangled in three-dimensional disorder. I came up with the idea
  to directly synthesize the uniaxially oriented films by using
  liquid crystal as a solvent. The same idea was proposed by a
  scientist from a company. We found that an equimolar mixture of
  nematic liquid crystals bearing a phenylcyclohexyl moiety was
  useful for that purpose. We succeeded in simultaneously
  polymerizing acetylene and synthesizing uniaxially oriented
  polyacetylene films by orienting the catalyst solution of liquid
  crystal solvent under flow condition or magnetic field. Further
  development of this technique enabled us to synthesize helical
  polyacetylene that consists of clockwise or counterclockwise
  helical structure of fibrils, by use of chiral nematic liquid
  crystals. The chiral helicity of the films may be useful for
  electromagnetic and optical applications.</p>

  <p>The other contribution is the synthesis of
  liquid crystalline conjugated polymers by replacing the hydrogen
  atom bonded to polyacetylene with a substituent having liquid
  crystalline nature as the side chain. As these polymers have
  large substituents, the doping effect is poor. However, these
  polymers can be modified by introducing various substituents with
  interesting optical and thermal properties. In addition, they can
  orient spontaneously in a given range of temperature.</p>
