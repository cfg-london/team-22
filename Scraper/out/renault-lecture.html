  <h2>The Work at The Hague in 1899 and in 1907</h2>

  <p>As you can imagine, I have been looking
  forward to this opportunity of expressing publicly to the Nobel
  Committee my deep gratitude for the signal honor they have
  conferred in awarding me the Peace Prize; I look upon it as the
  greatest honor of my life. I should like also to keep a promise
  made to my distinguished colleague Mr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
  Passy</a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> when I saw him on
  the eve of my departure, by conveying to you his regrets that age
  has prohibited him from discharging the same duty.</p>

  <p>My debt of gratitude to you all has been
  further increased by the warmth and friendliness of your welcome,
  a welcome which has gladdened my heart even more than it has
  flattered my vanity. I cannot help adding that I ought also to
  thank Norway for the moving experience afforded me by the
  spectacle of her national festival. It was not by chance that I
  was present; guided by friendly advice, I had indeed
  <i>chosen</i> the date for my visit here. However, in spite of
  all I had been told, what I had the good fortune to see yesterday
  far surpassed all my expectations.</p>

  <p>In the morning under a dazzling sun all the
  gay young people in their varied and picturesque costumes,
  stepping so briskly and waving their flags so joyously, made me
  think of the springtime of life on its march into the future. In
  the afternoon the scene took on a more serious aspect, and the
  sky was less radiant; it all seemed more like autumn. I was
  deeply moved to hear the national anthem sung by everybody with
  almost religious fervor, and to see the banners of so many
  societies and associations dipped in universal salute to the
  highest representative of the country.</p>

  <p>So it was that I saw the two faces of
  Norway's noble image - the one gay, the other serious, but both
  equally engaging. My eyes and my heart were fully satisfied.</p>

  <p>You have shown me every kindness and no
  doubt you will now think me only too quick to take advantage of
  your patience. Forgive me and understand that I am repaying a
  debt of gratitude.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is not only on my own behalf that I
  thank you; I thank you also on behalf of all the jurists who have
  devoted their efforts to the study of international law, and to
  whose services in the interest of better international relations
  you have seen fit to testify so appreciatively. These services
  had already been collectively honored by the award given to the
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1904/index.html">Institute of
  International Law</a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, an
  award which excited universal interest. From this pacifist army
  of internationalists you have now singled out one soldier who,
  for many years, has fought for the concept of law, both in
  teaching and in practice.</p>

  <p>For too long the diplomats and the
  theorists of international law ignored each other and disdained
  each other; as a result of this mutual scorn, now fortunately
  ended, both theoretical studies and diplomatic agreements have
  suffered. International relations have become so complex that, if
  they are to be regulated effectively in view of the many
  interests at stake, the co-operation of various jurisdictions. is
  indispensable. This is especially true now that the scope of
  conventional law has been extended to include almost all aspects
  of political, economic, juridical, and administrative affairs. As
  we have found in recent conferences, we must now call upon
  experts in all categories. By doing so we create a climate for
  the successful collaboration that is so necessary.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Since you have chosen to honor a jurist, it
  is as a jurist that I address myself to you now, and I beg
  forgiveness in advance for the aridity of an account which seeks
  only to be clear and accurate. Unluckily for you, the
  qualifications of the professor do not necessarily correspond to
  those of the orator who, as we saw at the Peace Conference, has
  the knack of making even the most involved problems sound
  alluring.</p>

  <p>I shall not delve into the historical
  background of the Peace Conferences, the political aspects and
  organizational details of which have an importance all their own.
  In this very place, the first Norwegian delegate to the
  Conference of 1907, my distinguished colleague Mr.
  Hagerup<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, made this the
  subject of a talk on an occasion that I shall never forget. I
  have no desire to repeat what he has already told you, and told
  you with an authority that I cannot even pretend to possess. I
  should like, however, to make some observations of a general
  nature, in fact to present the philosophy of the Peace
  Conferences. I shall not enter into any controversy. I merely
  speak as a man who has always been a keen observer of these
  events, now and again taking a modest part in them, and as one
  who has profited from the time that has elapsed to evaluate, at a
  distance from the heat of discussion, the results achieved
  through strenuous effort.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>What, in my opinion, characterizes what I
  call <i>the work at The Hague</i> is the progressive development
  of the concept of law in the relations between peoples, in short
  the <i>juridical organization of international life.</i></p>

  <p>Here I call to mind what has been done at
  The Hague in the last fifteen years in the fields of private
  international law and public international law: the Conferences
  of 1893, 1894, 1900, and 1904 dealt with the former, those of
  1899 and 1907 with the latter.</p>

  <p>There are, unquestionably, great
  differences among the matters treated, yet they share a common
  characteristic. Such conferences seek to substitute law for the
  arbitrary; they are concerned with relations between individuals
  as well as with those between states. The difficulties involved
  are not the same in both cases, but they are equally great. To
  resolve them, each country must give up stubborn adherence to its
  own ideas and concede whatever it can without actually injuring
  its own essential interests. Let me pay tribute here to a
  Norwegian magistrate, Mr. Beichmann<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, with whom I have on many occasions
  had both the pleasure and the profit of working in the field of
  private law.</p>

  <p>Curious, at first glance, is the fact that
  codification of public international law was begun before that of
  private international law. The interests of the individual
  undoubtedly suffered in the absence of rulings in cases of
  conflicting civil law, but complaints were not lively enough to
  attract the attention of the various governments. It was the
  initiative of The Netherlands government, prompted by an eminent
  jurist, the Minister of State Mr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1911/index.html">Asser</a><a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, that finally led the nations of
  Europe to discuss the conflicts of civil law; the action this
  inspired was blessed with favorable results, and we can say that
  in Europe the codification of private international law is well
  on its way.</p>

  <p>The codification of public international
  law can be traced back to the Congress held in Paris in 1856
  following the Crimean War. The diplomatic act of April 16, 1856,
  known as the <i>Declaration of Paris</i>, contains four rules
  relating to maritime warfare which are universally accepted
  today. They brought about great progress, particularly in
  reconciling on two important points two widely varying systems,
  that of France and that of Great Britain. This rapprochement, at
  first forced by the necessity of waging a common war and later
  maintained after the peace, was established under conditions that
  complied with both justice and the general interest. Each country
  gave up practices in its system which seemed, if not unjust, then
  particularly harsh; the result was entirely favorable to the
  neutrals, who comprised the largest group concerned: the flag
  covered the cargo without confiscating it. It is in such a way
  that all conciliations should be worked out.</p>

  <p>However, it is not the Declaration of Paris
  itself which I want to examine here; rather, it is the procedure
  that was followed to achieve its extraordinary result, that is to
  say, the adoption by the whole world of the rules it laid
  down.</p>

  <p>The powers represented at the Congress of
  Paris - namely, the five big European powers, Austria, France,
  Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia, together with Sardinia and
  Turkey who took part in their capacity as belligerents - agreed,
  after deliberation, on terms which were <i>ipso facto</i> binding
  on themselves and which they later asked the other powers to
  accept. To be sure, an agreement reached among governments of
  such widely divergent political, economic, and geographical
  backgrounds provides certain assurances, for it presents every
  opportunity for the variety of interests involved to find some
  sort of satisfaction; so the subsequent adherence by other
  governments to the terms agreed upon can be easily understood.
  Nevertheless, the nonparticipating powers could have contributed
  some pertinent observations both in their own and in the general
  interest. The adherence procedure, however, put them in the
  position of having to choose between outright acceptance or
  outright rejection of rules adopted in their absence.</p>

  <p>The same procedure was followed in 1864 for
  the <i>Geneva Convention</i> concerning military wounded on the
  battlefield and in 1868 for the <i>Declaration of St.
  Petersburg</i> which involved banning the use of explosive
  bullets, except that in these cases, the procedure was not
  confined to the great powers alone.</p>

  <p>A real step forward was taken by the
  Brussels Conference which was convened<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, on Russia's initiative, to attempt
  the regulation of the laws and practices of war on land. No
  longer were the great and secondary powers the only ones
  represented at the discussions; the smaller nations were also
  invited to take part. Obviously these small nations have special
  interests to protect in that they do not have the same military
  organization as the large nations and are more likely to be
  invaded than to invade. However, it should be noted that, in
  spite of this extension of participation in discussion, the
  movement remained exclusively European. The United States of
  America was not represented, despite the initiative it had taken
  in 1863 through the promulgation of its famous instructions to
  armies in the field<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Once again it was Russia who took the lead
  in making yet another change by persuading twenty-six nations to
  send delegates to the first Peace Conference in 1899; thus the
  movement spread beyond Europe to include nations in America and
  Asia: the United States, Mexico, China, Japan, Persia, and Siam.
  The halfway point had been reached. The decision as to which
  nations were to be invited was arrived at somewhat arbitrarily by
  the Russian government, which compiled its list on the basis of
  whether or not the respective powers had ambassadors at the Court
  of St. Petersburg. The last stage was completed in 1907 when
  forty-six nations were invited and forty-four actually took part.
  This time almost the entire civilized world was represented at
  the conference which some daring journalist, not surprisingly,
  dubbed the <i>Parliament of Mankind</i> - certainly an incorrect
  title in many respects, but a striking one just the same.</p>

  <p>Apart from congresses such as the postal or
  telegraphic conferences which are primarily concerned with
  administrative matters, I think one can say that no diplomatic
  gathering purporting to have matters of political interest as the
  main items on its agenda had ever before been so well attended.
  Such a congress is clearly qualified to pass laws intended for
  universal application; all parties have an equal opportunity to
  voice their opinions and to defend their own interests, and it is
  with a full knowledge of the facts that they adopt any
  resolution. This general participation in discussion is
  unquestionably more in keeping with the independence and equality
  of states than was the previous procedure. But along with these
  theoretical and practical advantages come many difficulties which
  have to be surmounted, first during the discussions themselves
  and then in connection with the passing of the resolutions, as
  all who attended the Conference discovered. By pointing out these
  difficulties I do not mean to condemn the system, but merely to
  draw attention to their inescapable consequences and to the care
  which must be taken to mitigate them. The equality of nations,
  except in matters of material strength, is juridically
  incontrovertible, but this equality pushed to the last limits of
  literalness becomes absurd. To give an example which should
  offend no one, Great Britain and Luxembourg are two states equal
  before the law, yet would it not be ridiculous if the voice of
  Luxembourg carried as much weight on a maritime issue as that of
  Great Britain? The small nations have a most useful and honorable
  part to play in these conferences; they are most frequently the
  true representatives of justice, precisely because they do not
  have the strength to impose injustice. However, if they wish to
  see maintained the tradition of these conferences to which they
  are invited, they would do well to exercise a certain restraint
  and to avoid the fallacious belief that obstinacy, not to say
  obstructionism, is the best way of asserting their independence.
  Please forgive the great liberty I have taken in thus expressing
  myself; it is a liberty taken by a jurist influenced by a sincere
  love for justice and not by any political considerations. I am
  less concerned with criticizing the attitude of this or that
  delegation than with paying homage to that of a delegation which
  has correctly understood the role it should play. I shall return
  to this matter later.</p>

  <p>Unanimity is basic to any diplomatic
  conference, for the goal of such a conference must be the
  alignment of equal but distinct wills; in a parliamentary
  assembly, on the other hand, it is the expression of a single
  will, that of the nation represented, which must be obtained.
  This necessity for unanimity is a constraining factor since it
  can lead to the exercise of the <i>liberum veto</i>, in short to
  a stalemate, but it is also an indispensable safeguard against
  hasty decisions and against coalitions of interests. It allows
  compromise in the sense that a resolution can represent the will
  of the conference as a whole, in spite of some disagreements. It
  is a matter of tact and prudence; such delicate problems are not
  resolved mathematically. The main point is that no nation should
  be forced into anything against its will.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>One has only to think about it to
  appreciate the difficulties bound to arise in any attempt to
  draft a formula which will be acceptable to the representatives
  of so many nations differing in interests, customs, and
  institutions. Even when there is a solid basis for agreement,
  there are always innumerable nuances suggesting diversity in
  attitudes of mind, ways of thinking and of reasoning. People may
  even speak the same language, but they do not speak it
  identically nor give to words the same shades of meaning. It is
  necessary indeed to accept compromises and to agree to
  conciliatory schemes which the logical, critical mind and which
  the learned scholar at his desk would not tolerate. I hasten to
  plead extenuating circumstances on behalf of one who has often
  used the pen and who knows, better than anyone else, that the end
  result is not perfect. Had he been as uncompromising in the
  drafting of resolutions as he would be in the formulating of a
  purely scientific work, he would have achieved nothing.</p>

  <p>In short, sometimes, instead of laying down
  a hard-and-fast rule, we must limit ourselves to a
  recommendation, indeed to a kind of prayer. The resolution is
  binding "insofar as is possible", "insofar as circumstances
  permit", etc. Then, you will say, it is no longer a legal
  obligation, but merely a moral duty. True, but it is no small
  matter that a moral duty be recognized by the majority of
  nations. By force of circumstance, it eventually becomes a part
  of custom and compels as much acknowledgment as if it had
  constituted a strict obligation in the first place. Assistance to
  enemy wounded was a charitable duty generally recognized even
  before the Geneva Convention of 1864 made it a legal
  responsibility. We must not move too fast or believe that, in our
  age of rapid communication, minds can be reshaped as quickly and
  easily as matter. There are some forms of resistance and even of
  hesitation that only time, allied with education, can overcome.
  Jurists and journalists can do a great deal to pave the way for
  the reform of nefarious practices. They can succeed - and there
  are examples of this in influencing a nation to give up barbaric
  measures which its government has been unwilling to renounce.</p>

  <p>Finally, in considering the work of a
  conference, we are wrong to take into account only what has
  produced definite, clear-cut results, ignoring what has been done
  to prepare the way for future achievements. There can be no
  harvest without the seed. We may well heed the instructions given
  to the United States delegates before the second Peace Conference
  in the name of one whom I take pleasure in remembering here -
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1906/index.html">President
  Roosevelt</a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>: "You should
  always keep in mind the promotion of this continuous process
  through which the progressive development of international
  justice and peace may be carried on; and you should regard the
  work of the Second Conference, not merely with reference to the
  definite results to be reached in that Conference, but also with
  reference to the foundations which may be laid for further
  results in future conferences. It may well be that among the most
  valuable services rendered to civilization by this Second
  Conference will be found the progress made in matters upon which
  the delegates reach no definite agreement."<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> Here is practical wisdom that has
  been lacking in all too many of those who disparage the Peace
  Conferences.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have no intention of commenting on or
  analyzing the various resolutions formulated at the Conference of
  1907. The delegates drew up thirteen <i>conventions</i> proper
  and one <i>declaration</i>, not to mention the important voeux or
  recommendations and the general acknowledgments contained in the
  Final Act. I should like merely to single out certain essential
  facts that show the extent to which the concept of law was
  strengthened and developed.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let us first of all consider the
  resolutions pertaining to war. To begin with, does it not seem
  paradoxical to be so occupied with war at a conference for peace?
  Indignation and mockery are easily evoked and given full rein;
  they are not the more justified for this reason. The name "Peace
  Conference" was chosen somewhat irrationally by a section of
  public opinion which, on the strength of the first Russian
  message<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>, expected the
  Conference to bring about partial, if not total, disarmament and,
  consequently, everlasting peace. Eventually the name passed into
  official usage. I must confess I regretted this fact
  wholeheartedly since I doubted very much that the public, having
  failed to obtain from the Conference what it had unreasonably
  expected, would then attach any importance or value to the actual
  useful results.</p>

  <p>Is this to say that the term "Peace
  Conference" is entirely unjustified? I do not believe so.
  Anything that contributes to extending the domain of law in
  international relations contributes to peace. Since the
  possibility of future war cannot be ignored, it is a
  <i>farsighted</i> policy that takes into account the difficulties
  created by war in the relations between belligerents and
  neutrals; and it is a <i>humanitarian</i> policy that strives to
  reduce the evils of war in the relations between the belligerents
  themselves and to safeguard as far as possible the interests of
  noncombatants and of the sick and the wounded. Whatever may be
  said by those who scoff at the work undertaken in this field by
  the Peace Conferences, wars will not become rarer by becoming
  more barbarous.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>For a long time discussion has centered on
  the question of whether a government on the verge of war has an
  obligation to warn its adversary before opening hostilities. This
  question has led to frequent recriminations between belligerents.
  The Conference agreed unanimously that "hostilities must not
  commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form
  either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with
  conditional declaration of war"<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup>.</a> The future will show whether it
  is possible to go a step further, as certain delegations have
  asked, by requiring a specified time-lapse between the receipt of
  the warning and the start of hostilities.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Convention dealing with the laws and
  customs of war on land is the Convention of 1899 carefully
  revised<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Let me select a few points which indicate
  significant progress.</p>

  <p>Article 23.h of the Statute forbids
  belligerents to "declare abolished, suspended, or inadmissible in
  a court of law, the rights and actions of the nationals of the
  hostile party". This would seem to satisfy a theoretical rather
  than a practical necessity because, with our modern concept of war
  and its effect on civilians, it would be difficult to imagine a
  civilized country's declaring void or suspended the rights of
  enemy subjects.</p>

  <p>In accordance with a new provision added at
  the end of the same Article 23, "a belligerent is likewise
  forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take
  part in any operations of war directed against their own country,
  even if they were in the belligerent's service before the
  commencement of the war." This provision results from the same
  concern that inspired the new Article 44: "A belligerent is
  forbidden to force the inhabitants of territory occupied by it to
  furnish information about the army of the other belligerent or
  about its means of defense." This touches on the question of
  forced guides, one of the most painful raised by the practice of
  war. Is it, after all, logical to forbid a belligerent to
  conscript an inhabitant of enemy territory into its army, and at
  the same time permit it to force the same inhabitant to serve it
  as a guide, thereby compelling him to do his country even greater
  harm ? Is this not an outrage against the most honorable aspect
  of patriotism? Should we not, then, commend the majority of the
  Conference for refusing to be sidetracked by technical arguments
  and for persisting in comdemning the present practice?
  Undoubtedly, certain delegations had their reservations with
  regard to the provision. It is open to question whether their
  governments would dare, should the occasion arise, to resort to a
  practice censured by the vast majority of the civilized world.
  What happened in the case of the "dum-dum" bullets offers an
  argument worth considering<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Article 52 now ends with the provision that
  requisitions in kind must be paid as soon as possible; this is a
  real advance toward achieving respect for private property.</p>

  <p>Lastly, and most important of all, is the
  inclusion in the Convention of an article under whose terms any
  belligerent party violating the provisions of the Statute will be
  subject to penalties. In addition, the belligerent will be held
  responsible for all acts committed by members of its armed
  forces. The inclusion of this new clause resulted from the doubts
  held in certain quarters about the compulsory character of the
  Statute, since comparison of its provisions with those of the
  Brussels Conference seemed to indicate that neither possessed
  more than moral weight. All doubt has been removed now that the
  terms of the Statute are supported by the obligation to make
  amends for any injurious consequences which might result from
  their violation. Moreover, the belligerent's responsibility for
  acts committed by members of its armed forces is clearly defined.
  Is this not a great step forward, and is it not calculated to
  make the belligerent more vigilant in observing the Statute?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Convention concerning the rights and
  duties of neutral powers and persons in war on land<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> implemented a recommendation of
  the Conference of 1899. It clarifies certain principles and, in
  doing so, gives guarantees to neutrals perpetually exposed to the
  demands of one or both of the belligerent parties. Again, this
  facilitates the maintenance of peace.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Naval warfare presents many difficulties on
  many points, since it involves the relations between the
  belligerents themselves and those between belligerents and
  neutrals. There is always some vagueness which the belligerents
  take advantage of to further their own interests. These interests
  are, or seem to be, very divergent, and the divergence
  unfortunately results primarily from geographical situation,
  which no one can do anything about. It would have been useless,
  therefore, to hope for general agreement on many of these
  matters. That negotiations became possible at all constituted an
  achievement in itself, since the great seafaring nations had for
  a long time automatically refused to be drawn into discussion on
  this subject.</p>

  <p>A great effort was made on all sides. Understanding was
  reached on several points; the field of controversy was limited,
  to the advantage of all concerned; and a basis for future
  discussion and agreement was established. It now remains for each
  country to undertake a serious examination of its own real
  interests and to determine how far it can go in bringing about
  the accord that is so desirable.</p>

  <p>In order to show just what has been attempted or achieved, I
  should have to delve into minute details and technicalities, but
  I shall confine myself to the broad outlines.</p>

  <p>The question of laying automatic submarine contact
  mines<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> had stirred public
  opinion ever since the last war because of the threat these mines
  posed to peaceable shipping even long after the end of
  hostilities. If no completely satisfactory answer has been given,
  it is because the technical questions involved have not as yet
  been satisfactorily answered; there is bound to be some groping
  in the dark. Rules offering certain guarantees concerning
  bombardment by naval forces have also been formulated<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> - not without difficulty. Both of
  these delicate matters were handled by a subcommittee presided
  over by Mr. Hagerup.</p>

  <p>The right to seize private property in the course of war at
  sea has long been a point for argument. Pursuing its traditional
  policy, the United States of America proposed the abolition of
  this right and succeeded in rallying the majority of nations to
  its point of view. However, since the remaining minority included
  the great seafaring nations, the proposition could have no
  immediate practical results. On the other hand, if the principle
  of abolition itself did not triumph, at least certain important
  restrictions were brought to bear on the exercise of the right of
  seizure<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>. For example,
  postal correspondence found on either enemy or neutral ships was
  declared inviolable - to the distinct advantage of both
  belligerent and neutral commercial relations. Coastal fishing
  boats and local shipping of light tonnage were exempted from
  seizure. The treatment of the crews of captured enemy merchant
  vessels was regulated advantageously. These results can well be
  appreciated by any country which, like Norway, is greatly
  concerned with fishing and shipping.</p>

  <p>Norway, like all maritime nations intending to remain neutral,
  was particularly anxious to have a comprehensive and precise
  ruling covering the rights and duties of neutral powers during
  naval warfare, especially with regard to the governing of
  belligerent warships visiting neutral ports. A convention was
  drawn up, thanks partly to the efforts of the late Count
  Tornielli, Italy's first delegate<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>. This Convention appears, on the
  whole, to provide a fair settlement of the matter. It is to be
  hoped that agreement can eventually be reached on the points
  which certain powers still have reservations about. This would
  mean real progress in the interests of peace, for it would reduce
  the danger of any extension of hostilities resulting from
  conflicts between belligerents and neutrals.</p>

  <p>In connection with this train of thought, I would just like to
  mention the Convention for the adaptation of the principles of
  the Geneva Convention [1864] to naval warfare<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>. Agreement was easily reached.
  The Convention of 1899 was carefully reviewed in the light of the
  amendments to the Geneva Convention which went into effect in
  1906. The same spirit of goodwill dominates both Conventions, the
  one concerning the sick and wounded in land warfare and that
  dealing with them in naval warfare. Differences of application
  occur in some cases, but only because of the difference in
  milieu.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I come now to those points which have a direct bearing on the
  maintenance of good relations between nations and which naturally
  claim the special attention of all friends of peace.</p>

  <p>How much did the second Peace Conference attempt, and to what
  extent did it succeed in contributing to this cause?</p>

  <p>First of all, it had to consider the Convention for the
  pacific settlement of international disputes which had been drawn
  up in 1899 and signed by nearly all the nations of the civilized
  world<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>. I shall deal only
  with those aspects of the Convention that concern arbitration.
  For certain problems, arbitration had been recognized as the
  fairest and most efficient instrument for settling disputes not
  resolved through diplomatic channels. Its use remained optional,
  but it still constituted a piece of legal machinery easily set in
  motion - something not to be disdained. When two powers agree to
  settle a dispute legally by arbitration, it is preferable that
  they should not first have to discuss details of the organization
  of the tribunal or of procedure. such discussion can easily
  become a source of friction which, although completely
  dissociated from the dispute itself, makes settlement of the
  dispute that much more difficult. How much better it is to be
  able to use an instrument set up in advance when there was no
  particular dispute in view, and no objective except that of
  finding the best means to serve the general cause of justice!</p>

  <p>To appreciate fully the benefits derived from the Convention
  of 1899, we should consider not only its material and tangible
  results, but also the imponderable influence which it has exerted
  on the chancelleries, an influence which has made itself felt in
  two important ways. In the first place, when a dispute does
  arise, the idea of settling it by arbitration is now readily
  accepted, whereas previously those who proposed such a solution
  were regarded by men of action as pure theorists, I can confirm
  this from personal experience. In the second place, there have
  already been numerous applications of Article 19 of the
  Convention, by the terms of which the signatory powers reserved
  the right to conclude new standing agreements of their own which
  would apply compulsory arbitration to all cases in which they
  deemed it appropriate. I am happy to say that it was the
  Franco-British Convention of October 14, 1903, which was the
  first to be signed under these terms and that approximately sixty
  such agreements have been signed up to April 6 of this year. One
  of the latest is, I believe, the Convention of April 4 between
  Norway and the United States.</p>

  <p>So far only four arbitration cases<a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a> have been adjudicated at The
  Hague itself in conformity with the procedure adopted in 1899.
  There have been others which were dealt with more simply. The
  important thing is that arbitration be used to avoid conflict;
  whether it is used here or there, whether through this or that
  procedure is of little consequence. Let me add, however, that we
  should not want too many such arbitrations. Undoubtedly; it is
  better to plead than to fight; but it is better still to come to
  a direct understanding without having to plead. It is the fear of
  arbitration and possible public censure by a tribunal, however,
  that prompts a government to be prudent enough to relinquish an
  unfounded claim.</p>

  <p>This 1899 Convention was revised in 1907 and many improvements
  in its details were made. I mention only the introduction of a
  summary procedure for minor matters and of the carefully drawn up
  procedures adopted by the International Commissions of Inquiry
  whose effectiveness was demonstrated in a striking manner on the
  occasion of the Hull incident<a href=
  "#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>; this in itself would have been
  enough to exonerate the 1899 Convention from the reproach of
  having done nothing useful.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I come now to what the 1907 Conference did about compulsory
  arbitration, a subject which it discussed thoroughly if not
  always happily.</p>

  <p>It had been proposed at the 1899 Conference to introduce this
  measure with limited applications, but the proposal had to be
  withdrawn in the face of overwhelming opposition. In 1907 the
  proposal was advanced again, and again was dropped, with the
  result that the Convention itself was not amended on this point.
  Does this mean that we are still exactly where we were in 1899
  and that no progress at all has been made in a matter which so
  deeply concerns all peace-loving people?</p>

  <p>To say this would be to exaggerate unfairly. I shall try to
  clarify this point and to explain the positions adopted at the
  Peace Conference.</p>

  <p>No attempt was made to present arbitration as a means of
  resolving all disputes, no matter what their nature, at least not
  in a general Convention. There is nothing to prevent two
  determined nations that may be able to foresee the possible
  nature of their future disputes, from going far beyond the scope
  of a Convention like the one I have just mentioned; indeed, many
  instances of this kind can be cited. However, some delegates
  believed that by taking precautions it was possible to introduce
  compulsory arbitration for certain types of disputes under terms
  extending to all nations; they were vigorously opposed. I am
  certain that the problem had never before been examined in such
  detail. By gathering together all the possible objections to it
  and thereby forcing everyone to face the problem in all its
  aspects, the adversaries of compulsory arbitration have, probably
  unwittingly, rendered an invaluable service to the very cause
  they so relentlessly attacked; for to face the problem is to take
  the first sure step toward its solution. I firmly believe that
  none of the objections is truly fundamental and that the
  principle must therefore triumph in the end. Jurists and
  diplomats will do well to devote some careful study to these
  lively, sometimes impassioned, but always courteous discussions
  of 1907. They will gain a clearer insight into the difficulties
  that must be overcome and so be better able to work out the
  proper solutions.</p>

  <p>What has actually been the result of the discussions I have
  just described?</p>

  <p>Thirty-two nations agreed to the drafting of a Convention
  instituting compulsory arbitration: first, for a range of general
  cases which would be subject to the traditional reservations
  covering vital interests and national honor; and second, for a
  number of specific cases which would not be subject to such. Some
  of those present indulged in lighthearted banter about a few of
  these cases, asking if anyone really supposed they could lead to
  war. In the first place, however, wars very frequently spring
  from petty incidents, and arbitration can be of value in dealing
  with these as well as with the more serious cases. We must become
  accustomed to making it function in relatively minor affairs
  before we come to more serious ones. In any event, some of the
  eventualities covered were not as trivial as they might seem, a
  case in point being the assessment of the sum of an indemnity
  once the onus of responsibility has been admitted. Experience has
  shown that arbitration in such a matter would prevent exaggerated
  claims. Be that as it may, the minority, invoking the rule of
  unanimity, opposed inclusion in the Final Act, of the agreement
  formulated along the lines just mentioned, and supported, as I
  have said, by thirty-two nations. There could clearly be no
  possibility of incorporating it in the same Convention that all
  the nations were prepared to sign. No one could be satisfied with
  this purely negative result; so the following declaration was
  inserted in the Final Act: "The Conference, actuated by the
  spirit of mutual agreement and concession characterizing its
  deliberations, has agreed upon the following declaration, which,
  while reserving to each of the powers represented full liberty of
  action as regards voting, enables them to affirm the principles
  which they regard as unanimously admitted: It [the Conference] is
  unanimous, first, in admitting the principle of compulsory
  arbitration and, secondly, in declaring that certain disputes, in
  particular those relating to the interpretation and application
  of the provisions of international agreements, may be submitted
  to compulsory arbitration without any restriction."</p>

  <p>Thus, no power now directly attacks compulsory arbitration; it
  only remains for certain nations to restudy their positions in
  order to decide in which cases they are prepared to allow it. The
  other thirty-two nations are prepared, as of now, to be bound by
  specific categories, and no further obstacle stands in the way of
  their signing an agreement to that effect. Can we say then that
  the situation is the same as it was in 1899? To do so would be to
  ignore the evidence. We can safely say that the future of
  compulsory arbitration is assured.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Conference of 1907 succeeded moreover in introducing a
  certain form of compulsory arbitration in a case which is not
  without significance; I refer to the Convention concerning the
  limitation of the use of force for the recovery of contractual
  debts<a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a>. In principle,
  contractual debts claimed from the government of one country by
  the government of another as owed to its nationals may not be
  recovered by force. However, this stipulation would not apply if
  the debtor nation refused or ignored an offer of arbitration or
  if, in the event of acceptance of such an offer, it obstructed
  the implementing of a compromise or, after arbitration, failed to
  comply with the decision given. Here, surely, is a case of
  compulsory arbitration in that the creditor nation must propose
  arbitration at the very outset and that it depends only on the
  debtor nation to accept. Those nations possessing powerful means
  of coercion renounce their use to start with, in the arrangement
  described. This is no mean advantage for the weaker nations.
  Objection has been made that the procedure suffers from a lack of
  complete reciprocity because a strong nation against whom a
  weaker one makes a claim could either ignore it or refuse
  arbitration, knowing that the only possible recourse for the
  weaker state would be the use of force, an absurd expedient in
  view of the disproportion of strength. This cannot be denied, nor
  can the fact that only in a limited way did the Convention allow
  such compulsory arbitration. However, it would be wrong to
  suppose that it is always the weaker nations who call for such
  arbitration and the strong ones who refuse it. The reverse was
  the case in 1902 at the time of the claims by European powers
  against Venezuela<a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The United States proposed the setting up of a judicial
  arbitration court which would be truly permanent as opposed to
  the one instituted by the Convention of 1899 which is permanent
  in name only; the framework alone [of the latter] is permanent
  since the tribunal is essentially mobile, having to be convened
  for each individual case and then dissolved immediately after
  pronouncing its verdict. A great deal of work was done to define
  the jurisdiction of the court and the procedure to be followed in
  sessions. The proposal encountered an insurmountable obstacle
  when it came to the composition of the court. The sponsors of the
  plan believed that, to be a truly effective instrument, the new
  tribunal should not include too many judges, and a total of
  fifteen to seventeen appeared to be the absolute maximum. If we
  compare this total with the number of nations represented at the
  Conference, we can understand the difficulty. How could one
  provide for each nation's sharing in the appointment of fifteen
  or seventeen judges? It is easy to foresee the various factions,
  whether they be of the great or of the lesser powers, colliding
  in opposition. All hope of reaching agreement in the Conference
  had to be abandoned and action restricted to the inclusion of the
  following recommendation<a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>
  in the Final Act: "The Conference calls the attention of the
  signatory powers to the advisability of adopting the annexed
  draft Convention for the creation of a judicial arbitration
  court, and of bringing it into force as soon as an agreement has
  been reached respecting the selection of the judges and the
  constitution of the court." It is to be hoped that we will
  succeed in arriving at an understanding obviously requiring
  compromise and the setting aside of unreasonable demands. The
  proposed permanent court would be of valuable service,
  particularly in its setting up of a delegation of three members
  to settle quickly a large number of minor disputes. The fact that
  three great powers, none of them particularly noted for idealism
  - namely, Germany, England, and the United States - jointly put
  forward the proposal is significant.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I end my review of the work of The Hague with the Convention
  relating to the creation of an international prize court<a href=
  "#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>. This is concerned largely with
  the rules of war; but the draft of the Convention was also
  referred to the First Commission entrusted with examining
  questions relative to international justice, since the matter
  involves the means of settling serious international disputes
  through litigation. I have kept this Convention for the last
  because it seems to me that it best demonstrates the general
  spirit of the second Peace Conference, the development of the
  concept of law, and the influence of the times.</p>

  <p>For centuries it has been accepted that a-captured enemy
  merchantman or a seized neutral ship becomes a prize in fact only
  after confirmation by a judicial authority: all prizes must be
  adjudicated. The competent jurisdiction has been that of the
  captor who arranges the prize tribunals as he sees fit. It is
  hardly surprising that the decisions of these tribunals have
  often given rise to objections and sometimes even to actual
  conflict. Indeed, these tribunals exercise the laws set down by
  their own governments, laws which may well be arbitrary.
  Furthermore, since their own national interests are deeply
  involved, they are not inclined to find illegal the acts
  perpetrated in serious or even dangerous circumstances by
  officers of their own national navy. Surely there is no better
  way of working for peace than by attempting to obtain a greater
  measure of justice for those wronged in the course of maritime
  warfare, and thus to eliminate some serious causes of conflict.
  The smaller nations, whose voices can sometimes hardly be heard
  among those of the powerful belligerents, would derive real
  benefit from a change in such practice.</p>

  <p>For a long time, publicists have been clamoring for reform.
  The Institute of International Law had drawn up a comprehensive
  proposal, but it was looked upon as belonging to the realm of
  pure theory, without a chance of realization. One would scarcely
  have thought that a group of great sea-faring nations, who have
  an interest in preserving their freedom of action if they are
  belligerents and who are in a position to make themselves heard
  if they are neutrals, would take the initiative in this matter.
  Nevertheless this is precisely what happened. From the very start
  of the Conference, Germany and Great Britain each advanced plans
  aimed at establishing an international court for dealing with
  prizes. They were, however, motivated by such divergent ideas
  that a conciliation was at first thought to be impossible. A
  compromise was nevertheless attained, and a comprehensive,
  carefully drafted proposal was submitted to the Conference in the
  name of four great powers, Germany, the United States, France,
  and Great Britain. With only a few amendments relating to points
  of detail, it was accepted by the main body of the Conference.
  The only opposition came from one non-European nation<a href=
  "#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I cannot even think of embarking on an analysis of a
  Convention which touches on so vast a number of technicalities
  and which in fact constitutes a code for the new institution. I
  shall confine myself to two points of primary importance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>I. Composition of the Court</h4>

  <p>The court consists of fifteen members supplied by forty-four
  nations. Comparison of the two figures gives an immediate
  indication of the difficulty of the problem. Here is a brief
  outline of the system adopted. Eight powers - Germany,
  Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, Great Britain, Italy,
  Japan, and Russia - all appeared to have a predominating interest
  by virtue of the size of their navies, the tonnage of their
  merchant shipping, and the importance of their maritime commerce;
  so they will select the regularly presiding judges. For the other
  powers, rotation determines a table appended to the Convention
  which lists, year by year, their respective judges and deputy
  judges. The system is inevitably arbitrary, both in itself and in
  its applications, and it is immediately open to criticism
  concerning its departure from the concept of the equality of all
  nations in law. But is it logical to wish to give equal control
  over the composition of the court to Germany, Montenegro, and
  Siam? Is it not the major powers who make the greatest sacrifice
  in agreeing to a revision of the decisions of their own prize
  tribunals? Lastly, granted that the nature of its composition is
  defective, does not the new jurisdiction at all events herald
  great progress, and does it not assure all nations, particularly
  the secondary powers, certain guarantees absent in the present
  state of affairs? Therein lies a decisive point not immediately
  grasped by the majority of the interested parties. I am happy to
  recall that the delegation of one nation, which is of secondary
  political importance but which possesses one of the largest
  merchant marines, declared that its government, in spite of
  reservations which it could have made on the subject of its
  participation in the selection of judges, accepted the proposal
  for the sake of the significant progress which it promised.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>II. Applicable Law</h4>

  <p>What rules of law will the new jurisdiction put into effect?
  This a crucial question posed by the fact that the laws of
  maritime warfare are far from being codified and that, in spite
  of the efforts of the 1907 Conference, uncertainty persists with
  regard to a great many points, some of them very important. When
  there are conventional rules that bind the nations concerned, or
  when rules have become so well established by custom that they
  can be regarded as the expression of the tacit will of these
  nations, international jurisdiction need only apply or interpret
  such rules. But a situation may well arise in which the law of
  nations, actual or customary, is silent; what then is the duty of
  international jurisdiction? Such a situation gives pause for
  thought. Here is the set of rules proposed by Great Britain
  which, after doctrinal scruples were expressed by certain
  delegates, was adopted by the Conference without serious
  objection:</p>

  <p>"If a question of law to be decided is covered by a treaty in
  force between the belligerent captor and a power which is itself
  or whose subject or citizen is a party to the proceedings, the
  court is governed by the provisions of the said treaty.</p>

  <p>In the absence of such provisions, the court shall apply the
  rules of international law. If no generally recognized rules
  exist, the court shall give judgment in accordance with the
  general principles of justice and equity."(Art. 7, par. 1 and
  2.)</p>

  <p>This is unquestionably a bold solution, but also one likely to
  exert the most beneficial influence on the development of
  international maritime law. The judges are thus set a delicate
  task, but we must trust the powers to choose them carefully
  enough that we can rely on the wisdom and moderation of their
  views. They will know how to amend a practice without
  overthrowing it. Such a provision reflects great credit on both
  the power which proposed it and on the Conference which voted for
  it. I emphasize this because it seems to me to signify
  outstanding progress for the concept of law in international
  relations.</p>

  <p>Thus the Conference of 1907 has created the first
  international judicial organism of a permanent nature in the
  sense that, as soon as redress from decisions of the prize
  tribunals is sought, the new institution will function on its own
  without there being any need for a new agreement between the
  nations concerned. I consider it auspicious for the development
  of compulsory arbitration that this agreement could be reached in
  view of the fact that it means submitting to a court of justice
  disputes deeply involving vital interests and national prestige,
  matters usually subject to the traditional reservations. Even
  though the whole problem was perforce related to the idea of war,
  it was, I feel, well within the domain of a Peace Conference.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The first Peace Conference had made it incumbent upon the one
  that would succeed it to pursue the study of certain questions.
  The second Conference was honorbound to execute this legacy
  insofar as practicable. It followed the example of its
  predecessor and referred various problems to the consideration of
  a third Conference. The calling of the latter has been expressly
  provided for by several Conventions, and the Final Act ends with
  these words:</p>

  <p>"Finally the Conference recommends to the powers the assembly
  of a Third Peace Conference, which might be held within a period
  corresponding to that which has elapsed since the preceding
  conference, at a date to be fixed by common agreement between the
  powers, and it calls their attention to the necessity of
  preparing the program of this Third Conference a sufficient time
  in advance, to ensure its deliberations being conducted with the
  necessary authority and expedition.</p>

  <p>In order to attain this object, the Conference considers that
  it would be very desirable that, some two years before the
  probable date of the meeting, a preparatory committee should be
  charged by the governments with the task of collecting the
  various proposals to be submitted to the conference, of
  ascertaining what subjects are ripe for embodiment in an
  international regulation, and of preparing a program which the
  governments should decide upon in sufficient time to enable it to
  be carefully examined by the countries interested. This committee
  should further be entrusted with the task of proposing a system
  of organization and procedure for the conference itself."</p>

  <p>I regard this recommendation as important for two reasons: it
  establishes the fact that the holding of regular international
  conferences is now a universally accepted idea and that
  suggestions based on experience should be made to ensure that
  these conferences take place under the most favorable conditions.
  Certain delegates had been in favor of providing an actual link
  between the second and third conferences by setting up a
  committee which would have been the executor, as it were, of the
  outgoing conference and the prime mover of the conference to
  come. This idea had to be promptly abandoned in favor of the
  formula I have just read, the drawing up of which was not an easy
  matter. In spite of the purely diplomatic prudence which inspired
  it, it contains several interesting points.</p>

  <p>The date of the next conference was not and could not be fixed
  since nobody can ever control the course of events, and since the
  year nominated might well prove totally unfavorable for a meeting
  of this kind. The interval provided for is fairly elastic. A
  certain amount of time must be allowed for the decisions of the
  1907 Conference to take effect: the period allowed for signing
  does not expire until June 30; the agreements signed will have to
  be ratified and, in a number of countries, the ratification of
  these agreements, or at least of some of them, will require the
  approval of parliament; and finally, in some cases special
  executive laws will have to be passed. All this naturally
  requires considerable time. Only after that can we start thinking
  about the next conference, and it is in this connection that
  practical experience has pointed the way. A diplomatic conference
  must be prepared carefully and the problems awaiting solution
  subjected to careful study in. the various countries so that the
  delegations can come equipped with precise instructions about the
  main issues, thus avoiding the necessity of referring them to
  their respective governments at every stage. The agendas of 1899
  and 1907 were too extensive and too vague. A committee of
  competent persons, formed well in advance, could render a signal
  service in collecting the various proposals, classifying them,
  and suggesting a program which would of course be decided upon by
  the governments themselves. Furthermore, regulations covering
  organization and procedure should be drawn up. In the wise
  recommendations made, which will, one hopes, find a receptive
  audience, there is an intentional omission: nothing has been said
  about the composition of the preparatory committee which will
  raise problems similar to those I have mentioned in connection
  with the court of arbitration. Let us hope that excessive
  touchiness does not thwart its appointment.</p>

  <p>Finally, you will note that the calling of a third conference
  is provided for in only a general way; nothing is said about
  initiating it or about the place where it is to be held. The
  institution exists independently, and each power can on its own
  responsibility take the necessary steps to activate it. From the
  legal point of view this is a sign of progress because no longer
  do meetings considered useful appear to depend on the goodwill of
  any particular power. As a jurist, however, I cannot make such a
  statement without also stating that Russia deserves the
  recognition of all nations for the initiative which she took in
  1899 and which she has valiantly tried to preserve in the
  aftermath of a terrible war, thus continuing a glorious
  tradition. She has shown the way once and will not hesitate to do
  so again, but she does not intend to monopolize the role of
  herald for the civilized world. As for the meeting place, if The
  Hague is not chosen it will not be because we have forgotten its
  gracious hospitality but because of consideration for The
  Netherlands government which cannot be tied up for years at a
  stretch. All legitimate sensitivities have been taken care of by
  a formula accepted by everyone.</p>

  <p>It is more than time for me to conclude. I have attempted to
  give an objective account of what has been achieved and of what
  has been done to prepare for future achievement. Let us be
  patient and let us have confidence in the beneficial effect of
  time in consolidating what is already decided and in developing
  what is only anticipated. Time can indeed be a "galant'uomo", to
  use the Italian phrase, but we must not leave it to work on its
  own; we must help it along. So let all of us who can exert any
  influence on international relations, be it in the sphere of
  theory or of practice, set to work. Let us devote ourselves
  neither to blind enthusiasm nor to blind disparagement of what
  has been done, but to constructive criticism that can lead the
  way to improvement; let us give properly measured consideration
  to every attempt and to every suggestion made to achieve success.
  Let all of us in each country search carefully for the real
  interests involved in any given question and for the changes in
  practice that might be effected by compromise - for habit is
  often a poor counselor, encouraging unjustified opposition to
  measures which would be to the general good.</p>

  <p>I need hardly say that I confine myself to my own field, that
  of jurisprudence, and that I do not mean to encroach upon that of
  the statesman.</p>

  <p>In closing, if I may be permitted to include the personal as I
  did in beginning this lecture, I promise you that I will devote
  to the task I have described the years of work still left to me.
  I would like to try in this way to justify the distinguished
  honor you have conferred upon me and to show my living gratitude
  to a country which welcomes me so warmly.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote24" id="footnote24"></a>24.
  In 1902, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy blockaded Venezuelan
  ports to enforce payment of claims which they and other nations
  (which had abstained from hostile action) held against Venezuela.
  Venezuela then agreed to a certain method of paying the claims
  but refused to give preferential treatment to the blockading
  powers. In May, 1903, the question was submitted to the Permanent
  Court of Arbitration which decided unanimously in favor of the
  blockading powers.</p>
