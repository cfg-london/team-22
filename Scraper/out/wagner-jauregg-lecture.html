  <h2>The Treatment of Dementia Paralytica by Malaria
  Inoculation</h2>

  <p>Two paths could lead to a cure for
  progressive paralysis: the rational and the empirical. The
  rational path appeared to be practical, as since Esmarch and
  Jessen, in 1858, attention had been drawn to a connection between
  progressive paralysis and syphilis. If incontestible proof that
  progressive paralysis was a syphilitic brain disease was first
  given much later (I mention in this connection the names
  Wassermann and Noguchi), therapeutic attempts to apply
  anti-syphilitic treatments were nevertheless instituted much
  earlier.</p>

  <p>Established psychiatry, it is true, soon
  turned away from the specific therapy. In all the textbooks it
  was stated that the mercury cure was of no use against paralysis
  and was usually harmful.</p>

  <p>However, systematic research on this point
  was not undertaken. It appears that the demand made by Jadassohn
  in 1912, that "one must compare, one with the other, a large
  series of cases untreated and of cases energetically treated with
  mercury", was nowhere put into effect.</p>

  <p>When rather belated Runge-Kiel in 1914
  established that among 555 paralytics collected between 1901 and
  1912 there were remissions in 3.9% of the untreated cases, 9.3%
  of those treated with iodine, and 11.4% of those treated with
  mercury it was still not possible to say that the iodine-mercury
  treatment was completely ineffective. However, its effect was
  unsatisfactory and, with rare exceptions, not lasting.</p>

  <p>The discovery of arsphenamine (Salvarsan)
  by Ehrlich brought new hope. The disappointment which soon
  followed was due to quite insufficient dosages. As one reads the
  reports of writers who have given arsphenamine in large doses and
  in rapidly repeated courses of treatment, and when one hears of
  the remissions obtained, in number and in duration far superior
  to the number of remissions observable in untreated paralysis, it
  cannot confidently be maintained that arsphenamine is ineffective
  against progressive paralysis. Yet it seems indeed, disregarding
  rare exceptions, that sooner or later a point is reached where
  arsphenamine treatment is unable to halt the fatal progression.
  The augmentation of the treatment by the employment of bismuth
  preparations could not change this.</p>

  <p>There are, however, still always writers
  who expect the cure of paralytics from specific treatment
  alone.</p>

  <p>But the question is not one of prestige
  between specific and non-specific treatment, but of what is the
  most far-reaching therapeutic effect on the disease
  obtainable.</p>

  <p>And thus we have arrived at the empirical
  method.</p>

  <p>Progressive paralysis has always been
  regarded as an incurable disease leading within a few years to
  insanity and death.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless there were records of cured
  cases of progressive paralysis; cases in which there was such a
  complete retrogression of all the symptoms of the disease that it
  was possible for the person concerned to go about his life and
  business independently for many years. And even though such cases
  were extraordinarily rare, there were still relatively frequent
  remissions of a considerable duration in which the symptoms of
  the disease already developed retrogressed to a greater or less
  extent. Thus, in principle at least, progressive paralysis was
  necessarily a curable disease. And Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam,
  had already pronounced that it must be of the greatest interest
  for the physician to study healed cases of incurable
  diseases.</p>

  <p>Now, the observation has been made that, in
  the rare cases of cure and in the frequent remissions of
  progressive paralysis, a febrile infectious disease or protracted
  suppuration had often preceded the improvement in the state of
  the disease.</p>

  <p>In that lay a pointer. These cures
  following febrile infectious diseases, of which I had experienced
  striking instances myself, led me to propose as early as 1887
  that this natural experiment should be imitated by a deliberate
  introduction of infectious diseases, and I suggested at that time
  malaria and erysipelas as suitable diseases. I singled out as a
  particular advantage of malaria that there is the possibility of
  interrupting the disease at will by the use of quinine, but I did
  not then anticipate to what degree these expectations from
  induced malaria would be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>At that time I did not proceed to the
  direct application of these proposals, apart from an unfortunate
  experiment with erysipelas, and I also hardly had the authority
  then to carry on with them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand I attempted to imitate
  the action of a febrile infectious disease by the use since 1890
  of tuberculin which Koch had just introduced. At first this was
  used not only in progressive paralysis, but also in other mental
  disturbances, not infrequently with beneficial consequences.
  (This was to some extent a forerunner of the use of protein
  therapy, which later attained a great advance.) As there were
  among these, some cases of progressive paralysis, my interest
  soon concentrated on this disease because a favourable result
  cannot be so easily regarded as fortuitous as in other
  psychoses.</p>

  <p>It was ascertained by means of a
  preliminary experiment of a large number of paralytics that those
  treated with tuberculin (with a maximum dose at that time of 0.1)
  showed more and longer-lasting remissions and a longer duration
  of life than an equal number of untreated paralytics. Afterwards,
  this treatment was carried out systematically and with an
  increasing dose of tuberculin (up to 1.0), and simultaneously a
  vigorous iodine-and-mercury treatment, later accompanied by
  arsphenamine injections, was also introduced.</p>

  <p>In 1909, at the International Medical
  Congress in Budapest I gave some information on these methods of
  treatment, which were thus the first combined treatment - i.e.
  specific and non-specific - of a syphilitic disease.</p>

  <p>Qualitatively the remissions which were
  obtained by means of the mercury- tuberculin treatment did not
  differ from those to be attained through induced malaria. The
  complete disappearance of the mental disturbances and the
  resumption of business activity, even in professions which make
  greater intellectual demands - such as civil servant, officer,
  barrister, solicitor, teacher, industrialist, actor, etc. - and
  the duration of the remissions was in individual cases quite
  remarkable; amounting to up to fifteen years.</p>

  <p>But the number of relapses was great, the
  lasting remissions were in the minority.</p>

  <p>I attempted to increase the effectiveness
  of the non-specific treatment by the utilization of various
  vaccines - staphylo-streptococcal vaccine, typhus vaccine -
  without altering the frequency of discouraging relapses in the
  slightest.</p>

  <p>In the course of this experimentation with
  treatments I was able to observe repeatedly that particularly
  complete and long-lasting remissions presented themselves
  precisely in those cases in which an unintentional infectious
  disease, such as pneumonia or an abscess, appeared during the
  course of the treatment.</p>

  <p>In 1917, therefore, I commenced to put into
  practice my proposal made in the year 1887, and I injected nine
  cases of progressive paralysis with tertian malaria.</p>

  <p>The result was gratifying beyond
  expectation: six of these nine cases showed an extensive
  remission, and in three of these cases the remission proved
  enduring, so that I was able to present these cases of cured
  patients who have without interruption taken up again their
  former occupations, to this year's annual meeting of the German
  Psychiatric Society as having been able to follow them for ten
  years. After the result of this first experiment was pursued for
  two years, I went on, in the autumn of 1919, to continue this
  experimental treatment on a large scale, and I made a report on
  it in 1920 to the annual meeting of the German Psychiatric
  Society in Hamburg.</p>

  <p>Whereas the earlier non-specific methods of
  treatment of progressive paralysis had met with little approval,
  it was otherwise with the malaria treatment. After Weygandt and
  Nonne, stimulated by M&uuml;hlens in Hamburg, had first tested
  the method of treatment on a large number of patients, it found
  quick acceptance in many psychiatric clinics and insane asylums,
  and is currently used, as far as I am informed, in all the
  countries of Europe, in North and South America, in South Africa,
  in the Dutch East Indies, and in Japan.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming majority of writers agree
  that with this method remissions can be obtained which are on a
  scale far exceeding those attained by any other method.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the malaria treatment should
  not simply replace specific treatment but should be used in
  conjunction with it. Some writers believed at first that they
  could dispense with the specific treatment, in that they obtained
  brilliant remissions by malaria alone. But the question is how to
  obtain the maximum therapeutic effect from the treatment. So, I
  undertook comparative investigations in which paralytics admitted
  to the clinic were treated alternately, the one with malaria
  only, the other with malaria followed by neoarsphenarnine. The
  superiority of the combined specific-non-specific treatment was
  clearly shown.</p>

  <p>The cases which had been subsequently
  treated with neoarsphenamine had 48.5% full remissions, those
  with no subsequent treatment only 25%. On the other hand, the
  number of deaths in the latter group was higher - 18.7% against
  12 % - and likewise the number of rapidly deteriorating cases was
  22% against 6.7%.</p>

  <p>The malaria treatment is thus to be
  associated with a specific treatment. Insofar as neoarsphenamine
  is concerned, the drug should be given first after the fever has
  subsided, as otherwise the malaria is cut short. In my clinic now
  5.00 grams of neoarsphenamine are given over six weeks after each
  malaria treatment.</p>

  <p>Malaria treatment is the more effective the
  earlier in the course of the paralysis it is carried out.
  Therefore it is impossible to get a correct picture of its
  potential effectiveness by simply calculating that out of such
  and such a number of paralytics treated with malaria so many per
  cent obtained complete remission. It depends very much on how
  many among the material in question were in the initial stages of
  paralysis and how many were in the advanced stages.</p>

  <p>We have therefore for some time singled out
  from the first, those cases of paralysis on their very first
  arrival at my clinic which from the degree and duration of their
  illness promised a favourable outcome and followed their progress
  separately. It was shown, that of these cases 84.8% obtained a
  full remission and 12.1% a partial remission, and that out of the
  total number of this series only one in thirty-eight had to be
  committed to the asylum.</p>

  <p>Hence it was shown that progressive
  paralysis is, in principle, curable and that the practical
  success of the malaria treatment will be the greater the earlier
  the diagnosis of the illness is established - the more, that is,
  that the early stages of paralysis are recognized by physicians.
  It has become apparent that it is unwise to employ other methods
  of treatment against paralysis before the malaria treatment, as
  this means time wasted.</p>

  <p>As the malaria treatment is the more
  effective the earlier it is employed, it would thus be best if it
  were carried out immediately on those luetics who are threatened
  with progressive paralysis. Which luetics are these? We know that
  they are those luetics in whom the cerebrospinal fluid in the
  advanced period of latency gives a positive reaction.</p>

  <p>It is due to the late Kyrle of Vienna that
  the malaria treatment was extended to these luetics in that in
  these cases, which are not yet immediately threatened, he
  prescribed a course of arsphenamine to precede the malaria, and a
  second course to follow it. The results in respect of the
  readjustment of the cerebrospinal fluid, which in such cases with
  other methods of treatment is on the contrary frequently very
  refractory, were so gratifying that already a large number of
  syphilologists have become acquainted with these methods. And it
  is to be hoped that once these methods become public property,
  psychiatrists will have very much fewer paralytics to treat.</p>

  <p>That the malaria treatment attained so
  great a dissemination is due to some favourable results, only
  apparent during its application, which could therefore not been
  expected from the beginning.</p>

  <p>It would have been difficult in many places
  to continue the malaria treatment if it had not been possible to
  maintain for an unlimited period a malaria strain by continual
  passage through human beings - that is in the asexual cycle. This
  was at first doubted, or at least the feat was stated, that such
  a strain would, in the course of its passage, change its
  properties, i.e. might become either no longer infectious or too
  virulent. These fears have proved groundless. In my clinic there
  is a malaria strain in use that since September 1919 has made
  about two hundred passages through human beings, without its
  infectiousness, its virulence, and its therapeutic properties
  having been altered. Similar experiences have been had in many
  places.</p>

  <p>The uninterrupted breeding of such a strain
  is, however, only possible where there is access to a
  sufficiently large number of paralytics needing treatment and
  possibly also of luetics in the advanced latency.</p>

  <p>In places with little patient material,
  however, such a strain of induced malaria will always die out
  again, and it would involve great and often insurmountable
  difficulties to always procure a new case of natural malaria
  again to start a treatment, for the malaria virus will not breed
  in cultures.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, however, the malaria parasites
  in human blood remain infectious for some time outside the human
  body, and this capacity can, by special methods of preservation
  be maintained for up to three days and in rare exceptions even
  longer, so that it is possible to send the virus over
  considerable distances by various means of transport.</p>

  <p>It is therefore possible to supply with
  malaria virus an area of a very large radius from a centre,
  especially if use is made of the most modern form of transport,
  air mail. In this way we once successfully supplied malaria blood
  to Constantinople from Vienna.</p>

  <p>It was finally a fortunate circumstance,
  which was not expected from the first, that tertian malaria
  brought on by injection proved to be so extra-ordinarily
  sensitive to quinine that a few grams of quinine suffice to cure
  the malaria completely and permanently, so that there is no fear
  of a relapse. It was through this that the great expansion which
  induced malaria has gained was first made possible.</p>

  <p>When tertian malaria is acquired naturally
  the attacks of fever may also be cut short very effectively with
  quinine, but the patients remain carriers of the plasmodium and
  frequently relapse sooner or later. How would it have been
  possible to release so many paralytics and advanced syphilitics
  from the hospitals when outside they first of all ran the
  continual risk of a relapse and secondly, particularly where
  there were anopheles, were a danger to their environment?</p>

  <p>The patient inoculated with malaria who has
  been adequately treated with quinine neither endangers himself
  further (in the sense of a malaria relapse), nor can he endanger
  his environment. However, he can from the moment of infection up
  to the elimination of the malaria present a danger to his
  environment, as malaria can be transferred from him to other
  persons through the sting of the anopheles, and that is then not
  induced malaria, but natural malaria, with its resistance to
  quinine.</p>

  <p>This danger, which was assumed with the
  presence of anopheles in places of treatment, can be excluded
  with a fair degree of safety, if the patients are kept under
  mosquito-proof netting during the whole duration of the
  treatment. This has been done in several countries, such as
  England and Sweden.</p>

  <p>The question is whether it is not possible
  to meet this danger in yet another way. An experiment was made in
  my clinic in 1924 with a large number of patients and mosquitoes
  to see if induced malaria could be transferred to other patients
  through anopheles; the experiment was without results. Such
  transfers have, however, been obtained by other writers, notably
  Shute and James, and also Warrington Yorke, in England, have
  carried out numerous successful transfers of induced malaria by
  means of anopheles. The Vienna strain has, however, been proved
  at that time to be free of gametes by an experiment of the
  Italian malariologist D. Vivaldi. The strains which were
  transferable through anopheles have all proved to be gamete
  producers; and the English writers mentioned in particular state
  that the transference by anopheles is the easier, the richer in
  gametes the donor's blood is.</p>

  <p>Plehn and Schulze of Berlin, and Vonkenel
  of Munich, also reported on such gamete-free strains.</p>

  <p>I have therefore in the preceding year made
  the demand that everyone who practises malaria therapy, should
  procure a gamete-free strain and thus eliminate the danger of a
  transfer by means of anopheles.</p>

  <p>More recent investigations carried out in
  my clinic this year have, however, shown that this demand cannot
  be realized, as gamete-free malaria strains cannot be obtained by
  transferring preserved blood unaltered from one place to another.
  That is to say that it has been shown that from the moment
  malaria blood leaves the human body, the malaria parasites
  deviate from the normal course of development; they leave the red
  blood corpuscles and assume gametic forms.</p>

  <p>We thus have in the preserved blood, not a
  gamete-free strain, but predominantly gamete-containing injection
  blood.</p>

  <p>Thus the propagation of a gamete-free
  strain would not be possible with preserved blood but only by
  direct transfer from one patient to another. It would not be
  possible to effect this by transferring the blood but only by
  transferring the patients.</p>

  <p>Induced malaria is, however, of itself a
  dangerous disease. The attacks of fever usually reach 40&deg;C
  by the third attack. The temperature often remains above
  40&deg;C for many hours in the later attacks. It frequently
  reaches 41&deg;C. The highest temperature that I have observed
  was 42&deg;C. In addition, the attacks frequently assume the
  quotidian type or take that course right from the beginning. It
  appears, incidentally, that paralysis plays a role in the
  appearance of the quotidian type, as in luetics of advanced
  latency the malaria usually remains tertian. Perhaps in this
  respect, however, different strains of malaria behave
  differently, since Bravetta in Novara has at his disposal a
  strain of which he reports that it causes without exception
  attacks of the tertian type.</p>

  <p>The high temperatures on the one hand and
  the brief pauses in the quotidian type on the other, make on the
  usually already weakened organism of the paralytic, especially on
  his heart, often too great demands; and thus we and others also
  have seen not by any means infrequent cases of death during the
  fever period or immediately afterwards.</p>

  <p>However, by various measures, this danger
  has been decreased to such an extent that fatal cases are now
  almost never seen. We use several methods to this end. Something
  can frequently be effected by the mode of inoculation. That is to
  say that, if one inoculates intracutaneously with a small
  quantity of blood, about 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup>, the fever usually
  develops into the tertian type, especially when the blood groups
  of the donor and recipient correspond, and the avoidance of the
  quotidian type is already an alleviation.</p>

  <p>In other cases we mitigate the fever with
  small doses of quinine (0.2-0.3) which must not, however, be
  given two days in succession, otherwise the fever ceases
  entirely. After a single administration of such a dose, the fever
  disappears for some days, during which the patient recovers; and
  when the fever sets in again it runs a milder course, as a rule.
  Alternatively one gives 0.1 quinine every two or three days from
  immediately after the injection, and in this way obtains a
  general alleviation of the course of the fever.</p>

  <p>Finally, in cases which on account of their
  physical constitution or on account of their age - somewhere
  between 55 and 70 - appear particularly endangered, a division of
  the course into two parts has been proved particularly
  successful. In such patients the fever will be interrupted by
  quinine after two to at the most four attacks. This is followed
  by a six weeks' pause taken up with injections of
  neoarsphenamine, after which the patient will be infected a
  second time. He has meanwhile recovered, and now endures the
  continuation of the cure very well.</p>

  <p>In this connection the question also
  arises, how many attacks of fever are necessary for a successful
  malaria cure? This can only be decided by experience, as we have
  no biological evidence as to when the optimum activity occurs. In
  my clinic the fever is, as a rule, terminated after eight
  attacks. English writers, by comparing therapeutic results after
  a shorter or longer duration of the fever period have likewise
  come to the conclusion that the optimum therapeutic effect lies
  at around eight attacks.</p>

  <p>Some writers have let their patients have
  very much longer fevers. However, I believe that it is much
  better to give to a patient in whom a course of some eight
  attacks of fever has had an unsatisfactory result, a second
  course soon afterwards, than to endanger the reconstruction which
  should follow each malaria injection by weakening the patient too
  severely by continuing the course too long.</p>

  <p>This reconstruction as an aftereffect of
  induced malaria, and the long duration of its aftereffect in
  general, is something that must be taken into account by every
  explanation of the mode of action of induced malaria.</p>

  <p>The improvement in the physical and mental
  health of the patients is not as a rule demonstrable immediately
  after the last attack of fever and never to the full extent. On
  the contrary, it often happens that a paralytic who on completion
  of the treatment has been committed to the asylum as uncured,
  presents himself again after six or twelve months and states that
  he has taken up his occupation again.</p>

  <p>The most convincing, because numerically
  demonstrable, expression of this delayed action of induced
  malaria is in the reactions of the serum and of the cerebrospinal
  fluid. The immediate effect of the malaria treatment on these
  reactions is negligible, and the changes do not run parallel with
  the clinical symptoms. It does change however, if these reactions
  are repeatedly investigated at intervals.</p>

  <p>Kyrle has already noticed that in the
  malaria treatment of advanced syphilitics distinguished by a
  positive cerebrospinal fluid, the immediate effect of the
  treatment was relatively small. However, after the space of a
  year the cerebrospinal fluid was negative, although since the
  malaria, no further treatment had taken place, and in spite of
  the fact that before the malaria treatment the most vigorous
  specific therapy had been applied without any result.</p>

  <p>The same thing happens with paralytics,
  only at an even slower tempo. In them the negativity of the
  cerebrospinal fluid reactions often first appears two, three, and
  even four years after the malaria treatment and still without any
  specific or non-specific treatment being introduced after the
  latter.</p>

  <p>My assistant D. Dattner reported three
  years ago on the results of treatment from a particular aspect on
  a series of 129 paralytics treated with malaria in the period
  between the beginning of 1922 and the beginning of 1924; 66 of
  them underwent cerebrospinal fluid examinations at more frequent
  intervals up to the present day. They were thus cases in whom the
  malaria treatment lay about three to five years behind. Of these
  cases, repeated examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid in 1927
  showed completely negative findings in 36, and nearly negative
  findings in 23. This favourable result, however, had first
  appeared in many of them two or more years after the cessation of
  the malaria treatment and without any further treatment having
  been administered in the meantime.</p>

  <p>It has been shown by these investigations
  that the serum reaction is more refractory than the cerebrospinal
  fluid reaction.</p>

  <p>The regularly repeated examination of the
  serum and cerebrospinal fluid also provides good evidence to
  establish a prognosis for the remissions achieved. Relapses, that
  is, do occur, but they form by far the minority beside cases
  which have attained a full remission. However, the cases in which
  this progressive improvement in the cerebrospinal fluid appears,
  do not relapse; but the contrary does not hold good. Curiously
  enough, this progressive improvement of the cerebrospinal fluid
  appears also in a number of the cases which do not improve
  clinically. It is thus of prognostic value only in conjunction
  with the clinical findings.</p>

  <p>How is the action of induced malaria on the
  paralytic process to be explained?</p>

  <p>It is certain that it is not the high
  temperature alone that is effective. The spirochaetes, it is
  true, disappear from the brain during the fever. When, however,
  the fever has passed, they are immediately to be found again in
  the brain, at least in cases where the course is not successful,
  as Forster has shown. Where are they in the meantime? Does
  malaria act against syphilis in general or predominantly against
  progressive paralysis? We know that syphilitic processes in the
  secondary period are also influenced by malaria, yet this action
  appears to be less permanent than the action on progressive
  paralysis. Vascular syphilis appears to be less favourably
  affected than progressive paralysis. Further, it has been
  experienced that soon after the malaria treatment gummata appear,
  even in cases in which the paralytic process has been favourably
  affected.</p>

  <p>It appears then, that malaria besides a
  non-specific action against the syphilitic infection, also exerts
  a specific elective action on the cerebral process of progressive
  paralysis, including advanced infection of the cerebro-spinal
  fluid.</p>

  <p>It is also very likely that malaria creates
  favourable conditions for all reparatory processes because of its
  cyclic course, and because ultimately a rapid transition takes
  place from a serious state of illness to a full recovery. The
  superiority ofinduced malaria over the different types of
  stimulation therapy, e.g. by the injection of vaccines and
  proteins, has been shown by Schilling and his colleagues on the
  cytological blood-picture, and by Donath and Heilig on the
  chemical blood-picture. It is certain that induced malaria
  therapy will yet pose many worthwhile problems for research to
  explain.</p><!--eri-no-index-->
