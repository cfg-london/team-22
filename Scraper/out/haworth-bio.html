  <h1>Norman Haworth - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="haworth.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Walter Norman Haworth</b> was born at
  Chorley, Lancashire, on March 19, 1883. He attended the local
  school until the age of fourteen when he joined his father,
  Thomas Haworth, to learn linoleum design and manufacture. His
  interest in chemistry was aroused through the use of dyestuffs in
  his work and his thirst for further knowledge led him to seek
  private tuition in Preston. This coaching enabled him to pass the
  entrance examination of the University of Manchester and in 1903 he
  entered the Chemistry Department as a pupil of W.H. Perkin,
  Junior. He graduated with first class honours in 1906 and after
  three years research he went, on a scholarship, to <a href=
  "../1910/index.html">Wallach</a>'s laboratory at G&ouml;ttingen.
  He received his doctor's degree in 1910 and returned to
  Manchester to be awarded his D.Sc. degree in 1911 - these
  qualifications were gained in the minimum time possible.<br>
  <br>
  In 1911, Haworth took an appointment as a demonstrator at the
  Imperial College,
  London and in 1912 he moved to St. Andrews,
  Scotland, as Lecturer and Reader in Chemistry. In 1920, he
  was called to the Chair in Chemistry at the University of Durham
  and in the following year succeeded Phillips Bedson as Director.
  Haworth was appointed Professor and Director of the Department of
  Chemistry in the University of Birmingham in 1925 and he remained in
  this position until his retirement in 1948, becoming Dean of the
  Faculty of Science and acting as Vice-Principal during 1947-1948.
  Sir Norman was active in retirement, serving on many Boards and
  Committees; he represented the Royal Society at
  the Seventh Pacific Science Congress in New Zealand during
  February, 1949. He was knighted in 1947.<br>
  <br>
  Haworth's early researches, initially with Perkin, involved
  investigations on the constitution of terpenes and in 1912 he
  synthesized sylvestrene. At St. Andrews, in association with T.
  Purdie and J.C. Irvine, he turned his attention to carbohydrates,
  extending <a href="../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a>'s method
  of reacting sugars with methanol to an elegant preparation of
  methylated derivatives which were, in turn, used to characterize
  the constitution of sugars.<br>
  <br>
  During the First World War, Haworth organized the laboratories at
  St. Andrews for the production of fine chemicals and drugs; after
  the war he returned once more to his carbohydrate investigations.
  By 1928, he had evolved and confirmed, among others, the
  structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose,
  melibiose, gentianose, raffinose and the glucoside ring structure
  of normal sugars. He studied lactones from sugars and co-related
  structure with optical rotatory powers. His method for the
  determination of chain length in methylated polysaccharides, an
  important structural problem, helped to settle the basic features
  of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan
  molecules.<br>
  <br>
  Following the synthesis of ascorbic acid, which considerably
  cheapened commercial production, Haworth's later researches
  contributed greatly towards further co-ordination of the
  chemical, physical and biological, problems concerned with
  bacterial polysaccharides.<br>
  <br>
  Haworth wrote numerous scientific papers and contributed to
  <i>Advances in Carbobydrate Chemistry</i>. His book <i>The
  Constitution of Sugars</i> was published in 1929.<br>
  <br>
  Haworth was President of the Chemical Society (1944-1946), and
  Fellow (1928), and Vice-President (1947-1948) of the Royal
  Society. He received honorary science degrees from the
  Universities of Belfast, Zurich and Oslo, honorary Doctor of Law, University of
  Manchester, and foreign memberships of nine foreign scientific
  academies. He was the Longstaff Medallist (Chemical Society),
  1933; Davy Medallist (Royal Society), 1934, and Royal Medallist,
  1942.<br>
  <br>
  In 1922, Haworth married Violet Chilton, second daughter of Sir
  James Dobbie, LL.D., F.R.S. They had two sons. He died suddenly
  on March 19, 1950.</p>
