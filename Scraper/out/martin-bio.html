  <h1>Archer J.P. Martin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="martin.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Archer John Porter Martin</b> was
  born on March 1st, 1910, in London where his father was a general
  medical practitioner. He attended Bedford School from 1921 to
  1929 when he entered Cambridge University to graduate in 1932. After a
  year in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory he obtained a post at
  the Dunn Nutritional Laboratory, where he worked under L.J.
  Harris and Sir Charles Martin, and in 1938 he moved to the Wool
  Industries Research Association at Leeds. From 1946 to 1948 he
  was Head of the Biochemistry Division of the Research Department
  of Boots Pure Drug Company at Nottingham and in 1948 he joined
  the staff of the Medical Research Council, first at the Lister
  Institute and later at the National Institute for Medical
  Research. He was appointed Head of the Division of Physical
  Chemistry at the Institute in 1952 and he was Chemical Consultant
  from 1956 to 1959. Since 1959 he has been a Director of
  Abbotsbury Laboratories Ltd.<br>

  Martin entered Cambridge University with the intention of
  becoming a chemical engineer but, due to the influence of
  Professor J.B.S. Haldane, then Reader of Biochemistry at
  Cambridge, he eventually specialized in biochemistry. His first
  researches, as an undergraduate, resulted in a method of
  detecting pyro-electricity by observing the attraction of a metal
  plate for crystals that had been immersed in liquid air. At
  Cambridge he worked on ultraviolet adsorption spectra and at the
  Nutritional Laboratory he was concerned with the attempted
  isolation of Vitamin E and in the pathological effects of
  prolonged Vitamin E deficiencies. In these latter studies he used
  solvent extraction and chromatographic methods which were to lay
  the foundation for his later work on chromatography. He also
  worked, along with others, on the B<sub>2</sub> group of vitamin
  deficiencies in pigs.<br>
  <br>
  At the Wool Industries Research Association he worked on the
  felting of wool, first with R.L.M. Synge and later with Consden
  and Gordon, and on amino-acid analysis. It was here that he
  developed his method of partition chromatography; more recently,
  with A.T. James, he has developed the method of gas-liquid
  chromatography.<br>

  Dr. Martin, a Fellow of the Royal Society (1950), was made Companion of
  the British Empire in 1960. He received the Berzelius Medal of
  the Swedish Medical Society (1951), the John Scott Award (1958),
  the John Price Wetherill Medal (1959), the Franklin Institute
  Medal (1959), and the Leverhulme Medal (1963).<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, he was appointed to deliver special lectures (as
  "buitengewoon hoogleraar") at the Technological University of Eindhoven, The
  Netherlands.<br>
  <br>
  In 1943 he married Judith Bagenal; they have one son and three
  daughters.</p>
