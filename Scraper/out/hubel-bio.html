  <h1>David H. Hubel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hubel.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Three of my grandparents were also born
  in Canada: the fourth, my paternal grandfather, emigrated as a
  child to the U.S.A. from the Bavarian town of N&ouml;rdlingen. He
  became a pharmacist and achieved some prosperity by inventing the
  first process for the mass producing of gelatin capsules. My
  parents were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. My father, a
  chemical engineer, took a job across the Detroit River in
  Windsor, Ontario, became tired of commuting from Detroit, and
  finally moved to Canada. When I was born I acquired U.S.
  citizenship through my parents and Canadian citizenship by birth.
  (When it comes to prizes I don't know whether each country gets
  half credit or both get full credit.) In 1929 my father moved to
  Montreal, where I grew up. From age six to eighteen I went to
  Strathcona Academy in Outremont, and owe much to the excellent
  teachers there, especially to Julia Bradshaw, a dedicated,
  vivacious history teacher with a memorable Irish temper, who
  awakened me to the possibility of learning how to write readable
  English. I owe much of my interest in science to my father, whom
  I plagued with endless questions. To my mother goes much of the
  credit for encouraging me to work for whatever objectives I set
  for myself. As a boy my main hobbies were chemistry (my friends,
  who consider me utterly ignorant of that subject, will be richly
  amused) and electronics. I soon tired of the electronics because
  nothing I built ever worked. But with chemistry I discovered
  potassium chlorate and sugar mixture and set off a small cannon
  that rocked Outremont, and I released a hydrogen balloon that
  flew all the way to Sherbrooke. At McGill College I did
  honors mathematics and physics, partly to find out why nothing
  worked in electronics, but mainly because it was more fun to do
  problems than to learn facts. I still much prefer to do science
  than to read about it. I graduated in 1947 and, almost on the
  toss of a coin, despite never having taken a course in biology
  (even in high school, where it was considered a subject only for
  those who could not do Latin or mathematics) I applied to Medical
  School at McGill. Rather to my horror I was accepted. At first I
  found it very difficult, given my total ignorance of biology and
  the need to memorize every muscular insertion in the body. I
  spent summers at the Montreal Neurological Institute doing electronics (I
  now had the theoretical basis but still no talent with a
  soldering iron) and there I became fascinated by the nervous
  system - small wonder considering that this was the period of
  culmination of the work of Penfield and Jasper. To my surprise I
  also found I enjoyed clinical medicine: it took three years of
  hospital training after graduation, (a year of internship and two
  of residency in neurology) before that interest finally wore off.
  The years of hospital training were interrupted by a year of
  clinical neurophysiology under Herbert Jasper, who was unequalled
  for his breadth and clarity of thinking in brain science. On
  setting foot into the United States in 1954 for a Neurology year
  at Johns
  Hopkins I was promptly drafted by the army as a doctor, but
  was lucky enough to be assigned to the Walter Reed Army Institute
  of Research, Neuropsychiatry Division, and there, at the age of
  29, I finally began to do research. One then had little of the
  feeling of frenetic competition that is found in graduate
  students today; it was possible to take more long-shots without
  becoming panic stricken if things didn't work out brilliantly in
  the first few months. We were not free from financial worries, as
  graduate students in biology by and large are now; until I
  entered the army my income was close to zero, and I owe a huge
  debt to my wife Ruth for supporting us through those lean and
  exploited years of residency and fellowship training.<br>

  Scientifically, I could hardly have chosen a better place than
  Walter Reed. In the neuropsychiatry division David Rioch had
  assembled a broad and lively group of young neuroscientists,
  notably M.G.F. Fuortes and Robert Galambos in neurophysiology,
  Walle Nauta in neuroanatomy, Joseph Brady and Murray Sidman in
  experimental psychology and John Mason in chemistry. As in
  Montreal, the focus was on the entire nervous system, not on a
  subdivision of biological subject matter based on methods. I
  worked under the supervision of Fuortes. We began by
  collaborating for six months on a spinal cord project, and it was
  then that I had my only apprenticeship in experimental
  neurophysiology. Fuortes had a genuine feel for biology that was
  rare among neurophysiologists in those days. I also learned and
  benefited much from a most able and helpful research assistant,
  Calvin Henson. My main project while at Walter Reed was a
  comparison of the spontaneous firing of single cortical cells in
  sleeping and waking cats. I began by recording from the visual
  cortex: it seemed most sensible to look at a primary sensory
  area, and the visual was easiest, there being less muscle
  between that part of the brain and the outside world. It was
  first necessary to devise a method for recording from freely
  moving cats and to develop a tungsten microelectrode tough enough
  to penetrate the dura. That took over a year, but in the end it
  was exciting to be able to record from a single cell in the
  cortex of a cat that was looking around and purring.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 I moved to the Wilmer Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital, to
  the laboratory of Stephen Kuffler, and there I began
  collaboration with <a href="index.html">Torsten Wiesel</a>. A
  year later Kuffler's entire laboratory (nine families) moved to
  Harvard
  Medical School in Boston, at first as part of the Department
  of Pharmacology under Otto Krayer, who was largely responsible
  for bringing Kuffler to Harvard. Five years later, in a move
  unprecedented for Harvard, we became the new Department of
  Neurobiology. My daily contacts with Stephen Kuffler (until his
  death a year ago) and with Edwin Furshpan, Edward Kravitz, David
  Potter and Simon LeVay have been both fun and enriching. During
  the past twenty two years, besides working with Torsten, I have
  collaborated briefly with Ursula Dr&auml;ger, Helga Ginzler, and
  Ann Graybiel. At present I am working with Margaret
  Livingstone.<br>
  <br>
  Since the age of five I have spent a disproportionate amount of
  time on music, for many years the piano, then recorders, and now
  the flute. I do woodworking and photography, own a small
  telescope for astronomy, and I ski and play tennis and squash. I
  enjoy learning languages, and have spent untold hours looking up
  words in French, Japanese and German dictionaries. In the
  laboratory I enjoy almost everything, including machining,
  photography, computers, surgery - even neurophysiology.<br>
  <br>
  This is perhaps a suitable place to express my deep gratitude to
  the Eye
  Institute of the National Institutes of Health, to the U.S.
  Air Force, the Klingenstein Foundation, and to the Rowland
  Foundation for their generous support of our research. Also the
  Faculty of Harvard University deserves my thanks for tolerating
  such a truculent colleague.</p>
