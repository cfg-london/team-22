  <h1>Carlos Saavedra Lamas - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lamas.jpg" class="bio-img">Born in Buenos
  Aires, <b>Carlos Saavedra Lamas</b> (November 1, 1878-May 5,
  1959) was a member of the &laquo;aristocracy&raquo; of Argentina. A
  descendant of an early Argentinian patriot, he married the
  daughter of a president of the Republic. Saavedra Lamas achieved
  renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his
  practical work in drafting international agreements and in
  conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for
  his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and
  international law.<br>
  <br>
  Saavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College
  and at the University of Buenos Aires where he received the
  Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, <i>summa cum laude</i>. After
  study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in
  law and constitutional history at the University of La
  Plata, where he began the teaching career that was to span
  more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in
  sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political
  economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the
  university, and eventually served as the president of the
  university.<br>
  <br>
  Saavedra Lamas was a leading Argentinian academician in two
  areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited
  several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the
  need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of
  labor - among them, <i>Centro de legislac&iacute;on social y del
  trabajo</i> (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation],
  <i>Trait&eacute;s internationaux de type social</i> (1924),
  <i>C&oacute;digo nacional del trabajo</i> (three volumes, 1933)
  [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs,
  Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina,
  supported the founding of the <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">International Labor Organization</a> in
  1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva
  while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine
  delegation.<br>
  <br>
  In international law, his other field of major scholarly
  interest, he published <i>La Crise de la codification et de la
  doctrine argentine de droit international</i> (1931); and he
  spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with
  international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization,
  immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief
  <i>Vida internacional</i>, which he wrote at the age of seventy,
  is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.<br>
  <br>
  Saavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of
  Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the
  municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to
  the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he
  initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation,
  sugar production, government finances, colonization, and
  immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs.
  He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty
  with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually
  became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the
  foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed
  foreign treaties.<br>
  <br>
  Appointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he
  instituted educational reforms by integrating the different
  divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at
  the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training
  of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.<br>
  <br>
  When General Agust&iacute;n P. Justo became president of Argentina
  in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this
  post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige
  to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American
  diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to
  rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years,
  and represented Argentina at virtually every international
  meeting of consequence during this period.<br>
  <br>
  His work in ending the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia
  (1932-1935) had not only local significance but generalized
  international importance as well. When he took over the foreign
  office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the
  diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this
  dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of
  August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to
  recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about
  by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and
  Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in
  October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the
  Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later.
  In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations
  which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay
  and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the
  South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was
  well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all
  of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the
  League of Nations in 1936.<br>
  <br>
  After his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra
  Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the
  University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941-1943), and rounded
  out his career as a professor for an additional three years
  (1943-1946).<br>
  <br>
  Saavedra Lamas was known as a disciplinarian in his office, a
  logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or
  his art gallery, a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is
  said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the
  Nobel Peace Prize, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion
  of Honor of France and analogous honors from ten other
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  He died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain
  hemorrhage.</p>
