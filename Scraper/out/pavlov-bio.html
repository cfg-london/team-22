  <h1>Ivan Pavlov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pavlov.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Ivan
  Petrovich Pavlov</b> was born on September 14, 1849 at Ryazan,
  where his father, Peter Dmitrievich Pavlov, was a village priest.
  He was educated first at the church school in Ryazan and then at
  the theological seminary there.<br>
  <br>
  Inspired by the progressive ideas which D. I. Pisarev, the most
  eminent of the Russian literary critics of the 1860's and I. M.
  Sechenov, the father of Russian physiology, were spreading,
  Pavlov abandoned his religious career and decided to devote his
  life to science. In 1870 he enrolled in the physics and
  mathematics faculty to take the course in natural science.<br>
  <br>
  Pavlov became passionately absorbed with physiology, which in
  fact was to remain of such fundamental importance to him
  throughout his life. It was during this first course that he
  produced, in collaboration with another student, Afanasyev, his
  first learned treatise, a work on the physiology of the
  pancreatic nerves. This work was widely acclaimed and he was
  awarded a gold medal for it.<br>
  <br>
  In 1875 Pavlov completed his course with an outstanding record
  and received the degree of Candidate of Natural Sciences.
  However, impelled by his overwhelming interest in physiology, he
  decided to continue his studies and proceeded to the Academy of
  Medical Surgery to take the third course there. He completed this
  in 1879 and was again awarded a gold medal. After a competitive
  examination, Pavlov won a fellowship at the Academy, and this
  together with his position as Director of the Physiological
  Laboratory at the clinic of the famous Russian clinician, S. P.
  Botkin, enabled him to continue his research work. In 1883 he
  presented his doctor's thesis on the subject of &laquo;The
  centrifugal nerves of the heart&raquo;. In this work he developed
  his idea of nervism, using as example the intensifying nerve of
  the heart which he had discovered, and furthermore laid down the
  basic principles on the trophic function of the nervous system.
  In this as well as in other works, resulting mainly from his
  research in the laboratory at the Botkin clinic, Pavlov showed
  that there existed a basic pattern in the reflex regulation of
  the activity of the circulatory organs.<br>
  <br>
  In 1890 Pavlov was invited to organize and direct the Department
  of Physiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine. Under
  his direction, which continued over a period of 45 years to the
  end of his life, this Institute became one of the most important
  centres of physiological research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1890 Pavlov was appointed Professor of Pharmacology at the
  Military Medical Academy and five years later he was appointed to
  the then vacant Chair of Physiology, which he held till
  1925.<br>
  <br>
  It was at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in the years
  1891-1900 that Pavlov did the bulk of his research on the
  physiology of digestion. It was here that he developed the
  surgical method of the &laquo;chronic&raquo; experiment with
  extensive use of fistulas, which enabled the functions of various
  organs to be observed continuously under relatively normal
  conditions. This discovery opened a new era in the development of
  physiology, for until then the principal method used had been
  that of &laquo;acute&raquo; vivisection, and the function of an
  organism had only been arrived at by a process of analysis. This
  meant that research into the functioning of any organ
  necessitated disruption of the normal interrelation between the
  organ and its environment. Such a method was inadequate as a
  means of determining how the functions of an organ were regulated
  or of discovering the laws governing the organism as a whole
  under normal conditions - problems which had hampered the
  development of all medical science. With his method of research,
  Pavlov opened the way for new advances in theoretical and
  practical medicine. With extreme clarity he showed that the
  nervous system played the dominant part in regulating the
  digestive process, and this discovery is in fact the basis of
  modern physiology of digestion. Pavlov made known the results of
  his research in this field, which is of great importance in
  practical medicine, in lectures which he delivered in 1895 and
  published under the title <i>Lektsii o rabote glavnykh
  pishchevaritelnyteh zhelez</i> (Lectures on the function of the
  principal digestive glands) (1897).<br>
  <br>
  Pavlov's research into the physiology of digestion led him
  logically to create a science of conditioned reflexes. In his
  study of the reflex regulation of the activity of the digestive
  glands, Pavlov paid special attention to the phenomenon of
  &laquo;psychic secretion&raquo;, which is caused by food stimuli at
  a distance from the animal. By employing the method - developed
  by his colleague D. D. Glinskii in 1895 - of establishing
  fistulas in the ducts of the salivary glands, Pavlov was able to
  carry out experiments on the nature of these glands. A series of
  these experiments caused Pavlov to reject the subjective
  interpretation of &laquo;psychic&raquo; salivary secretion and, on
  the basis of Sechenov's hypothesis that psychic activity was of a
  reflex nature, to conclude that even here a reflex - though not a
  permanent but a temporary or conditioned one - was
  involved.<br>
  <br>
  This discovery of the function of conditioned reflexes made it
  possible to study all psychic activity objectively, instead of
  resorting to subjective methods as had hitherto been necessary;
  it was now possible to investigate by experimental means the most
  complex interrelations between an organism and its external
  environment.<br>
  <br>
  In 1903, at the 14th International Medical Congress in Madrid,
  Pavlov read a paper on &laquo;The Experimental Psychology and
  Psychopathology of Animals&raquo;. In this paper the definition of
  conditioned and other reflexes was given and it was shown that a
  conditioned reflex should be regarded as an elementary
  psychological phenomenon, which at the same time is a
  physiological one. It followed from this that the conditioned
  reflex was a clue to the mechanism of the most highly developed
  forms of reaction in animals and humans to their environment and
  it made an objective study of their psychic activity
  possible.<br>
  <br>
  Subsequently, in a systematic programme of research, Pavlov
  transformed Sechenov's theoretical attempt to discover the reflex
  mechanisms of psychic activity into an experimentally proven
  theory of conditioned reflexes.<br>
  <br>
  As guiding principles of materialistic teaching on the laws
  governing the activity of living organisms, Pavlov deduced three
  principles for the theory of reflexes: the principle of
  determinism, the principle of analysis and synthesis, and the
  principle of structure.<br>
  <br>
  The development of these principles by Pavlov and his school
  helped greatly towards the building-up of a scientific theory of
  medicine and towards the discovery of laws governing the
  functioning of the organism as a whole.<br>
  <br>
  Experiments carried out by Pavlov and his pupils showed that
  conditioned reflexes originate in the cerebral cortex, which acts
  as the &laquo;prime distributor and organizer of all activity of
  the organism&raquo; and which is responsible for the very delicate
  equilibrium of an animal with its environment. In 1905 it was
  established that any external agent could, by coinciding in time
  with an ordinary reflex, become the conditioned signal for the
  formation of a new conditioned reflex. In connection with the
  discovery of this general postulate Pavlov proceeded to
  investigate &laquo;artificial conditioned reflexes&raquo;. Research
  in Pavlov's laboratories over a number of years revealed for the
  first time the basic laws governing the functioning of the cortex
  of the great hemispheres. Many physiologists were drawn to the
  problem of developing Pavlov's basic laws governing the activity
  of the cerebrum. As a result of all this research there emerged
  an integrated Pavlovian theory on higher nervous activity.<br>
  <br>
  Even in the early stages of his research Pavlov received world
  acclaim and recognition. In 1901 he was elected a corresponding
  member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1904 he was awarded
  a Nobel Prize, and in 1907 he was elected Academician of the
  Russian Academy of Sciences; in 1912 he was given an honorary
  doctorate at Cambridge University and in the following years
  honorary membership of various scientific societies abroad.
  Finally, upon the recommendation of the Medical Academy of Paris,
  he was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour (1915).<br>
  <br>
  After the October Revolution, a special government decree, signed
  by Lenin on January 24, 1921, noted &laquo;the outstanding
  scientific services of Academician I.P.Pavlov, which are of
  enormous significance to the working class of the whole
  world&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  The Communist Party and the Soviet Government saw to it that
  Pavlov and his collaborators were given unlimited scope for
  scientific research. The Soviet Union became a prominent centre
  for the study of physiology, and the fact that the 15th
  International Physiological Congress of August 9-17, 1935, was
  held in Leningrad and Moscow clearly shows that it was
  acknowledged as such.<br>
  <br>
  Pavlov directed all his indefatigable energy towards scientific
  reforms. He devoted much effort to transforming the physiological
  institutions headed by him into world centres of scientific
  knowledge, and it is generally acknowledged that he succeeded in
  this endeavour.<br>
  <br>
  Pavlov nurtured a great school of physiologists, which produced
  many distinguished pupils. He left the richest scientific legacy
  - a brilliant group of pupils, who would continue developing the
  ideas of their master, and a host of followers all over the
  world.<br>
  <br>
  In 1881, Pavlov married Seraphima (Sara) Vasilievna Karchevskaya,
  a teacher, the daughter of a doctor in the Black Sea fleet. She
  first had a miscarriage, said to be due to her having to run
  after her very fast-walking husband. Subsequently they had a son,
  Wirchik, who died very suddenly as a child; three sons, Vladimir,
  Victor and Vsevolod, one of whom was a well-known physicist and
  professor of physics at Leningrad in 1925, and a daughter,
  Vera.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Pavlov died in Leningrad on February 27, 1936.</p>
