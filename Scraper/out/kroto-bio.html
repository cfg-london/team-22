 <h1>Sir Harold Kroto - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kroto.jpg" class="bio-img">I was the kid
 with the funny name in my form. That is one of the earliest
 memories I have of school (except for being forced to finish
 school dinners). Other kids had typical Lancashire names such as
 Chadderton, Entwistle, Fairhurst, Higginbottom, Mottershead and
 Thistlethwaite though I must admit that there were the odd Smith,
 Jones and Brown. My name at that time was Krotoschiner (my father
 changed it to Kroto in 1955 so it is now occasionally thought, by
 some, to be Japanese). I felt as though I must have come from
 outer space - or maybe they did! I now realise that I had made a
 continual subconscious effort to blend as best I could into the
 environment by making my behaviour as identical as possible to
 that of the other kids. This was not easy indeed it was almost
 impossible with a couple of somewhat eccentric parents (in
 particular an extrovertly gregarious mother) who were born in
 Berlin and came to Britain as refugees in their late 30's.<br>
 <br>
 Bolton is a once prosperous but then (the fifties) decaying
 northern English town which is rightfully proud of its legendary
 contributions to the industrial revolution - the likes of Samuel
 Crompton and Richard Arkwright were Boltonians. Indeed we lived
 in Arkwright St. and I shall always remember walking to school
 each morning past the windows of cotton mills through which I
 could see the vast rows of massive looms and spinning frames
 operated by women who had been working from at least six o'clock
 in the morning, if not earlier.<br>
 <br>
 My efforts to merge into the background meant, among other things
 such as fighting (literally) for survival, speaking only English
 (all real Englishmen expect others to speak English) - though I
 allowed myself to absorb just enough German to understand what my
 parents were saying about me when they spoke German. One specific
 memory was that when I did particularly poorly at French one year
 my Father gave me a very large French dictionary for my birthday
 - was I pleased!!!<br>
 <br>
 My name seems to have its origins in Silesia where my father's
 family originated and there is a town in Poland now called
 Krotoszyn (then Krotoschin). My father's family came from
 Bojanowo and set up a shop in Berlin where my father was born in
 1900. The original family house, which was then a shop, still
 exists in the main square in Bojanowo. I have an old photograph
 which shows the sign "I. Krotoschiner" in gothic characters
 emblazened over the window. I visited the town recently and,
 apart from cars rather than horsedrawn carts and the sign, little
 has changed - the Hotel Centralny is now the Restauracja
 Centralny and the aerials on the roofs are still there!<br>
 <br>
 My father, who originally wanted to be a dress designer but
 somehow ended up running a small business printing faces and
 other images on toy balloons, had to leave Berlin in 1937 and my
 mother (who was not Jewish) followed a few months later. I always
 felt that my parents had a really raw deal, as did almost
 everyone born in Europe at the turn of the Century. The First
 World War took place while they were teenagers, then the
 Depression struck and Hitler came to power while they were young
 adults. They had to leave their home country and then the Second
 World War broke out and they had to leave their home again. When
 my father was 45 he had to find a new profession, when he was 55
 he set up his business again and when he was 65 he realised I was
 not going to take it over. He sold the business and retired in
 his early 70's.<br>
 <br>
 I do not know how my father managed to catch the train to take
 him over the border into Holland in 1937. For as long as I knew
 him he was always late for everything; he invariably missed every
 train or bus he was supposed to catch. He told me that this was
 because he was called up in 1917 to go to the Front but arrived
 at the station just as the train was pulling out. When he asked
 the station master what he should do, he was told to go home.
 From then on he decided to make a point of missing trains and
 buses, but seems to have made one exception, in 1937. My parents
 managed to set up their small business again in London but the
 effort was, of course, short lived due to the outbreak of the War
 in September 1939. I was born in Wisbech (a very small town in
 Cambridgeshire to which my mother was evacuated) on Oct 7th 1939
 in the first month of the War so I was a war baby. My father was
 interned on the Isle of Man because he was considered to be an
 enemy alien; my mother (who was also an alien, but presumably
 assumed not to be an enemy one) was moved (with me - when I was
 about one year old) from London to Bolton in 1940. After the war
 my father became an apprentice engineer and because he was so
 good with his hands he managed to get a job as a fully qualified
 toolmaker at an engineering company in months rather than
 years.<br>
 <br>
 In 1955, with help from friends in England and Germany from
 before the war, he set up his own small factory again, this time
 to make balloons as well as print them. I spent much of my school
 holidays working at the factory. I was called upon to fill in
 everywhere, from mixing latex dyes to repairing the machinery and
 replacing workers on the production line. I only now realise what
 an outstanding training ground this had been for the development
 of the problem solving skills needed by a research scientist. I
 am also sure that what I was doing then would contravene
 present-day health and safety at work regulations. I would have
 been considered too young and inexperienced to do the sort of
 maintenance work that I was often called upon to do. I did the
 stocktaking twice-a-year using a set of old scales with sets of
 individual gram weights (weighing balloons 10 at-a-time to obtain
 their average weights), my head, log tables and a slide rule to
 determine total numbers of various types of balloons. No paradise
 of microprocessor controlled balances then. After each
 stocktaking session I invariably felt that I never wanted to see
 another balloon as long as I lived.<br>
 <br>
 My parents had lost almost everything and we lived in a very poor
 part of Bolton. However they did everything they could to get me
 the best education they could. As far as they were concerned this
 meant getting me into Bolton School, a school with exceptional
 facilities and teachers. As a consequence of misguided
 politically motivated educational policies this school has become
 an independent school and it bothers me that, were I today in the
 same financial position as my parents had been when I was a
 child, I would not be able to send my children to this school.
 Though I did not like exams or homework anymore than other kids,
 I did like school and spent as much time as I could there. At
 first I particularly enjoyed art, geography, gymnastics and
 woodwork. At home I spent much of the time by myself in a large
 front room which was my private world. As time went by it filled
 up with junk and in particular I had a Meccano set with which I
 "played" endlessly. Meccano which was invented by Frank Hornby
 around 1900, is called Erector Set in the US. New toys (mainly
 Lego) have led to the extinction of Meccano and this has been a
 major disaster as far as the education of our young engineers and
 scientists is concerned. Lego is a technically trivial plaything
 and kids love it partly because it is so simple and partly
 because it is seductively coloured. However it is only a toy,
 whereas Meccano is a real engineering kit and it teaches one
 skill which I consider to be the most important that anyone can
 acquire: This is the sensitive touch needed to thread a nut on a
 bolt and tighten them with a screwdriver and spanner just enough
 that they stay locked, but not so tightly that the thread is
 stripped or they cannot be unscrewed. On those occasions (usually
 during a party at your house) when the handbasin tap is closed so
 tightly that you cannot turn it back on, you know the last person
 to use the washroom never had a Meccano set.<br>
 <br>
 At no point do I ever remember taking religion very seriously or
 even feeling that the biblical stories were any different from
 fairy stories. Certainly none of it made any sense. By comparison
 the world in which I lived, though I might not always understand
 it in all aspects, always made a lot of sense. Nor did it make
 much sense that my friends were having a good time in a coffee
 bar on Saturday mornings while I was in schul singing in a
 language I could not understand. Once while my father and I were
 fasting, I remember my mother having some warm croissants - and
 did they smell good! I decided to have one too - ostensibly a
 heinous crime. I waited for a 10 ton "Monty Python" weight to
 fall on my head! It didn't. Some would see this lack of
 retribution as proof of a merciful God (or that I was not really
 Jewish because my mother wasn't), but I drew the logical (Occam's
 razor) conclusion that there was "nothing" there. There are
 serious problems confronting society and a "humanitarian" God
 would not have allowed the unaccountable atrocities carried out
 in the name of any philosophy, religious or otherwise, to happen
 to anyone let alone to his/her/its chosen people. The desperate
 need we have for such organisations as Amnesty International has
 become, for me, one of the pieces of incontrovertible evidence
 that no divine (<i>mystical</i>) creator (other than the simple
 Laws of Nature) exists.<br>
 <br>
 The illogical excuses, involving concepts such as free will(!),
 convoluted into confusing arguments by clerics and other
 self-appointed guardians of universal morality, have always
 seemed to me to be just so much fancy (or actually clumsy)
 footwork devised to explain why the fascinating and beautifully
 elegant world I live in operates exactly the way one would expect
 it to in the absence of a mystical power. Of course the excuses
 have been honed and polished over millennia to retain a hold over
 those unwilling or unable to accept that, as a Croatian friend of
 mine once neatly put it, "When you've had it you've had
 it".<br>
 <br>
 The humanitarian philosophies that have been developed (sometimes
 under some religious banner and invariably in the face of
 religious opposition) are human inventions, as the name implies -
 and our species deserves the credit. I am a devout atheist -
 nothing else makes any sense to me and I must admit to being
 bewildered by those, who in the face of what appears so obvious,
 still believe in a mystical creator. However I can see that the
 promise of infinite immortality is a more palatable proposition
 than the absolute certainty of finite mortality which those of us
 who are subject to free thought (as opposed to free will) have to
 look forward to and many may not have the strength of character
 to accept it.<br>
 <br>
 <i>[After all this, I have ended up a supporter of ideologies
 which advocate the right of the individual to speak, think and
 write in freedom and safety (surely the bedrock of a civilised
 society). I have very serious personal problems when confronted
 by individuals, organisations and regimes which do not accept
 that these freedoms are fundamental human rights. I feel one must
 oppose those who claim that the "good" of the community must come
 before that of the individual - this claim is invariably used to
 justify oppression by the state. Furthermore there has never been
 any consensus on what the "good" of the community actually
 consists of, whereas for individuals there is little difficulty.
 Thus I am a supporter of Amnesty International, a humanist and an
 atheist. I believe in a secular, democratic society in which
 women and men have total equality, and individuals can pursue
 their lives as they wish, free of constraints - religious or
 otherwise. I feel that the difficult ethical and social problems
 which invariably arise must be solved, as best they can, by
 discussion and am opposed to the crude simplistic application of
 dogmatic rules invented in past millennia and ascribed to a
 plethora of mystical creators - or the latest invention; a single
 creator masquerading under a plethora of pseudonyms.
 Organisations which seek political influence by co-ordinated
 effort disturb me and thus I believe religious and related
 pressure groups which operate in this way are acting
 antidemocratically and should play no part in politics. I also
 have problems with those who preach racist and related ideologies
 which seem almost indistinguishable from nationalism, patriotism
 and religious conviction.]</i><br>
 <br>
 My art teacher, Mr Higginson, would give me special tuition at
 lunch times or after school was over. My father made me finish
 all my homework and I had to stay up until it was not only
 complete but passed his inspection - midnight if necessary. As
 time progressed, for reasons which I am not sure I understand, I
 gravitated towards chemistry, physics and maths (in that order)
 and these became my specialist subjects in the 6th form. I was
 keen on sport, and in school I concentrated on gymnastics whilst
 outside school I played as much tennis as I could. I patterned my
 backhand (and my haircut) on that of Dick Savitt and my service
 on that of Neil Fraser. At one time I remember wanting to be
 Wimbledon champion but decided that this goal was going to be a
 bit hard to achieve as I seemed to be having too much difficulty
 winning.<br>
 <br>
 I started to develop an unhealthy interest in chemistry during
 enjoyable lessons with Dr. Wilf Jary who fascinated me most with
 his ability, when using a gas blowpipe to melt lead, to blow
 continuously without apparently stopping to breath in. I, like
 almost all chemists I know, was also attracted by the smells and
 bangs that endowed chemistry with that slight but charismatic
 element of danger which is now banned from the classroom. I agree
 with those of us who feel that the wimpish chemistry training
 that schools are now forced to adopt is one possible reason that
 chemistry is no longer attracting as many talented and
 adventurous youngsters as it once did. If the decline in hands-on
 science education is not redressed, I doubt that we shall survive
 the 21st century. I became ever more fascinated by chemistry -
 particularly organic chemistry - and was encouraged by the sixth
 form chemistry teacher (Harry Heaney, now Professor at Loughborough) to go
 to. Sheffield
 University because he reckoned it had, at the time, the best
 chemistry department in the UK (and perhaps anywhere) - a
 friendly interview with the amazing Tommy Stephens (compared with
 a most forbidding experience at Nottingham) settled it.<br>
 <br>
 I was born during the war so I just escaped military service. As
 all the normal places at Oxbridge were already assigned for the
 next two years to reemerging national servicemen, I needed to
 achieve scholarship level to get to Cambridge. This
 turned out to be a bit difficult as I had been assigned a college
 with an examination syllabus orthogonal to the one that I had
 studied. Ian McKellen, the actor, who was in the same year at
 school, only seems to have needed to remember his lines from his
 part as Henry V in the school play!<br>
 <br>
 The first day that I arrived in Sheffield, I walked past a
 building which had a nameplate saying it was the Department of
 Architecture and was bemused - did people do that at University?
 I had somehow missed this possibility because general careers
 advice was non-existent at that time. With hindsight I am sure
 that with the advice available today I would have done something
 like architecture which would have conflated my art and
 technology interests. At Sheffield I did as much as I could.
 Initially I lived with a family in Hillsborough, near to the
 Sheffield Wednesday football ground and occasionally watched them
 - very occasionally as I am a Bolton Wanderers supporter. I
 played as much tennis as I could which helped to get me a room in
 a hall of residence (Crewe Hall). I played for the university
 tennis team and we got to the UAU (Universities Athletics Union)
 final twice - the team would probably have been champions without
 me - which they were in 1964. I wanted to continue with some form
 of art, which was really my passion, and became art editor of
 "Arrows" (the student magazine which we published each term),
 specialising in designing the magazine's covers and the
 screenprinted advertising posters. Whilst a research student I
 won a <i>Sunday Times</i> bookjacket design competition - the
 first important (national) prize I was to get for a very long
 time. Later my cover design for the departmental teaching and
 research brochure <i>"Chemistry at Sussex"</i> was featured in
 "Modern Publicity" (an international annual of the best in
 professional graphic design) - I consider this to be one of my
 best publications.<br>
 <br>
 In the 1960s almost everybody could play the guitar well enough
 to play and sing two or three songs at a party so I had a go at
 that too and learned just enough chords (about half-a-dozen) to
 play some simple songs at local student folk clubs. I also
 decided that I should do some administration in the Students'
 Union and from secretary of the tennis team I somehow ended up as
 President of the Athletics Council. During my last year at
 University (1963-64) I spent some 2-3 hours of each day attending
 to administration in the sports office in the Union. That year's
 involvement in embryonic politics was enough to last a lifetime.
 I managed to do enough chemistry in between the tennis, some
 snooker and football, designing covers and posters for "Arrows",
 painting murals as backdrops for balls and trying to play the
 guitar, to get a first class honours BSc degree (1958-61) and a
 PhD (1961-64) as well as some job offers. I also got
 married.<br>
 <br>
 I had been keen on organic chemistry when I arrived at Sussex (at
 the behest of Harry Heaney I had bought Fieser and Fieser's
 Organic Chemistry and read much of it while at school - it was a
 good read), but as the university course progressed I started to
 get interested in quantum mechanics and when I was introduced to
 spectroscopy (by Richard Dixon, who was to become Professor at
 Bristol) I
 was hooked. It was fascinating to see spectroscopic band patterns
 which showed that molecules could count. I had a problem as I
 really liked organic chemistry (I guess I really liked drawing
 hexagons) but in the end I decided to do a PhD in the
 Spectroscopy of Free Radicals produced by Flash Photolysis - with
 Richard Dixon. George Porter was Professor of Physical Chemistry
 at that time so there was a lot of flashing going on at
 Sheffield.<br>
 <br>
 In 1964 I had several job offers but Marg(aret) and I decided
 that we wanted to live abroad for a while and Richard Dixon had
 inveigled an attractive offer of a postdoctoral position for me
 from Don Ramsay at the National Research Council in Ottawa. In
 1964 Marg and I left Liverpool, on the Empress of Canada, for
 Montreal and then went on to Ottawa by train. I arrived at the
 famous No. 100, Sussex Drive, NRC, Ottawa, where <a href=
 "../1971/index.html">Gerhard Herzberg</a> (GH) had created the
 mecca of spectroscopy with his colleagues Alec Douglas, Cec
 Costain, Don Ramsay, Boris Stoicheff and others. At the time NRC
 was the only national research facility worldwide that was
 recognised as a genuine success. I suspect that this was because
 the legendary Steacie had left researchers to do the science they
 wanted; now unfortunately - as almost everywhere else -
 administrators decide what should be done. I remember easily
 making friends with all the other postdocs who congregated each
 morning and afternoon in the historical room 1057 - the
 spectroscopy tea/coffee area. The atmosphere was, in retrospect,
 quite exhilarating and many there, including: Reg Colin, Cec
 Costain, Fokke Creutzberg, Alec Douglas, Werner Goetz, Jon
 Hougen, Takeshi Oka and Jim Watson and their families became our
 lifelong close friends. As I look back I realise that Cec
 Costain, Jon Hougen, Takeshi Oka and Jim Watson were to exert
 enormous direct and indirect influence on my scientific
 development. I gradually learned to recognise who was good at
 what and what (if anything) I was good at. To paraphrase Clint
 Eastwood "A (scientist's) gotta know his limitations"- and in
 this somewhat daunting company I learned mine. Although I knew
 that my level of knowledge and understanding was limited when I
 arrived, I was never made to feel inferior. This encouraging
 atmosphere was, in my opinion, the most important quality of the
 laboratory and permeated down directly from GH, Alec and Cec - it
 was a fantastic, free environment. The philosophy seemed to be to
 make state-of-the-art equipment available and let budding young
 scientists loose to do almost whatever they wanted. Present
 research funding policies appear to me to be opposed to this type
 of intellectual environment. I have severe doubts about policies
 (in the UK and elsewhere) which concentrate on "relevance" and
 fund only those with foresight when it is obvious that many
 (including me) haven't got much. There are as many ways to do
 science as there are scientists and thus when funds are scarce
 good scientists have to be supported even if they do not know
 where their studies are leading. Though it seems obvious (at
 least to me) that unexpected discoveries must be intrinsically
 more important than predictable (applied) advances it is now more
 difficult than ever before to obtain support for more
 non-strategic research.<br>
 <br>
 In 1965 after a further year of flash photolysis/spectroscopy in
 Don Ramsay's laboratory, where I discovered a singlet-singlet
 electronic transition of the NCN radical and worked on pyridine
 which turned out to have a nonplanar excited state (still to be
 fully published!), I transferred to Cec Costain's laboratory
 because I had developed a fascination for microwave spectroscopy.
 There I worked on the rotational spectrum of NCN3. Sometimes
 Takeshi Oka would be on the next spectrometer-working next to
 someone with such an exceptional blend of theoretical and
 experimental expertise did not help to alleviate the occasional
 sense of inadequacy. I really learned quantum mechanics (as did
 we all) from an intensive course that Jon Hougen gave at Carleton
 University. Whenever I was in difficulty theoretically (which
 was most of the time) Jim Watson helped me out - when he was not
 busy helping everyone else out. Gradually I realised that many in
 the field were stronger at physics than chemistry and in
 retrospect I subconsciously recognised that there might be a
 niche for me in spectroscopy research if I could exploit my
 relatively strong chemistry background.<br>
 <br>
 In 1966, after two years at NRC, John Murrell (who had taught me
 quantum chemistry at Sheffield) offered me a postdoctoral
 position at Sussex. We were quite keen to live in the US,
 however, and I managed to get a postdoctoral position at Bell
 Labs (Murray Hill) with Yoh Han Pao (later Professor at Case Western) to carry
 out studies of liquid phase interactions by laser Raman
 spectroscopy. David Santry (now Professor at McMaster) was also
 working with Yoh Han at that time and each evening Dave and I
 carried out CNDO theoretical calculations on the electronic
 transitions of small molecules and radicals. I learned
 programming (Fortran) from Dave who threw me in at the deep end
 by showing me how to modify and correct the programs and then
 left me to see if I could do it myself.<br>
 <br>
 During the year I received another letter from John Murrell to
 say that the position that had been available at Sussex the
 previous year was still available but would not be so for much
 longer. Thus Marg, Stephen (who had been born in Ottawa) and I
 came back to the UK- my annual salary dropped from $14000 to 1400
 pounds, ouch! Marg had to find part-time employment as soon as
 possible although pregnant with our second son, David (we were
 poorer - but we were happier .... ! ! ! ). I was just about to
 start writing off for some positions back in the US and had just
 located the address of Buckminster Fuller's research group (I was
 interested in the way that predesigned urban sub-structures might
 be welded into an efficient large urban complex) when John
 Murrell offered me a permanent lectureship at Sussex which I
 accepted.<br>
 <br>
 I remember thinking I would give myself five years to make a go
 of research and teaching and if it was not working out I would
 re-train to do graphic design (my first love) or go into
 scientific educational TV (I had had an interview with the BBC
 before we went to Canada). I started to build up a microwave
 laboratory to probe unstable molecules and Michael Lappert
 encouraged me to use his photoelectron spectrometer to carry out
 work independently.<br>
 <br>
 By 1970 I had carried out research in the electronic spectroscopy
 of gas phase free radicals and rotational microwave spectroscopy,
 I had built He-Ne and argon ion lasers to study intermolecular
 interactions in liquids, carried out theoretical calculations and
 learned to write programs. At Sussex I carried on liquid phase
 Raman studies, rebuilt a flash photolysis machine and built a
 microwave spectrometer and started to do photoelectron
 spectroscopy. I had applied for a Hewlett Packard microwave
 spectrometer and SERC, in its infinite wisdom, decided to place
 the equipment at Reading (where my co-applicant, a theoretician
 (!), worked) so requiring me and my group (the experimentalists)
 to travel each month to Reading to make our measurements! However
 by 1974, after three further attempts to get my own spectrometer
 (with help in consolidating my proposal from David Whiffen), the
 SERC finally gave in and I got one of my own at Sussex. The first
 molecule we studied was the carbon chain species HC<sub>5</sub>N
 - to which the start of my role in the discovery of
 C<sub>60</sub> can be traced directly.<br>
 <br>
 The discovery of C<sub>60</sub> in 1985 caused me to shelve my
 dream of setting up a studio specialising in scientific graphic
 design (I had been doing graphics semiprofessionally for years
 and it was clear that the computer was starting to develop real
 potential as an artistically creative device). That was the
 downside of our discovery. I decided to probe the consequences of
 the C<sub>60</sub> concept. In 1990 when the material was finally
 extracted by Kr&auml;tschmer, Lamb, Fostiropoulos and Huffman, I
 and my colleagues Roger Taylor and David Walton, decided to
 exploit the synthetic chemistry and materials science
 implications. I began to realise that I might never fulfill my
 graphics aspirations. In 1991 I was fortunate enough to be
 awarded a Royal Society Research Professorship which enables me
 to concentrate on research by allowing me to do essentially no
 teaching. However I like teaching so I continue to do some. I
 have discovered that since I stopped teaching 1st and 2nd-year
 students, home-grown graduate students are few and far
 between.<br>
 <br>
 In 1995, together with Patrick Reams a BBC producer, I
 inaugurated the Vega Science Trust to create science films of
 sufficiently high quality for network television broadcast (BBC2
 and BBC Prime). Our films not only reflect the excitement of
 scientific discovery but also the intrinsic concepts and
 principles without which fundamental understanding is impossible.
 The Trust also seeks to preserve our scientific cultural heritage
 by recording scientists who have not only made outstanding
 contributions but also are outstanding communicators. The trust,
 whose activities are coordinated by Gill Watson, has now made
 some 20 films of Royal Institution (London) Discourses archival
 programmes and interviews.<br>
 <br>
 I have been asked many questions about our Nobel Prize and have
 many conflicting thoughts about it. I have particular regrets
 about the fact that the contributions of our student co-workers
 Jim Heath, and Sean O'Brien as well as Yuan Liu receive such
 disparate recognition relative to that accorded to ours (e.g.
 Bob, Rick and me). I also have regrets with regard to the general
 recognition accorded to the amazing breakthrough that Wolfgang
 Kr&auml;tschmer and Don Huffman made with their students Kostas
 Fostiropoulos and Lowell Lamb in extracting C<sub>60</sub> using
 the carbon arc technique and which did so much to ignite the
 explosive growth of Fullerene Science. I have heard some
 scientists say that young scientists need prizes such as the
 Nobel Prize as an incentive. Maybe some do, but I don't. I never
 dreamed of winning the Nobel Prize - indeed I was very happy with
 my scientific work prior to the discovery of C<sub>60</sub> in
 1985. The creation of the first molecules with carbon/phosphorus
 double bonds and the discovery of the carbon chains in space
 seemed (to me) like nice contributions and even if I did not do
 anything else as significant I would have felt quite successful
 as a scientist. A youngster recently asked what advice I would
 give to a child who wanted to be where I am now. One thing I
 would not advise is to do science with the aim of winning any
 prizes let alone the Nobel Prize that seems like a recipe for
 eventual disillusionment for a lot of people. [Over the years I
 have given many lectures for public understanding of science and
 some of my greatest satisfaction has come in conversations with
 school children, teachers, lay people, retired research workers
 who have often exhibited a fascination for science as a cultural
 activity and a deep and understanding of the way nature works.] I
 believe competition is to be avoided as much as possible. In fact
 this view applies to any interest - I thus have a problem with
 sport which is inherently competitive. My advice is to do
 something which interests you or which you enjoy (though I am not
 sure about the definition of enjoyment) and do it to the absolute
 best of your ability. If it interests you, however mundane it
 might seem on the surface, still explore it because something
 unexpected often turns up just when you least expect it. With
 this recipe, whatever your limitations, you will almost certainly
 still do better than anyone else. Having chosen something worth
 doing, <i>never give up and try not to let anyone down</i>.</p>
