  <h1>Alexei Abrikosov - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="abrikosov.jpg" class="bio-img">I 
              was born in 1928, June 25, in Moscow, USSR (now Russia). My parents 
              were physicians. I graduated from high school in 1943 and was accepted 
              as student of the Institute for Power Engineers. In 1945 I transferred 
              to the Physics Department of the Moscow State University, from which 
              I graduated in 1948 with a diploma (M.Sc. degree). After that I 
              was accepted, as a Postgraduate (Ph.D. student) to the Institute 
              for Physical Problems (now P.L. Kapitza Institute). My scientific 
              adviser was L.D. Landau. After I defended in 1951 a thesis on thermal 
              diffusion in completely and incompletely ionized plasmas, I got 
              the Candidate of Science (Ph.D.) degree and was taken to the staff 
              of the Institute, as Junior Scientist.</p>
            <p>In 1951&#8211;1952 I worked with the experimentalist 
              of the same institute, N.V. Zavaritskii on the experimental verification 
              of the predictions of the recently published Ginzburg-Landau theory 
              of superconductivity on the critical magnetic field of thin films. 
              This resulted in our discovery of the "superconductors of the second 
              group" (now <i>Type II superconductors</i>). After that I started 
              to work on the magnetic properties of bulk Type II superconductors, 
              and came to the conclusion that the transition from superconducting 
              to the normal state happens gradually in increasing field with two 
              limiting critical fields. Between these two values the field gradually 
              penetrates the superconductor forming thin threads of magnetic flux 
              surrounded by vortex currents. The array of these quantum vortices 
              forms a regular structure (now referred in the literature, as <i>Abrikosov 
              vortex lattice</i>). I compared my results with the magnetization 
              curves obtained experimentally in the 1930s for superconducting 
              alloys, and there was a perfect fit. The experimentalist explained 
              their data, as due to inhomogenity of their samples. My paper was 
              published in 1957 but the experimentalists accepted the vortex lattice 
              only 10 years later, after it was demonstrated by decoration experiments.</p>

            <p>In the middle of 1950s I worked also on the 
              transition from the insulating molecular phase into the atomic metallic 
              phase in hydrogen and on the structure of hydrogen planets. Another 
              my topic was quantum electrodynamics at high energies. The latter 
              works became my Doctor of Science thesis (this degree is similar 
              to Habilitation in Germany), which I defended in 1955.</p>
            <p>In the end of 1950s &#8211; beginning of 1960s we 
              worked with L. Gor'kov on the microscopic theory of superconductivity. 
              We constructed the theory of superconductors in a high-frequency 
              field (with I.M. Khalatnikov) and the theory of superconductors 
              with magnetic impurities, where we discovered the possibility of 
              the so-called <i>gapless superconductivity</i>. We also solved the 
              mystery of the finite Knight shift at zero temperature, taking into 
              account the spin-orbit scattering. Simultaneously we worked with 
              I.M. Khalatnikov on the theory of nonsuperfluid He<sup>3</sup>: 
              thermodynamics, kinetics, sound dispersion, light and <font face="Symbol">g</font>-ray 
              scattering, etc. These works were based on the theory of a Fermiliquid 
              by L. Landau. I worked also during this time on the theory of strongly 
              compressed matter.</p>
            <p>In 1961 we published a book with L. Gor'kov and I. Dzyaloshinskii
"Quantum field theory methods in statistical physics". Originally written in
Russian, it was translated into English, German, Chinese, Japanese, and became
(and still is) the main textbook on the subject.</p>
            <p>In 1962&#8211;63 with my postgraduate L. Falkovsky 
              we constructed the theory of semimetals of the Bi type. These substances 
              have a very small number of charge carriers (in Bi ~ 10<sup>-5</sup> 
              per atom) and a very peculiar crystalline lattice differing from 
              a simple cubic lattice by two small deformations. The resulting 
              lattice has two atoms per unit cell, and in principle it could be 
              an insulator. However, a simple cubic lattice has one atom per unit 
              cell, and should be a "good" metal with the number of carriers of 
              the order of one per atom, and small deformations cannot transform 
              it into an insulator. This paradox can be resolved by constructing 
              an artificial phase, which at zero deformation has an energy higher 
              than a conventional metal but the energy decreases with deformation, 
              so that eventually this phase becomes energetically favorable. This 
              gives the opportunity to approach the (almost) insulating phase 
              continuously. In this series of papers the energy spectrum was calculated, 
              and the metalinsulator transition with the vanishing of the energy 
              gap was predicted. The infrared properties were analyzed and the 
              transparency thresholds in the frequency were established. All this 
              was confirmed by experiments.</p>
            <p>In 1962 our dear teacher, L.D. Landau, got in a car accident and suffered
heavy injuries. His life was saved but his brain was damaged, and he never returned
to science after that. He died in 1968 from remote consequences of
the accident. After the accident the attitude towards theorists at the Institute
for Physical Problems changed, and the Landau Group started to think about
leaving.</p>
            <p>In 1964 I was elected Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences,
USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1966 I was awarded the Lenin
Prize together with V.L. Ginzburg and L.P. Gor'kov "for the theory of superconductivity
in strong magnetic fields".</p>
            <p>In 1965 I became the head of the Condensed Matter 
              Theory Department in the newly organized Institute for Theoretical Physics (later 
              named L.D. Landau Institute). I was one of its organizers.</p>
            <p>In 1965&#8211;68 I published several papers 
              on the Kondo effect at low temperatures, where I established the 
              appearance of a resonance in the scattering amplitude of an electron 
              from a magnetic impurity atom (now <i>Abrikosov-Suhl resonance</i>).</p>
            <p>In 1971 I published a book &#8220;Introduction to the Theory of 
              Normal Metals&#8221;, which was translated into English. In 1972 I was awarded the International
              Fritz London Award for my works on low-temperature physics.</p>
            <p>In 1970&#8211;75 I constructed the theory of gapless semiconductors, 
              where I showed, that in substances of the type of HgTe, a strong interaction 
              region close to the band matching point exists where the dependencies of 
              various quantities on temperature and magnetic field are described by nontrivial
              power laws. At the same time I worked on the theory of an excitonic 
              transition in Bi in strong magnetic fields. The predictions were in complete 
              agreement with experimental data.</p>
            <p>In 1975 I was awarded the title Doctor of Sciences Honoris Causa 
              by the University of Lausanne (Switzerland).</p>
            <p>In 1977&#8211;81 with my postgraduate, I.A. 
              Ryzhkin we constructed the theory of one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional 
              metals. The main results were a) the probability distribution function 
              of resistivity of a one-dimensional wire, where due to mesoscopic 
              effects there was no self-averaging, and b) the conclusion that 
              suppression of superconductivity in (TMTSF)<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub> 
              by nonmagnetic defects was an evidence of triplet pairing. Later 
              this was confirmed. During the same years I worked on the theory 
              of spin-glasses with short-range interaction, including semiconductor-based 
              spin-glasses.</p>
            <p>In 1982 with a group of experimentalists I was awarded the State 
              Prize of USSR, for the works on semimetals and gapless semiconductors. In 
              1987 I was elected Full Member of the Academy of Sciences. In 1988 I published 
              the book &#8220;Fundamentals of the Theory of Metals&#8221; on which 
              I worked three years. It was translated into English and Japanese. The same year I was 
              elected Director of the High Pressure Physics Institute in Troitsk, Moscow 
              District. In 1989 L. Gor&#8217;kov, I. Dzyaloshinskii and myself were awarded 
              the L.D. Landau award of the Academy of Sciences, USSR, for our book &#8220;Field 
              Theory Methods in Statistical Physics&#8221;.</p>
            <p>In 1991 I accepted the offer of the Argonne National Laboratory, 
              USA, and became Distinguished Argonne Scientist. Since then I continue to 
              work at the same position. In the same year, together with V.L. Ginzburg and 
              L.P. Gor&#8217;kov I was awarded the International John Bardeen Award 
              and was elected as Foreign Honorary Member to the American Academy of Arts and
              Sciences. In 1992 I was elected Fellow of the American Physical 
              Society.</p>
            <p>Being at Argonne I became interested by the 
              high-T<sub>c</sub> layered cuprates. This interest resulted in a 
              theory which was based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach 
              but took into account the specific features of the electron spectrum, 
              namely the quasi-two-dimensionality and the existence of the &#8220;extended 
              saddle point singularities&#8221;, or &#8220;flat regions&#8221;, 
              which made the motion of quasiparticles in some regions of the Fermi 
              surface quasi-one-dimensional. At the same time these regions had 
              the maximal density of states. Another idea was the resonant tunneling 
              mechanism of the electron transport between the CuO<sub>2</sub> 
              planes. On the basis of these ideas I was able to explain almost 
              all the unusual behavior of the high-T<sub>c</sub> layered cuprates, 
              including the isotope effect, neutron scattering, pseudogap and 
              the metal-insulator transition.</p>
            <p>In 1998 in connection with the experiments performed 
              at Argonne and the University of Chicago I introduced a new phenomenon: 
              <i>&#8220;Quantum Linear Magnetoresistance&#8221;</i>. The analysis 
              of experimental data showed that it was first discovered experimentally 
              by Piotr Kapitza, as early as 1928, but was confused with a different 
              phenomenon. During these years in connection with experiments I 
              studied also the effects of quantum interference on the magnetoresistance 
              of layered substances and constructed a theory of an s-type superconductivity 
              in UGe<sub>2</sub>.</p>
            <p>In 1999 I became a naturalized US citizen. In 2000 I was elected 
              member of the National Academy of Sciences USA, and in 2001, as Foreign Member 
              of the Royal Society of London, UK. In 2003 I received the title Doctor 
              of Sciences Honoris Causa from the University of Bordeaux (France) 
              and together with V. Ginzburg and A. Leggett was awarded the Nobel Prize in
              Physics &#8220;for pioneering work on the theory of superconductivity 
              and super-fluidity&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Apart from research, almost all my life I was teaching. First I 
              was assistant, associated, full Professor at the Moscow State University, 1950&#8211;1969, 
              then Professor at the Gorky (now Nizhniy Novgorod) University, 1970&#8211;72, 
              and eventually Chair for theoretical physics at the Moscow Institute 
              for Steel and Alloys (Technical University), 1976&#8211;1991. In USA I am Adjunct 
              Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Utah. 
              In addition I am a Leverhulm Adjunct Professor at the University of Loughborough, 
              UK.</p>
            <p>I am married and have two sons and one daughter.</p>
