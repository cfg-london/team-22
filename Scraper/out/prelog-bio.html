  <h1>Vladimir Prelog - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="prelog.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  July 23rd, 1906 in Sarajevo in the province of Bosnia, which then
  belonged to the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy and later, in 1918,
  became part of Yugoslavia. In the western world my birthplace has
  a somewhat sinister reputation that was characterized by an older
  tax-inspector in the Midwest of America as "the place where all
  that mess started". Actually, as an 8 years old boy I stood near
  to the spot where Archiduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were
  assassinated. At the beginning of the first World War, in 1915,
  we moved to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where I attended the
  gymnasium. The period 1924 to 1929 was spent studying Chemistry
  at the Czech
  Institute of Technology in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The
  supervisor of my thesis was Professor Emil Votocek, one of the
  prominent founders of chemical research in Czechoslovakia. My
  mentor, however, was Rudolf Lukes, then lecturer and later
  successor of Votocek to the chair of organic chemistry. To Lukes
  I owe the greatest part of my early scientific education, and he
  remained my close friend until his premature death in 1960. In
  addition to these two "real" teachers I admired <a href=
  "../1947/index.html">Robert Robinson</a>, Christopher Ingold and
  <a href="../1939/index.html">Leopold Ruzicka</a>, all of whom I
  considered as my "imaginary" teachers. In later years I was
  fortunate to become well acquainted with all three of these great
  chemists.<br>
  <br>
  The close of my studies with a degree of a Dr. Ing. in 1929
  coincided with the great economic crisis, and I was not able to
  find an academic position. I was therefore very grateful for a
  position in the newly created laboratory of G.J. Dr&iacute;za in
  Prague where rare chemicals were produced on small scale. I had
  there also a modest opportunity to do some research, but I badly
  wanted to work in an academic environment. This is why I was so
  eager to accept the position of a lecturer at the University of
  Zagreb in 1935. I did not know that I had to fulfil there all
  the duties of a full professor and to live on a salary of an
  underpaid assistant, but it would probably not have affected my
  decision if I had known. With the help of a couple of
  enthusiastic young co-workers and of a developing small
  pharmaceutical factory, I had just managed to solve at least the
  most urgent problems for myself and my laboratory when the second
  World War broke out. After the German occupation of Zagreb in
  1941 it became clear that I was likely to get into serious
  trouble if I remained there. At this critical point I received an
  invitation of <a href="../1938/index.html">Richard Kuhn</a> to
  give some lectures in Germany, and shortly afterwards Leopold
  Ruzicka, whom I had asked for help, invited me to visit him on
  the way. With these two invitations, it was possible for me to
  escape with my wife to Switzerland. Through Ruzicka I soon
  obtained generous support of CIBA Ltd. and started work in the
  Organic Chemistry Laboratory at the Federal Institute of
  Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The cooperation with Ruzicka
  lasted many years and enabled me to make my slow progress up the
  academic hierarchical ladder. Starting as assistant, I became
  "Privat Dozent", "Titularprofessor" associate
  (ausserordentlicher) professor and in 1952 full professor ad
  personam. Finally, in 1957, I succeeded Ruzicka as head of the
  Laboratory, a height that I never dreamt of when I was a student
  in Prague. In becoming director of the Laboratory I reached,
  according to Peter's principle, the level of my incompetence and
  I tried hard for several years to step down. Surrounded and
  supported by a group of very able young colleagues, I finally
  succeeded in introducing a rotating chairmanship from which I was
  exempted. So far this has worked very satisfactorily and it may
  have helped some of my colleagues to resist tempting offers from
  other Universities.<br>
  <br>
  My main interests were natural compounds, from adamantane and
  aialoids to rifamycins and boromycin. During the work on natural
  compounds stereochemical problems emerged from all sides. As E.L.
  Eliel pointed out, stereochemistry is not so much a branch of
  chemistry but rather a way of looking at chemistry. It was, and
  still is, great fun trying to find new points of view for
  it.<br>
  <br>
  I travel a lot. Recently I counted that I have given lectures in
  more than 150 places, often several times. This in spite of the
  fact that I do not speak any language properly. I suspect that
  many people come to my lectures because they enjoy my strange
  accent and skill in managing without actually cheating.<br>
  <br>
  I married my wife Kamila in Prague in 1933. A son Jan was born to
  us in Z&uuml;rich in 1949.<br>
  <br>
  For many years, when still a Yugoslav citizen, I was already a
  Swiss patriot and in 1959 I obtained Swiss citizenship. However,
  I consider myself a world citizen and I am very grateful to my
  adopted country that it allows me to be one.<br>
  <br>
  The way from Sarajevo to Stockholm is a long one and I am fully
  aware that I have been very lucky to arrive there. The journey
  could not have been made without the generous help of friends,
  colleagues, co-workers and also of innumerable earlier chemists
  "on whose shoulders we stand".</p>
