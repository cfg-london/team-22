  <h1>Paul Karrer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="karrer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Paul Karrer</b> was born in Moscow on
  April 21, 1889. His parents, Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch, were
  Swiss nationals and in 1892 the family returned to Switzerland
  where he received his early education at Wildegg and at the
  grammar school in Lenzburg, Aarau, where he matriculated in 1908.
  He studied chemistry at University of
  Zurich under Professor <a href="../1913/index.html">Alfred
  Werner</a> and after gaining his Ph.D. in 1911, he spent a
  further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute. In 1912 he
  took a post as chemist with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/index.html">Paul Ehrlich</a> at the
  Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt-am-Main; he left Frankfurt six years
  later on his election as reader at University of Zurich. In 1919
  he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical
  Institute.<br>
  <br>
  His early researches involved the preparation and investigation
  into the properties of complex metal compounds but his most
  important work has concerned plant pigments, particularly the
  yellow carotenoids. He was responsible for elucidating the
  chemical structure of the carotenoids and he also showed that
  some of these substances are transformed in the animal body into
  vitamin A. His work in this field led, in 1930, to the
  establishment of the correct constitutional formula for
  <font face="Symbol">b</font>-carotene, the chief precursor of
  vitamin A; this, the first time that the structure of a vitamin
  or provitamin had been established, in turn led to the
  clarification of the structure of vitamin A itself. Later, he
  confirmed the structure ascribed to ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/index.html">Albert von
  Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi</a> and he extended his researches into the
  vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and E fields. His important contributions
  to the chemistry of the flavins led to identification of
  lactoflavin as part of the complex originally thought to be
  vitamin B<sub>2</sub>.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Karrer has published over 1,000 scientific papers in
  the various fields of organic chemistry, especially concerning
  vitamins A, B<sub>2</sub>, C, E and K, co-enzymes, carotenoids
  and other plant pigments, curare and other alkaloids, amino
  acids, carbohydrates and organo-arsenic compounds. His
  <i>Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie</i> (1930) has passed through
  13 editions and has been translated in full into English,
  Italian, Spanish, French, Polish and Japanese. His monograph on
  carotenoids (1948) has also been translated into English.<br>
  <br>
  Karrer was President of the 14th International Congress on Pure
  and Applied Chemistry (Zurich, 1955). He has received honorary
  doctorate degrees from universities in Europe and America; they
  include Dr.med. Basle, Breslau, Lausanne and Zurich; Ph.D. Lyons, Paris, Sofia,
  London, Turin,
  Brussels and
  Rio de Janeiro;
  and Dr.Pharm. Madrid and Strasbourg. He has been awarded the
  Marcel Benoist Prize and the Cannizzaro Prize and he is a full
  member or honorary, corresponding or associate member of numerous
  chemical and biochemical societies throughout the world. These
  include the Academie des Sciences (Paris); the Royal Society
  (London); National
  Academy of Science (Washington); <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/karrer-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/" target="_blank">Royal Academy of Sciences (Stockholm)</a>; the
  National Academy (Rome); Royal Academy of Belgium; the Indian
  Academy of Science; the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences,
  and the Chemical Societies of Britain, France, Germany, Belgium,
  India and Austria.<br>

  Karrer married Helena Froelich in 1914. They have two sons.</p>
