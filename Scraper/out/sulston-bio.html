  <h1>John E. Sulston - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sulston.jpg" class="bio-img">On my mother's side
  I come from Midlands engineers and on my father's from tenant
  farmers near Oxford. As far back as I remember, and earlier, I
  was an artisan, a maker and doer. Mechanically minded, my parents
  said.</p>

  <p>Ted, my father, was an Anglican priest;
  after serving as an army chaplain in the second world war he
  joined the missionary society SPG (later USPG) and spent his life
  as an administrator, though he was active in the local parish at
  weekends. He had a great interest in the natural world, and was a
  keen gardener. When young I was mainly interested in the physical
  world, especially anything to do with electricity, but I think
  something of his love for living things may have rubbed off on
  me. He brought me up as a Christian, and it was a source of
  distress to him that I lost my faith, as they say, during my
  adolescence. That was a hard struggle, one of the hardest I've
  had. When I tried to talk to my fellow students about it at
  Cambridge I
  found them uncomprehending, not seeing it as very important in
  the scheme of things: but I had had to choose between my
  judgement and my father. It was a slight worry to me that our
  children were raised faithless - not prohibited, just not
  encouraged - in case the religious upbringing was essential to
  their moral development. Great relief that they've got on fine!
  Daphne said don't be silly, and of course she was right.</p>

  <p>Muriel, my mother, was my main confidant.
  She was a teacher of English at Watford grammar school, but took
  a break while my sister Madeleine and I were children. She held
  court in the kitchen, and we talked about everything. Questions,
  help with homework. She was more subtle than my father, and it
  was only after her death that I opened a letter from her and
  realised that she too desperately wanted me to have continued in
  the Christian faith.</p>

  <p>From them both I gained a sense that there
  is not, or need not be, any clear distinction between work and
  play, and that one has a duty both to serve others and to do the
  best one can in everything.</p>

  <p>They believed in private education, and at
  five I was sent to the local preparatory school. It was just
  round the corner. The classroom work was easy enough and I got on
  well with that, but I absolutely loathed games at which I was
  hopeless. Whether it was eyesight, reflexes or just daydreaming I
  don't know, but it just didn't turn out well. Cricket was the
  worst because it went on so long, on beautiful summer afternoons
  when there were so many better things to do. Once we had catching
  practice and the ball hit me in the forehead because I was
  thinking about something else to pass the time. It knocked me
  over and there was some concern about safety - rather
  embarrassing for my teacher.</p>

  <p>From there I got a scholarship to Merchant
  Taylors at Northwood, which was a financial relief for my
  parents, who were not particularly well off. I could have gone to
  a grammar school like Madeleine, but I'm ashamed to say that
  there was the sense that the boy had to have the "best". One
  can't blame them too much - that was the tenor of the age. School
  gradually became more interesting because I was able to
  specialise in science. Games continued to be a nightmare for a
  while, but that gradually faded as I realised that one didn't
  have to take them seriously and began to discover the joy of hill
  walking on my own.</p>

  <p>When it came to choice of subjects, science
  was obvious - since I was uninterested in anything else - but a
  decision that caused consternation in some eyes was my demand to
  take biology for A-level. I was told that this was not sensible
  at all and would lower my chances, upon which what had initially
  been more or less a whim on my part hardened into determination.
  So biology, physics and chemistry it was, with maths abandoned.
  Not sensible at all, but I had tremendous fun dissecting animals
  and sectioning plants and wondering about their workings. This
  was the late 50's, and the molecular biology revolution was
  getting under way with reports from the front starting to trickle
  back to us. And we had great support: my enthusiastic zoology
  teacher, Richard Stokes, wrote to me regularly until his death
  last year.</p>

  <p>In 1960 I arrived in Cambridge, with a
  scholarship to read Natural Sciences at Pembroke College.
  The first year was easy because those of us with scholarships had
  a head start, but the second year was a grind. I wasn't enjoying
  my course work much, because biology wasn't fulfilling its
  promise, and anyway I'm not a books person but a hands person,
  but mainly because by then I had become distracted by other
  activities, especially theatre lighting at the ADC. Meredith
  Dewey, my tutor, warned me that those who went into the theatre
  seldom did well at anything else, but of course that was of no
  great concern to me. I also became fairly depressed at my lack of
  social graces and everything seemed pretty pointless. It
  culminated in a night of drunken disorder that ended in the
  police station, and poor Meredith was hauled out to retrieve me.
  Covered in shame, I felt nobody would ever speak to me again. Of
  course my misdemeanour was hardly noticed, but it did have the
  effect of motivating me to make some sort of effort in my final
  year. I plumped for organic chemistry, reasoning that at least I
  could get a job with it, found it interesting because of my
  sparky supervisor Ian Fleming, and ended up with a 2.1, though
  without tremendous enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>My only attempt at job-seeking had been an
  application to VSO, and I was actually expecting to join a scheme
  that summer. However it fell through at the last moment, and so
  with my 2.1 in hand I went along to see <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1957/index.html">Alexander Todd</a> at the
  chemistry department in Lensfield Road, on the off chance of
  being taken on as a research student. To my amazement I was taken
  on immediately and handed over to Colin Reese, who put me to work
  on his research into oligonucleotide synthesis.</p>

  <p>And that was the beginning of my scientific
  career, if you can call it that. No more text books, just my own
  lab books, and the toys, the lovely toys, to play with. I was put
  in a large lab, sharing a long bench with Mike Tanner, swarthy
  and amiable. Life was simple, revolving largely around the lab
  and the Panton Arms where Iris Ambrose dispensed beer, egg on
  toast with beans (or sometimes as a variant beans on toast with
  egg), sympathy, and cashed our cheques.</p>

  <p>That first year my lodging was in a bedsit
  on the other side of town. For the second year I arranged with
  another research student Henry Chan to share a flat. We
  advertised for a third, and a geophysicist Bob Grasty replied.
  Most Tuesdays we shared a meal, to which Bob brought two women
  from his group - Monica Dirac and Daphne Bate. We were all very
  cheerful together, and when the year ended we seemed to
  disperse.</p>

  <p>But that autumn we went to London for Bob's
  wedding to his long standing girl friend Jenny. I sat behind
  Daphne, and she turned and smiled at me. I asked her if she
  wanted a lift home, and we haven't really been apart since. And
  Mike, Henry and Bob are our lifelong friends.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, thanks to Colin's efficient
  organisation and my love of playing with the toys, my labwork was
  trundling along nicely, and already it was time to be writing up
  and moving on. Colin suggested that I should take a post-doc
  position with Leslie Orgel at the Salk Institute, and Daphne agreed to get
  married. And so we whooshed away to California, where Daphne
  intended to get a job too but then found she was pregnant. So
  Ingrid was born there, and though at first we feared destitution
  it turned out to be idyllic. The lab was a great place, and we
  spent holidays travelling around the western states; shores,
  deserts, forests and mountains - an earthly utopia.</p>

  <p>With Leslie's prebiotic chemistry I felt I
  was beginning to get back towards biology. It was through the
  discussions there that I really grasped the power of evolution
  for the first time. And Leslie spoiled me terribly, frequently
  inviting us to dinner when he had visitors, and making me feel
  pretty important. I fear that I became rather obnoxious as a
  result. In my second year there Leslie introduced me to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick</a>, who
  interviewed me on behalf of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/index.html">Sydney Brenner</a>. All I
  really knew at the time was that Sydney had picked a small animal
  to study neurobiology. There were lots of jokes about Sydney's
  worm, and general scepticism about its chances of coming to
  anything. This seemed a pretty good recommendation to me: there's
  little point in doing what everybody else is doing. In fact,
  Leslie suggested that I could just go away for a year and then
  apply for a junior fellowship at the Salk Institute. The buzz
  word was neurobiology, and the place was full of meetings and
  discussion about this next step in molecular biology. One of the
  events was a summer programme run by Steve Kuffler and Ed
  Furshpan from Harvard Medical School, and I was invited to join
  in. They put me on to studying the formaldehyde-induced-
  fluorescence of catecholamines, a method for revealing these
  neurotransmitters in sections of frozen tissue. Although I was
  not deeply involved in their objectives, learning this technique
  was to make a difference in my life. In the spring of 1969 the
  three of us took our last holiday, swinging around Mexico and
  then departed on an extended break, travelling overland to the
  east coast via Florida and Canada. After the open spaces of
  America, southern England felt pretty cramped, but in no time we
  were settled again in Cambridge, I joined Sydney's group, and
  Adrian was born.</p>

  <p>The group was housed in the Cell Biology
  Division of the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of
  Molecular Biology in Cambridge, where so many of the basic
  mechanisms of molecular biology had been worked out: a rather
  awe-inspiring place to arrive as a junior staff member. Space was
  at a premium, as it is in any successful institute, and I ended
  up in the "big lab". Hugh Robertson, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1989/index.html">Sidney Altman</a> and Mary
  Osborn were all there. Next door was Mike Wilcox working on
  <i>Anabaena</i>, later switching to <i>Drosophila</i>. Our
  families became great friends, and we often shared weekend trips
  as the children grew up. His death from cancer in 1992 was a
  great loss.</p>

  <p>My first years there were devoted to
  exploring all manner of things to do with the worm: it was a
  largely virgin field, and so one didn't have to know much in
  advance. I worked on neurotransmitters, and, because of my
  background, I spent some time on the DNA using the global methods
  of hybridisation that were all we had available at the time.</p>

  <p>But as a side project I tried out the FIF
  method, and got it to work on the tiny cells of the worm. The
  neurons I discovered have not proved especially important in
  themselves, but they led me to start looking at the cellular
  anatomy as a whole. And so, quite by chance, I was the one who
  began to watch the cell divisions unfold. For a decade I became
  essentially a pure zoologist, and with several colleagues worked
  out the entire cell lineage of the animal. My key colleagues at
  this time were <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/index.html">Bob
  Horvitz</a> and John White, and after Bob returned to the US for
  a tenure track post at MIT I felt distinctly bereft. But there
  was Judith Kimble as my first post-doc, and <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/">Marty Chalfie</a> with
  Sydney, and Jonathan Hodgkin as Sydney's research student, so we
  continued as a vigorous little group. It suited me very well not
  to be in charge, so that I was free to go on playing. The LMB
  gave me a junior staff position, for which I am immensely
  grateful. To set up a formal research programme would have been
  impossible for me then.</p>

  <p>The last and most difficult stage of the
  cell lineage to be completed, that of the embryo, was an
  important accomplishment for me. It quickly secured my election
  to the Royal Society, proposed by Sydney, and is now a factor in
  bringing me to Stockholm. Later, better methods of observation
  were devised, which to some extent are superseding direct
  observation. Of course one has to begin somehow, and that
  beginning then stimulates the development of new approaches, so
  that what had been difficult becomes routine. I was lucky to have
  the chance to start it off.</p>

  <p>Another feature of the community that was
  instigated by Bob Edgar was the series of international worm
  meetings. The first was at Woods Hole in 1977, then it moved to
  Cold Spring Harbor, then to Madison. The meetings played a vital
  role in holding together and nurturing the growing <i>C.
  elegans</i> community, and for me they were particularly
  important when I moved on in 1982 to map and eventually sequence
  the worm's DNA. This was no longer to be a solitary endeavour for
  me. It began with new partnerships - Alan Coulson and Bob
  Waterston - and continued with an increasingly large group.</p>

  <p>The worm genome work was funded throughout
  by the Medical
  Research Council, but in 1992 the Wellcome Trust
  accepted a proposal for tackling the human genome and under
  Michael Morgan's management built a new laboratory, the Sanger Centre, to
  house worm, human and other projects. From then until I stepped
  down in 2000 I found myself to my astonishment being an actual
  director. Thanks to a close knit group of colleagues (Alan
  Coulson, Jane Rogers, Richard Durbin, David Bentley, Bart Barrell
  and Murray Cairns) we succeeded in our aims, and it all seems to
  have worked out well enough, but it was a strange time.</p>

  <p>The human sequence is being brought to
  completion this year through the international consortium of the
  human genome project. More than half the effort is in the US; the
  central management is there - initially under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Jim Watson</a>, then under
  Francis Collins from1992 - as are other leading figures including
  Bob Waterston, Eric Lander, Maynard Olson and Phil Green. Outside
  the US are several groups, including Jean Weissenbach in France,
  and others in Germany, Japan and China. Michael Morgan is a key
  organiser of the international aspects.</p>

  <p>It all took a lot of work, organisation,
  and of course money. Despite helping to set up the UK side of it,
  I didn't expect to be playing a visible role myself. But in 1999
  we were drawn into defending our position against a vigorous bid,
  by Celera Genomics, to take over the project for profit, and it
  fell to me to be a major UK spokesman.</p>

  <p>Having to deal with this extraordinary
  dispute, at what turned out to be a moderately unpleasant level
  of public acrimony, was quite a shock. It seemed to me
  self-evident that on both moral and practical grounds the human
  genome itself (as opposed to inventions that may be made from a
  knowledge of it) is an inappropriate subject for commercial
  investment and ownership. It was not just the commercial bid
  itself that shocked, what was worse was that it gained support
  from all sorts of people for whom I'd previously had respect. I
  still don't exactly know why, but part of the reason seems to be
  a business-style way in science nowadays of following bandwagons
  and avoiding controversy in case things turn out politically
  against you.</p>

  <p>During these events, I thought all the time
  that I would return to my lab bench once we'd got the episode
  over with. It had never been my ambition to run a large
  enterprise, and the thought of returning to play with the toys
  buoyed me along. Well, get over it we did - Celera collapsed, and
  the human, mouse and other genomes are firmly in the public
  domain. It's immensely exciting to reflect that the plan has
  worked out, and that all these sequences are quietly providing a
  new and firm foundation for biological research. But I found
  myself impelled further away from practical science rather than
  returning.</p>

  <p>First, I felt it important to write an
  account of what had happened. Other books had already been
  published, and more were to come, but all were written by
  journalists who drew on the press accounts, largely from the US
  where for no solid reason the balance of opinion had been in
  favour of the private effort. So I thought someone should provide
  an accurate record of events. Bob Waterston and I discussed
  writing something, but we were neither expert nor free enough to
  get it done in a reasonable time. So at Daphne's suggestion I got
  together with Georgina Ferry, a very accomplished science writer.
  I found it an enormously rewarding undertaking, and a wholly
  novel experience. Georgina drew on my email records, interviewed
  many people, and did the greater part of the actual writing, but
  I wrote some parts and we finished it off jointly, merging our
  ideas as we went (Sulston and Ferry, 2002).</p>

  <p>The exercise had a great influence on me,
  because it forced me to examine some of the premises under which
  I had been working all my life. Like many scientists I had felt
  that my job was to get on with my work, and leave the world to be
  run by politicians who have the skills and experience to do it
  properly. Indeed while writing these words I've had a
  conversation with a colleague who argued exactly that. She feels
  that to stray from one's expertise is to become second rate.</p>

  <p>However, it's become apparent to me that
  the problems that we encountered over the human genome are much
  more widespread than I had realised. The researchers at Oxfam, in
  particular, have educated me in the global consequences of
  ignoring common goods in the quest for short term profit. These
  issues are not simple, but I do think we would benefit from a
  greater and genuine involvement by us non-professionals in
  deciding the sort of world we want. Many people say: "Yes, I
  agree with you, but what can I do?". For me, it's been like
  climbing up from a valley and reaching a col: suddenly you can
  see new territories, stretching away into the distance, and you
  wonder.</p>

  <p>At present, of course, I'm indeed
  second-rate in these matters - an amateur. But one should not be
  afraid of being an amateur if one is willing also to be a
  student. Has my head been turned by the Nobel prize? No, this
  happened to me two years ago. But getting the prize provides us
  all with a higher platform from which (if we don't fall off
  through excessive gesticulation) we can have more influence than
  we did before. So it changes our lives.</p>

  <p>It remains for me to say thank you to my
  family for putting up with me, and for all the talking. Daphne
  retires this year from her duties as librarian at DAMTP. Through
  her I've had a lot of interaction with the staff there, and shall
  miss seeing them at parties. After taking her PhD at Berkeley Ingrid
  went into interactive museums. She lives in New York with her
  husband Paul Pavlidis, and son Micah. Adrian is in Edinburgh, and
  works in software. Madeleine worked for many years in the Gray
  Lab at Mount Vernon Hospital; now retired, she lives with her
  husband John Harvey near Lewes. We all met in Stockholm on 7
  December, and had a marvellous week together.</p>
