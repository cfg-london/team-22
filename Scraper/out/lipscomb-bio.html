  <h1>William Lipscomb - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lipscomb.jpg" class="bio-img">Although born
  in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, on December 9, 1919, I moved to Kentucky
  in 1920, and lived in Lexington through my university years.
  After my bachelors degree at the University of Kentucky, I entered graduate
  school at the California Institute of Technology in 1941, at first
  in physics. Under the influence of <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">Linus Pauling</a>, I returned to chemistry
  in early 1942. From then until the end of 1945 I was involved in
  research and development related to the war. After completion of
  the Ph.D., I joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1946, and moved to
  Harvard
  University in 1959. Harvard's recognitions include the Abbott
  and James Lawrence Professorship in 1971, and the George Ledlie
  Prize in 1971.<br>
  <br>
  The early research in borane chemistry is best summarized in my
  book "Boron Hydrides" (W.A. Benjamin, Inc., 1963), although most
  of this and late work is in several scientific journals. Since
  about 1960, my research interests have also been concerned with
  the relationship between three-dimensional structures of enzymes
  and how they catalyze reactions or how they are regulated by
  allosteric transformations.<br>
  <br>
  Besides memberships in various scientific societies, I have
  received the Bausch and Lomb honorary science award in 1937; and,
  from the American Chemical Society, the Award for Distinguished
  Service in the Advancement of Inorganic Chemistry, and the Peter
  Debye Award in Physical Chemistry. Local sections of this Society
  have given the Harrison Howe Award and Remsen Award. The
  University of Kentucky presented to me the Sullivan Medallion in
  1941, the Distinguished Alumni Centennial Award in 1965, and an
  honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1963. A Doctor Honoris Causa
  was awarded by the University of Munich in 1976. I am a member of the
  National Academy of
  Sciences U.S.A. and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a
  foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and
  Letters.<br>
  <br>
  My other activities include tennis and classical chamber music as
  a performing clarinetist.</p>
