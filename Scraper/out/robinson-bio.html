  <h1>Sir Robert Robinson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="robinson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Sir Robert Robinson</b> was
  born at Rufford, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire on September 13th,
  1886, the son of William Bradbury Robinson, a surgical dressing
  manufacturer who invented his own machines for the production of
  lint, bandages, etc., and the cardboard boxes for packaging them.
  He was educated at the Chesterfield Grammar School, Fulneck
  School, near Leeds, and at Manchester University where he graduated
  B.Sc. in 1906 and D.Sc. in 1910.<br>
  <br>
  In 1912, he was appointed the first Professor of Pure and Applied
  Organic Chemistry in the University of Sydney. He returned to Britain
  in 1915 to take the Chair in Organic Chemistry at the University of
  Liverpool until 1920 when he accepted an appointment as
  Director of Research at the British Dyestuffs Corporation. One
  year later, he became Professor of Chemistry at St. Andrews and in
  1922 he took the Chair in Organic Chemistry at Manchester
  University until 1928 when he accepted a similar post in the
  University of London. In 1930, he was appointed Waynflete
  Professor of Chemistry, Oxford University, where he remained until his
  retirement in 1955 when he was appointed Emeritus Professor and
  Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College. He has been a Director of
  the Shell Chemical Company and a chemical consultant since
  1955.<br>
  <br>
  Sir Robert has been a member of over thirty Government Committees
  and chairman of some of them. He was a United Kingdom delegate to
  the first Conference of UNESCO in 1947. He was knighted in 1939
  and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1949.<br>
  <br>
  Robinson's extensive researches in organic chemistry have dealt
  not only with the structure and synthesis of many organic bodies,
  but also with the electrochemical mechanism of organic reactions.
  His interest in the chemical constitution of plant dyestuffs
  (anthocyanins) soon extended to another group of vegetable
  bodies, the alkaloids, where the whole series of his researches
  are remarkable for their brilliant syntheses. He contributed
  greatly towards the definition of the arrangement of atoms within
  molecules of morphine, papaverine, narcotine, etc. These
  discoveries led to the successful production of certain
  antimalarial drugs (they are reported in numerous scientific
  papers, mainly in the Journal of the Chemical Society).<br>
  <br>
  Sir Robert, a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry and of
  the Royal
  Society was President of The Chemical Society, 1939-1941; of
  the Royal Society, 1945-1950; of the British Association for the
  Advancement of Science, 1955; and of the Society for the Chemical
  Industry, 1958. He is a Commandeur de la L&eacute;gion d'Honneur
  and holds Honorary Doctorates of over twenty British and foreign
  universities. He has been honoured by The Chemical Society
  (Longstaff, Faraday and Flintoff Medals), the Royal Society
  (Davy, Royal and Copley Medals) and the Swiss, American, French
  and German Chemical Societies; he has also been awarded the
  Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, the
  Albert Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Arts and the Medal of
  Freedom (U.S. Government). Sir Robert is Corresponding Member,
  Honorary Fellow, Foreign Member, Associate or Correspondant of
  almost fifty British and foreign learned societies.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962, The Chemical Society honoured Sir Robert by establishing
  a Robert Robinson Lectureship, to be delivered biennially <i>in
  lieu</i> of the usual Presidential Address.<br>
  <br>
  In 1912 Sir Robert married Gertrude Maud Walsh, a fellow student
  at Manchester University. They collaborated in several fields of
  chemical research, notably in a survey of anthocyanins. She died
  in 1954; they had one son and one daughter. In 1957, he married
  Stearn Sylvia Hillstrom (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hershey) of New
  York.<br>
  <br>
  In his younger days, Sir Robert was a keen mountaineer, having
  climbed in the Alps, Pyrenees, Norway and New Zealand, and he is
  an ardent chess player being President of the British Chess
  Federation, 1950-1953. His hobbies also include photography and
  music.</p>
