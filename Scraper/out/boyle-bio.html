 <h1>Willard S. Boyle - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="boyle.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on August 19, 1924 in Amherst, Nova Scotia and raised in the village
of Wallace until I was about two years old. At this time, my family moved
to Chaudiere, a small logging community in northern Quebec. My father
was the local physician in the community and my mother took on the task
of home schooling me. She believed in the Socratic method of teaching,
asking me questions about my work for the day that required very detailed
explanations as answers. She was a curious woman, and through her teaching
I developed a strong curiosity as well. When I was fourteen, I began my
formal education at Lower Canada College in Montreal. My peers were a
stark contrast to the logging men I'd known growing up and I quickly earned
the nickname Butch.</p>
<p>Following Lower Canada College, I continued to pursue my scientific
interests at McGill University. Then, in 1943, I had some time away from my
studies, when I joined the Royal Canadian Navy. From there I applied to
the Fleet Air Arm and was trained to land Spitfire fighter planes on aircraft
carriers. When the war was coming to an end, I was anxious to return home
to school. The transition back to class was not easy, but I found it very
helpful that my best friend from the Navy was also at McGill and we were able
to work together to adapt back to our old lives. During this same fall I met
my wife Betty, who made me believe in love at first sight. We married in 1946
and had our first son, and in 1947 we had our first daughter and I completed
my Bachelor of Science. With two young children at home only twenty-one
months apart, I continued my studies at McGill, completing my Masters in
Science in 1948 and Doctorate in Physics in 1950.</p>
<p>After completing my Doctorate, I remained at McGill in Canada&rsquo;s
  Radiation Laboratory for one year. I then spent two years teaching physics at
  the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Here Betty and I
  purchased our first small house for our growing family while welcoming our
  next son in 1952. About this time, I was met with several new opportunities
  for employment. In 1953, after careful consideration, I decided the academic
  community available through Bell Labs would become my new home. While
  work life became very busy, in 1955 we welcomed our youngest daughter into
  the world.</p>
<p>My time with Bell Labs was always challenging, and this led to several
  important discoveries. In 1962, I worked with Don Nelson to create the
  first continuously operating ruby laser. Also in 1962, I became the Director
  of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm, a division of Bell
  Labs in Washington, D.C. While at Bellcomm I supported the Apollo space
  program and was able to aid in the selection of lunar landing sites. I returned
  to Bell Labs in 1964. Then in 1969, during a brainstorming session with
  George Smith, we created the charged-coupled device. During my time at
  Bell Labs I worked on about 18 patents.</p>
<p>I retired from Bell Labs in 1979 as the Executive Director of the
  Communication Science division. Retired at 55, I sailed my 33-foot boat for
  six leisurely weeks up the inland waterway from New Jersey, the New York
  Harbor and up to Quebec and down the St. Lawrence to the house we had
  built in Wallace. I was accompanied by five or six different crews made up
  of former assistants, friends and family, and a cat and a dog. Following this I
  have continued to live in Wallace, Nova Scotia and Lac Tremblant, Quebec.
  I have been graced with ten wonderful grandchildren and one great-grandchild.</p>
<p>I have been active in several advisory capacities and have won several
  awards (listed below) for my work.</p>
