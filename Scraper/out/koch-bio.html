  <h1>Robert Koch - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="koch.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Robert Koch</b> was born on December 11,
  1843, at Clausthal in the Upper Harz Mountains. The son of a
  mining engineer, he astounded his parents at the age of five by
  telling them that he had, with the aid of the newspapers, taught
  himself to read, a feat which foreshadowed the intelligence and
  methodical persistence which were to be so characteristic of him
  in later life. He attended the local high school
  (&laquo;Gymnasium&raquo;) and there showed an interest in biology
  and, like his father, a strong urge to travel.</p>

  <p>In 1862 Koch went to the University of
  G&ouml;ttingen to study medicine. Here the Professor of Anatomy
  was Jacob Henle and Koch was, no doubt, influenced by Henle's
  view, published in 1840, that infectious diseases were caused by
  living, parasitic organisms. After taking his M.D. degree in
  1866, Koch went to Berlin for six months of chemical study and
  there came under the influence of Virchow. In 1867 he settled,
  after a period as Assistant in the General Hospital at Hamburg,
  in general practice, first at Langenhagen and soon after, in
  1869, at Rackwitz, in the Province of Posen. Here he passed his
  District Medical Officer's Examination. In 1870 he volunteered
  for service in the Franco-Prussian war and from 1872 to 1880 he
  was District Medical Officer for Wollstein. It was here that he
  carried out the epoch-making researches which placed him at one
  step in the front rank of scientific workers.</p>

  <p>Anthrax was, at that time, prevalent among
  the farm animals in the Wollstein district and Koch, although he
  had no scientific equipment and was cut off entirely from
  libraries and contact with other scientific workers, embarked, in
  spite of the demands made on him by his busy practice, on a study
  of this disease. His laboratory was the 4-roomed flat that was
  his home, and his equipment, apart from the microscope given to
  him by his wife, he provided for himself. Earlier the anthrax
  bacillus had been discovered by Pollender, Rayer and Davaine, and
  Koch set himself to prove scientifically that this bacillus is,
  in fact, the cause of the disease. He inoculated mice, by means
  of home-made slivers of wood, with anthrax bacilli taken from the
  spleens of farm animals that had died of anthrax, and found that
  these mice were all killed by the bacilli, whereas mice
  inoculated at the same time with blood from the spleens of
  healthy animals did not suffer from the disease. This confirmed
  the work of others who had shown that the disease can be
  transmitted by means of the blood of animals suffering from
  anthrax.</p>

            <p>But this did not satisfy Koch. He also wanted to know 
              whether anthrax bacilli that had never been in contact with any 
              kind of animal could cause the disease. To solve this problem he 
              obtained pure cultures of the bacilli by growing them on the aqueous 
              humour of the ox's eye. By studying, drawing and photographing these 
              cultures, Koch recorded the multiplication of the bacilli and noted 
              that, when conditions are unfavourable to them, they produce inside 
              themselves rounded spores which <i>can</i> resist adverse conditions, 
              especially lack of oxygen and that, when suitable conditions of 
              life are restored, the spores give rise to bacilli again. Koch grew 
              the bacilli for several generations in these pure cultures and showed 
              that, although they had had no contact with any kind of animal, 
              they could still cause anthrax.</p>

  <p>The results of this painstaking work were
  demonstrated by Koch to Ferdinand Cohn, Professor of Botany at
  the University of Breslau, who called a meeting of his colleagues
  to witness this demonstration, among whom was Professor Cohnheim,
  Professor of Pathological Anatomy. Both Cohn and Cohnheim were
  deeply impressed by Koch's work and when Cohn, in 1876, published
  Koch's work in the botanical journal of which he was the editor,
  Koch immediately became famous. He continued, nevertheless, to
  work at Wollstein for a further four years and during this period
  he improved his methods of fixing, staining and photographing
  bacteria and did further important work on the study of diseases
  caused by bacterial infections of wounds, publishing his results
  in 1878. In this work he provided, as he had done with anthrax, a
  practical and scientific basis for the control of these
  infections.</p>

  <p>Koch was still, however, without adequate
  quarters or conditions for his work and it was not until 1880,
  when he was appointed a member of the
  &laquo;Reichs-Gesundheitsamt&raquo; (Imperial Health Bureau) in
  Berlin, that he was provided, first with a narrow, inadequate
  room, and later with a better laboratory, in which he could work
  with Loeffler, Gaffky and others, as his assistants. Here Koch
  continued to refine the bacteriological methods he had used in
  Wollstein. He invented new methods - &laquo;Reinkulturen&raquo; -
  of cultivating pure cultures of bacteria on solid media such as
  potato, and on agar kept in the special kind of flat dish
  invented by his colleague Petri, which is still in common use. He
  also developed new methods of staining bacteria which made them
  more easily visible and helped to identify them. The result of
  all this work was the introduction of methods by which pathogenic
  bacteria could be simply and easily obtained in pure culture,
  free from other organisms and by which they could be detected and
  identified. Koch also laid down the conditions, known as Koch's
  postulates, which must be satisfied before it can be accepted
  that particular bacteria cause particular diseases.</p>

  <p>Some two years after his arrival in Berlin
  Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus and also a method of
  growing it in pure culture. In 1882 he published his classical
  work on this bacillus. He was still busy with work on
  tuberculosis when he was sent, in 1883, to Egypt as Leader of the
  German Cholera Commission, to investigate an outbreak of cholera
  in that country. Here he discovered the vibrio that causes
  cholera and brought back pure cultures of it to Germany. He also
  studied cholera in India.</p>

  <p>On the basis of his knowledge of the
  biology and mode of distribution of the cholera vibrio, Koch
  formulated rules for the control of epidemics of cholera which
  were approved by the Great Powers in Dresden in 1893 and formed
  the basis of the methods of control which are still used today.
  His work on cholera, for which a Prize of 100,000 German Marks
  was awarded to him, also had an important influence on plans for
  the conservation of water supplies.</p>

  <p>In 1885 Koch was appointed Professor of
  Hygiene in the University of Berlin and Director of the newly
  established Institute of Hygiene in the University there. In 1890
  he was appointed Surgeon General (Generalarzt) Class I and
  Freeman of the City of Berlin. In 1891 he became an Honorary
  Professor of the Medical Faculty of Berlin and Director of the
  new Institute for Infectious Diseases, where he was fortunate to
  have among his colleagues, such men as <a href=
  "../1908/index.html">Ehrlich</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1901/index.html">von Behring</a> and
  Kitasato, who themselves made great discoveries.</p>

  <p>During this period Koch returned to his
  work on tuberculosis. He sought to arrest the disease by means of
  a preparation, which he called tuberculin, made from cultures of
  tubercle bacilli. He made two preparations of this kind called
  the old and the new tuberculin respectively, and his first
  communication on the old tuberculin aroused considerable
  controversy. Unfortunately, the healing power that Koch claimed
  for this preparation was greatly exaggerated and, because hopes
  raised by it were not fulfilled, opinion went against it and
  against Koch. The new tuberculin was announced by Koch in 1896
  and the curative value of this also was disappointing; but it
  led, nevertheless, to the discovery of substances of diagnostic
  value. While this work on tuberculin was going on, his colleagues
  at the Institute for Infectious Diseases, von Behring, Ehrlich
  and Kitasato, carried out and published their epoch-making work
  on the immunology of diphtheria (see the biographies of <a href=
  "../1908/ehrlich-bio.html">Ehrlich</a> and <a href=
  "../1901/behring-bio.html">von Behring</a>).</p>

  <p>In 1896 Koch went to South Africa to study
  the origin of rinderpest and although he did not identify the
  cause of this disease, he succeeded in limiting the outbreak of
  it by injection into healthy farm-stock of bile taken from the
  gall bladders of infected animals. Then followed work in India
  and Africa on malaria, blackwater fever, surra of cattle and
  horses and plague, and the publication of his observations on
  these diseases in 1898. Soon after his return to Germany he was
  sent to Italy and the tropics where he confirmed the work of
  <a href="../1902/index.html">Sir Ronald Ross</a> in malaria and
  did useful work on the aetiology of the different forms of
  malaria and their control with quinine.</p>

  <p>It was during these later years of his life
  that Koch came to the conclusion that the bacilli that caused
  human and bovine tuberculosis are not identical and his statement
  of this view at the International Medical Congress on Tuberculosis
  in London in 1901 caused much controversy and opposition; but it
  is now known that Koch's view was the right one. His work on
  typhus led to the idea, then a new one, that this disease is
  transmitted much more often from man to man than from drinking
  water and this led to new control measures.</p>

  <p>In December, 1904, Koch was sent to German
  East Africa to study East Coast fever of cattle and he made
  important observations, not only on this disease, but also on
  pathogenic species of <i>Babesia</i> and <i>Trypanosoma</i> and
  on tickborne spirochaetosis, continuing his work on these
  organisms when he returned home.</p>

  <p>Koch was the recipient of many prizes and
  medals, honorary doctorates of the Universities of Heidelberg and
  Bologna, honorary citizenships of Berlin, Wollstein and his
  native Clausthal, and honorary memberships of learned societies
  and academies in Berlin, Vienna, Posen, Perugia, Naples and New
  York. He was awarded the German Order of the Crown, the Grand
  Cross of the German Order of the Red Eagle (the first time this
  high distinction was awarded a medical man), and Orders from
  Russia and Turkey. Long after his death, he was posthumously
  honoured by memorials and in other ways in several countries.</p>

  <p>In 1905 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for
  Physiology or Medicine. In 1906, he returned to Central Africa to
  work on the control of human trypanosomiasis, and there he
  reported that atoxyl is as effective against this disease as
  quinine is against malaria. Thereafter Koch continued his
  experimental work on bacteriology and serology.</p>

  <p>In 1866 Koch married Emmy Fraats. She bore
  him his only child, Gertrud (b. 1865), who became the wife of Dr.
  E. Pfuhl. In 1893 Koch married Hedwig Freiberg.</p>

  <p>Dr. Koch died on May 27, 1910, in
  Baden-Baden.</p>
