  <h1>Howard M. Temin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="temin.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on December 10, 1934 in
  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America, the second
  of three sons of Annette and Henry Temin. My father was an
  attorney, and my mother has been continually active in civic
  affairs, especially educational ones. My older brother, Michael,
  is also an attorney in Philadelphia, and my younger brother,
  Peter, is a Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology, Cambridge, Mass.<br>
  <br>
  I received my elementary and high school education in the public
  schools of Philadelphia. My specific interest in biological
  research was focused by summers (1949-1952) spent in a program
  for high school students at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and
  a summer (1953) spent at the Institute for Cancer Research in
  Philadelphia. I attended Swarthmore College from 1951 to 1955,
  majoring and minoring in biology in the honors program. After
  another summer (1955) at the Jackson Laboratory, I became a
  graduate student in biology at the California Institute of Technology
  in Pasadena, California, majoring in experimental embryology.
  After a year and a half, I changed my major to animal virology,
  becoming a graduate student in the laboratory of Professor
  <a href="index.html">Renato Dulbecco</a>. My doctoral thesis was
  on Rous sarcoma virus. Much of my early work on this virus was
  carried out with the dose collaboration of Dr. Harry Rubin, then
  a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Dulbecco's laboratory. At Cal
  Tech, I was also greatly influenced by Professor <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Max Delbr&uuml;ck</a> and by Dr. Matthew
  Meselson. After finishing my Ph.D. degree in 1959, I remained
  for an additional year in Professor Dulbecco's laboratory as a
  postdoctoral fellow. In that year, I performed the experiments
  that led to the formulation in the same year of the provirus
  hypothesis for Rous sarcoma virus.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960, I moved to Madison as an Assistant Professor in the
  McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, which is also the
  Department of Oncology, in the Medical School, The University of
  Wisconsin-Madison. My first laboratory was in the basement,
  with a sump in my tissue culture lab and with steam pipes for the
  entire building in my biochemistry lab. Here I performed the
  experiments that led in 1964 to my formulating the DNA provirus
  hypothesis. In the fall of 1964, the entire department moved to a
  new building. I became successively Associate Professor, Full
  Professor, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Professor of
  Cancer Research, and, in 1974, American Cancer Society Professor of Viral
  Oncology and Cell Biology. From 1964 to 1974, I also held a
  Research Career Development Award from the National Cancer
  Institute.<br>
  <br>
  During my first years at Wisconsin, I worked with only two
  technicians. My first postdoctoral fellow joined me in 1963, and
  my first graduate student, in 1965. I had no more than two or
  three postdoctoral fellows and graduate students at one time
  until about 1968.<br>
  <br>
  During the late 1960's, about half of my time was spent in
  studying the control of multiplication of uninfected and Rous
  sarcoma virus-infected cells in culture. This work led to my
  appreciation of the role of specific serum factors in the control
  of cell multiplication and the demonstration that a
  multiplication-stimulating factor in calf serum for chicken
  fibroblasts was the same as somatomedin.<br>
  <br>
  I serve on the editorial boards of several journals, including
  the <i>Journal of Cellular Physiology,</i> the <i>Journal of
  Virology,</i> and the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of
  Sciences U.S.A</i>. I have also been a member of the Virology
  Study Section of the National Institutes of Health. In addition, I do
  much other paper and grant reviewing.<br>
  <br>
  Since the general acceptance of the DNA provirus hypothesis in
  1970, I have received many honors, including the Warren Triennial
  Prize (with <a href="index.html">David Baltimore</a>); the Pap
  Award of the Papanicolaou Institute, Miami, Florida; the Bertner
  Award, M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston,
  Texas; the U. S. Steel Foundation Award in Molecular Biology,
  National Academy of Sciences U.S.A.; the American Chemical
  Society Award in Enzyme Chemistry; the Griffuel Prize,
  Association Developpment Recherche Cancer, Villejuif, France; the
  G.H.A. Clowes Award, American Association for Cancer Research;
  the Gairdner International Award (with David Baltimore); the
  Albert Lasker Award in Basic Medical Research; and honorary
  degrees from Swarthmore College and New York Medical College. I
  have also presented several honorary lectures. I am a fellow of
  the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 I married Rayla Greenberg of Brooklyn, New York, a
  population geneticist. She has been a constant source of support
  and warmth. We have two daughters, Sarah Beth and Miriam.</p>
