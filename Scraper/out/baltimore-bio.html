  <h1>David Baltimore - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="baltimore.jpg" class="bio-img"> My
  interest in Biology began when I was a high school student and
  spent a summer at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine.
  There I first experienced research biology and saw research
  biologists at work; this experience led me to become a biology
  major in college.<br>
  <br>
  I went on to Swarthmore College where I began as a major in
  biology but switched to chemistry later so that I could carry out
  a research thesis. Between my last two years at Swarthmore I
  spent a summer at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories working with Dr.
  George Streisinger, and the experience of working with and
  watching that great teacher led me to molecular biology.<br>
  <br>
  I started graduate school at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
  biophysics, but when I decided to work on animal viruses I left
  M.I.T. to study for a summer with Dr. Philip Marcus at the
  Albert
  Einstein Medical College and to take the animal virus course
  at Cold Spring Harbor, then taught by Dr. Richard Franklin and
  Dr. Edward Simon. I joined Dr. Franklin at the Rockefeller
  Institute to do my thesis work and then continued in animal
  virology as a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. James
  Darnell. I had already found that much could be learned by
  studying virus-specific enzymes, so I studied for a while with
  Dr. Jerard Hurwitz at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to
  learn from someone who knew enzymology as a professional.<br>
  <br>
  My first independent position was at the Salk Institute in La
  Jolla, California where I had the rare opportunity to work in
  association with Dr. <a href="index.html">Renato Dulbecco</a>.
  After 2 1/2 years away from a university setting, I returned to
  M.I.T. in 1968 and have remained there. In 1974, I joined the
  staff of the M.I.T. Center for Cancer Research under the
  directorship of Dr. <a href="../1969/index.html">Salvador
  Luria</a> because I had found that my research interests, that
  previously had involved mainly the non-oncogenic RNA viruses,
  were more and more focused on the problems of cancer.</p>
