  <h1>Leland H. Hartwell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hartwell.jpg" class="bio-img">I don't
  remember much about my early childhood. I am told that before I
  began school, my older cousin would return from her school and
  teach me what she had learned. By the time I was 10 or so, I was
  displaying a curiosity that might have suggested an academic
  bent. I was an avid collector of bugs, butterflies, lizards,
  snakes, and spiders. I remember on one of these adventures
  learning to be skeptical of everything one reads in books. I had
  read that lizards do not have teeth. I had grabbed a very big
  lizard and stared in disbelief as it turned its head, displayed a
  fine set of teeth and sank them into my thumb. From age 13 to 17
  I was preoccupied with sports, girls and cars. But midway through
  high school a fortunate event happened. I became unhappy with the
  football coach and bored of carousing with my car club friends. A
  close friend of mine suggested we transfer to the cross town high
  school and my accommodating mother moved apartments so I could do
  so. At the new school I was fortunate to find some teachers that
  challenged me, particularly a physics teacher and my grades
  improved dramatically. Since no one in my family had ever been to
  college, I had little in the way of career guidance. However, I
  was good at math and physics and I liked mechanical drawing, so I
  thought I might become an engineer. I went for one year to a
  two-year junior college, Glendale Junior College, in preparation,
  taking math, chemistry and physics. I did well, and my counselor
  encouraged me to meet with a recruiter from the California Institute of
  Technology. This was my next major break. I took the entrance
  exams and was admitted into the sophomore class.</p>

  <p>For the first time, I was in an environment
  of real science and it was magical. In hindsight, I can see that
  I was destined for science. I have always been curious and wanted
  to understand things at a fundamental level. For example, I used
  to get annoyed at my father, a neon sign man, because he would
  not explain to me, how neon signs work. I only realized later,
  that I wanted to know about electricity and atomic emissions,
  topics that he knew nothing about. At Cal Tech, I enrolled as a
  physics major. During my sophomore year, I took a lecture course
  in Biology, taught by James Bonner. He was incredibly
  enthusiastic. This must have been around 1958, only five years
  after the discovery of the DNA structure, and the course was all
  about DNA, RNA and protein. The clincher for me was an optional
  evening laboratory in bacteriophage genetics taught by Bob Edgar
  and Charlie Steinberg. Here, I learned that biology could be
  quantitative and it was little time before I changed my major to
  biology. At Cal Tech I was able to do research nearly every
  quarter and summer, in chemistry, biochemistry, and genetics. I
  worked with Hildegard Lamfrom, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1975/index.html">Howard Temin</a> and Bob
  Edgar. Another feature of the Cal Tech undergraduate education
  was the opportunity to take credits as reading which I did most
  quarters, reading the original literature in phage genetics and
  gene regulation.</p>

  <p>I graduated in 1961 and went to MIT for graduate
  school. I had decided that I wanted to work on gene regulation
  and I knew of only two prominent labs in the US, Arthur Pardee at
  Berkeley,
  and Boris Magasanik, at MIT. I visited Arthur Pardee at Berkeley
  and he was not encouraging so I went to MIT. Being a graduate
  student at MIT was great fun and very intense. Boris Magasanik
  would come through the lab each afternoon and stop at each desk
  to discuss the previous day's results. I wanted a new result each
  day so that set quite a pace! I was there only about two and a
  half years when Boris came to me and said that I had essentially
  finished my thesis but since no one could leave that soon I would
  have to stay another year.</p>

  <p>By this time <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1965/index.html">Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob and
  Jacques Monod</a> had published their famous work on the lac
  operon and I figured that gene regulation was pretty well
  understood. I thought it appropriate to do my postdoctoral work
  on something much less well understood and I decided to work on
  the control of cell growth. Going to the literature again, I was
  most impressed with the work coming out of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1975/index.html">Renato Dulbecco</a>'s
  laboratory, so I applied to Renato and he accepted me. My timing
  was excellent because Renato was moving to the Salk Institute but
  the buildings had not been built. We were quartered in temporary
  buildings that kept the lab groups very small. Most of the
  original fellows at the Salk had only one or two postdocs so it
  was very intimate. I spent a lot of time talking with Marguerite
  Vogt, Renato's long time collaborator. Marguerite's enthusiasm
  for cancer research and her adeptness at cell culture were a joy
  to behold and try to learn from. During that period I spent about
  half my time working on polyoma virus infected cells, the main
  research program of the laboratory, and about half the time
  trying to get something of my own started. The polyoma work went
  very well. DNA hybridization was a relatively new technique and
  Nada Ledinko had come to Renato's lab with experience with this
  technique. We used it to show that polyoma infected cells induced
  cellular DNA synthesis and a complement of cellular DNA
  replication enzymes. This seemed like it might be fundamentally
  interesting to the cancer problem. However, none of the three
  projects that I worked on as possible starting points for my own
  entry into research worked. I left the lab after only about 18
  months as a postdoc, taking a position as assistant professor at
  the new University
  of California, Irvine in 1965.</p>

  <p>I had applied for and gotten a grant to
  study the control of cellular DNA synthesis but I was not
  enthusiastic about the prospects for reaching fundamental
  insights with mammalian cells. It was again a fortunate
  circumstance. While I was waiting for my newly ordered equipment
  to arrive, I spent considerable time in the library trying to
  figure out what to do. Dan Wulff, another new recruit, suggested
  that I find a model eukaryotic cell that could be used for
  genetic studies of cell growth. I thought this a great idea and
  went to the library to discover that <i>Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae</i>, baker's yeast was one of the only singled celled
  eukaryotic organisms with facile genetics. I visited Bob Mortimer
  at Berkeley and Herschel Roman and Don Hawthorne at Seattle to find
  out how one worked with yeast. They were both incredibly kind and
  generous. Hersch and Don loaned me a micromanipulator to start my
  work.</p>

  <p>I began by isolating temperature-sensitive
  mutants and analyzing them for macromolecule synthesis and cell
  division at the restrictive temperature. This approach came
  directly from my earlier experience with Bob Edgar at Cal Tech
  where I had seen the power of conditional mutants to analyze
  phage morphogenesis. Three years later, Herschel Roman invited me
  to join the faculty at the genetics department in Seattle which I
  did. Soon after that move, we discovered the power of time-lapse
  photomicroscopy to study the cell cycle.</p>

  <p>Looking back over my life, I feel in some
  sense destined because of my native interest in understanding
  things at a fundamental level. And I also feel extremely
  fortunate for a great number of people who intervened or mentored
  me on my path. I sought a rigorous approach to mysterious
  problems and found people at each step that pointed the way. I
  feel very fortunate to have become a biologist at a time when
  curiosity was paramount and to have been trained by people who
  had high standards.</p>
