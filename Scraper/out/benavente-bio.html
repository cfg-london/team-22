  <h1>Jacinto Benavente - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="benavente.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Jacinto Benavente</b> (1866-1954), the
  son of a well-known pediatrician, was born in Madrid. He studied
  law, but when his father died and left him with a comfortable
  income, he abandoned his studies and travelled widely in France,
  England, and Russia. On his return to Spain he edited, and
  contributed to, several newspapers and journals. He published a
  collection of poems (1893) and achieved some fame with <i>Cartas
  de mujeres</i> (1892-93) [Women's Letters], a series of women's
  letters, which was followed by another series in 1902. These
  letters gave Benavente a reputation as a brilliant stylist. His
  career as a dramatist began in 1892 with a collection of plays
  under the title &laquo;The Fantastic Theatre&raquo;, but his first
  successes were <i>El nido ajeno</i> (1894) [Another's Nest] and
  <i>Gente conocida</i> (1896) [High Society], a satire of Madrid
  society. Benavente's plays deal with all strata of life; they are
  both serious and comic, realistic and fantastic, but it is
  chiefly as a writer of comedies of manners and of one-act farces
  that he made his name. His comedies usually take place in Madrid
  or in Moraleda, an imaginary provincial town in Castile. Whereas
  in his earlier plays Benavente had been chiefly interested in
  giving a faithful portrait of society, his later works show an
  increasing concern for a tight dramatic structure.</p>
  
  <p>Benavente is best known for such plays as <i>La Gobernadora</i>
  (1901) [The Governor's Wife], Rosas de oto&ntilde;o (1905)
  [Autumnal Roses], and particularly <i>Se&ntilde;ora ama</i> ( 1908)
  [The Lady of the House] and <i>La Malquerida</i> (1913) [The
  Wrongly Loved], two psychological dramas which take place in a
  rural atmosphere. <i>Los intereses creados</i> (1907) [<i>The
  Bonds of Interest</i>] has repeatedly been called Benavente's
  masterpiece, and it is certainly, of all his plays, the one that
  has most often been seen on the stage. A note of ironic
  resignation marks the delicate allegory of this play, the thesis
  of which affirms the necessity of evil. Mention should also be
  made of the play <i>Hijos, padres de sus padres</i> [<i>Sons,
  Fathers of Their Parents</i>], which appeared in the year of
  Benavente's death. His collected plays were published in ten
  volumes between the years 1941 and 1955.</p>
