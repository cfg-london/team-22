  <h1>Emily Greene Balch - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="balch.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Emily
  Greene Balch</b> (January 8, 1867-January 9, 1961) was born in
  Boston, the daughter of Francis V. and Ellen (Noyes) Balch. Hers
  was a prosperous family, her father being a successful lawyer, at
  one time secretary to United States Senator Charles Sumner. She
  went to private schools as a young girl; was graduated from
  Bryn Mawr
  College in 1889, a member of its first graduating class;
  spent the year 1889-1890 in independent study of sociology; used
  a European Fellowship awarded by Bryn Mawr to study economics in
  Paris in 1890-1891 under &Eacute;mile Levasseur and to write
  <i>Public Assistance of the Poor in France</i>, published in
  1893; completed her formal studies with scattered courses at
  Harvard and
  the University
  of Chicago and with a full year of work in economics in
  1895-1896 in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  In 1896 she joined the faculty of Wellesley
  College, rising to the rank of professor of economics and
  sociology in 1913. An outstanding teacher, she impressed students
  by the clarity of her thought, by the breadth of her experience,
  by her compassion for the underprivileged, by her
  strong-mindedness, and by her insistence that students could
  formulate independent judgments only if they combined on-the-spot
  investigation with their research in the library. During these
  years she was a member of two municipal boards (one on children
  and one on urban planning) and of two state commissions (one on
  industrial education, the other on immigration); she participated
  in movements for women's suffrage, for racial justice, for
  control of child labor, for better wages and conditions of labor;
  she contributed to knowledge with her research, notably, <i>Our
  Slavic Felow-Citizens</i> (1910), a study of the main
  concentrations of Slavs in America and of the areas in Austria
  and Hungary from which they emigrated.<br>
  <br>
  Although Miss Balch had always been concerned with the problem of
  peace and had followed carefully the work of the two peace
  conferences of 1899 and 1907 at The Hague, she became convinced
  after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 that her lifework lay
  in furthering humanity's effort to rid the world of war. As a
  delegate to the International Congress of Women at The Hague in
  1915, she played a prominent role in several important projects:
  in founding an organization called the Women's International
  Committee for Permanent Peace, later named the Women's
  International League for Peace and Freedom; in preparing peace
  proposals for consideration by the warring nations; in serving on
  a delegation, sponsored by the Congress, to the Scandinavian
  countries and Russia to urge their governments to initiate
  mediation offers; and in writing, in collaboration with <a href=
  "../1931/index.html">Jane Addams</a> and Alice Hamilton, <i>Women
  at The Hague: The International Congress of Women and Its
  Results</i> (1915). Although Miss Balch was not a member of
  Henry Ford's &laquo;Peace Ship&raquo;, in 1915, she
  was a member of his Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation,
  based at Stockholm, for which she drew up a position paper called
  &laquo;International Colonial Administration&raquo;, proposing a
  system of administration not unlike that of the mandate system
  later accepted by the League of Nations.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to the United States, she campaigned actively against
  America's entry into the conflict. She asked for an extension of
  her leave of absence from the faculty of Wellesley College, but
  the trustees in 1918 decided instead to terminate her contract.
  She accepted a position on the editorial staff of the liberal
  weekly, the <i>Nation</i>; wrote <i>Approaches to the Great
  Settlement</i>, with an introduction by <a href=
  "../1933/index.html">Norman Angell</a>, a future Nobel Peace
  Prize winner (for 1933); attended the second convention of the
  International Congress of Women held in Zurich in 1919 and
  accepted its invitation to become secretary of its operating
  organization WILPF, The Women's International League for Peace
  and Freedom, with headquarters in Geneva. This post she
  relinquished in 1922, but when the League was hard pressed
  financially in 1934, she again acted, without salary, as
  international secretary for a year and a half. It was to this
  League that Miss Balch donated her share of the Nobel Peace Prize
  money.<br>
  <br>
  During the period between the wars, Miss Balch put her talents at
  the disposal of governments, international organizations, and
  commissions of various types. She helped in one way or another
  with many projects of the League of Nations - among them,
  disarmament, the internationalization of aviation, drug control,
  the participation of the United States in the affairs of the
  League. In 1926 she served as a member of a WILPF committee
  appointed to investigate conditions in Haiti, garrisoned then by
  American marines, and edited, as well as wrote, most of
  <i>Occupied Haiti</i>, the committee's report. In the thirties
  she sought ways and means to help the victims of Nazi
  persecution.<br>
  <br>
  Indeed, the excesses of nazism caused Emily Balch to change her
  strong pacifistic views and to defend the &laquo;fundamental human
  rights, sword in hand&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_1">1</a></sup>
  during WW II. She also concentrated on generating ideas for the
  peace, most of them characterized by the common denominator of
  internationalism; for example, the internationalization of
  important waterways, of aviation, of certain regions of the
  world.<br>
  <br>
  Even after receiving the Peace Prize in 1946 at the age of
  seventy-nine, Miss Balch continued, despite frail health, to
  participate in the cause to which she had given her life. She
  maintained her association with the WILPF, acting often in an
  honorary capacity; in 1959 she served as a co-chairman of a
  committee to mark the centenary of the birth of Jane Addams, a
  good comrade of days past and herself a winner of the Peace Prize
  (for 1931).<br>
  <br>
  Throughout her life Miss Balch obeyed the call of the
  humanitarian in her nature, but she also listened to the
  promptings of the artist. She liked to paint, and she published a
  volume of verse, <i>The Miracle of Living</i>.<br>
  <br>
  She died at the age of ninety-four years and one day,
  demonstrating that she was as persistent physically as she was
  intellectually.</p>
