  <h2>The Role of the Hypophysis in Carbohydrate Metabolism and in
  Diabetes</h2>

  <p>The nutritive substances used in greatest
  quantities by mammals are carbohydrates. - These are ingested
  with the food or produced by the liver, and after being converted
  into glucose they are utilized by all the cells of the organism,
  specially by the muscles, which constitute nearly half the mass
  of the body.</p>

  <p>Production and consumption of carbohydrates
  is so well regulated that there is a constant blood sugar level;
  any accidental increase or fall in blood sugar is rapidly
  compensated. The constancy of the blood sugar level is maintained
  by a complex physiological mechanism, a homeostatic mechanism of
  the same order as those which maintain the body temperature, the
  blood pressure or the heart rate at normal levels and control
  many other functions. The blood sugar level itself is an
  important factor in many chemical and physiological
  processes.</p>

  <p>The liver is the principal organ in the
  regulation of the blood sugar level. If the liver is removed
  there is a progressive hypoglycemia which ends in death. After
  hepatectomy it is not possible to provoke hyperglycemia, whatever
  the agent or procedure employed, whether the animal were diabetic
  or not before the liver was removed. Nor is it possible to
  produce any form of diabetes in hepatectomized animals. On the
  other hand, when there is hyperglycemia the liver diminishes or
  ceases the production of sugar, and stores it.</p>

  <p>The production and consumption of glucose
  and hence the blood sugar level, are controlled by a functional
  endocrine equilibrium. This mechanism acts on the liver - the
  organ which produces and stores glucose - and on the tissues
  which are the consumers of glucose, by means of hormones which
  play a part in the chemical processes of carbohydrate
  metabolism.</p>

  <p>The secretion of each endocrine organ is
  controlled by a physiological mechanism. For instance, the
  pancreas secretes insulin in adequate quantities so as to
  maintain a normal blood sugar level, and the blood sugar level
  regulates the amount of insulin secreted. Thus hyperglycemia
  increases the secretion of insulin and hypoglycemia diminishes or
  completely inhibits it. This regulation of insulin secretion is
  maintained even when the pancreas is surgically reduced to one
  seventh of its normal mass, or when besides the intact pancreas
  <i>in situ</i> four others are grafted into the circulation. In
  both cases the blood sugar is kept constantly at a normal level.
  The extrinsic innervation of the pancreas is not necessary for
  the regulation of insulin secretion; the response of the
  denervated pancreas to changes in blood sugar differs only in
  minor details from the response of the normal pancreas.</p>

  <p>Not only is the secretion of each gland
  regulated according to the organic needs of each moment, but
  there is also an equilibrium between the secretions of the
  different glands. The blood sugar and the production and
  consumption of glucose are kept within normal bounds, therefore
  there is an equilibrium between the glands of internal secretions
  which reduce the blood sugar (pancreas) and those which raise it
  (anterohypophysis, adrenals, thyroid, etc.).</p>

  <p>In 1907, when I was a medical student, I
  was attracted to the study of the hypophysis because the
  microscopic picture showed glandular activity and its lesions
  were accompanied by serious organic disturbances, such as
  acromegaly, dwarfism, etc.</p>

  <p>The frequency of glycosuria or diabetes in
  acromegaly has been reported many times; Atkinson found it in
  32.8% of 817 cases of the disease published up to 1938. Moreover,
  extracts of the posterior lobe of the hypophysis produce rapid
  pharmacological effects, amongst which is a transitory
  hyperglycemia (Borchardt, 1908). Therefore it was commonly
  accepted that if the hypophysis played a part in carbohydrate
  metabolism, it would be due to the activity of its posterior
  lobe.</p>

  <p>One year after the discovery of insulin a
  systematic study of the influence of endocrine glands on its
  activity was organized in my laboratory. With Magenta
  (1924-1927-1929) I found that hypophysectomized dogs were
  hypersensitive to the toxic and hypoglycemic action of insulin.
  In 1925, I found the same fact in the toad (with Mazzocco and
  Rietti); and in 1929, assisted by Miss Potick I saw that the
  administration of <i>pars distalis</i> prevented or corrected
  hypersensitiveness to insulin in hypophysectomized toads.</p>

  <p>The next step consisted in the removal of
  the pancreas in hypophysectomized dogs and toads (with Biasotti
  in 1930). The removal of the hypophysis or of its <i>pars
  distalis</i> produced a considerable attenuation of the severity
  of pancreatic diabetes. The injection or implantation of anterior
  hypophyseal lobe reestablished or even increased the usual
  severity of diabetes.</p>

  <p>This work, done in 1930, showed that: (a)
  the anterior lobe of the hypophysis has an important part in the
  physiological control of metabolism; (b) the hypophysis is a
  factor conditioning the severity of diabetes; (c) the injection
  of anterior lobe of the hypophysis has a diabetogenic effect.</p>

  <p>Later the diabetogenic effect was also
  demonstrated in dogs with a surgically reduced pancreas (Houssay,
  Biasotti, Di Benedetto, and Rietti, 1932) or with an intact
  pancreas (Evans <i>et al</i>., 1932, etc.). A permanent diabetes
  was produced by prolonged treatment with the extract of anterior
  lobe of hypophysis in dogs with a reduced (Houssay, Biasotti, Di
  Benedetto, and Rietti, 1932) or an intact pancreas (Young,
  1937).</p>

  <p>After total hypophysectomy, or removal of
  the <i>pars distalis</i>, when the animals are kept fasting, a
  severe, and sometimes fatal, hypoglycemia easily occurs. These
  animals are also very sensitive to hypoglycemic agents, such as
  insulin and phloridzin. Hyperglycemia produced by adrenaline or
  by glucose administration is followed in some cases by intense
  hypoglycemia and convulsions.</p>

  <p>The injection of pars distalis increases
  the resistance to insulin and phloridzin. This effect has been
  called glycotropic by Young (1936-1938).</p>

  <p>Hepatic and muscular glycogen falls rapidly
  in fasting hypophysectomized animals. Hypophyseal injections
  inhibit this decrease specially in respect to muscle glycogen and
  this action is also produced in absence of the adrenals (Russell,
  Bennett); The mobilization of hepatic glycogen by insulin or
  adrenaline is in some species slower in hypophysectomized than in
  normal animals.</p>

  <p>Extirpation of the hypophysis, or of the
  <i>pars distalis</i>, markedly attenuates the severity of
  pancreatic and phloridzin diabetes. Hypophysectomized
  pancreatectomized dogs show the following differences with
  respect to pancreatectomized dogs: (a) they survive a long time,
  the wounds heal well and infection is much less frequent; (b)
  there is a slow gradual loss of weight; (c) the loss of nitrogen
  is less considerable; (d) hyperglycemia and glycosuria are less
  marked and are sometimes absent; fasting produces a notable fall
  in blood sugar and decrease in glycosuria; (e) spontaneous
  hypoglycemic crises occur, usually due to underfeeding or fasting
  and there is hypersensitiveness to insulin; (f) hypoglycemic
  crises can be prevented by carbohydrate or protein-rich diets,
  but not by fats; injection of glucose saves the animal's life
  when it has fallen into a hypoglycemic crisis; (g) there is
  little decrease in hepatic and muscle glycogen if the diabetes is
  not severe, and in some cases the same concentrations as in the
  controls are found; (h) when glucose is injected only part of it
  and sometimes none, is excreted in the urine; (i) the blood sugar
  curve following glucose administration is intermediate between
  those of pancreatectomized and normal dogs; (j) after glucose is
  given, there is a moderate rise in the respiratory quotient in
  some cases, but not in all; (k) the increase in ketonemia and
  ketonuria is remarkably small; (l) the increase in lipemia and
  cholesterolemia is not considerable; (m) the rise in the basal
  metabolic rate is less than in the pancreatectomized controls;
  (n) the D/N ratio in urine is also lower than in the
  controls.</p>

  <p>Hypophysectomized pancreatectomized animals
  utilize more glucose than pancreatectomized, but less than normal
  animals. Protein consumption does not increase as much as in the
  pancreatectomized; the small amount of ketonuria points to a
  diminished consumption of fat.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The diabetogenic effect of the hypophysis
  was first observed in animals in which both the hypophysis and
  the pancreas had been removed. Later, in 1937, it was
  demonstrated in: (a) dogs with a surgically reduced pancreas
  (Houssay, Di Benedetto, and Rietti); (b)normal rabbits (Baumann
  and Marine); (c) normal puppies.</p>

  <p>Daily injections of anterohypophyseal
  extract provoke after two or three days a rise in blood sugar and
  hypophyseal diabetes in cats and dogs. In the dog the blood sugar
  rises from normal to 150 to 300 mg per cent; there is glycosuria;
  ketonemia and ketonuria increase; and there is polyuria and
  polydipsia. Injection of glucose is followed by a typical
  diabetic blood sugar curve and the respiratory quotient does not
  rise or rises very little. The animal becomes insulin
  resistant.</p>

  <p>The hypophysis of all vertebrates has this
  diabetogenic effect on animals of its own and other species. The
  <i>pars distalis</i> is responsible for the diabeto-genie effect,
  the posterior lobe has little activity in this respect. The
  diabeto-genie principle is rapidly destroyed at room temperature,
  therefore the extracts should be stored at a temperature near
  0&deg;C.</p>

  <p>The active principle is a protein. Young
  has obtained a concentrated extract, but it has not been prepared
  in a pure form, so it is not yet possible to say if it is a
  separate hypophyseal hormone, different from those already known.
  I am mistakenly supposed to have described a diabetogenic
  hormone. I have described a diabetogenic property, or factor, or
  action of the extract, without having said this effect was due to
  a diabetogenic hormone. The regulation of carbohydrate metabolism
  is a normal function of the hypophysis, but certainly the
  production of diabetes is <i>not</i> one of its normal functions.
  Nevertheless an active hypophysis, even when it is functioning
  normally, increases the severity of diabetes.</p>

  <p>The diabetogenic effect of the hypophysis
  is dependent on the liver. It can not be obtained in the
  hypophysectomized pancreatectomized toad if the liver has been
  removed. Hepatectomy causes a rapid fall in the blood sugar of
  dogs or toads with a hypophyseal diabetes. On the other hand,
  destruction of the diencephalon or removal of the whole brain, or
  extirpation of the kidneys, the adrenals, the thyroid, the lungs
  and all the digestive tract do not prevent the diabetogenic
  effect.</p>

  <p>In the toad and in the dog, adrenalectomy
  diminishes but does not suppress the diabetogenic effect of the
  anterior lobe extract, which can be obtained in adrenalectomized
  dogs, in which the pancreas has been surgically reduced, and
  which are kept alive by treatment with desoxycorticosterone and
  salt or even with sodium chloride alone. The experiments of Long
  show that the adrenocorticotrophic hormone of the hypophysis by
  releasing corticoadrenal hormones, plays a part in the
  diabetogenic effect; but my own experiments prove there is a
  hypophyseal diabetogenic action which takes place when there are
  no adrenals.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>There are pancreatic and extrapancreatic
  factors in the production of hypophyseal diabetes.</p>

  <p>Extrapancreatic: factors are demonstrated
  by: (1) the diabetogenic effect obtained in pancreatectomized
  hypophysectomized animals; (2) the increase in the severity of
  diabetes in pancreatectomized dogs treated with anterohypophyseal
  extract; (3) the increase in resistance to insulin which precedes
  and accompanies hypophyseal diabetes; (4) the fact that
  hyperglycemia and diabetes occur before that there are visible
  lesions in the beta cells of the islets, and before insulin
  secretion diminishes.</p>

  <p>After two to four days of hyperglycemia
  provoked by the injection of an terohypophyseal extracts the beta
  cells show signs of damage and insulin secretion diminishes. The
  beta cells are degranulated, they swell, become vacuolized and go
  into hydropic degeneration. In most cases there is no insulin
  secretion or it is considerably reduced. This can be demonstrated
  by grafting the pancreas from these animals into the circulation
  of a diabetic animal. A normal pancreas reestablishes the normal
  blood sugar level in three to five hours and maintains it there,
  while the pancreas taken from an animal in hypophyseal diabetes
  has little or no effect on the blood sugar.</p>

  <p>If after a few days the anterohypophyseal
  treatment is discontinued the diabetic condition disappears, the
  blood sugar returns to a normal level, and later the beta cells
  regain their normal aspect. If daily injections of anterohypo
  physeal extracts are continued for several weeks, beta cells
  first show pycnotic nuclei and then gradually disappear in great
  numbers. At this stage even if the hypophyseal treatment is
  discontinued the animals remain permanently diabetic,
  degeneration of the beta cells continues and the pancreas ceases
  to secrete insulin.</p>

  <p>The diabetic condition which appears during
  hypophyseal treatment and which disappears when this treatment is
  discontinued should be called hypophyseal diabetes. The lesions
  in the beta cells are reversible.</p>

  <p>The diabetic conditions which persists when
  the hypophyseal treatment is discontinued, should be called
  metahypophyseal diabetes. It is a pancreatic diabetes due to
  irreversible lesions of the beta cells. It is produced by the
  injection of hypophyseal extract, but persists without this
  treatment.</p>

  <p>In hypophyseal diabetes there is a marked
  increase in insulin resistance, while in metahypophyseal diabetes
  the resistance to the action of insulin is normal or only
  slightly increased. It is possible that in acromegaly, in some
  stages of the disease there may be a hypophyseal diabetes and at
  others a metahypophyseal diabetes.</p>

  <p>There is a certain antagonism between the
  hypophysis and the pancreas. Thus as the mass of the pancreas is
  progressively reduced by extirpation of increasingly larger
  portions, the dose of hypophyseal extract needed to provoke
  diabetes diminishes. Reciprocally in hypophysectomized animals
  there is hypersensitiveness to insulin, and in fasting, their
  blood sugar and glycogen falls more rapidly and markedly than in
  normal animals.</p>

  <p>The anterohypophysis is not necessary for
  the normal development and maintenance of the pancreas, therefore
  there is no physiologic pancreatotrophic effect of the hypophysis
  on the pancreas. Hypophysectomy does not cause a loss in the
  weight of the pancreas in dogs, nor of the insular mass in
  several species in which it has been examined; on the contrary,
  there is an increase in the islets. The pancreatic content and
  secretion of insulin are normal.</p>

  <p>Anterohypophyseal extracts can produce two
  opposite effects on the islets: (a) stimulation and hyperplasia;
  (b) atrophy and hypofunction. One or other effect is observed
  according to the dose given, the amount of islet tissue and the
  animal species.</p>

  <p>The lesions in the islets and the decrease
  in insulin secretion are due to two factors: (a) the effect of
  the anterohypophyseal extract; and (b) hyperglycemia. They are
  not due exclusively to hyperglycemia as proved by the fact that
  the same levels of blood sugar have been maintained during four
  days by continuous injection of glucose and by hypophyseal
  extracts injections. Only the hypophyseal treatment produced
  lesions of the islets and decrease or absence of insulin
  secretion.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The mechanism by which the anterohypophysis
  controls carbohydrate metabolism is still imperfectly known.</p>

  <p>Hypophysectomized dogs utilize protein and
  carbohydrate ingested in the food, but during complete fasting,
  or protein fasting, the disintegration of body protein is slower
  than in normal dogs. Hypophysectomy also reduces the
  disintegration of body protein in pancreatic and phloridzin
  diabetes. It would seem therefore that hypophysectomy diminishes
  the capacity of the organism to catabolize body protein and to
  form glucose from this protein.</p>

  <p>Ketonuria is also below normal in
  hypophysectomized animals in basal conditions and in the diabetic
  state, whatever its origin, therefore the consumption of fat also
  seems to be reduced. There is good utilization of carbohydrate in
  hypophysectomized animals. Experiments in rats (Fisher, Russel,
  and Cori, 1936) and rabbits (Greeley, 1935-1940) show there is a
  preferential consumption of glucose, above the normal. These
  workers believe this to be the fundamental metabolic disturbance
  produced by hypophysectomy. In the dog this supernormal,
  preferential consumption of glucose has not been demonstrated.
  Moreover, it could be the effect of the subnormal and
  insufficient catabolism of proteins and fats.</p>

  <p>The pituitary is a very important regulator
  of the homeostatic function of the liver. In hypophyseal
  insufficiency glucose formation by the liver does not increase
  during hypoglycemia as it does in normal animals. During fasting
  or diabetes, the glucose formation from proteins is also lower.
  On the other hand an excess of anterior pituitary produces
  hyperglycemia due to diminished peripheral consumption of glucose
  and to lack of inhibition of its hepatic formation.</p>

  <p>Recently, Price, Cori, and Colowick
  (1945-1947) have shown that the anterohypophysis inhibits
  hexokinase and that insulin counteracts this inhibition. It is
  the first case in which it has been shown that a hormone, or
  rather two hormones, act on an enzymatic process of importance in
  carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, this important discovery
  does not explain all the facts, e.g. the hypersensitiveness to
  insulin of hypophysectomized animals.</p>

  <p>One of the most important metabolic
  functions of the hypophysis is the part it plays in the formation
  of protein on which growth depends. The growth hormone increases
  the fixation of nitrogenous substances and body protein
  formation. Hypophysectomized rats with forced feeding form more
  fat and less protein than the controls. Ingested protein is
  catabolized in a greater proportion than in normal animals.</p>

  <p>Young (1940-1944)supposes that the growth
  hormone of the hypophysis induces the fixation of nitrogen and
  the utilization of glucose when insulin is present and in this
  way causes growth. When there is not enough insulin, sugar is not
  utilized but excreted, i.e. there is a diabetogenic effect. His
  main arguments are the following: (1) a dose of hypophyseal
  extract which is rapidly diabetogenic in the adult diabetic
  animal causes only growth in puppies; these young animals do not
  become diabetic until after several months of treatment they
  cease to grow; (2) in the rat the extract increases the islet
  tissue, the animal grows and there is no diabetes; (3) extracts
  which are diabetogenic for the dog only cause growth in the rat;
  (4) pure growth hormone increases glycosuria in subtotally
  pancreatectomized rats; (5) the fixation of nitrogen caused by
  hypophyseal extract is conditioned by the amount of islet tissue
  or of insulin.</p>

  <p>Long (1942) believes that the metabolic
  action of the hypophysis depends on the growth hormone, the
  adrenotrophic and the thyrotrophic hormones.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The work that has been done in my
  laboratory on this subject has been carried out with the
  collaboration of Drs. Lewis, Giusti, Mazzocco, Rietti, Potick,
  Biasotti, Braier, Di Benedetto, Gerschman, Aubrun, Campos,
  Lanari, Curutchet, Cicardo, Etcheverry, Foglia, Sammartino,
  Magdalena, Ferrer- Zanchi, Savino, Hug, Novelli, Orias, Parodi,
  Leloir, Artundo, Lascano-Gonzalez, Gofialons, Riet-Correa,
  Stoppani, Dambrosi, Dosne, Fernandez, A. Houssay, H. Houssay,
  Smyth, Pasqualini, Marenzi, De Robertis, and others.</p>

  <p>Carbohydrate metabolism and other metabolic
  processesare regulated by the balance maintained between the
  secretion of several endocrine glands. Diabetes and other
  metabolic diseases are a disturbance in this endocrine
  equilibrium. There are still many problems to be solved, but
  undoubtedly the hypophysis is one of the most important organs in
  the regulation of metabolism and the center of the endocrine
  constellation.</p>
