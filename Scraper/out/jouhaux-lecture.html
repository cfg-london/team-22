  <h2>Fifty Years of Trade-Union Activity in Behalf of Peace</h2>

  <p>It will certainly come as no surprise to
  you when I tell you that one of the most moving, as well as one
  of the happiest, moments of my life occurred on the evening of
  Monday, November 5, 1951. A reporter whose initiative I have
  already commended to the French Broadcasting System, eager to
  satisfy his professional conscience by extracting a sensational
  statement from me, came to inform me at a somewhat late hour that
  the Nobel Peace Prize Committee of the Norwegian Parliament had
  just bestowed on me one of the most renowned and flattering
distinctions that this world can offer.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he was disappointed by my reception
  and by the way in which I immediately identified myself with the
  working classes and their trade unions when I responded to the
  award of this prize, which reflects so much honour on its
  founder, on those whose mission it is to confer it, and on him
  who receives it. But I can assure you that not for the briefest
  instant did I believe that it was I alone who was the recipient
  of this great reward.</p>

  <p>I have never ceased to do my utmost to be
  the faithful interpreter and devoted servant of the ideals of
  peace and justice upheld by out trade-union organizations, and at
  such a solemn moment it was natural for me to regard myself
  simply as their representative. I speak as their representative
  now as I review for you their constant efforts to hasten the
  advent of an era of peace for which all men long and in which, to
  borrow the words of Jean Jaur&egrave;s<a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>, "mankind, finally at peace with itself"
  will pursue its own destiny in joy and harmony.</p>

  <p>My emotion was, nonetheless, great. Neither
  my friends nor my family, who should know me better than anyone
  else does, have ever doubted the strength of my nerves. They
  would be more likely to reproach me - and sometimes with less
  than kindly truculence -for a calmness that some of them call
  placidity. True enough, nature has endowed me with a fair measure
  of patience and composure, yet I should be lying if I told you
  that, having seen the reporter off on his way to make his
  deadline, I fell peacefully asleep. That evening, all that night,
  I waited in vain for a slumber that wouldn't come.</p>

  <p>And during those long hours I was assailed
  by many memories. I saw again the house where I was born, which
  disappeared in 1898 with the abattoir of Grenelle. I was not
  quite two years old when my parents left it and, after a brief
  stay in the country, made a home in Aubervilliers. This town so
  near Paris where I spent my youth was the Aubervilliers of the
  end of the last century. Being at that time more than half
  agricultural, it scarcely resembled the industrial city of today.
  It afforded us children wide-open spaces, covered with grain in
  the summer, and it gave us the clear waters of the Courneuve
  River flowing nearby where we spent many pleasant hours of
  bathing and swimming.</p>

  <p>This almost rustic life made me a sturdy
  and stable man, and, despite the unpretentiousness of our family
  life and its hazards, I look back on those days with considerable
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>However, it was at Aubervilliers that I
  felt for the first time the hard consequences of the struggle of
  the workers for improvement of their living conditions. These had
  a considerable influence on my future.</p>

  <p>My father, a veteran of the Commune<a href=
  "#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>, his convictions and his fighting spirit
  unbroken by the defeat of the workers in 1871, took an energetic
  and untiring part in the strikes which set the workmen of the
  match factory where he worked against the management of the
  company prior to its becoming nationalized. The courageous
  efforts of my mother, who resumed her job as a cook, were not
  enough to compensate us for the loss of my father's wages, and it
  was during one of these strikes that I had to leave elementary
  school before I was twelve to work at the Central Melting House
  in Aubervilliers.</p>

  <p>My parents, and especially my mother,
  encouraged by the director of the local school which I was
  attending, wanted in spite of everything to send me to a National
  School of Arts and Crafts so that I could later become an
  engineer. I was keen to study and had some natural mechanical
  ability, and so I entered the Colbert upper primary school. Less
  than a year later, because of a reversal of the family fortunes,
  I was forced to leave and go to work in the Michaux Soap Works.
  From this time on, except for one more attempt at schooling when
  I spent a year at the Diderot Vocational School, I was, at the
  age of fourteen, completely caught up in the hard life of the
  industrial worker.</p>

  <p>When I was sixteen, I became a member of
  the trade union at the match works where I had rejoined my
  father. I did so without question. My father's vigorous example
  and my own experience led me quite naturally to participate in
  the worker's movement. I had suffered personally from the social
  order. My school work, my intellectual gifts, my eagerness to
  study, had all come to nothing. I had been brutally compelled to
  leave the upper primary school and even the vocational training
  school and to become a wage earner of the humblest order.</p>

  <p>This day has been set aside for all
  countries to celebrate the anniversary of the adoption by the
  United Nations General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of
  Human Rights<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>. And with a passion
  fired by these memories of an adolescent deprived of the right to
  realize his full intellectual potential, I wish to express my own
  conviction that, thanks to the action of true trade unionists and
  sincere democrats, all the sacred and inalienable rights of man
  will henceforth be recognized without reservation and that man
  will be able to exercise these rights without hindrance.</p>

  <p>The feeling of having been unjustly treated
  drove me to spend much time in the library of the Aubervilliers
  libertarian group, one of the few places where I could escape
  intellectually from my situation. Reading the books that I found
  there reinforced my feelings of rebellion against the established
  order and against social injustice.</p>

  <p>I propose now to review the progress of
  trade-union activity for international peace. To this end I shall
  disregard all its other aspects, but first, in order to stress by
  a personal example its positive results with regard to the
  protection of the workers' health, let me give you the reasons
  for the first strike in which I took part. I participated in this
  strike not simply as a member of the trade union but as its
  administrative secretary; in other words - to give you an exact
  idea of my functions and responsibilities in this humble office -
  I drafted the minutes of meetings of the trade-union council, of
  the general assemblies, and sometimes of delegations. I do not
  think that I owed this mark of confidence to my worth as a trade
  unionist; I owed it, more likely, to my having received a less
  sketchy education than that of my comrades: the great school
  reforms of the Third Republic had not yet been in existence ten
  years.</p>

  <p>Instigated by the National Federation of
  Match Factory Workers<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>, itself
  adherent to the C.G.T. which had been established in 1895<a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>, this strike involved the whole trade
  corporation and aimed principally at prohibiting in the
  manufacturing process the use of white phosphorus, which
  constituted no small danger, particularly to the dental health of
  the personnel. The strike lasted over a month, but it led
  directly to the calling of the Bern Conference which prohibited
  the use of noxious substances<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
  This first success naturally could not fail to encourage me to
  persevere in trade-union action, which at the same time satisfied
  both my urge to work against iniquity and my youthful need for
  tangible achievements.</p>

  <p>Another consequence of the same strike was
  the bringing into use of the "continuous" machine, as it was
  called, which increased production as it eased the drudgery of
  the workmen. This led me to understand that trade unionism, the
  instrument of working-class liberation and of social change
  could, and indeed should, be also an instrument of industrial
  progress. Nor did it take me long to see therein one of the most
  effective means for freeing the world of the always menacing
  specter of war.</p>

  <p>Why should I not state openly, Ladies and
  Gentlemen, the fact that the first manifestation of the
  trade-union struggle for peace, and particularly the French
  trade-union struggle into which I threw myself with all the
  ardour of my youth, was antimilitaristic in thought and sometimes
  also in deed? Is not one of the greatest sins against the spirit
  that of knowingly concealing the truth? And would it not be
  ridiculous to reproach the trade-union movement with having
  confused cause and effect? Sociologists worthy of the name never
  make the mistake of reproaching primitive peoples for their
  belief that the sun moves round the earth. We too, through lack
  of knowledge and of sufficiently mature reflection, mistook the
  visible outward appearance of the phenomenon for the phenomenon
  itself. I would add that my memory of that period, perhaps
  because of the mirage which the passage of the years evokes, is
  that of a great enthusiasm, undoubtedly sparked more by
  irrational hope than by any constructive will; but that fervour
  makes me feel all the more bitter about the atmosphere of
  indifference, fatalism, and resignation that has persisted up to
  the present time on our continent, a continent which two wars
  seem to have ravaged morally as well as physically. An orator
  once exclaimed: "When war breaks out, its principal victims are
  always the people." He was more right than he knew. Not only does
  war kill workers by the thousand, nay, by the million, destroy
  their homes, lay waste the fields which took them centuries of
  effort to cultivate, raze to the ground the factories they built
  with their own hands, and reduce for years the standard of living
  of the working masses, but it also gives man an increasingly
  acute feeling of his helplessness before the forces of violence,
  and consequently severely retards his progress toward an age of
  peace, justice, and well-being.</p>

  <p>Oh yes! we were full of enthusiasm back in
  1900. Nothing, no matter what it was, seemed impossible to us
  then, and we had every reason to believe it. We felt already that
  after Viktor Adler, Wilbur Wright was going to give us
  wings<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>On completion of my military service, I
  went back to the factory and to the trade union. From here on,
  however, I am going to take myself out of the story of the
  movement - not because our paths diverged, indeed they
  intermingle after 1909 - but because trade unionism, despite its
  close initial connections with libertarian individualism, is
  essentially and by definition a collective work.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, I mentioned in passing the
  creation in 1895 of the Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration
  g&eacute;n&eacute;rale du travail (C.G.T.). It replaced the National
  Federation of Trade Unions [F&eacute;d&eacute;ration des Syndicats et
  Groupes corporatifs ouvriers de France], which had been founded
  in 1886. Actually, unity of the workers under the C.G.T. was not
  completely achieved until 1902 when, at the Montpellier Congress,
  the Federation of Labour Exchanges (F&eacute;d&eacute;ration
  nationale des Bourses du travail) was incorporated in the C.G.T.
  as the Division of Labour Exchanges. However, during this period
  in which the unity of the working classes was being consolidated,
  the C.G.T., in its annual congresses, had already gone beyond
  questions of organization and corporate claims and as early as
  1898 had taken its stand in favour of general disarmament:</p>

  <p>"The Congress (the motion stated in a
  somewhat antiquated style) considering all peoples to be brothers
  and war to be mankind's greatest calamity, [and]</p>

  <p>Holding that armed peace leads all peoples
  to ruin through the increase in taxation required to meet the
  enormous expense of standing armies,</p>

  <p>Declares that money spent on the
  perpetration of acts suitable only to barbarians and on the
  support of young, strong, and vigorous men for a period of years
  would be better used for work serving humanity, [and]</p>

  <p>Expresses the wish <i>[voeu</i>] that
  general disarmament take place as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>In 1900 and in 1901, the C.G.T. progressed
  from theoretical declarations to practical considerations; it
  decided that "young workers about to undergo conscription should
  be put in touch with the secretaries of the Labour Exchanges of
  the towns in which they are to be garrisoned", and agreed in
  principle to the setting up of a Serviceman's Fund.</p>

  <p>Today these declarations and decisions seem
  very mild. We must not forget, however, that they were
  accompanied by a significant antimilitaristic agitation which had
  found solid support in the impassioned propaganda for a retrial
  of the Dreyfus case<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>. This was
  opposed with equal vigour by militarists whose affinity with a
  discredited Council of War laid open the army and particularly
  its officers to fatal, if unfair, suspicion as far as democratic
  opinion was concerned.</p>

  <p>All the C.G.T. congresses, which took place
  biennially after 1902, were deeply concerned with action in
  support of peace. At the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese
  War<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>, the 1904 Congress, held at
  Bourges, declared: "At a time when two nations are at each
  other's throats, re-enacting on a wider scale the slaughter of
  the past for the greater good of the ruling classes and
  exploiters who enslave the proletariat of the whole world, this
  Congress... censures the ignoble attitude of the governments of
  the two nations concerned, which, with the object of finding an
  outlet for the mounting discontent of the proletariat, appeal to
  chauvinistic passions and unhesitatingly organize the death and
  assassination of thousands of workers in order to safeguard their
  own privileged position."</p>

  <p>The international sky was increasingly
  overcast, and the attitude of the unions stiffened. The 1906
  Congress approved "all programs of antimilitaristic propaganda",
  and that of 1908 contemplated replying to a "declaration of war
  with a declaration of a revolutionary general strike". The
  Congresses of 1910 and 1912 confirmed these resolutions and
  strongly protested against repression, but 1912 was the year of
  the Balkan War<a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a> and, in view of
  the rivalries which began to make themselves felt and which
  threatened to spread the conflict even farther, a special
  conference held on the first of October decided to call a
  congress whose sole objective would be to combat the menace of
  war. The motion passed was a true indication of the confidence of
  the trade-union organizations in their growing strength. To stop
  the governments from being drawn any further down the slope to
  the yawning chasm of fire and blood, the Congress affirmed its
  resolution to take revolutionary action in the event of military
  mobilization.</p>

  <p>We would gain a false impression of the
  importance and effectiveness of labour action if we confined
  ourselves to the motions passed at its congresses. The trade
  unions, far from being content with these declarations,
  established international liaisons and supported every policy
  based on pacification and understanding. Between 1900 and 1901
  the C.G.T. and the English working classes together contributed
  to bringing about the Entente Cordiale<a href=
  "#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>. To gain an idea of the value of this
  contribution, it is necessary only to reflect upon the tension
  which followed the Fashoda incident<a href=
  "#not12"><sup>12</sup></a> and to thumb through the collections
  of satirical publications of those days.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Agadir incident<a href=
  "#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>, on July 22, 1911, a delegation from
  the C.G.T. left for Berlin, and in the following month a
  trade-union delegation from Germany arrived in Paris. The French
  and the German proletariat were uniting their efforts to try to
  avert war.</p>

  <p>These occasional international contacts
  were not, however, the only ones to be established between the
  various national trade-union organizations. Several international
  workers' congresses were held after the abolition of the workers'
  International. One met in Zurich in 1895 and one in London in
  1896, bringing together delegates of the trade unions and
  representatives of socialist-minded political parties. In London,
  the French delegation included, among other trade unionists:
  Fernand Pelloutier, the Gu&eacute;rard brothers, and Keufer<a href=
  "#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>. The results of this cooperation - or
  confusion, as the more critical historians would have it - were
  not outstanding, and the idea of a purely trade-union
  international organization first came up at the Congress of
  Scandinavian Trade Unions in Copenhagen in 1901, thanks to the
  direct contact among fraternal delegations. The proposal came
  from Legien<a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a> who represented the
  General Committee of German Trade Unions. It was decided to
  request the various national organizations to attend the Congress
  of German Trade Unions at Stuttgart in 1902. The organizations of
  Germany, Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, Bohemia, Denmark,
  Spain, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and
  Switzerland responded to the appeal and approved the proposal to
  organize international trade-union congresses which would take
  place at more or less regular intervals. Their mandate remained
  limited, at first extending only to the compilation of common
  statistics, the exchange of information on legislation affecting
  labour, and eventually to solidarity in the event of important
  strikes. Nevertheless, the first international link had been
  forged, and it was later strengthened in Dublin in 1903 by the
  creation of an International Trade-Union Secretariat.</p>

  <p>Without formally withdrawing from the
  Secretariat, our French C.G.T. suspended the payment of its
  contributions in 1904 after the Secretariat had refused to
  include the question of antimilitarism in the agenda for the
  Conference of Amsterdam. I would not go so far as to say that the
  French trade unions attached greater importance to the struggle
  for peace than the others did; but they certainly seemed to take
  it more to heart.</p>

  <p>Relations were renewed following the C.G.T.
  Congress in Marseilles in 1908 and the Secretariat's acquiescence
  to the demand that the calling of truly international congresses
  be included in the agenda of the next conference.</p>

  <p>This, the fifth Conference, took place in
  Paris and included some spirited debates - quite spirited, in
  fact. Having become its secretary, I was the spokesman for the
  C.G.T. I recently referred to this meeting in an article, and I
  think I can do no better than to quote its opening words, for
  they pinpoint not only our own position but also that of the
  representative of the American Federation of Labour.</p>

  <p>"I saw Gompers<a href=
  "#not16"><sup>16</sup></a> again (I wrote) on the evening of
  September 1, 1909. It was the second day of the International
  Conference of Trade-Union Secretariats. All day I had been asking
  for a true international congress, and I had had to ask with a
  certain amount of vehemence. At the end of the afternoon session,
  after we had won the majority over to the argument of the French
  C.G.T., Gompers, who represented the American labour unions
  belonging to the A.F. of L. [American Federation of Labour], came
  over to me to express his deep satisfaction !"</p>

  <p>There were two more conferences, the first
  of which was in 1911 at Budapest where this time the A.F. of L.
  participated officially and the Industrial Workers of the
  World<a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a> unofficially. The second
  was in Zurich in 1913. An attempt at an expanded conference,
  leading to the international congresses which we had in mind, was
  made on the latter occasion by appealing to the International
  Vocational Secretariats. The resolution adopted in Zurich
  recommended that the trade-union organizations of all countries
  study the possibility of setting up an International Federation
  of Labour, whose aim "would be to protect and extend the rights
  and interests of the wage earners of all countries and" - I
  emphasize this last part of the sentence - "to achieve
  international fraternity and solidarity".</p>

  <p>The trade-union movement was emerging from
  its infancy and beginning to be aware of the magnitude of its
  future. In Zurich it no longer thought of itself as the
  expression of a single social class; the international solidarity
  which it was trying to bring about was already something quite
  different from the solidarity of workers in time of strike - all
  that had been envisaged up to that time. The dramatic events
  which its development precipitated were soon to hasten its
  maturity.</p>

  <p>Men of my generation will never forget the
  last days of July, 1914, least of all those who tried to build a
  dike against the onrushing sea of blood. After July 27 our C.G.T.
  never ceased trying to achieve the impossible. To leaders still
  adhering in spirit to the old motto of "Ultimate Right", which
  kings used to engrave on their cannons, it opposed the common
  sense of the man in the street. "War", it cried, "is no solution
  to the problems facing us; it is, and always will be, the most
  terrible of human-calamities. Let us do everything to avoid it."
  On Friday, July 30, the C.G.T. cabled the supreme appeal to the
  International Secretariat, beseeching it to intervene by
  "exerting pressure on the governments".</p>

  <p>Alas! As we all know, these desperate
  efforts were in vain!</p>

  <p>This disaster did not force us to abandon
  our ideal; on the contrary, from the very first months of the
  conflict, it led us to define precisely the conditions for its
  realization.</p>

  <p>In fact, at the end of 1914, the A.F. of L.
  took the initiative of proposing to hold "an International
  Conference of National Trade-Union Organizations on the same day
  and in the same place that the Peace Congress would be held, in
  order to help restore good relations between proletariat
  organizations and to encourage participation with the Peace
  Congress in laying the foundations of a definitive and lasting
  peace". Le Comit&eacute; conf&eacute;d&eacute;ral of the C.G.T.
  accepted this proposal and itself issued a manifesto to all the
  trade-union organizations. I believe that the major portion of
  this text has become less dated than all of its predecessors. It
  concludes by demanding: the suppression of the system of secret
  treaties; an absolute respect for nationalities; the immediate
  limitation of armaments on an international scale, a measure
  which should lead to total disarmament; and finally compulsory
  arbitration for the settlement of all conflicts between
  nations.</p>

  <p>These ideas were soon well on their way.
  The milestones were to be the Conference of Leeds in 1916, that
  of London in September, 1917, and those of Stockholm and Bern in
  June and October of the same year.</p>

  <p>At Leeds the idea of an international
  labour organization appeared in a trade-union text which also
  drew attention to the danger to the working classes inherent in
  the existence of international capitalist competition. In the
  report made on behalf of the C.G.T. we affirmed that the Peace
  Treaty should, in accordance with the spirit of workers'
  organizations, lay the first foundations of the United States of
  Europe. In London there was strong support for the idea of the
  League of Nations itself, along with all its corollaries: general
  disarmament preceded by limitation of armaments, and compulsory
  arbitration, both of which the C.G.T. had advocated three years
  previously.</p>

  <p>At Stockholm in June, 1917, the
  representatives of the trade unions in the Central European and
  Scandinavian countries declared their complete agreement with the
  decisions taken at Leeds and even expressed their congratulations
  to the union organizations of the Allied countries and most
  particularly to the C.G.T. Another International Conference of
  Trade Unions was called at Bern for the beginning of October,
  1917, by the Association of Swiss Trade Unions. The national
  organizations of Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Bulgaria, Denmark,
  Hungary, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland were
  represented, and they confirmed the resolutions adopted at Leeds
  and London.</p>

  <p>The Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist
  Conference which took place in London in February of 1918 was
  perhaps even more important. Our French organization delivered a
  memorandum there containing, certainly, many ideas that had
  already been voiced before, but in it we also demanded the
  creation of a supranational authority, the "formation of an
  international legislative assembly" and "the gradual development
  of an international legislation accepted by all and binding all
  in a clearly defined way". We were ahead of our time, far ahead
  in fact, since thirty-three years later these proposals have
  still not been put into effect. The Conference requested that "at
  least one representative of socialism and of labour should sit
  with the official representatives at the official Peace
  Conference". This request, which was reiterated by the C.G.T. on
  December 15, 1918, in more or less identical terms, was granted
  by two governments; in consequence, Gompers and I were attached
  to the delegations of the U.S.A. and France in the capacity of
  technical experts. We collaborated in bringing our efforts in
  behalf of the trade-union movement to bear on the elaboration of
  the Treaty, particularly insofar as Part XIII<a href=
  "#not16"><sup>18</sup></a> was concerned. The working classes
  were becoming more and more sharply aware of the complex causes
  of international malaise.</p>

  <p>I shall quote two clauses from that part of
  the Treaty which gave birth to the International Labour
  Organization and to its permanent instrument the International
  Labor Office whose activities and tangible results I need not
  recall here. The two clauses of the Treaty read as follows :</p>

  <p>"Whereas, The League of Nations has for its
  object the establishment of universal peace, and such a peace can
  be established only if it is based upon social justice;</p>

  <p>And whereas, Conditions of labour exist
  involving such injustice, hardship, and privation to large
  numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace
  and harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of
  those conditions is urgently required..."</p>

  <p>From 1918 on, trade unionists were to
  express from the platforms of their congresses the workers'
  desire for peace through a rational organization of the world.
  The meetings of the International Labour Office and even the
  general Assemblies of the League of Nations, several of which
  were to have many sessions, were to excite universal interest in
  their proposals. The trade-union organizations nevertheless
  continued their autonomous activity. After the International
  Conference at Bern in February of 1919 and the Congress of
  Amsterdam in July of the same year, the International Trade-Union
  Secretariat was replaced by a true International Federation of
  Trade Unions<a href="#not19"><sup>19</sup></a> which immediately
  acquired over twenty million members. One of its first acts was
  an appeal to International solidarity to alleviate the terrible
  misery prevailing within Austria; and the Austrian workers
  escaped famine, thanks to the many trainloads of supplies sent by
  various trade unions and cooperative societies. The second
  intervention of the F.S.I. was on behalf of the Hungarian trade
  unions, whose liberty was being threatened.</p>

  <p>Some have forgotten - for forgetting is as
  blissful as ignorance - that the F.S.I. intervened with equal
  vigour on behalf of the Russian workers; its representatives,
  O'Grady, Wauters, and later Thomson, actually lived in Russia
  until 1923 in order to supervise the distribution of food and
  medicines sent by the Federation. Furthermore, it is not
  distorting history to say that it was largely through the efforts
  and propaganda of our International Federation that the
  government of the U.S.S.R. was recognized by the majority of the
  great powers.</p>

  <p>However, the trade unionists did not
  confine themselves to mitigating the cruel consequences of war.
  They sought the means to establish a stable peace, emphasizing
  that it should be founded on a basis of worldwide economic and
  social stability. In fact, the majority of the proposals
  ultimately put before the League of Nations originated in the
  international congresses of the International Federation of Trade
  Unions and in the World Peace Congress which the latter convened
  at The Hague in 1922. We asked for the organization of exchanges,
  the circulation of manpower, the distribution of raw materials,
  and the prohibition of private manufacture of arms for
  international circulation.</p>

  <p>It was at about this time that the League
  of Nations set up a Temporary Mixed Commission for the purpose of
  studying methods for dealing with international traffic in
  armaments, munitions, and war mat&eacute;riel<a href=
  "#not20"><sup>20</sup></a>. The opinion of the workers now
  carried such weight that the Commission included three
  representatives of the workers from the Governing Body of the
  International Labour Office. A convention was drawn up on June
  17, 1925, in which the principle of supervision, as opposed to
  that of simple propaganda, was recognized, thanks to the efforts
  of the labour members, of whom I was one. However, not all of our
  suggestions were followed; we had, for instance, requested
  internationalised supervision, the auditing of the books of
  business enterprises, proper measures designed to prevent
  influencing the press and the setting up of international
  cartels, together with the standardisation of national
  inspections.</p>

  <p>It is curious to note - somewhat bitterly -
  that the principle of internationalised supervision always meets
  with strong opposition. Yesterday it came from the private
  manufacture of arms, today from armament itself I remain
  convinced, as do my comrades of the C.I.S.L <a href=
  "#not21"><sup>21</sup></a>, that we cannot talk seriously of
  general, or even of partial, disarmament, without accepting the
  need for effective international surveillance.</p>

  <p>At the Economic Conference of 1927 I was
  again spokesman for the trade unions. The principal arguments in
  my statement of May 5, were as follows :</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"On behalf of my comrades, representing the
  workers, I would like at this International Economic Conference
  to pay tribute to the recognition of the high ideals which the
  trade-union movement has always defended.</p>

  <p>It is the opinion of the labour
  organizations that economic collaboration between peoples is a
  necessity. Immediately after the war during the armistice period
  - in February of 1919 - in examining the conditions necessary for
  peace and exploring the possible bases on which to found the
  League of Nations which was still on the drawing board, so to
  speak, the labour and socialist conferences, meeting
  simultaneously in Bern, emphasized the necessity of giving the
  League of Nations precisely that economic foundation which our
  chairman, Monsieur Theunis<a href="#not22"><sup>22</sup></a>,
  called for yesterday.</p>

  <p>&#8230;In 1924, we declared that the
  organization of a definitive peace requires not only the
  institution of a law of peace but also that of an economy of
  peace... No true peace can be established... so long as
  quasi-military strategy is applied in economic relations. What is
  needed is a committee for economic cooperation."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>On May 23, the last day of the Conference,
  I voiced the sentiments of my friends when I said: "We have been
  bold in criticism, too timid in constructive action."</p>

  <p>Three years later, with the idea of
  concerted economic action in mind, the Conference sent a
  questionnaire to the member states of the League of Nations. The
  French government instructed the National Economic Council to
  work out the essentials of the French answer. I had been
  representing the C.G.T. on this council since its foundation in
  1925, and I investigated the practical means of assuring the most
  satisfactory conditions for the distribution and optimum
  utilization of European raw materials among the various nations.
  Expressing the thoughts of my comrades, I suggested, among other
  means, the organization of an international information service
  on inventories, on production, and on the needs of the various
  countries for raw materials.</p>

  <p>We also took an active part in 1931 on the
  Unemployment Committee of the Commission of Inquiry for European
  Union<a href="#not23"><sup>23</sup></a>, in 1933 at the Monetary
  and Economic Conference in London, and on the Comit&eacute; des
  grands travaux internationaux, through which the International
  Labour Office and the League of Nations, taking up the proposals
  of the trade unions, sought to establish healthy collaboration
  among nations in the struggle against under-employment and toward
  the creation of new sources of wealth. But all these conferences,
  all these meetings, succeeded in doing nothing to rid the world
  of the prevailing economic crisis. The will to organize the world
  on a rational basis, or at least to modify its most apparent
  incongruities, had clearly not been strong enough to counteract
  the combined effects of inertia, egoism, and incomprehension.</p>

  <p>Efforts to wrest weapons away from nations
  bending under the weight of so many instruments of death were
  equally futile. All the same, I cannot forget the first sessions
  of the Conference for the Limitation and Reduction of Armaments.
  Those early days of February, 1932, were days of hope for
  humanity. Millions confidently awaited the results of the
  proceedings of this conference, which was presided over by that
  veteran militant Laborite <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1934/index.html">Henderson</a><a href=
  "#not24"><sup>24</sup></a>, and we can claim, with justification,
  to have had a lot to do with the creation of this enthusiasm. The
  Socialist Workingmen's International and the International
  Federation of Trade Unions, zealously vying with each other, had
  each collected thousands of petitions which the delegations
  presented to the conference. On February 6, after
  Vandervelde<a href="#not25"><sup>25</sup></a> had spoken on
  behalf of the members of the Socialist Worker's International, I
  conveyed to the conference the unqualified support of millions of
  trade unionists.</p>

  <p>That day remains one of the highlights of
  my life. I was intensely aware that I was expressing not only the
  unanimous hope of the workers of an entire world, still bruised
  by the recent holocaust, but also their clear understanding of
  the real conditions necessary for disarmament. In their name, I
  assured the members of the conference of the complete readiness
  of the trade-union organizations to cooperate in making effective
  and sincere the procedures of national and international
  supervision, without which partial disarmament would be either
  illusory or inoperative.</p>

  <p>The attempt to bring about disarmament was
  as fruitless as the efforts in the economic sphere, and a few
  years later, with empty stomachs as its excuse, Italian fascism
  launched itself upon Abyssinia. We trade unionists knew very well
  that peace was indivisible, and we had no doubt that the weakness
  of the League of Nations would render it powerless and herald a
  new period of massacre and destruction. We were insistent and
  even violent in our demands that the Covenant should be applied
  and that sanctions be put into effect. We were voices crying in
  the wilderness. The sanctions were not applied; war broke out in
  Ethiopia<a href="#not26"><sup>26</sup></a>; and it was followed
  fatally, logically, and inexorably by the intervention in
  Spain<a href="#not27"><sup>27</sup></a>, the reoccupation of the
  left bank of the Rhine<a href="#not28"><sup>28</sup></a>, the
  Anschluss<a href="#not29"><sup>29</sup></a>, the Munich
  agreements<a href="#not30"><sup>30</sup></a>, and the Second
  World War<a href="#not31"><sup>31</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I do not want to enlarge upon our
  opposition to this policy of weakness whereby the principle of
  collective security was abandoned. We know only too well what the
  lack of resolution on the part of the democracies has cost
  them.</p>

  <p>Once more the earth was laid waste by war.
  Even so, we do not believe that action in the cause of peace is a
  Sisyphean labour; and that the deadly stone will forever keep on
  rolling back down to crush mankind. We will yet manage to lodge
  the stone firmly at the top of the hill.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Fascists and Nazis had laid
  down their arms, the trade unionists began to rethink the
  problems of peace.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of 1947, the
  C.G.T.-F.O<a href="#not32"><sup>32</sup></a> revived the
  traditions and spirit of our old C.G.T., and in speeches,
  articles, and reports we again took up and specified the
  solutions which the C.G.T., along with the International
  Federation of Trade Unions, had offered to the world as a way to
  salvation.</p>

  <p>We approved the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1953/index.html">Marshall</a> Plan<a href=
  "#not33"><sup>33</sup></a> because it was a manifestation of
  international solidarity, because its benefits could be extended
  to any nation without discrimination, and because we could not
  see in it any expression of a policy of prestige or force of arms
  since it invested the beneficiary states with the right to use
  the credits as they saw fit.</p>

  <p>We approved the propaganda in favour of
  European Unity and emphasized that we would regard such
  unification as the first step on the road to World Unity. In my
  capacity as a trade unionist, I was elected president of the
  European Movement in February of 1949, and in the following
  spring I opened the Westminster Economic Conference<a href=
  "#not34"><sup>34</sup></a> by expressing our common sentiment as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"It is normal, it is logical, it is in
  conformity with the very spirit of history that the organized
  working class should have an active part in the construction of
  Europe. It has always proclaimed that it would not, could not,
  and had no wish to disassociate the struggle for its emancipation
  from the constant battle to maintain peace, because doing so
  would have set up barriers which international events would have
  swept away like piles of chaff."</p>

  <p>It is a matter of Europe's consolidation,
  not of its isolation. This human mass, which has such a vast
  wealth of natural resources at its disposal and whose
  intellectual potential is the greatest on earth, is not willing
  to cut itself off from the rest of the world. It is ready to
  welcome all who wish to be associated with its efforts: "The
  Europe we are building will have more doors and windows than
  walls."</p>

  <p>In July, 1950, in an introduction to the
  reports on the Social Conference of the European Movement, I
  stressed again the importance of its objective of international
  peace and of social justice:</p>

  <p>"We want to make Europe simply a peninsula
  of the vast Eurasian Continent, where for thousands of years war
  has been the only way to resolve conflicts between peoples. We
  want Europe to be a peaceable community united, despite and
  within its diversity, in a constant and ardent struggle against
  human misery and all the suffering and dangers that it engenders.
  We have no desire to make Europe into a larger, better
  entrenched, better armed fortress."</p>

  <p>We approved the Schuman Plan for a European
  Coal and Steel Community<a href="#not35"><sup>35</sup></a>. A few
  days after the declaration of May 9, 1950 - on May 31 to be exact
  - in commenting on the Ruhr Statute<a href=
  "#not36"><sup>36</sup></a> in a C.I.S.L. Conference journal, I
  wrote :</p>

  <p>"The promoters of the &lt;Combinat&gt; can
  take as their objective... only the progressive unification of
  Europe. However, this unification cannot be an end in itself.</p>

  <p>The final and essential goal, the only
  valid goal, is to extend the well-being of the worker, to give
  him a more equitable share of the products of collective work, to
  make Europe a social democracy, and to ensure the peace desired
  by men of every race and tongue by proving that the democracies
  can bring about social justice through the rational organization
  of production without sacrificing the liberty and the dignity of
  the individual.</p>

  <p>... The pool should be only one stage in a
  process of continuous creation. The C.I.S.L. has decided to
  follow its development closely in order to be in a position to
  give it effective collaboration."</p>

  <p>We recommended the organization of a
  worldwide market for raw materials and in this connection
  recalled just what it is that we intend to defend in defending
  democracy :</p>

  <p>"What are we all trying to save? What are
  we trying to safeguard? Civil liberties: specifically, the right
  of all citizens to hold their own opinions and to express them
  freely on the great questions of moral, philosophical, political,
  and economic import, and the right to form associations. But
  democracy is not, nor can it be, merely a theoretical respect for
  these rights. It must give every man effective opportunities to
  enjoy them, and it must do so under the kind of moral and
  material conditions that will encourage him to exercise such
  rights.</p>

  <p>One who must be constantly preoccupied with
  his own subsistence cannot be an alert citizen.</p>

  <p>I said recently in a short address to the
  Economic Council that economic justice is one of the factors in
  the moral health of nations. There is no economic order in
  inflationist policies and in underemployment."</p>

  <p>The C.I.S.L. commissioned me to put before
  the U.N. Assembly at Lake Success a draft resolution whose main
  paragraph read as follows: "The General Assembly... recommends to
  the participating nations that they seek above all the means of
  establishing international regulation of the distribution and
  cost of raw materials and that, to this end, they contribute to
  the creation of a common stabilization fund."</p>

  <p>We have constantly defended the two
  inseparable principles of collective security and general
  disarmament, effected through the reassessment and international
  supervision of military strength and of all categories of
  instruments of war.</p>

  <p>A synthesis of our doctrine was attempted
  on the occasion of the C.I.S.L. Congress at Milan in July, 1951,
  in the report on the role of the trade-union movement in
  international crisis.</p>

  <p>In this report we have fixed our
  objectives: first and above all, to spare humanity the colossal
  ordeal of a third world war.</p>

  <p>In it we have stated our principles : to
  act within the framework and under the aegis of the United
  Nations Organization, to develop a spirit of community and a
  spirit of cooperation, and to return to collective economic
  disciplines.</p>

  <p>Finally, we have set forth some of the
  forms our activity will take: the organization of the
  distribution of raw materials and the fixing of the prices of
  basic products; the solution of the housing problem; the fight
  against restrictive practices in production by national and
  international cartels; and above all the effective participation
  of the organized workers in the management of social and economic
  affairs in every country in the world. Since this Congress is the
  most recent of the many manifestations of the desire for peace on
  the part of the free trade unions, I believe I could give no
  better conclusion to this survey of fifty years of trade-union
  activity in behalf of the rational organization of the world and
  of peace - which are absolutely inseparable - than by giving the
  final lines of this report practically unaltered.</p>

  <p>The free trade-union movement is called on
  to play an essential part in the fight against international
  crisis and for the advent of true peace. The scope of the task is
  enormous, matched only by its urgency. Our movement intends to
  devote its efforts to this task regardless of the cost. I might
  add that it was enormously encouraged by the recent interventions
  of the government delegates on the Third Committee of the present
  General Assembly of the United Nations. The Cuban delegate Mr.
  Ichaso, among others, showed that certain official circles had
  adopted the idea which we have been propagating for years and
  which we have already succeeded in putting into the Treaty of
  Versailles: the idea that economic disorder and misery are among
  the determinative causes of wars.</p>

  <p>The decision of the Committee of the
  Norwegian Parliament, which, in awarding me the Nobel Peace Prize
  for 1951, has recognized and proclaimed the importance and the
  steadfastness of the pacifist efforts of the trade unionists,
  cannot but greatly assist the spread of these ideas and
  considerably extend their sphere of influence. It strengthens the
  common will of those who have conceived and submitted these ideas
  to the consideration of men, and of those who have been convinced
  by them, to work ceaselessly to develop a society free of
  injustice and violence.</p>

  <p>We know well, alas, that men and their
  civilizations are mortal. We wish to leave to indifferent nature
  the responsibility of their demise and to free mankind at last
  from its remorse for having begotten Cain.</p>
