  <h1>Ernest Lawrence - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lawrence.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ernest Orlando Lawrence</b>
  was born on 8th August, 1901, at Canton, South Dakota (United
  States). His parents, Carl Gustavus and Gunda (n&eacute;e Jacobson)
  Lawrence, were the children of Norwegian immigrants, his father
  being a Superintendant of Schools. His early education was at
  Canton High School, then St. Olaf College. In 1919 he went to the
  University of South
  Dakota, receiving his B.A. in Chemistry in 1922. The
  following year he received his M.A. from the University of Minnesota.
  He spent a year at University of Chicago doing physics and was awarded his
  Ph.D. from Yale
  University in 1925. He continued at Yale for a further three
  years, the first two as a National Research Fellow and the third
  as Assistant Professor of Physics. In 1928 he was appointed
  Associate Professor of Physics at the University of
  California, Berkeley, and two years later he became
  Professor, being the youngest professor at Berkeley. In 1936 he
  became Director of the University's Radiation Laboratory as well,
  remaining in these posts until his death.<br>
  <br>
  During World War II he made vital contributions to the
  development of the atomic bomb, holding several official
  appointments in the project. After the war he played a part in
  the attempt to obtain international agreement on the suspension
  of atomic-bomb testing, being a member of the U.S. delegation at
  the 1958 Geneva Conference on this subject.<br>
  <br>
  Lawrence's research centred on nuclear physics. His early work
  was on ionization phenomena and the measurement of ionization
  potentials of metal vapours. In 1929 he invented the cyclotron, a
  device for accelerating nuclear particles to very high velocities
  without the use of high voltages. The swiftly moving particles
  were used to bombard atoms of various elements, disintegrating
  the atoms to form, in some cases, completely new elements.
  Hundreds of radioactive isotopes of the known elements were also
  discovered. His brother, Dr. John Lawrence, who became Director
  of the University's Medical Physics Laboratory, collaborated with
  him in studying medical and biological applications of the
  cyclotron and himself became a consultant to the Institute of
  Cancer Research at Columbia.<br>
  <br>
  Larger and more powerful versions of the cyclotron were built by
  Lawrence. In 1941 the instrument was used to generate
  artificially the cosmic particles called mesons, and later the
  studies were extended to antiparticles.<br>
  <br>
  Lawrence was a most prolific writer: during 1924-1940 his name
  appeared on 56 papers (an average of 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
  papers a year), showing his exceptional breadth of interest. He
  was also the inventor of a method for obtaining time intervals as
  small as three billionths of a second, to study the discharge
  phenomena of an electric spark. In addition he devised a very
  precise method for measuring the <i>e/m</i> ratio of the
  electron, one of the fundamental constants of Nature. Most of his
  work was published in <i>The Physical Review</i> and the
  <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Among his many awards may be mentioned the Elliott Cresson Medal
  of the Franklin
  Institute, the Comstock Prize of the National Academy of
  Sciences, the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society, the Duddell
  Medal of the Royal Physical Society, the Faraday Medal, and the
  Enrico Fermi Award. He was decorated with the Medal for Merit and
  was an Officer of the Legion of Honour. He held honorary
  doctorates of thirteen American and one British University
  (Glasgow). He was a member or fellow of many American and foreign
  learned societies.<br>
  <br>
  Lawrence married Mary Kimberly Blumer, daughter of the Emeritus
  Dean at Yale
  Medical School, in May 1932. They had six children. His
  recreations were boating, tennis, ice-skating, and music. He died
  on 27th August, 1958, at Palo Alto, California.</p>
