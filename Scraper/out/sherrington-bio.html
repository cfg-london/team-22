  <h1>Sir Charles Sherrington - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sherrington.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Charles Scott Sherrington</b> was born on November 27, 1857,
  at Islington, London. He was the son of James Norton Sherrington,
  of Caister, Great Yarmouth, who died when Sherrington was a young
  child. Sherrington's mother later married Dr. Caleb Rose of
  Ipswich, a good classical scholar and a noted archaeologist,
  whose interest in the English artists of the Norwich School no
  doubt gave Sherrington the interest in art that he retained
  throughout his life.<br>
  <br>
  In 1876 Sherrington began medical studies at St. Thomas's
  Hospital and in 1878 passed the primary examination of the
  Royal College
  of Surgeons, and a year later the primary examination for the
  Fellowship of that College. After a short stay at Edinburgh he
  went, in 1879, to Cambridge as a noncollegiate student studying
  physiology under Michael Foster, and in 1880 entered Gonville and Caius
  College there.<br>
  <br>
  In 1881 he attended a medical congress in London at which Sir
  Michael Foster discussed the work of Sir Charles Bell and others
  on the experimental study of the functions of nerves that was
  then being done in England and elsewhere in Europe. At this
  congress controversy arose about the effects of excisions of
  parts of the cortex of the brains of dogs and monkeys done by
  Ferrier and Goltz of Strasbourg. Subsequently, Sherrington worked
  on this problem in Cambridge with Langley, and with him published, in
  1884, a paper on it. In this manner Sherrington was introduced to
  the neurological work to which he afterwards devoted his
  life.<br>
  <br>
  In 1883 Sherrington became Demonstrator of Anatomy at Cambridge
  under Professor Sir George Humphrey, and during the winter
  session of 1883-1884 at St. Thomas's Hospital he demonstrated
  histology.<br>
  <br>
  The years 1884 and 1885 were eventful ones for Sherrington, for
  during the winter of 1884-1885 he worked with Goltz at
  Strasbourg, in 1884 he obtained his M.R.C.S., and in 1885 a First
  Class in the Natural Sciences Tripos at Cambridge with
  distinction. During this year he published a paper of his own on
  the subject of Goltz's dogs. In 1885 he also took his M.B. degree
  at Cambridge and in 1886 his L.R.C.P.<br>
  <br>
  In 1885 Sherrington went, as a member of a Committee of the
  Association for Research in Medicine, to Spain to study an
  outbreak of cholera, and in 1886 he visited the Venice district
  also to investigate the same disease, the material then obtained
  being examined in Berlin under the supervision of Virchow, who
  later sent Sherrington to <a href="../1905/index.html">Robert
  Koch</a> for a six weeks' course in technique. Sherrington stayed
  with Koch to do research in bacteriology for a year, and in 1887
  he was appointed Lecturer in Systematic Physiology at St.
  Thomas's Hospital, London, and also was elected a Fellow of
  Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In 1891 he was appointed
  in succession to Sir Victor Horsley, Professor and Superintendent
  of the Brown Institute for Advanced Physiological and
  Pathological Research in London. In 1895 he became Professor of
  Physiology at the University of Liverpool.<br>
  <br>
  During his earlier years in Cambridge, Sherrington, influenced by
  W. H. Gaskell and by the Spanish neurologist, <a href=
  "../1906/index.html">Ram&oacute;n y Cajal</a>, whom he had met
  during his visit to Spain, took up the study of the spinal cord.
  By 1891 his mind had turned to the problems of spinal reflexes,
  which were being much discussed at that time, and Sherrington
  published several papers on this subject and, during 1892-1894,
  others on the efferent nerve supply of muscles. Later, from
  1893-1897, he studied the distribution of the segmented skin
  fields, and made the important discovery that about one-third of
  the nerve fibres in a nerve supplying a muscle are efferent, the
  remainder being motor.<br>
  <br>
  At Liverpool he returned to his earlier study of the problem of
  the innervation of antagonistic muscles and showed that reflex
  inhibition played an important part in this. In addition to this,
  however, he was studying the connection between the brain and the
  spinal cord by way of the pyramidal tract, and he was at this
  time visited by the American surgeon Harvey Cushing, then a young
  man, who stayed with him for eight months.<br>
  <br>
  In 1906 he published his well-known book: <i>The Integrative
  Action of the Nervous System</i>, being his Silliman Lectures
  held at Yale
  University the previous year, and in 1913 he was invited to
  become Waynfleet Professor of Physiology at Oxford, a post for
  which he had unsuccessfully applied in 1895, and here he remained
  until his retirement in 1936. Here he wrote, and published in
  1919, his classic book entitled <i>Mammalian Physiology: a Course
  of Practical Exercises</i>, and here he regularly taught the
  students for whom this book was written.<br>
  <br>
  In physique Sherrington was a well-built, but not very tall man
  with a strong constitution which enabled him to carry out
  prolonged researches.<br>
  <br>
  During the First World War, as Chairman of the Industrial Fatigue
  Board, he worked for a time in a shell factory at Birmingham, and
  the daily shift of 13 hours, with a Sunday shift of 9 hours, did
  not, at the age of 57, tire him. From his early years he was
  short-sighted, but he often worked without spectacles.<br>
  <br>
  The predominant notes of his character as a man were his humility
  and friendliness and the generosity with which he gave to others
  his advice and valuable time. An interesting feature of him is
  that he published, in 1925, a book of verse entitled <i>The
  Assaying of Brabantius and other Verse</i>, which caused one
  reviewer to hope that &laquo;Miss Sherrington&raquo; would publish
  more verse. He was also sensitive to the music of prose, and this
  and the poet in him, but also the biologist and philosopher, were
  evident in his Rede Lecture at Cambridge in 1933 on <i>The Brain
  and its Mechanism</i>, in which he denied our scientific right to
  join mental with physiological experience.<br>
  <br>
  The philosopher in him ultimately found expression in his great
  book, <i>Man on his Nature</i>, which was the published title of
  the Gifford Lectures for 1937-1938, which Sherrington gave. As is
  well known, this book, published in 1940, centres round the life
  and views of the 16th century French physician Jean Fernel and
  round Sherrington's own views. In 1946 Sherrington published
  another volume entitled <i>The Endeavour of Jean
  Fernel</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Sherrington was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
  London in 1893, where he gave the Croonian Lecture in 1897, and
  was awarded the Royal Medal in 1905 and the Copley Medal in 1927.
  In 1922 the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire
  and in 1924 the Order of Merit were conferred upon him. He held
  honorary doctorates of the Universities of Oxford, London, Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester,
  Liverpool, Wales, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris, Strasbourg, Louvain, Uppsala, Lyons, Budapest, Athens, Brussels,
  Berne,
  Toronto,
  Montreal,
  and Harvard.<br>
  <br>
  As a boy and a young man Sherrington was a notable athlete both
  at Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich, where he went in 1871, and
  later at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, for which College
  he rowed and played rugby football; he was also a pioneer of
  winter sports at Grindelwald.<br>
  <br>
  In 1892 Sherrington married Ethel Mary, daughter of John Ely
  Wright, of Preston Manor, Suffolk. After some years of frail
  health, during which, however, he remained mentally very alert,
  he died suddenly of heart failure at Eastbourne in 1952.</p>
