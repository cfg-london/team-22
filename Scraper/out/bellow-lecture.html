  <p><br>I was a very contrary undergraduate more
  than 40 years ago. It was my habit to register for a course and
  then to do most of my reading in another field of study. So that
  when I should have been grinding away at "Money and Banking" I
  was reading the novels of Joseph Conrad. I have never had reason
  to regret this. Perhaps Conrad appealed to me because he was like
  an American - he was an uprooted Pole sailing exotic seas,
  speaking French and writing English with extraordinary power and
  beauty. Nothing could be more natural to me, the child of
  immigrants who grew up in one of Chicago's immigrant
  neighborhoods of course! - a Slav who was a British sea captain
  and knew his way around Marseilles and wrote an Oriental sort of
  English. But Conrad's <i>real</i> life had little oddity in it.
  His themes were straightforward - fidelity, command, the
  traditions of the sea, hierarchy, the fragile rules sailors
  follow when they are struck by a typhoon. He believed in the
  strength of these fragile-seeming rules, and in his art. His
  views on art were simply stated in the preface to <i>The Nigger
  of the Narcissus</i>. There he said that art was an attempt to
  render the highest justice to the visible universe: that it tried
  to find in that universe, in matter as well as in the facts of
  life, what was fundamental, enduring, essential. The writer's
  method of attaining the essential was different from that of the
  thinker or the scientist. These, said Conrad, knew the world by
  systematic examination. To begin with the artist had only
  himself; he descended within himself and in the lonely regions to
  which he descended, he found "the terms of his appeal". He
  appealed, said Conrad, "to that part of our being which is a
  gift, not an acquisition, to the capacity for delight and
  wonder... our sense of pity and pain, to the latent feeling of
  fellowship with all creation - and to the subtle but invincible
  conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of
  innumerable hearts... which binds together all humanity - the
  dead to the living and the living to the unborn."<br>
  <br>
  This fervent statement was written some 80 years ago and we may
  want to take it with a few grains of contemporary salt. I belong
  to a generation of readers that knew the long list of noble or
  noble-sounding words, words like "invincible conviction" or
  "humanity" rejected by writers like <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">Ernest Hemingway</a>. Hemingway spoke for
  the soldiers who fought in the First World War under the
  inspiration of <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html">Woodrow
  Wilson</a> and other rotund statesmen whose big words had to be
  measured against the frozen corpses of young men paving the
  trenches. Hemingway's youthful readers were convinced that the
  horrors of the 20th Century had sickened and killed humanistic
  beliefs with their deadly radiations. I told myself, therefore,
  that Conrad's rhetoric must be resisted. But I never thought him
  mistaken. He spoke directly to me. The feeling individual
  appeared weak - he felt nothing but his own weakness. But if he
  accepted his weakness and his separateness and descended into
  himself intensifying his loneliness, he discovered his solidarity
  with other isolated creatures.<br>
  <br>
  I feel no need now to sprinkle Conrad's sentences with skeptical
  salt. But there are writers for whom the Conradian novel - all
  novels of that sort - are gone forever. Finished. There is, for
  instance, M. Alain Robbe-Grillet, one of the leaders of French
  literature, a spokesman for "thingism" - <i>choseisme.</i> He
  writes that in great contemporary works, <a href=
  "../1964/index.html">Sartre's</a> <i>Nausea</i>, <a href=
  "../1957/index.html">Camus'</a> <i>The Stranger</i>, or Kafka's
  <i>The Castle,</i> there are no characters; you find in such
  books not individuals but - well, entities. "The novel of
  characters," he says, "belongs entirely in the past. It describes
  a period: that which marked the apogee of the individual." This
  is not necessarily an improvement; that Robbe-Grillet admits. But
  it is the truth. Individuals have been wiped out. "The present
  period is rather one of administrative numbers. The world's
  destiny has ceased, for us, to be identified with the rise and
  fall of certain men of certain families." He goes on to say that
  in the days of Balzac's bourgeoisie it was important to have a
  name and a character; character was a weapon in the struggle for
  survival and success. In that time, "It was something to have a
  face in a universe where personality represented both the means
  and the end of all exploration." But our world, he concludes, is
  more modest. It has renounced the omnipotence of the person. But
  it is more ambitious as well, "since it looks beyond. The
  exclusive cult of the 'human' has given way to a larger
  consciousness, one that is less anthropocentric." However, he
  comforts us, a new course and the promise of new discoveries lie
  before us.<br>
  <br>
  On an occasion like this I have no appetite for polemics. We all
  know what it is to be tired of "characters". Human types have
  become false and boring. D.H. Lawrence put it early in this
  century that we human beings, our instincts damaged by
  Puritanism, no longer care for, were physically repulsive to one
  another. "The sympathetic heart is broken," he said. He went
  further, "We stink in each other's nostrils." Besides, in Europe
  the power of the classics has for centuries been so great that
  every country has its "identifiable personalities" derived from
  Moli&egrave;re, Racine, Dickens or Balzac. An awful phenomenon.
  Perhaps this is connected with the wonderful French saying.
  <i>"Sil y a un caract&egrave;re, il est mauvais."</i> It leads one
  to think that the unoriginal human race tends to borrow what it
  needs from convenient sources, much as new cities have often been
  made out of the rubble of old ones. Then, too, the psychoanalytic
  conception of character is that it is an ugly rigid formation -
  something we must resign ourselves to, not a thing we can embrace
  with joy. Totalitarian ideologies, too, have attacked bourgeois
  individualism, sometimes identifying character with property.
  There is a hint of this in M. Robbe-Grillet's argument. Dislike
  of personality, bad masks, false being have had political
  results.<br>
  <br>
  But I am interested here in the question of the artist's
  priorities. Is it necessary, or good, that he should begin with
  historical analysis, with ideas or systems? Proust speaks in
  <i>Time Regained</i> of a growing preference among young and
  intelligent readers for works of an elevated analytical, moral or
  sociological tendency. He says that they prefer to Bergotte (the
  novelist in <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>) writers who seem
  to them more profound. "But," says Proust, "from the moment that
  works of art are judged by reasoning, nothing is stable or
  certain, one can prove anything one likes."<br>
  <br>
  The message of Robbe-Grillet is not new. It tells us that we must
  purge ourselves of bourgeois anthropocentricism and do the classy
  things that our advanced culture requires. Character? "Fifty
  years of disease, the death notice signed many times over by the
  serious essayists," says Robbe-Grillet, "yet nothing has managed
  to knock it off the pedestal on which the 19th century had placed
  it. It is a mummy now, but one still enthroned with the same
  phony majesty, among the values revered by traditional
  criticism."<br>
  <br>
  The title of Robbe-Grillet's essay is <i>On Several Obsolete
  Notions.</i> I myself am tired of obsolete notions and of mummies
  of all kinds but I never tire of reading the master novelists.
  And what is one to do about the characters in their books? Is it
  necessary to discontinue the investigation of character? Can
  anything so vivid in them now be utterly dead? Can it be that
  human beings are at a dead end? Is individuality really so
  dependent on historical and cultural conditions? Can we accept
  the account of those conditions we are so "authoritatively"
  given? I suggest that it is not in the intrinsic interest of
  human beings but in these ideas and accounts that the problem
  lies. The staleness, the inadequacy of these repels us. To find
  the source of trouble we must look into our own heads.<br>
  <br>
  The fact that the death notice of character "has been signed by
  the most serious essayists" means only that another group of
  mummies, the most respectable leaders of the intellectual
  community, has laid down the law. It amuses me that these serious
  essayists should be allowed to sign the death notices of literary
  forms. Should art follow culture? Something has gone wrong.<br>
  <br>
  There is no reason why a novelist should not drop "character" if
  the strategy stimulates him. But it is nonsense to do it on the
  theoretical ground that the period which marked the apogee of the
  individual, and so on, has ended. We must not make bosses of our
  intellectuals. And we do them no good by letting them run the
  arts. Should they, when they read novels, find nothing in them
  but the endorsement of their own opinions? Are we here on earth
  to play such games?<br>
  <br>
  Characters, Elizabeth Bowen once said, are not created by
  writers. They pre-exist and they have to be <i>found.</i> If we
  do not find them, if we fail to represent them, the fault is
  ours. It must be admitted, however, that finding them is not
  easy. The condition of human beings has perhaps never been more
  difficult to define. Those who tell us that we are in an early
  stage of universal history must be right. We are being lavishly
  poured together and seem to be experiencing the anguish of new
  states of consciousness. In America many millions of people have
  in the last forty years received a "higher education" - in many
  cases a dubious blessing. In the upheavals of the Sixties we felt
  for the first time the effects of up-to-date teachings, concepts,
  sensitivities, the pervasiveness of psychological, pedagogical,
  political ideas.<br>
  <br>
  Every year we see scores of books and articles which tell the
  Americans what a state they are in - which make intelligent or
  simpleminded or extravagant or lurid or demented statements. All
  reflect the crises we are in while telling us what we must do
  about them; these analysts are produced by the very disorder and
  confusion they prescribe for. It is as a writer that I am
  considering their extreme moral sensitivity, their desire for
  perfection, their intolerance of the defects of society, the
  touching, the comical boundlessness of their demands, their
  anxiety, their irritability, their sensitivity, their
  tendermindedness, their goodness, their convulsiveness, the
  recklessness with which they experiment with drugs and
  touch-therapies and bombs. The ex-Jesuit Malachi Martin in his
  book on the Church compares the modern American to Michelangelo's
  sculpture, <i>The Captive</i>. He sees "an unfinished struggle to
  emerge whole" from a block of matter. The American "captive" is
  beset in his struggle by "interpretations, admonitions,
  forewarnings and descriptions of himself by the self-appointed
  prophets, priests, judges and prefabricators of his travail,"
  says Martin.<br>
  <br>
  Let me take a little time to look more closely at this travail.
  In private life, disorder or near-panic. In families - for
  husbands, wives, parents, children - confusion; in civic
  behavior, in personal loyalities, in sexual practices (I will not
  recite the whole list; we are tired of hearing it) - further
  confusion. And with this private disorder goes public
  bewilderment. In the papers we read what used to amuse us in
  science fiction - <i>The New York Times</i> speaks of death rays
  and of Russian and American satellites at war in space. In the
  November Encounter so sober and responsible an economist as my
  colleague, <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1976/index.html">Milton
  Friedman</a>, declares that Great Britain by its public spending
  will soon go the way of poor countries like Chile. He is appalled
  by his own forecast. What - the source of that noble tradition of
  freedom and democratic rights that began with Magna Carta ending
  in dictatorship? "It is almost impossible for anyone brought up
  in that tradition to utter the word that Britain is in danger of
  losing freedom and democracy; and yet it is a fact!"<br>
  <br>
  It is with these facts that knock us to the ground that we try to
  live. If I were debating with Professor Friedman I might ask him
  to take into account the resistance of institutions, the cultural
  differences between Great Britain and Chile, differences in
  national character and traditions, but my purpose is not to get
  into debates I can't win but to direct your attention to the
  terrible predictions we have to live with, the background of
  disorder, the visions of ruin.<br>
  <br>
  You would think that one such article would be enough for a
  single number of a magazine but on another page of
  <i>Encounter</i> Professor Hugh Seton-Watson discusses George
  Kennan's recent survey of American degeneracy and its dire
  meaning for the world. Describing America's failure, Kennan
  speaks of crime, urban decay, drug-addiction, pornography,
  frivolity, deteriorated educational standards and concludes that
  our immense power counts for nothing. We cannot lead the world
  and, undermined by sinfulness, we may not be able to defend
  ourselves. Professor Seton-Watson writes, "Nothing can defend a
  society if its upper 100,000 men and women, both the
  decision-makers and those who help to mould the thinking of the
  decision-makers, are resolved to capitulate."<br>
  <br>
  So much for the capitalist superpower. Now what about its
  ideological adversaries? I turn the pages of Encounter to a short
  study by Mr. George Watson, Lecturer in English at Cambridge, on
  the racialism of the Left. He tells us that Hyndman, the founder
  of the Social Democratic Federation, called the South African war
  the Jews' war; that the Webbs at times expressed racialist views
  (as did Ruskin, Carlyle and T. H. Huxley before them); he relates
  that Engels denounced the smaller Slav peoples of Eastern Europe
  as counter-revolutionary ethnic trash; and Mr. Watson in
  conclusion cites a public statement by Ulrike Meinhof of the West
  German "Red Army Faction" made at a judicial hearing in 1972
  approving of "revolutionary extermination". For her, German
  anti-semitism of the Hitler period was essentially
  anticapitalist. "Auschwitz," she is quoted as saying, "meant that
  six million Jews were killed and thrown on the waste heap of
  Europe for what they were: money Jews (Geldjuden)."<br>
  <br>
  I mention these racialists of the Left to show that for us there
  is no simple choice between the children of light and the
  children of darkness. Good and evil are not symmetrically
  distributed along political lines. But I have made my point; we
  stand open to all anxieties. The decline and fall of everything
  is our daily dread, we are agitated in private life and tormented
  by public questions.<br>
  <br>
  And art and literature - what of them? Well, there is a violent
  uproar but we are not absolutely dominated by it. We are still
  able to think, to discriminate, and to feel. The purer, subtler,
  higher activities have not succumbed to fury or to nonsense. Not
  yet. Books continue to be written and read. It may be more
  difficult to reach the whirling mind of a modern reader but it is
  possible to cut through the noise and reach the quiet zone. In
  the quiet zone we may find that he is devoutly waiting for us.
  When complications increase, the desire for essentials increases
  too. The unending cycle of crises that began with the First World
  War has formed a kind of person, one who has lived through
  terrible, strange things, and in whom there is an observable
  shrinkage of prejudices, a casting off of disappointing
  ideologies, an ability to live with many kinds of madness, an
  immense desire for certain durable human goods - truth, for
  instance, or freedom, or wisdom. I don't think I am exaggerating;
  there is plenty of evidence for this. Disintegration? Well, yes.
  Much is disintegrating but we are experiencing also an odd kind
  of refining process. And this has been going on for a long time.
  Looking into Proust's <i>Time Regained</i> I find that he was
  clearly aware of it. His novel, describing French society during
  the Great War, tests the strength of his art. Without art, he
  insists, shirking no personal or collective horrors, we do not
  know ourselves or anyone else. Only art penetrates what pride,
  passion, intelligence and habit erect on all sides - the seeming
  realities of this world. There is another reality, the genuine
  one, which we lose sight of. This other reality is always sending
  us hints, which, without art, we can't receive. Proust calls
  these hints our "true impressions." The true impressions, our
  persistent intuitions, will, without art, be hidden from us and
  we will be left with nothing but a "terminology for practical
  ends which we falsely call life." Tolstoy put the matter in much
  the same way. A book like his Ivan Ilyitch also describes these
  same "practical ends" which conceal both life and death from us.
  In his final sufferings <i>Ivan Ilyitch</i> becomes an
  individual, a "character", by tearing down the concealments, by
  seeing through the "practical ends."<br>
  <br>
  Proust was still able to keep a balance between art and
  destruction, insisting that art was a necessity of life, a great
  independent reality, a magical power. But for a long time art has
  not been connected, as it was in the past, with the main
  enterprise. The historian Edgar Wind tells us in <i>Art and
  Anarchy</i> that Hegel long ago observed that art no longer
  engaged the central energies of man. These energies were now
  engaged by science - a "relentless spirit of rational inquiry."
  Art had moved to the margins. There it formed "a wide and
  splendidly varied horizon." In an age of science people still
  painted and wrote poetry but, said Hegel, however splendid the
  gods looked in modern works of art and whatever dignity and
  perfection we might find "in the images of God the Father and the
  Virgin Mary" it was of no use: we no longer bent our knees. It is
  a long time since the knees were bent in piety. Ingenuity, daring
  exploration, freshness of invention replaced the art of "direct
  relevance." The most significant achievement of this pure art, in
  Hegel's view, was that, freed from its former responsibilities,
  it was no longer "serious." Instead it raised the soul through
  the "serenity of form above any painful involvement in the
  limitations of reality." I don't know who would make such a claim
  today for an art that raises the soul above painful involvements
  with reality. Nor am I sure that at this moment, it is the spirit
  of rational inquiry in pure science that engages the central
  energies of man. The center seems (temporarily perhaps) to be
  filled up with the crises I have been describing.<br>
  <br>
  There were European writers in the 19th Century who would not
  give up the connection of literature with the main human
  enterprise. The very suggestion would have shocked Tolstoy and
  Dostoevski. But in the West a separation between great artists
  and the general public took place. They developed a marked
  contempt for the average reader and the bourgeois mass. The best
  of them saw clearly enough what sort of civilization Europe had
  produced, brilliant but unstable, vulnerable, fated to be
  overtaken by catastrophe, the historian Erich Auerbach tells us.
  Some of these writers, he says, produced "strange and vaguely
  terrifying works, or shocked the public by paradoxical and
  extreme opinions. Many of them took no trouble to facilitate the
  understanding of what they wrote - whether out of contempt for
  the public, the cult of their own inspiration, or a certain
  tragic weakness which prevented them from being at once simple
  and true."<br>
  <br>
  In the 20th Century, theirs is still the main influence, for
  despite a show of radicalism and innovation our contemporaries
  are really very conservative. They follow their l9th-Century
  leaders and hold to the old standard, interpreting history and
  society much as they were interpreted in the last century. What
  would writers do today if it would occur to them that literature
  might once again engage those "central energies", if they were to
  recognize that an immense desire had arisen for a return from the
  periphery, for what was simple and true?<br>
  <br>
  Of course we can't come back to the center simply because we want
  to; but the fact that we are wanted might matter to us and the
  force of the crisis is so great that it may summon us back to
  such a center. But prescriptions are futile. One can't tell
  writers what to do. The imagination must find its own path. But
  one can fervently wish that they - that we - would come back from
  the periphery. We do not, we writers, represent mankind
  adequately. What account do Americans give of themselves, what
  accounts of them are given by psychologists, sociologists,
  historians, journalists, and writers? In a kind of contractual
  daylight they see themselves in the ways with which we are so
  desperately familiar. These images of contractual daylight, so
  boring to Robbe-Grillet and to me, originate in the contemporary
  world view: We put into our books the consumer, civil servant,
  football fan, lover, television viewer. And in the contractual
  daylight version their life is a kind of death. There is another
  life coming from an insistent sense of what we are which denies
  these daylight formulations and the false life - the death in
  life - they make for us. For it is false, and we know it, and our
  secret and incoherent resistance to it cannot stop, for that
  resistance arises from persistent intuitions. Perhaps humankind
  cannot bear too much reality, but neither can it bear too much
  unreality, too much abuse of the truth.<br>
  <br>
  We do not think well of ourselves; we do not think amply about
  what we are. Our collective achievements have so greatly
  "exceeded" us that we "justify" ourselves by pointing to them. It
  is the jet plane in which we commonplace human beings have
  crossed the Atlantic in four hours that embodies such value as we
  can claim. Then we hear that this is closing time in the gardens
  of the West, that the end of our capitalist civilization is at
  hand. Some years ago Cyril Connolly wrote that we were about to
  undergo "a complete mutation, not merely to be defined as the
  collapse of the capitalist system, but such a sea-change in the
  nature of reality as could not have been envisaged by Karl Marx
  or Sigmund Freud." This means that we are not yet sufficiently
  shrunken; we must prepare to be smaller still. I am not sure
  whether this should be called intellectual analysis or analysis
  by an intellectual. The disasters are disasters. It would be
  worse than stupid to call them victories as some statesmen have
  tried to do. But I am drawing attention to the fact that there is
  in the intellectual community a sizeable inventory of attitudes
  that have become respectable - notions about society, human
  nature, class, politics, sex, about mind, about the physical
  universe, the evolution of life. Few writers, even among the
  best, have taken the trouble to re-examine these attitudes or
  orthodoxies. Such attitudes only glow more powerfully in Joyce or
  D.H. Lawrence than in the books of lesser men; they are
  everywhere and no one challenges them seriously. Since the
  Twenties, how many novelists have taken a second look at D.H.
  Lawrence, or argued a different view of sexual potency or the
  effects of industrial civilization on the instincts? Literature
  has for nearly a century used the same stock of ideas, myths,
  strategies. "The most serious essayists of the last fifty years,"
  says Robbe-Grillet. Yes, indeed. Essay after essay, book after
  book, confirm the most serious thoughts - Baudelairian,
  Nietzschean, Marxian, Psychoanalytic, etcetera, etcetera - of
  these most serious essayists. What Robbe-Grillet says about
  character can be said also about these ideas, maintaining all the
  usual things about mass society, dehumanization and the rest. How
  weary we are of them. How poorly they represent us. The pictures
  they offer no more resemble us than we resemble the reconstructed
  reptiles and other monsters in a museum of paleontology. We are
  much more limber, versatile, better articulated, there is much
  more to us, we all feel it.<br>
  <br>
  What is at the center now? At the moment, neither art nor science
  but mankind determining, in confusion and obscurity, whether it
  will endure or go under. The whole species - everybody - has
  gotten into the act. At such a time it is essential to lighten
  ourselves, to dump encumbrances, including the encumbrances of
  education and all organized platitudes, to make judgments of our
  own, to perform acts of our own. Conrad was right to appeal to
  that part of our being which is a gift. We must hunt for that
  under the wreckage of many systems. The failure of those systems
  may bring a blessed and necessary release from formulations, from
  an over-defined and misleading consciousness. With increasing
  frequency I dismiss as merely respectable opinions I have long
  held - or thought I held - and try to discern what I have really
  lived by, and what others live by. As for Hegel's art freed from
  "seriousness" and glowing on the margins, raising the soul above
  painful involvement in the limitations of reality through the
  serenity of form, that can exist nowhere now, during this
  struggle for survival. However, it is not as though the people
  who engaged in this struggle had only a rudimentary humanity,
  without culture, and knew nothing of art. Our very vices, our
  mutilations, show how rich we are in thought and culture. How
  much we know. How much we even feel. The struggle that convulses
  us makes us want to simplify, to reconsider, to eliminate the
  tragic weakness which prevented writers - and readers - from
  being at once simple and true.<br>
  <br>
  Writers are greatly respected. The intelligent public is
  wonderfully patient with them, continues to read them and endures
  disappointment after disappointment, waiting to hear from art
  what it does not hear from theology, philosophy, social theory,
  and what it cannot hear from pure science. Out of the struggle at
  the center has come an immense, painful longing for a broader,
  more flexible, fuller, more coherent, more comprehensive account
  of what we human beings are, who we are, and what this life is
  for. At the center humankind struggles with collective powers for
  its freedom, the individual struggles with dehumanization for the
  possession of his soul. If writers do not come again into the
  center it will not be because the center is pre-empted. It is
  not. They are free to enter. If they so wish.<br>
  <br>
  The essence of our real condition, the complexity, the confusion,
  the pain of it is shown to us in glimpses, in what Proust and
  Tolstoy thought of as "true impressions". This essence reveals,
  and then conceals itself. When it goes away it leaves us again in
  doubt. But we never seem to lose our connection with the depths
  from which these glimpses come. The sense of our real powers,
  powers we seem to derive from the universe itself, also comes and
  goes. We are reluctant to talk about this because there is
  nothing we can prove, because our language is inadequate and
  because few people are willing to risk talking about it. They
  would have to say, "There is a spirit" and that is taboo. So
  almost everyone keeps quiet about it, although almost everyone is
  aware of it.<br>
  <br>
  The value of literature lies in these intermittent "true
  impressions". A novel moves back and forth between the world of
  objects, of actions, of appearances, and that other world from
  which these "true impressions" come and which moves us to believe
  that the good we hang onto so tenaciously - in the face of evil,
  so obstinately - is no illusion.<br>
  <br>
  No one who has spent years in the writing of novels can be
  unaware of this. The novel can't be compared to the epic, or to
  the monuments of poetic drama. But it is the best we can do just
  now. It is a sort of latter-day lean-to, a hovel in which the
  spirit takes shelter. A novel is balanced between a few true
  impressions and the multitude of false ones that make up most of
  what we call life. It tells us that for every human being there
  is a diversity of existences, that the single existence is itself
  an illusion in part, that these many existences signify
  something, tend to something, fulfill something; it promises us
  meaning, harmony and even justice. What Conrad said was true, art
  attempts to find in the universe, in matter as well as in the
  facts of life, what is fundamental, enduring, essential.</p>
