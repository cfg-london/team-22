  <h2>The Development of Vaccines against Yellow Fever</h2>

  <p>The study of yellow fever may be divided
  into two periods. The first one occurred at the turn of the
  century when Walter Reed and his co-workers showed by the use of
  human volunteers that the causative agent of this disease was a
  filterable virus and that it was transmitted by the bite of the
  common urban mosquito, subsequently named <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.
  The second period began in 1928, when Stokes, Bauer, and Hudson
  found that the common Indian rhesus monkey was susceptible to
  yellow fever, thus making available an animal that could be used
  in the laboratory. The first strain of yellow fever established
  by these workers is known as the Asibi strain, named after the
  patient from whom it was isolated. It has been used extensively
  in yellow fever work and, as will be shown later, was the parent
  strain from which the 17D vaccine was eventually produced.</p>

  <p>It was shortly after monkeys were found
  susceptible that, in searching for a less expensive and more
  readily available experimental animal, I found that the common
  white mouse was susceptible to the virus if inoculated by the
  intracerebral route. This method of inoculation was chosen as it
  was generally conceded that the common laboratory animals could
  not become infected if inoculated by the usual routes. The strain
  of virus with which this work was done was isolated by Mathis,
  Sellards, and Laigret in 1928 in Dakar, French West Africa, is
  known as the French strain, and, like the Asibi, is highly
  virulent for rhesus monkeys. The disease in mice was an
  encephalomyelitis with no involvement of the visceral organs, in
  contrast to that induced in man and monkey, in which the liver,
  kidney, and heart are involved. By serial passage in mice, the
  pathogenic action of the virus was altered in two respects.
  Firstly, the incubation period became progressively shortened
  until, after many passages, it became constant, or, to use the
  term introduced by Pasteur in his work on rabies, it became
  fixed. Now the incubation period in mice is used as a measure of
  the degree of neurotropism for these animals. Secondly, with the
  increase of virulence for the nervous system of mice, there was
  also evidence of a progressive loss of virulence for rhesus
  monkeys when inoculated parenterally. This loss of virulence for
  monkeys first suggested the possibility of the use of an
  attenuated active virus for the immunization of man. The finding
  that by mouse brain passage the virulence of yellow fever virus
  could be altered led me to undertake extensive studies on the
  variations induced in the virus by different laboratory
  procedures, which became my main scientific activity for several
  years. The results of only those experiments which are pertinent
  to the development of vaccines will be discussed here.</p>

  <p>The finding of the susceptibility of mice
  and its attenuation for monkeys was rapidly confirmed by others.
  It was shown that many, if not all, strains of yellow fever are
  pathogenic for mice, and this animal came into widespread use in
  all yellow fever work. The pathogenicity of unmodified strains
  for mice varied greatly - ranging from the highly neurotropic
  Asibi virus to the relatively avirulent French strain. Both of
  these, as noted before, are highly pathogenic for rhesus monkeys
  and almost invariably produce a fatal disease when inoculated
  parenterally. With most strains it was shown that the mouse could
  be used for the quantitative estimation of virus. This proved of
  great value, for as strains of virus avirulent for monkeys were
  developed, the mouse was the only animal by which the presence
  and amount could be readily determined.</p>

  <p>In my early work it was clearly shown that
  mice could be used for determining the presence of yellow fever
  antibodies in sera. Standardized tests for antibodies by the use
  of these animals were soon evolved by Sawyer and Lloyd, and
  myself. These have proved of great value in the study of the
  epidemiology and distribution of yellow fever and eventually in
  testing the efficacy of different vaccines as these became
  available.</p>

  <p>In considering the possibility of using the
  modified mouse-adapted virus for human immunization, although it
  was clear that it had become markedly attenuated for monkeys when
  inoculated by parenteral routes, the discovery was made by
  Sellards, and Lloyd and Penna that the virus had acquired marked
  neurotropic affinities for these animals and produced a fatal
  encephalitis when inoculated into their brains. There was thus
  the possibility that the virus, if used as a vaccine, although it
  had lost the power of inducing a serious visceral disease, might
  induce an infection of the nervous system. Reasons for this
  possibility were clearly shown in experiments in monkeys. When
  these animals were inoculated subcutaneously with the
  mouse-adapted virus, they usually remained well, and developed a
  solid immunity to a subsequent inoculation of a highly virulent
  strain. The inoculation of the adapted virus was shown to produce
  a mild systemic infection with the production of specific
  antibodies; in fact, it acted like a vaccine. In an occasional
  animal, however, after the systemic infection had run its course,
  an encephalitis developed which was invariably fatal. This
  encephalitis was due to the mouse-adapted yellow fever virus.</p>

  <p>In the development of vaccines for human
  beings, using my mouse-adapted virus, two paths were followed. In
  the first, used chiefly by French workers, virus alone was
  inoculated; and in the second, used by American and English
  workers, virus and human immune serum were inoculated
  simultaneously. The first immunizations of humans using
  mouse-adapted neurotropic virus alone were reported by Sellard
  and Laigret (1932). Several severe reactions were reported, and
  the method was modified by Laigret, who introduced the procedure
  of giving three inoculations at twenty-day intervals of virus
  which had been exposed for four days, two days, and one day,
  respectively, to a temperature of 20&ordm; C. That this method
  consisted essentially of the inoculation of three graded doses of
  fully virulent neurotropic virus and not of attenuated virus, as
  thought by Laigret, was shown by Whitman and myself. These early
  vaccines, using the neuroadapted virus alone, though producing a
  satisfactory immunity, were, nevertheless, not considered
  entirely safe because of the serious reactions associated in some
  cases with signs of involvement of the central nervous system.
  Further investigations by French workers, however, finally led to
  a safe and efficient method of vaccination, which is at present
  used on a very large scale in the French territories in Africa.
  This method introduced by Peltier and his co-workers (1939)
  consists of applying the mouse-adapted virus to the scarified
  skin. In retrospect, it seems probable that the early severe
  reactions were due to the use of a virus which, although it had
  undergone a considerable degree of modification, was nevertheless
  not sufficiently attenuated for safe use in man. At the present
  time this method of vaccination is usually combined with vaccinia
  virus. A mixture of both viruses is applied to the scarified
  skin, and the individual is thus immunized to the two agents at
  the same time. Many millions of people have been immunized thus
  without any very serious reactions having been reported.</p>

  <p>The other early method of vaccination using
  the mouse-adapted virus consisted in the simultaneous inoculation
  of the virus and human immune serum. This method was based on the
  observation that an active immunity was readily induced in
  monkeys by the simultaneous inoculation of highly virulent yellow
  fever virus and immune serum. After extensive experiments in
  monkeys, using the mouse-adapted virus and immune serum, Sawyer,
  Kitchen, and Lloyd introduced this method for the immunization of
  persons working with yellow fever virus, thus bringing to an end
  the long series of laboratory infections that had taken such a
  heavy toll. Though the reactions to the vaccine were, in general,
  very mild, it should be noted that one very serious reaction with
  signs of involvement of the brain occurred like those reported by
  the French workers following the use of the virus alone. This
  method, however, had a very serious disadvantage in that it could
  not be used on an extensive scale because of the large quantities
  of human immune serum required.</p>

  <p>Investigations were accordingly undertaken
  - on the one hand to find a substitute for the human immune serum
  and on the other hand to develop a more attenuated strain of
  virus. The first was readily achieved, and various workers
  succeeded in producing high-titer horse, rabbit, goat, and monkey
  immune sera. Experiments in monkeys by Whitman and myself showed
  that by the use of a hyperimmune serum the quantity used for
  human vaccination could be considerably reduced. Of the
  hyperimmune sera, those produced in monkeys by Smith and myself
  proved the most satisfactory and were used fairly extensively for
  some time. Reactions were few and mild and antibody production
  satisfactory. The main advantage, however, lay merely in the fact
  that only a few cubic centimeters were necessary for each
  individual vaccinated, whereas previously from 35 to 40 cc. of
  human serum were needed. The method was still cumbersome and
  entirely impractical for large-scale immunization. This had
  become an urgent problem as the epidemiological entity known as
  "jungle yellow fever" had been discovered. Classical urban yellow
  fever, transmitted by the common yellow fever mosquito, <i>Aedes
  aegypti</i>, can be readily controlled by antimosquito measures.
  Jungle yellow fever, on the other hand, occurs in the country
  districts, sometimes in vast epidemics, and in the absence of
  <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. The only rational method of protection of
  the exposed population called for large-scale vaccination.</p>

  <p>In further attempts to attenuate yellow
  fever virus, the method of tissue culture was investigated. The
  cultivation of the French neurotropic virus was readily achieved
  by Haagen and myself and later by Lloyd, Ricci, and myself by the
  use of chick embryo tissue. Extensive experiments for several
  years with this virus strain in a variety of culture media did
  not lead to any further attenuation. In attempts to cultivate an
  unadapted strain of virus, great difficulty was encountered, but
  this was finally achieved by Lloyd, Ricci, and myself by using a
  fluid medium, the tissue component of which consisted of minced
  mouse-embryo tissue. Prolonged cultivation of the Asibi virus in
  this medium induced a marked change in its virulence; in fact, it
  became so attenuated that when inoculated parenterally into
  monkeys it no longer caused death. What was considered of equal
  significance was that the culture virus did not become more
  neurotropic; in fact, it was less neurotropic for experimental
  animals than the mouse-adapted French virus then in use for human
  vaccination. However, it was not considered sufficiently
  attenuated in both these attributes to be used for human
  immunization alone without the simultaneous inoculation of immune
  serum. This cultured virus, known as 17E, was consequently
  substituted by Lloyd for the French neurotropic virus. This
  method proved satisfactory.</p>

  <p>In the culture experiments, attempts were
  made to propagate the virus in as wide a variety of tissues as
  possible, in the hope that in one the desired attenuation of both
  the viscerotropic as well as the neurotropic affinities would
  occur. While it was plain that the viscerotropic affinity could
  be readily reduced either by mouse brain passage or by prolonged
  tissue culture, what was particularly desired was a method of
  reducing the neurotropism. On the theory that since the virus
  becomes more neurotropic when maintained for a long time in brain
  tissue (as by passage in mice) it might lose this affinity if
  cultivated in the absence of nerve tissue, experiments were
  undertaken to determine the influence of nervous tissue on the
  prolonged culture of the virus. For this purpose, three parallel
  series of tissue cultures were maintained, all containing chick
  embryo tissue but differing in the amount of nervous tissue. In
  the first, the tissue component consisted of minced whole-chick
  embryo; in the second, chick embryo brain only was used; whereas
  the third series contained minimal amounts of nervous tissue
  consisting of minced chick embryo from which the brain and spinal
  cord had been cut away before mincing.</p>

  <p>The Asibi virus with which all these
  culture experiments were undertaken is highly pathogenic, not
  only for monkeys by parenteral inoculation but also for mice by
  intracerebral inoculation; that is, its viscerotropic as well as
  its neurotropic affinities are highly developed. These properties
  made it suitable for culture experiments as any change induced
  could be readily determined. The culture experiments to date had
  shown that the viscerotropic affinity of the Asibi strain could
  be readily reduced without at the same time producing a change in
  the neurotropic affinity. Since strains of yellow fever virus as
  they occur in nature vary enormously in these two attributes, it
  was reasoned that if strains possessing less marked affinities
  were cultivated, then possibly the desired attenuation would
  occur. Numerous attempts to cultivate strains of yellow fever
  virus with low viscerotropic or neurotropic affinities at first
  ended in failure. However, success was eventually achieved by
  Smith and myself. Experiments had shown that when embryo mice in
  utero are inoculated with yellow fever, the virus has a
  predilection for the brain. By the use of mouse embryo brain as
  the tissue component in the cultures, seven different strains of
  yellow fever were readily cultivated. Only two of these, the
  unmodified French strain and the JSS, a strain isolated from a
  case of jungle yellow fever, were extensively studied. After
  their establishment in this medium, the possibility of
  cultivating them in other tissues was investigated. At first
  these attempts were unsuccessful, but eventually cultures were
  obtained in a medium containing minced whole-mouse embryo and
  finally in media containing chick embryo tissue prepared either
  from whole embryos or from embryos from which the central nervous
  system had been cut away before mincing. Three parallel series of
  cultures were maintained for several hundred subcultures of these
  two strains of virus, the tissue components of the cultures
  being, respectively, mouse embryo brain, minced whole-chick
  embryo, and chick embryos from which the central nervous system
  had been cut away before mincing. We thus had three different
  yellow fever strains (the Asibi, the unmodified French, and the
  JSS) of widely divergent tissue affinities running concurrently
  in several media containing varying amounts of nervous
  tissue.</p>

  <p>Before these new culture experiments had
  progressed very far, a very marked change in pathogenicity was
  observed in the Asibi virus grown in the medium, the tissue
  component of which was chick embryo containing minimal amounts of
  nervous tissue. This is called the 17D strain. This attenuation
  consisted in a partial loss of neurotropism for mice and monkeys,
  as well as a marked loss of viscerotropism for monkeys. Monkeys
  inoculated intracerebrally developed a mild encephalitis which as
  a rule was non-fatal. This was the much hoped-for change, as both
  the strains then in use for human immunization, namely, the
  French neurotropic virus and the 17E variant of the Asibi virus,
  cultivated in mouse embryo tissue, invariably produced a fatal
  encephalitis when inoculated into the brains of rhesus
  monkeys.</p>

  <p>The marked loss of viscerotropism of the
  17D culture virus was clearly shown in experiments in monkeys. As
  a rule monkeys inoculated with the virus by extraneural routes
  developed no fever or other signs of illness and in their blood
  only minimal amounts of virus could be demonstrated. Such monkeys
  were shown to develop specific antibodies and to be solidly
  immune to the highly virulent Asibi strain.</p>

  <p>After extensive experiments in monkeys by
  Smith and myself, the 17D strain was used for human vaccination
  without the simultaneous inoculation of immune serum. It was
  considered that the loss of both the viscerotropic as well as
  neurotropic affinities as demonstrated in monkeys made this the
  virus of choice for human vaccination. In a preliminary study we
  showed that reactions in man were either absent or minimal and
  that satisfactory antibody response was obtained. Smith, Penna,
  and Paoliello, in Brazil, made a more thorough and more extensive
  study of the reaction in man. The results were eminently
  satisfactory. The 17D virus has been used as a vaccine in many
  millions of individuals.</p>

  <p>In the two parallel series of cultures with
  the Asibi virus in which whole-chick tissue and chick embryo
  brain only were used, no such marked attenuation occurred. Both
  of these viruses, after several hundred subcultures, produced
  fatal encephalitis in monkeys when inoculated intracerebrally and
  both produced a rather severe visceral infection. These results
  suggested that the amount of nervous tissue was the conditioning
  factor which produced the change, as loss of neurotropism
  occurred only in a medium containing minimal amounts of nervous
  tissue. It was considered at the time that these findings were a
  confirmation of the hypothesis on which the culture experiments
  had been planned.</p>

  <p>Consequently, in order to obtain more
  information on the role of nervous tissue, I started three new
  series of tissue cultures. Virus taken from the culture series
  that had been maintained in chick brain only and virus that had
  been cultivated in whole-chick embryo were grown in two new
  series of cultures, the tissue component of which contained
  minimal amounts of nervous tissue; and, conversely, the 17D
  virus, which had been grown in a medium containing minimal
  amounts of nervous tissue, was transferred to a medium containing
  chick embryo brain only. At the time of the conclusion of the
  experiment, more than 200 subcultures in the new series had been
  made. At intervals, monkeys were inoculated intracerebrally to
  determine the neurotropism of the cultivated virus. The results
  showed that no modification had occurred. Thus the 17D strain,
  cultivated for more than 200 subcultures in chick embryo brain,
  had not become more neurotropic, and the virus at the beginning
  and the end of the series was essentially the same in
  pathogenicity. In like manner, the other two strains, which, it
  will be recalled, produced fatal encephalitis in monkeys at the
  beginning of these culture experiments, did not lose their
  neurotropism even though maintained for more than 200 subcultures
  in a medium containing minimal amounts of nervous tissue. The
  conclusion was obvious that the relative amounts of nervous
  tissue present in the media had not produced any demonstrable
  change.</p>

  <p>The reason for the rapid change noticed in
  the 17D strain, which occurred between the 89th and 114th
  subcultures, was and still is completely unknown. However, these
  experiments indicate that once the mutant had occurred, it was
  relatively stable.</p>

  <p>What was apparently a similar mutant was
  reported subsequently by Penna and Moussatch&eacute; (1939). These
  workers maintained the Asibi virus in series in the developing
  chick embryo and noted a similar marked attenuation. In their
  experiments a marked loss of neurotropism occurred in spite of
  the fact that in the developing chick embryo the virus shows a
  marked affinity for the brain and multiplies readily there.</p>

  <p>Our experiments with the Asibi virus in
  tissue culture may be summarized as follows. In one of the series
  of cultures, a sudden modification. occurred. The evidence is
  that this change was not due to the relative absence of nervous
  tissue in the medium, nor could chick embryo tissue <i>per se</i>
  be responsible as the change occurred in only one of six series
  of cultures containing chick embryo tissue.</p>

  <p>The results with two other strains of
  yellow fever, the French and JSS, which were cultivated in media
  containing varying amounts of nervous tissue are briefly as
  follow. The French viscerotropic virus was cultured for several
  hundred subcultures in three different media, the tissue
  component of which consisted of, respectively, mouse-embryo
  brain, minced whole-chick embryo, and minced chick-embryo
  containing minimal amounts of nervous tissue. The results showed
  that the viscerotropism was rapidly lost, but there was no such
  extreme attenuation as was observed in the 17D virus. On the
  contrary, it appeared that an actual increase of neurotropism had
  taken place in all three parallel cultures, irrespective of the
  quantity of nervous tissue in the medium.</p>

  <p>In the culture experiments with the JSS
  strain, maintained for over three hundred subcultures in the same
  media as were used for the French virus, the neurotropism tended
  to decrease in all three series. However, the least decrease was
  observed in the virus cultured in the medium containing minimal
  amounts of nervous tissue. The viscerotropism of the virus grown
  in the medium containing minced whole-chick tissue became so
  decreased that on inoculation subcutaneously it failed to produce
  an infection even when administered in large doses. This is the
  most extreme case of attenuation so far observed in any yellow
  fever virus. The loss of infectivity of this highly attenuated
  strain for monkeys inoculated subcutaneously recalls a somewhat
  similar, though not so marked, change that occurred in one of the
  17D culture series, which became so attenuated for man that it
  failed in a fair proportion of cases to produce immunity.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we may summarize the culture
  experiments by stating that any yellow fever virus maintained in
  tissue culture will become attenuated somewhat in its
  viscerotropic affinities, irrespective of the tissue used. The
  neurotropic affinity as a rule does not change. Occasionally,
  however, for some unknown reason, a mutant appears with marked
  reduction in both neurotropism as well as viscerotropism. This
  mutant is comparatively stable, but it too has been observed to
  undergo change on two occasions. The first time, as reported by
  Soper and Smith, the cultured virus was found to have become so
  attenuated that it failed to produce immunity in a fair
  proportion of persons vaccinated, and the second time, noted by
  Fox and his co-workers, the virus had regained some neurotropism
  so that it actually produced encephalitis in a small proportion
  of persons vaccinated.</p>

  <p>In comparing the two vaccines at present in
  use - viz., the French vaccine and the 17D - it may be stated
  that both vaccines produce an actual infection and a resulting
  immunity. The infection produced by the French vaccine is more
  severe than that produced by the 17D, as manifested both by
  subjective symptoms as well as by the amount of circulating
  virus. As a consequence of this relatively severe infection
  induced by the French vaccine, antibody production is more
  regular than after the extremely mild infection induced by the
  17D vaccine. Only time will tell which of the two is to be
  preferred.</p>

  <p>By the intelligent application of
  antimosquito measures combined with vaccination, public-health
  officials have now the means available to render what was once a
  prevalent epidemic disease to one which is now a comparatively
  rare infection of man.</p>
