  <h2>Discontinuous Structure of Matter</h2>

  <p>Since I have the great honour to have to
  summarize here the work which has enabled me to receive the high
  international distinction awarded by the Swedish Academy of
  Sciences, I shall speak of the "discontinuous structure of
  matter".</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>A fluid such as air or water seems to us at
  first glance to be perfectly homogeneous and continuous; we can
  put more water or less water into this glass, and the experiment
  seems to suggest to us that the amount of water contained in it
  can vary by an infinitely small amount, which is the same as
  saying that water is "indefinitely divisible". Similarly, a
  sphere of glass or of quartz, a crystal of alum, are received by
  our senses as being perfectly continuous, and particularly when
  we see this alum crystal growing in a supersaturated solution,
  each of the planes bounding the crystal moves parallel to itself
  in a continuous manner.</p>

  <p>However, this can be taken for granted only
  up to the degree of subtlety reached by the resolving power of
  our senses which, for example, would certainly be unable to
  distinguish between two positions of the crystal face one
  millionth of a millimetre apart. Beyond the things which our
  senses separate in this manner, our imagination remains free, and
  ever since ancient times, just as the philosophers who started
  from the " full" or the "void", has hesitated between two
  hypotheses.</p>

  <p>For the former, matter remains continuous:
  "full", not only (as is reasonable and probable) a little beyond
  this domain on our scale where our senses make it appear as such,
  but indefinitely.</p>

  <p>For the latter, who were the first
  atomists, all matter consists of minute grains separated by empty
  gaps; not any hypothesis has been formulated for the structure of
  these grains themselves, <i>atoms</i>, which were considered as
  indestructible constituent elements of the Universe.</p>

  <p>Lastly, and doubtless always, but
  particularly at the end of the last century, certain scholars
  considered that since the appearances on our scale were finally
  the only important ones for us, there was no point in seeking
  what might exist in an inaccessible domain. I find it very
  difficult to understand this point of view since what is
  inaccessible today may becomes accessible tomorrow (as has
  happened by the invention of the microscope), and also because
  coherent assumptions on what is still invisible may increase our
  understanding of the visible.</p>

  <p>Indeed, increasingly numerous and strong
  reasons have come to support a growing probability, and it can
  finally be said the certainty, in favour of the hypothesis of the
  atomists.</p>

  <p>There is, first of all, the familiar
  observation of solutions; we all say, for example, that sugar and
  water are present in sugar water, although it is impossible to
  distinguish the different parts in it. And similarly, we
  <i>recognize</i> quite simply bromine in chloroform. This can be
  understood if the bromine and the chloroform are formed
  respectively by very small particles in continuous movement which
  can intermingle with one another without losing their
  individuality. Those elementary constituent particles, those
  <i>molecules</i>, are probably of the same kind, like articles
  made in series, for each <i>pure substance</i> (defined by its
  resistance to the fractionation test) or even more surely for
  each definite <i>chemical species</i> (experiment proves that it
  is never necessary to consider a continuous sequence of chemical
  species), and we come to formulate the molecular hypothesis by
  saying that for a sufficient magnification any fluid appears to
  us as formed by molecules in continuous movement which impinge
  ceaselessly upon one another, and of which there are as many
  distinct varieties as chemical species can be recognized in the
  fluid under consideration.</p>

  <p>These molecules which exist in the mixtures
  are not indestructible since they must disappear (or appear) when
  a chemical reaction causes the chemical species which they
  constitute to disappear (or appear); when a mixture of hydrogen
  and oxygen explodes to give water, the molecules of hydrogen and
  oxygen certainly have to disappear at the same time as the water
  molecules appear. But we know that the decomposition of chemical
  species, when carried out as far as possible, has led to the
  experimental definition of a small number of <i>simple bodies</i>
  which can always be recovered, without any change in their
  nature, and without loss or gain of mass, from combinations in
  which they have been introduced. It is then very difficult not to
  assume that, for example, one and the same substance "exists" in
  all the chemical species from which the simple substance hydrogen
  can be regained and which passes, disguised but indestructible,
  through our various reactions. Dalton supposed, and this is the
  essential point of the atomic hypothesis, that this substance is
  formed by a definite variety of particles which are all identical
  and which cannot be cut into pieces in the reactions which we can
  produce, and which for this reason are called <i>atoms</i>. There
  are, therefore, one or several atoms of hydrogen in each molecule
  of a hydrogenated chemical species.</p>

  <p>The fundamental laws of chemistry which are
  well known to you and which are laws of discontinuity
  (discontinuity between chemical species, and discontinuous
  variation according to the " multiple proportions" in the
  composition of species made from the same simple bodies) then
  become immediately clear: they are imposed solely by the
  condition that the molecule constituting a compound contains a
  necessarily whole number of atoms of each of the simple bodies
  combined in this compound. And I do not need to tell you that if
  one admits that " analogous " bodies (alkali halides, for
  example) must have analogous formulae, simple chemical analysis
  will give for the elements of the same " family" the ratios of
  the weights of the atoms, or "atomic weights", of these
  elements.</p>

  <p>But in order to pass from one family to
  another, from hydrogen to oxygen for example, it was necessary to
  have the gas laws and Avogadro's hypothesis or law which I recall
  because my researches are based on it: when one of those cases
  occurs where the ratios of the weights of the molecules of the
  two compounds are known, it is found that masses proportional to
  these masses (which must, therefore, contain the same number of
  molecules) occupy equal volumes in the gaseous state under the
  same conditions of temperature and pressure. This means that as
  far as these substances are concerned, equal numbers of heavy or
  light molecules develop equal pressures at the same temperature
  and in equal volumes. Since the mass of a molecule, and not its
  nature, must affect the impact of the molecule upon the wall, I
  see here a justification (not yet agreed, I must say) of the
  following proposition known as Avogadro's postulate, or
  hypothesis:</p>

  <p><i>When gaseous masses, at the same
  temperature and pressure, occupy equal volumes, they all contain
  the same number of molecules.</i></p>

  <p>These "equimolecular" masses are determined
  for the various chemical species, as soon as one of them has been
  chosen. They are called <i>gram-molecules</i> when the masses in
  the gaseous state occupy, at the same temperature and pressure,
  the same volume as 32 grams of oxygen. The number N of the
  molecules constituting any gram-molecule is <i>Avogadro's
  number</i>. For each simple substance the gram-molecule of a
  compound contains as many gram-atoms as the molecule contains
  atoms of this simple substance, and the gram-atom is the product
  of the mass of the atom and Avogadro's number <i>N</i>.</p>

  <p>In short, if molecules and atoms exist,
  their relative weights are known to us, and their absolute
  weights would be known at the same time as Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>You also know how - particularly for
  understanding substitutions - it was assumed that the atoms of a
  molecule are held together by <i>valences</i> of which each
  unites only two atoms, a kind of bolt holding rigidly together
  two bars or protuberances which pre-exist on the two atoms. A new
  detail is thus introduced here to the concept of the atom, but
  once this new hypothesis is accepted, the structural formulae can
  be determined for an enormous number of compounds, and with such
  success in regard to forecasting the properties that it could be
  said that the hundreds of thousands of structural formulae set up
  by the organic chemists constitute just as many arguments in
  favour of the atomic theory.</p>

  <p>These brilliant successes tell us,
  otherwise, nothing about the absolute weights of the atoms. If
  they all became at the same time a thousand times smaller, a
  milliard times smaller, infinitesimal in the mathematical sense
  of the word, with matter becoming again continuous at each
  reduction, our chemical laws and our formulae would be unchanged,
  and the idea of the atom, then driven back infinitely far beyond
  all experimental reach, would lose its interest and its
  reality.</p>

  <p>It will be noted that the laws of
  <i>crystallography</i>, which are laws of discontinuity just as
  the fundamental laws of chemistry, lead to similar considerations
  in regard to the dimensions of an elementary cell which is
  repeated periodically along the three dimensions of a
  parallelepipedic lattice and should constitute the crystal which
  is homogeneous in appearance on our scale. Only in this way can
  one understand how the symmetries of crystals are soley those of
  reticular systems (for example, never symmetry axes of the order
  of 5), and explain at the same time the law of rational indices
  (a kind of laws of multiple proportions which describe what
  discontinuities separate the possible faces), a law which
  requires the three dimensions of the elementary parallelepiped to
  be in definite ratios. Here again the grain of matter could
  become infinitely small without the laws having to be
  changed.</p>

  <p>In short, in order really to establish the
  Atomic Theory, it was necessary to obtain the weights and
  dimensions of the atoms and not only their ratios. A remarkably
  successful attempt to do this was made about fifty years ago by
  the physicists who created the <i>kinetic theory of gases</i> by
  assuming that gases are made of elastic molecules which are on
  the average fairly widely separated from one another so that,
  between two collisions, each molecule can move in a straight
  line, the duration of the collision being negligible in relation
  to that of the <i>free path</i>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, if it is agreed that the
  pressure of a gas on a wall is solely due to the impacts of the
  molecules upon this wall, and if we write that this (known)
  pressure must consequently be numerically equal to the impulse
  exerted perpendicularly on the wall by the molecules impinging
  against unit surface in unit time, an equation is obtained which
  shows the mean velocity of the gas molecules.</p>

  <p>It is also known that if, in a gas, a rigid
  plane is made to slide parallel to a fixed plane at a distance
  <i>D</i> and with a constant velocity <i>V</i>, each intermediate
  layer at a distance <i>d</i> from the fixed plane is involved
  with a velocity equal to <i>V</i>(<i>d/D</i>), and that the fixed
  and moving planes are drawn in opposite directions by forces (per
  unit surface) equal to the product of the velocity gradient
  <i>V/D</i> and a fixed factor for each gas, the latter measuring
  the <i>viscosity</i> of this gas (at the temperature of the
  experiment). This is readily understood from the kinetic theory:
  the unit surface of the fixed plane is drawn in the direction of
  the movement by a force numerically equal to the total excess
  impulse received in this direction, this excess being
  proportional to the number of impinging molecules (in other
  words, both to the density and to the mean molecular velocity
  which we can determine), and proportional to the mean excess
  impulse of each impinging molecule; this individual mean excess
  is itself proportional to the distance of the layer in which the
  molecule was at the time of the previous impact, and consequently
  to the <i>mean free path</i>. In this way it is seen how Maxwell
  was able to deduce this <i>mean free path</i> from the
  experimental determination of the viscosity.</p>

  <p>Now, as Clausius observed, the molecules
  are all the smaller as the mean free path (now known) becomes
  greater (if the molecules were reduced to points, they would
  never collide with one another). And it is seen, therefore, that
  if the free path is known, it is possible to calculate the
  <i>total surface</i> of the molecules which form a given mass of
  gas. The <i>total volume</i> of these same molecules is probably
  little different from the volume occupied by this mass if it were
  solidified. Finally, from two obvious equations we derive both
  the number and the diameter of the molecules which constitute,
  let us say, a gram-molecule of the gas.</p>

  <p>Depending on the gas, the diameters found
  in this way are graded between 2 and 5 ten-millionths of a
  millimetre; and the values found for Avogadro's number are
  between 40 x 10<sup>22</sup> and 120 x 10<sup>22</sup>. The
  uncertainty is largely 100 per cent, both because of the
  inaccuracy of certain measurements and especially because the
  calculations have been simplified by making assumptions which can
  only be approximate. But the order of magnitude is achieved: an
  atom vanishes in our substance almost as the latter would vanish
  in the sun</p>

  <p>The sequence of reasonings which I have
  just summarized deserves our profound admiration; however, they
  were not sufficient to carry conviction owing to the uncertainty
  which in spite of everything existed not only in the simplifying
  assumptions (sphericalness of the molecules, for example), but in
  the very hypotheses on which the reasoning is based. This
  conviction will without doubt come to life if entirely different
  paths lead us to the same values for the molecular sizes.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>The Brownian movement</h4>

  <p>Let us consider a liquid in equilibrium:
  the water contained in this glass, for example. It appears to us
  homogeneous and continuous, and immobile in all its parts. If we
  place in it a denser object, it falls, and we know quite well
  that once it has arrived at the bottom of the glass, it stays
  there and is unlikely to ascend again "by itself".</p>

  <p>We could have observed this water before it
  reached equilibrium, and to see how it reached it, at the moment
  when we filled this glass; then we should have been able to find
  (by observing the visible indicator dust which was specially
  mixed with the water) that the movement of the various parts of
  the water which were coordinated at first in parallel movements,
  became more and more uncoordinated by scattering in all
  directions between smaller and smaller parts until the whole
  appeared completely immobile (nothing prevents us as yet from
  assuming that this scattering will continue without limit).</p>

  <p>It is very remarkable that these so
  familiar ideas become false on the scale of the observations
  which we can make under a microscope: each microscopic particle
  placed in water (or any other liquid), instead of falling in a
  regular manner exhibits a continuous and perfectly irregular
  agitation. It goes to and fro whilst turning about, it rises,
  falls, rises again, without tending in any way towards repose,
  and maintaining indefinitely the same mean state of agitation.
  This phenomenon which was predicted by Lucretius, suspected by
  Buffon, and established with certainty by Brown, constitutes the
  <i>Brownian movement</i>.</p>

  <p>The nature of the grains is not important,
  but the smaller a grain is, the more violently does it become
  agitated. There is also complete independence between the
  movements of two grains, even if they are very close together,
  which excludes the hypothesis of collective convection produced
  by the impacts or temperature differences. We are, finally,
  forced to think that each grain only follows the portion of
  liquid surrounding it, in the same way that an indicating buoy
  indicates and analyses the movement all the better if it is
  smaller: a float follows the movement of the sea more faithfully
  than a battleship.</p>

  <p>We obtain from this an essential property
  of what is called a liquid in equilibrium: <i>its repose is only
  an illusion due to the imperfection of our senses, and what we
  call equilibrium is a certain well-defined permanent system of a
  perfectly irregular agitation.</i> This is an experimental fact
  in which no hypothesis plays any part.</p>

  <p>Since this agitation remains on an average
  constant (it would be possible to make this "impression" accurate
  by measurements), the movement possessed by a part of the liquid
  does not scatter without limit in all directions between smaller
  and smaller parts, in spite of what observations made on our
  scale suggest to us; this spreading does not go beyond a certain
  limit for which, at each moment, just as much movement is
  coordinated as becomes uncoordinated.</p>

  <p>This is explainable if the liquid consists
  of elastic grains, and I do not see how it can be understood if
  the structure is continuous. Moreover, it is seen that the
  agitation for a given observable particle must increase with the
  size of the molecules: the magnitude of the Brownian movement,
  therefore, will probably enable us to calculate the molecular
  sizes.<a href="#footnote">*</a></p>

  <p>In short, the Brownian movement (an
  experimental fact) leads us to the hypothesis of the molecules;
  and we then understand quite well how each particle that is
  situated in a liquid and is being bombarded ceaselessly by
  neighbouring molecules, receives shocks which on the whole have
  all the less change of coming to equilibrium as the particle
  becomes smaller, with the result that this particle must be
  tossed to and fro irregularly.</p>

  <p>This applies to absolutely whatever kind of
  particle. If it has been possible to bring into suspension in a
  liquid a large number of particles all of the same nature, we say
  that an emulsion has been produced. This emulsion is stable if
  the particles in suspension do not stick together when the
  hazards of the Brownian movement bring them into contact, and if
  they re-enter the liquid when these hazards bring them against
  the walls or to the surface. From this two-fold point of view
  such a <i>stable emulsion</i> is comparable to a <i>solution</i>.
  It is precisely by pursuing this analogy that I have been able to
  obtain a simple determination of the molecular sizes.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Extension of the gas laws to emulsions</h4>

  <p>I must, first of all, recall how the gas
  laws and particularly Avogadro's law came to be regarded, thanks
  to Van 't Hoff, as applicable to dilute solutions.</p>

  <p>The pressure exerted by a gas on the walls
  limiting its expansion becomes, for a dissolved substance, the
  <i>osmotic pressure</i> exerted on <i>semi-permeable</i> walls
  which allow the solvent to pass, but hold back this dissolved
  substance. Such is a membrane of copper ferrocyanide which
  separates sugared water from pure water.</p>

  <p>Now, the measurements of Pfeffer show that
  in fact the equilibrium exists only if there is a certain excess
  pressure from the side on which the sugar is, and Van 't Hoff has
  pointed out that the value of this excess pressure or osmotic
  pressure is precisely that of the pressure which would be
  exerted, in accordance with Avogadro's law, on the wall of the
  container containing the sugared water if the sugar present could
  occupy the entire container alone and in the gaseous state. It is
  then probable that the same would occur with every dissolved
  substance, but we do not need to recall the thermodynamic
  reasoning with which Van 't Hoff justified this generalization
  nor to make other measurements of the osmotic pressure: Arrhenius
  has indeed shown that every substance which, in solution,
  confirms the well-known Raoult laws through its freezing
  temperature and its vapour pressure, necessarily exerts through
  this very fact the pressure predicted by Van 't Hoff on every
  wall which halts it without halting the solvent. In short, the
  Raoult laws which were established by a very large number of
  measurements, are logically equivalent to the law of Van't Hoff
  which consists in the extension of Avogadro's law to solutions,
  and we can now say:</p>

  <p><i>Equal numbers of molecules, regardless
  of the kind, in the gaseous state or dissolved, exert - at the
  same temperature and in equal volumes - equal pressures on the
  walls detaining them.</i></p>

  <p>This law applies equally to heavy or light
  molecules, in such manner that, for example, the molecule of
  quinine which contains more than one hundred atoms, has neither a
  greater nor a lesser effect when it impinges against the wall
  than the light molecule of hydrogen which contains two atoms.</p>

  <p>I have thought that it was perhaps valid
  for stable emulsions with visible grains, in such manner that
  each of these grains which is agitated by the Brownian movement,
  counts as a molecule when it collides with a wall.</p>

  <p>Let us assume then that we can measure the
  osmotic pressure which equal grains exert, through their Brownian
  movement, against a unit of a wall which holds them up and allows
  water to pass (let us say blotting paper). Let us also assume
  that we can count these grains in the immediate vicinity of the
  wall unit, that is to say that we know the "abundance" of the
  grains per unit volume near this wall unit. This number <i>n</i>
  also measures the abundance of molecules in any gas (let us say
  hydrogen) which would exert the same pressure on the walls of the
  container in which it would be enclosed. If, for example, the
  osmotic pressure measured is the hundred-millionth of a barye, we
  shall know that a cubic centimetre of hydrogen under normal
  conditions (pressure equal to a million baryes) contains 100
  million million times n molecules (10<sup>14</sup> <i>n</i>). And
  the gram-molecule (22,412 c.c. in the gaseous state under normal
  conditions) will contain 22,412 times more molecules: this number
  will be <i>Avogadro's number</i>.</p>

  <p>This is very simple; but how to measure the
  stupendously weak osmotic pressure that an emulsion exerts?</p>

  <p>This will, in fact, not be necessary nor,
  as we have just explained, will it be necessary to measure the
  osmotic pressure of a solution to make sure that this solution
  obeys the gas laws. And it will be sufficient for us to find an
  experimentally accessible property for emulsions which would be
  logically equivalent to the gas laws.</p>

  <p>I found such a property (1908) by extending
  to emulsions the fact that is qualitatively well known to you,
  that in a vertical column of a gas in equilibrium the density
  decreases as the altitude increases.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Law of the vertical distribution of an emulsion</h4>

  <p>We all know that air is more rarefied at
  the top of a mountain than at sea level and, generally speaking,
  he pressure of air has to diminish as one goes higher since this
  pressure has then to carry only a smaller part of the atmosphere
  which applies its weight against the earth.</p>

  <p>If we specify this slightly vague reasoning
  in the Laplace manner, we shall say that each horizontal slice of
  a gas in equilibrium in a large vertical pump would remain in
  equilibrium if it were imprisoned between two rigid pistons
  (which would no longer allow exchange of molecules between this
  slice and the neighbouring slices of the gas) and these pistons
  would exert respectively the pressures existing at the lower face
  and at the upper face of the slice; with the result that, per
  unit surface, the difference of these pressures is equal to the
  weight of the gas supported. That is to say that if the thickness
  d<i>h</i> of the slice is sufficiently small so that the
  abundance of molecules near the upper face differs little from
  the abundance <i>n</i> near the lower face, the pressure
  difference d<i>p</i> between the two faces will be equal to
  <i>n</i> <font face="Symbol">p</font> d<i>h</i>, where
  <font face="Symbol">p</font> denotes the weight of a
  molecule.</p>

  <p>This very simple equation expresses two
  important facts: first of all, as the abundance <i>n</i> of
  molecules is proportional to the pressure <i>p</i> at each given
  temperature, we see that for a column of a given gas (for a given
  <font face="Symbol">p</font>) and of uniform temperature, the
  relative reduction of the pressure d<i>p/p</i>, or also the
  relative reduction of the abundance d<i>n/n</i> which can be said
  to measure the rarefaction, always has the same value for the
  same difference in level d<i>h</i>, whatever this level may be.
  For example, each time that you climb a flight of stairs, the
  pressure in the air (or the abundance of molecules) is reduced by
  one forty-thousandth of its value. Adding these effects for each
  step, we see that at whatever level we were originally, each time
  we ascend by the same height, the pressure (or the density) in
  air at a uniform temperature will be divided by the same number;
  for example, in oxygen at 0&deg; the rarefaction will be doubled
  for each rise of 5 kilometres.</p>

  <p>The other fact which emerges immediately
  from our equation relates to the weight <font face=
  "Symbol">p</font> of the molecule; for the same value of level
  d<i>h</i>, the rarefaction d<i>p/p</i> (or d<i>n/n</i>) varies in
  inverse ratio with the weight of the molecule. Adding here again
  the effects for each step, we see that in two different gases at
  the same temperature, the rises producing the same rarefaction
  are in inverse ratio to the molecular weights. For example, as we
  know that the oxygen molecule (if it exists, and in accordance
  with the laws summarized above) must weigh 16 times more than the
  hydrogen molecule, it is necessary to rise 16 times higher in
  hydrogen than in oxygen, i.e. 80 kilometres, for the rarefaction
  to be doubled.</p>

  <p>You can appreciate the influence of the
  altitude, and of the molecular weight, on the rarefaction by
  looking at this schematic picture where I have drawn three
  gigantic vertical test tubes (the highest is 300 kilometers)
  containing equal numbers of hydrogen molecules, helium molecules,
  and oxygen molecules. At a uniform temperature the molecules
  would be distributed as shown in the drawing, being more numerous
  near the bottom as they increase in weight.</p>

  <p>Let us now admit that Avogadro's law
  applies to emulsions as it does to gases.</p>

  <p>We assume, therefore, that we have a stable
  emulsion made of equal grains which is left to itself at a
  constant temperature, being only under the influence of its own
  weight. We can repeat the previous reasoning with the only change
  that the intergranular space, instead of being void, is now a
  liquid which exerts on each grain, in an opposite direction to
  its weight, a push in accordance with Archimedes' principle.
  Consequently, the effective weight z of the gram to which this
  reasoning is applied, is its actual weight reduced by this
  push.</p>

  <p>If now our generalization is justified,
  once the emulsion is in equilibrium it will produce <i>a
  miniature atmosphere of visible molecules</i> where equal rises
  will be accompanied by equal rarefactions. But if, for example,
  the rise in the emulsion to double the rarefaction is a milliard
  times less than in oxygen, it means that the effective weight of
  the grain is a milliard times greater than that of the oxygen
  molecule. It will, therefore, be sufficient to determine the
  effective weight of the visible grain (which forms links between
  the magnitudes on our scale and the molecular magnitudes) in
  order to obtain by a simple ratio the weight of any molecule, and
  consequently Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>It is in this sense that I carried out my
  experiments which I was able to do successfully.</p>

  <p>I first prepared stable emulsions made from
  solid (vitreous) spheres of various resins in suspension in a
  liquid (generally water). This was done by dissolving the resin
  in alcohol and adding to this limpid solution a large amount of
  water. The resin is quite insoluble in the water and is then
  precipitated as microscopic spherules of all sizes. By means of
  prolonged centrifuging similar to those in which the red blood
  corpuscles are separated from the blood serum, it is possible to
  collect these grains as a consistent deposit which splits up
  again as a stable emulsion of distinct spherules when it is
  agitated in the pure water after the supernatant alcohol solution
  has been removed.</p>

  <p>It was then necessary, starting with an
  emulsion where the grains are of very different size, to succeed
  in separating these grains according to size in order to have
  <i>uniform</i> emulsions (consisting of equal grains). The
  process which I used can be compared with fractional
  distillation: just as, in a distillation, the fractions which
  come off first are richer in the most volatile constituents, so
  in a centrifuging of a <i>pure</i> emulsion (spherules of the
  same substance), the parts which settle out first are richer in
  coarse grains, and this is a method of separating the grains
  according to size by proceeding according to rules which it would
  be unnecessary to elaborate here. It is also necessary to be
  patient: I treated in my most careful fractionation one kilogram
  of gamboge and obtained after several months of daily operations
  a fraction containing several decigrams of grains with a diameter
  of approximately three-quarters of a thousandth of a millimetre
  which was appreciably equal to what I had wanted to obtain.</p>

  <p>If a droplet of a very dilute emulsion made
  with such equal grains is allowed to evaporate on the slide under
  a microscope, the grains are seen, when the evaporation is almost
  complete (and doubtless as a result of capillary action), to run
  and join together in regular lines just as cannon-balls in a
  horizontal row of a pile of cannon-balls.</p>

  <p>You can see this on the photograph which is
  now projected. And you will understand how it is possible
  simultaneously to obtain a successful centrifuging and to measure
  the mean diameter of the grain of the emulsion. (Other processes
  are, moreover, possible.)</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there is no difficulty
  in determining the density of the glass constituting the
  spherules (several processes: the most correct consists in
  suspending the grains in a solution which is just so dense that
  the centrifuging cannot separate the grains).</p>

  <p>We then know everything necessary for
  calculating the effective weight of the grain of the
  emulsion.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we shall have studied
  the equilibrium distribution of the emulsion under the action of
  gravity. For this we imprison a drop of the emulsion in a
  well-closed dish (evaporation must be impossible) arranged for
  microscopic observation. The distribution of the grains is at
  first uniform, but it is found that the grains accumulate
  progressively in the lower layers until a limiting distribution
  is reached with reversible settling or expansion depending on
  whether the temperature is lowered or raised. There are two
  possible methods of observation, as shown in the drawing
  projected here. In one method (the horizontal microscope) the
  rarefaction of the emulsion is obtained immediately from the
  height, and the resemblance to a miniature atmosphere is
  extremely striking, precise measurements being possible from
  instantaneous photographs. But it is then difficult to give the
  emulsion a height lower than, shall we say, one millimetre, and
  the time needed for establishing a permanent state becomes long
  (several days) which involves complications and difficulties.</p>

  <p>In the other method of observation the
  microscope is vertical, and the emulsion imprisoned between the
  slide and the cover-glass has now a thickness only of the order
  of a tenth of a millimetre. We take an objective of high
  magnifying power and weak focal depth so that a very thin
  horizontal layer of the emulsion (of the order of 2 microns) is
  clearly seen, and an instantaneous photograph is taken. We thus
  have the abundance at a certain level (as an aviator could take
  the density of air at every level). The abundances at different
  levels are then compared at our leisure.</p>

  <p>The success is complete. Before insisting
  that it is so, I can show a cinematographic film on which you
  will see for yourselves the equilibrium distribution of an
  emulsion formed from spherules which are agitated by the Brownian
  movement.</p>

  <p>The observations and the countings which
  this film summarizes for you prove that the laws of ideal gases
  apply to dilute emulsions. This generalization was predicted as a
  consequence of the molecular hypothesis by such simple reasoning
  that its verification definitely constitutes a very strong
  argument in favour of the existence of molecules. In particular,
  it was necessary - it can be verified effectively, and it is very
  remarkable - that the various emulsions studied lead, within the
  limit of the possible errors, to the same value for Avogadro's
  number. In fact, I changed (with the valuable assistance of
  Bjerrum, Dabrovski, and Bruhat) the mass of the grains (from 1 to
  50), their nature (gamboge, mastic), their density (1.20 to
  1.06), the nature of the intergranular liquid (water, strongly
  sugared water, glycerol in the upper layers of which the grains
  of mastic, being lighter, accumulated) and lastly the temperature
  (from -9&deg; to +60&deg;). My most careful measurements made
  with an emulsion the rarefaction of which doubled with each rise
  of 6 microns, gave a value for <i>N</i> of 68 X
  10<sup>22</sup>.</p>

  <p>The accuracy of such determinations, so far
  of several hundredths, can certainly be improved: the same does
  not apply to values obtained from the kinetic theory of gases,
  because here perfecting the measurements would not diminish the
  uncertainties inherent in the simplifying assumptions which were
  introduced to facilitate the calculations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Non-diluted emulsions</h4>

  <p>Proceeding then further in tracing the
  similarities between liquids and emulsions, I was able to show
  (1913) that a non-diluted emulsion is comparable to a compressed
  liquid of which the molecules would be visible.</p>

  <p>For this purpose it was necessary to
  determine the osmotic pressure as a function of the concentration
  when the gas laws cease to be applicable. Let us, therefore,
  consider a vertical column of emulsion which extends upwards
  practically without limit. At each level the osmotic pressure can
  be regarded as supporting the whole of the grains above it, and
  we shall, therefore, know it by counting all these grains. The
  emulsion will be imprisoned between two vertical plate glasses
  only several microns apart so that all the grains can be taken by
  an instantaneous photograph. The concentration of the grams at
  each level is, on the other hand, fixed by the known number of
  grains present in a small known volume near this level. In short,
  we shall in this way know the pressure corresponding to a known
  concentration: this will give experimentally the law of
  compressibility which can then be compared with Van der Waals'
  law.</p>

  <p>Rene Costantin made these measurements
  under my direction and confirmed that Van der Waals' law applies
  to emulsions which are already too concentrated to conform to the
  gas laws. The resulting value for Avogadro's number is 62 x
  10<sup>22</sup>.</p>

  <p>Even Van der Waals' law is no longer
  suitable for concentrations above 3 per cent, but the
  compressibility remains measurable, consequently the law of
  compressibility remains known empirically.</p>

  <p>This enables - and this idea was due
  entirely to Ren&eacute; Costantin who died for France in 1915 - a
  theory of Smoluchovski to be checked on the density fluctuations
  which the molecular agitation should produce in a liquid in
  equilibrium. According to this theory, the <i>fluctuation</i>
  <i>(n'-n)/n</i> in a volume containing accidentally <i>n'</i>
  molecules whilst it should contain only <i>n</i> if the
  distribution were uniform, has a mean value which can be
  calculated if the compressibility of the liquid is known, and
  which includes Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>For our emulsions of equal grains,
  considered as fluids with visible molecules, the measurements of
  osmotic compressibility, carried out as far as a content of 7 per
  cent, have confirmed Smoluchovski's theory by giving
  approximately 60 X 10<sup>22</sup> for Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Measurements of the Brownian movement</h4>

  <p>The equilibrium distribution of an emulsion
  is due to the Brownian movement, and the more rapidly as this
  movement is more active. But this rapidity is not important for
  the final distribution. In fact, as we have just seen, I also
  studied the distribution first on the permanent state without
  making any measurement on the Brownian movement. But by means of
  such measurements it is possible, though in a less obvious
  manner, to demonstrate the discontinuous structure of matter and
  to obtain a determination of Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>It is due to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> and
  Smoluchovski that we have a kinetic theory of the Brownian
  movement which lends itself to verification.</p>

  <p>Without being disturbed by the intricate
  path described by a grain within a given time, these physicists
  characterize the agitation by the rectilinear segment joining the
  point of departure with the point of arrival, the segment being
  on an average greater as the agitation is livelier. This segment
  will be the <i>displacement</i> of the grain during the time
  considered.</p>

  <p>If we then admit that the Brownian movement
  is <i>perfectly irregular</i> at right angles to the vertical, we
  prove that the mean horizontal displacement of a grain is doubled
  when the duration of the displacement is quadrupled, and is
  tenfold if that duration becomes a hundredfold, and so forth.
  This means that the mean square of the horizontal displacement is
  proportional to the duration t of this displacement. This can
  easily be verified.</p>

  <p>Now, this mean square is equal to twice the
  mean square <img src="fig1b.gif" width="12" height="11" alt=" ">
  of the projection of the displacement on an arbitrary horizontal
  axis. Consequently, the mean value of the quotient <img src=
  "fig2b.gif" width="22" height="10" alt=" "> for a given grain
  remains constant. Obviously, since it increases as the grain is
  more agitated, this mean quotient characterizes <i>the activity
  of the Brownian movement</i>.</p>

  <p>Having said this, there must be a
  <i>diffusion</i> for the grains of an emulsion just as for the
  molecules of a solution; Einstein shows that the coefficient of
  diffusion should be equal to the half of the number which
  measures the activity of the agitation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the steady state in a
  vertical column of emulsion is produced and maintained by the
  interplay of two opposing actions, gravity and the Brownian
  movement; this can be expressed by writing that at each level the
  flow through diffusion towards the poor regions is equal to that
  which gravity produces towards the rich regions.</p>

  <p>In order to calculate the flow by diffusion
  it must be admitted, as we have done, that grains or molecules
  are equivalent to each other in regard to the osmotic pressures;
  in order to calculate the flow produced by gravity, in the case
  of spherules of radius <i>a</i>, it must be admitted, though at
  first it appeared uncertain, that the (very weak) mean velocity
  of fall of a grain animated by a very active Brownian movement
  can still be calculated by "Stokes' law" which applies to the
  uniform fall in a viscous liquid of a large sphere which is
  practically not animated by a Brownian movement. In fact, I have
  since shown experimentally that this is so.</p>

  <p>Having admitted this hypothesis, Einstein
  finds that the diffusion coefficient <img src="fig3b.gif" width=
  "31" height="13" alt=" "> is equal to <i>(RT/N)</i>
  (6<font face="Symbol">p</font><i>az</i>)<sup>-1</sup> (<i>R</i>
  being the gas constant, <i>T</i> the absolute temperature, and
  <i>z</i> the viscosity).</p>

  <p>So far we have thought of the
  <i>translational</i> Brownian movement only. Now a grain rotates
  at the same time as it is displaced. Einstein was able to show
  that if <img src="fig4b.gif" width="12" height="10" alt=" ">
  denotes the mean square in a time <i>t</i> of the component of
  the angle of rotation around an axis, the agitation coefficient
  of rotation <img src="fig5b.gif" width="22" height="10" alt=" ">
  is fixed for the same grain and should be equal to (<i>RT/N</i>)
  (4<font face=
  "Symbol">p</font><i>a</i><sup>3</sup><i>z</i>)<sup>-1</sup>. His
  reasoning implies equality between <i>the mean energy of
  translation</i> and <i>the mean energy of rotation</i> which was
  predicted by Boltzmann and which we shall make more probable if
  we succeed in confirming this equation.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>These theories can be judged by experiment
  if we know how to <i>prepare spherules of a measurable
  radius</i>. I was, therefore, in a position to attempt this check
  as soon as I knew, thanks to Langevin, of the work of
  Einstein.</p>

  <p>I must say that, right at the beginning,
  Einstein and Smoluchovski had pointed out that the order of
  magnitude of the Brownian movement seemed to correspond to their
  predictions. And this approximate agreement gave already much
  force to the kinetic theory of the phenomenon, at least in broad
  outline.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to say anything more
  precise so long as spherules of known size had not been prepared.
  Having such grains, I was able to check Einstein's formulae by
  seeing whether they led always to the same value for Avogadro's
  number and whether it was appreciably equal to the value already
  found.</p>

  <p>This is obtained for the displacements by
  noting on the camera lucida (magnification known) the horizontal
  projections of the same grain at the beginning and at the end of
  an interval of time equal to the duration chosen, in such a
  manner as to measure a large number of displacements, for example
  in one minute.</p>

  <p>In several series of measurements I varied,
  with the aid of several collaborators, the size of the grains (in
  the ratio of I to 70,000) as well as the nature of the liquid
  (water, solutions of sugar or urea, glycerol) and its viscosity
  (in the ratio of 1 to 125). They gave values between 55 x
  10<sup>22</sup> and 72 x 10<sup>22</sup>, with differences which
  could be explained by experimental errors. The agreement is such
  that it is impossible to doubt the correctness of the kinetic
  theory of the translational Brownian movement.</p>

  <p>It must otherwise be observed that although
  it is didactically of comparable difficulty to the kinetic theory
  of the viscosity of gases, Einstein's theory does not introduce
  simplifying approximations and, like the measurement of height
  distribution, lends itself to a precise determination of
  Avogadro's number.</p>

  <p>My most careful measurements which gave me
  <i>N</i> equal to 69 x 10<sup>22</sup> had been made on grains
  which, for reasons which are no longer of interest, had their
  initial position at 6 <i>&micro;</i> from the bottom of the
  preparation. In the course of the verifications which I had asked
  Ren&eacute; Costantin to make on preparations which were only
  several microns thick, he found that the vicinity of a wall
  slowed down the Brownian movement. The measurements made at a
  distance from the walls gave a value for <i>N</i> of 64 x
  10<sup>22</sup>.</p>

  <p>With regard to the <i>rotational</i>
  Brownian movement, Einstein's formula predicts a mean rotation of
  approximately 8&deg; per hundredth of a second for spheres of 1
  <i>&micro;</i> diameter, a rotation which is too rapid to be
  perceived and which - with greater reason - escapes measurement.
  And, in fact, this rotation had not been made the subject of any
  experimental study, at least not quantitatively. (Einstein did
  not suppose that his formula could be verified.)</p>

  <p>I overcame the difficulty by preparing
  large spherules of mastic. I arrived at them by making pure water
  pass slowly under an alcohol solution of resin. A passage zone is
  produced where the grains form which then have generally a
  diameter of some twelve microns. They are limpid spheres, like
  glass balls. They frequently seem to be perfect, and then their
  rotation is not observable. But they also frequently contain
  small vacuoles, <i>guide marks by means of which the rotational
  Brownian movement is easily perceived</i>.</p>

  <p>But the weight of these large grains keeps
  them very close to the bottom which disturbs their Brownian
  movement. I, therefore, tried to give the intergranular liquid
  the density of the grains by dissolving suitable substances in
  it. A complication soon arose in that at the amount necessary for
  keeping the grains suspended between the two waters, almost all
  these substances agglutinated the grains into <i>bunches of
  grapes</i>, showing thus in the nicest way possible the
  phenomenon of <i>coagulation</i> which is not easy to obtain on
  ordinary suspensions or colloidal solutions (of ultramicroscopic
  grains). Coagulation failed to occur in a single substance,
  urea.</p>

  <p>In water containing 27 per cent urea I was,
  therefore, able to follow the agitation of the grains and to
  measure their rotation. For this I noted at equal intervals of
  time the successive positions of certain vacuoles from which it
  was then possible, at one's leisure, to find again the
  orientation of the sphere at each of these moments and to
  calculate its rotation from one moment to the next. The
  calculations were made on approximately 200 (fairly rough) gl an
  e measurements on spheres having a diameter of 13 <i>&micro;</i>,
  and gave me for <i>N</i> the value of 65 x 10<sup>22</sup> This
  agreement with the previous . determinations is all the more
  striking as even the order of magnitude of the phenomenon was not
  known (1910).</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>The molecular reality</h4>

  <p>Briefly, and in spite of the variety of
  experimental conditions and techniques, the study of the
  emulsions gave me for Avogadro's number:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>68 x 10<sup>22</sup> by means of the
    distribution of emulsions analogous to gases;<br>
    62 x 10<sup>22</sup> by means of that of emulsions analogous to
    liquids;<br>
    60 x 10<sup>22</sup> by means of the fluctuations in
    concentrated emulsions;<br>
    64 x 10<sup>22</sup> by means of the translational Brownian
    movement;<br>
    65 x 10<sup>22</sup> by means of the rotational Brownian
    movement;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>or, as a crude average, <i>64 x
  10<sup>22</sup></i>.</p>

  <p>I can recall here that on the other hand,
  considering gases as consisting of molecules which diffract light
  (<a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Rayleigh</a>,
  Smoluchovski, Einstein) it was possible to obtain (somewhat after
  my first experiments) Avogadro's number by means of measurements
  relating to the <i>critical opalescence</i> (Keesom: 75 x
  10<sup>22</sup> ), the <i>blueness of the sky</i> (Bauer and L.
  Brillouin, then Fowler: 65 x 10<sup>22</sup>), and relating in a
  particularly precise manner to light that was laterally diffused
  by gases (Cabannes: 65 x 10<sup>22</sup>; 1921).</p>

  <p>The theory of black-body radiation, where
  the reasoning is allied to that of the kinetic theory, gives
  again the same value (64 x 10<sup>22</sup>).</p>

  <p>Along other lines, the measurements of the
  electric charges of charged microscopic dust, which should be
  whole multiples of the elementary charge of ions, led - by stages
  with Townsend, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J.
  Thomson</a>, Harold A. Wilson, Ehrenhaft, and finally <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/index.html">Millikan</a> (1909) - to the
  same result (61 x 10<sup>22</sup>).</p>

  <p>Lastly, radioactivity which enables the
  atoms forming a given mass of helium to be counted one by one,
  has given in a totally different manner proofs of the
  discontinuity of matter by imposing once again the same value (62
  x 10<sup>22</sup> to 70 x 10<sup>22</sup>) on Avogadro's
  number.</p>

  <p>Such a collection of agreements between the
  various pieces of evidence according to which the molecular
  structure is translated to the scale of our observations, creates
  a certitude at least equal to that which we attribute to the
  principles of thermodynamics. The <i>objective reality of
  molecules and atoms</i> which was doubted twenty years ago, can
  today be accepted as a <i>principle</i> the consequences of which
  can always be proved.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, however sure this new
  principle may be, it would still be a great step forward in our
  knowledge of matter, and for all that a certitude of a different
  order, if we could perceive directly these molecules the
  existence of which has been demonstrated.</p>

  <p>Without having arrived there, I have at
  least been able to observe a phenomenon where the discontinuous
  structure of matter can be seen directly.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Monomolecular films</h4>

  <p>I encountered this phenomenon (1913) by
  observing under the microscope small laminae of "soapy water",
  and in such simple conditions that it is surprising it was not
  discovered earlier.</p>

  <p>You know the properties of <i>thin
  laminae</i>: each ray reflected from such a lamina is formed by
  the superposition of a ray reflected from the front side of the
  lamina on a ray reflected from the rear side. For each elementary
  colour these rays add together or subtract from one another
  according to a classical formula, depending on whether they are
  in phase or out of phase; in particular, there is extinction when
  the thickness of the lamina is an even multiple of one quarter of
  the wavelength, and there is maximum reflection when it is an odd
  multiple.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, white light strikes a lamina
  which has a thickness increasing continuously from zero, the
  reflected light is at first non-existent (black lamina), then
  weak (grey lamina), then lively and still almost white, becoming
  successively straw yellow, orange yellow, red, violet, blue
  (tints of the first order), then again (but with different tints)
  yellow, red, violet, blue, green (second order); and so on, the
  reflected colour becoming continuously more complex and more
  off-white up to the "white of a higher order" (the spectrum is
  furrowed with black grooves the number of which increases with
  the thickness of the lamina). All these tints will be present at
  the same time on a lamina which has not a uniform thickness and
  which will be black or grey in its thinnest region, straw yellow
  in a thicker region, red in an even thicker region, and so
  forth.</p>

  <p>It is the same with ordinary soap bubbles,
  with their magnificent colours. The gradation of these colours
  seems to us perfectly continuous, from the lowest part of the
  bubble where the wall is thicker, to its upper part, which
  thinning progressively, becomes white and then grey, after
  passing through the "first-order" tints. At that moment, just
  before the bubble bursts, this thin region: begins to show one or
  several <i>black spots</i>, quite round, which contrast strongly
  with the neighbouring grey tone (I mistook them for holes when I
  was a child) and the very sharp edge of which marks a strong
  discontinuity in the thickness. In fact, they are not completely
  black, but reflect so little light that their thickness is
  certainly small in relation to the wavelengths of white light. In
  an enclosed space that is free from dust, these black spots may
  extend over areas of the order of one square decimetre, and
  remain for several months (Dewar).</p>

  <p>A more careful examination has long since
  shown that in the first black spot may form even blacker circles,
  therefore thinner ones, again with a sharp periphery. In
  measurements which were at the time very remarkable, although not
  very accurate, Reinold and R&uuml;cker, and then Johonnott had
  shown that the darkest spot could have a thickness of 6
  m<i>&micro;</i> (milli-microns), and the other roughly twice this.
  No interpretation had been given: it was simply thought that the
  surface tension which is variable below a certain thickness,
  became equal again for the thickness of the two black spots to
  what it is for large thicknesses. In the light of subsequent
  observations we shall understand that the black spot represents a
  kind of carpet formed by two layers or perhaps even by a single
  layer of molecules held together parallel with one another.</p>

  <p>Without indicating here the intermediate
  stages which I passed through, let us say straightaway that, by
  observing in the microscope in bright light a small horizontal
  lamina of a given soapy water (approximately 5 per cent pure
  alkali oleate), I have seen the discontinuities multiplying of
  which the black spots were the first example.</p>

  <p>The observation is made as for a metal
  surface: the light emitted through a lateral aperture in the tube
  of the microscope and reflected towards the objective, passes it
  and is reflected on the thin lamina, returning to the eye through
  the objective and the eye-piece to give a clear image of the
  lamina.</p>

  <p>We then see, first of all, the colours in
  continuous gradation of the ordinary laminae of soapy water; then
  the lamina quivers; liquid gathers together in globules; at the
  same time, uniform bands, with flat tints separated from one
  another by arcs of a circle, appear in the whole lamina which
  becomes a kind of mosaic. These arcs terminate at the globules
  around which they radiate like stars. Once this stratification is
  organized, a very slow evolution takes place by displacement of
  the contours and the globules, giving (according to circumstances
  over which I had no control) more or less importance to one band
  or the other or a series of bands which is the reason for the
  extraordinary variety of stepped laminae which are observed. Very
  frequently kinds of flat bulges are seen protruding from the
  globules or from the non-stratified peripheral liquid and
  spreading over bands which have already formed.</p>

  <p>We thus observe, in order of increasing
  thickness, black bands which do not seem to differ from the "
  black spots" which we just mentioned; then grey, white, yellow,
  red, blue bands; and then bands having second-order tints, and so
  on, up to higher-order white. Each band has a uniform colour
  standing out clearly and discontinuously against adjacent bands.
  The richness of the colours can be extreme as you see from the
  colour photographs (Lumiere autochrome plates) which are here
  projected. The richness pertaining partly to a transitional tint
  - e.g. some purple - represented by an insignificant region on a
  lamina of ordinary soap, may extend here as a flat tint over an
  important area.</p>

  <p>These bands are definitely liquids; this is
  shown by the existence of exactly circular contours (when
  solidification occurs, the areas become like dried skins with a
  dentated contour), by the mobility of these contours which change
  by blowing without breaking the lamina, by the existence finally
  of a " two-dimensional " Brownian movement which is found (for
  droplets, or for small flat discs, pieces detached from the
  bands), on grey or coloured bands (the Brownian movement is all
  the less lively when these bands are thicker which is natural in
  view of the fact that the frictions then become more
  important).</p>

  <p>Let me add that I have also been able to
  obtain such stepped laminae with alkali oleate in glycerol, and
  also with alkali colophonates and resinates in water.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Having examined a large number of
  stratified laminae, it occurred to me, before I made any
  measurement, that the difference in thickness between two
  adjacent bands cannot fall below a certain value and that this
  elementary minimum difference, a kind of "step of a staircase",
  is included a whole number of times in each band. Similarly, if
  we throw playing-cards on the table, the thickness at each point
  is that of a whole number of cards, without all possible
  thicknesses being necessarily present, since two or three cards
  may remain stuck together. The stratified liquid strips would,
  therefore, be formed by the piling up of identical sheets, more
  or less overlapping each other, their liquid state imposing on
  the free contours the form of arcs of a circle (which are fixed
  at their extremities on globules or on the non-stratified
  periphery, according to conditions so far unknown).</p>

  <p>The measurements confirmed this impression.
  From 1913 onwards I found a value ranging between 4.2 and 5.5
  m<i>&micro;</i>. And since then, precise photometric
  determinations made under my direction in 1921 by P.V. Wells, who
  otherwise had to overcome serious experimental difficulties, have
  fully established what we can call a law of multiple
  thicknesses.</p>

  <p>We first of all applied simply the
  classical relationship between the thickness of the lamina and
  the intensity of the reflected light, using monochromatic
  lighting.</p>

  <p>On the first-order band 120 measurements
  were made, giving thicknesses grouped according to the law of
  chances around 4.4 m<i>&micro;</i>. It is certainly the best
  measurement made so far of the thickness of the "black spot " for
  which Johonnott gave 6 m<i>&micro;</i>. The extreme thinness of
  this band, the faintness of the reflected light, and the
  difficulties due to parasitic lights make this determination
  particularly interesting.</p>

  <p>The set of the measurements for the first
  fifteen bands give similarly thicknesses which are, within
  several hundredths, of the successive multiples of 4.5
  m<i>&micro;</i>.</p>

  <p>As this elementary thickness is not known
  with a precision greater than 4 per cent, it seems impossible to
  verify the law above a certain thickness. For example, at this
  accuracy any thickness greater than 120 m<i>&micro;</i> would be a
  multiple of 4.5 m<i>&micro;</i>. But if the law exists, the
  thickness should always vary in the same way between two adjacent
  areas; or again the "step of the stairs" should remain the same,
  and this can be verified.</p>

  <p>This is, in fact, what Wells saw, operating
  this time in white light and using a method which Ren&eacute;
  Marcelin had suggested to me in 1914, by obtaining tints
  identical to those of the lamina by means of a quartz compensator
  of variable thickness which was placed between crossed nicols.
  (The difference between the thicknesses of quartz which gave the
  tints of the two adjacent liquid bands, determines the difference
  in thickness of these bands.) He obtained in this way 4.2
  m<i>&micro;</i> near the first-order violet and 4.3 near the
  second-order violet.</p>

  <p>In short, the "step of the staircase" has
  the same value near the first, the fiftieth or the hundredth
  band, i.e. approximately 4.4 m<i>&micro;</i>; and we can be sure
  that:</p>

  <p><i>In a stratified liquid lamina the
  thickness of each band is a whole multiple of the same elementary
  thickness;</i></p>

  <p>in other words, it is very probable
  that:</p>

  <p><i>The bands of the stratified laminae are
  formed by the overlapping, in any number, of identical
  fundamental "sheets".</i></p>

  <p>This is how a "discontinuous and periodic
  structure" of matter is perceived quite directly, at least in a
  certain group of cases.</p>

  <p>Similar experiments, suggested precisely by
  these observations of stratified laminae of soapy water, were
  made on mica at the beginning of 1914 by Ren&eacute; Marcelin (who
  died for France in 1914). We know that if we pour selenium on to
  mica, and if we try to tear off this mica, thin laminae of mica
  remain adhering to the selenium. These laminae exhibit bright
  colourations which are divided into completely flat tints
  separated by clear rectilinear contours which mark
  discontinuities of thickness. The minimum difference of thickness
  measured with the Michel Levy comparator was found to be equal to
  0.7 m<i>&micro;</i> which would, therefore, be the thickness of a
  monomolecular layer in the crystal. But the measuring accuracy
  becomes low for such a small thickness.</p>

  <p>Let us return to the stratified laminae of
  soapy water for which the size of the discontinuities is such
  that we have readily accessible the elementary sheet the periodic
  repetition of which forms the bands. We shall want to know what
  this elementary sheet is. I see in it a monomolecular film of
  hydrated bioleate.</p>

  <p>We know, in fact (Rayleigh, A. Marcelin,
  Langmuir) that water on which float globules of oleic acid, is
  covered between these globules with a veil of oleic acid 1.9
  m<i>&micro;</i> thick. According to its known density, this veil
  can be formed only by a single layer of molecules arranged
  perpendicularly to the surface and probably glued to the water by
  their (hygroscopic) acid groups. The surface of a soapy water is
  greasy (low surface tension, arrest of the movements of camphor);
  it is, therefore, covered at least by a similar layer of oleic
  acid or oleate, as can be shown by analysing a known quantity of
  soapy water drawn in the form of laminae having a known total
  surface area (Jean Perrin, Mouquin). The black spot corresponding
  to the maximum possible thinning would, therefore, be a kind of
  sandwich containing a layer of water molecules against each side
  of which, and glued to it by their acid groups, parallel
  molecules of oleic acid or oleate are arranged, the whole forming
  an anisotropic lamina or liquid crystalline sheet. The piling-up
  of such sheets, easily sliding over each other - with weak
  cohesion forces existing between them - would give the successive
  bands.</p>

  <p>In remarkable agreement with this
  conception is the fact that the molecular length as calculated
  for oleic acid from X-ray diffraction measurements recently made
  in the laboratories of Bragg and Friedel agrees with the
  thickness of our fundamental sheet.</p>

  <p>I do not think that there is any more to be
  said, at the moment, on the direct visibility of molecules.</p>

  <h4>The discontinuous structure of the atom</h4>

  <p>Even whilst evidence continued to
  accumulate on the still disputed atomic reality, a start was made
  to penetrate the interior structure of these atoms, a research in
  which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Rutherford</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a> obtained
  marvellous results, as we know. And I must summarize here my
  contribution to this research.</p>

  <p>It was known that when an electric
  discharge passes in a glass tube through a sufficiently rarefied
  gas, the part facing the cathode is illuminated by a fluorescence
  on which the shadow of any obstacle placed in front of the
  cathode is outlined; and that the <i>cathode rays</i> definable
  in this way, are deflected by the magnetic field, describing a
  circular trajectory when they are thrown at right angles to a
  uniform field (Hittorf). Crookes had had the intuition that these
  rays were trajectories of negative particles emitted by the
  cathode and violently repelled by it (1886), but he did not
  succeed in establishing this electrification. And this emission
  theory was abandoned when <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1925/index.html">Hertz</a> on the one hand
  failed in his attempts to manifest the negative electricity of
  the rays, and on the other hand showed that they were able to
  pass through glass foil or aluminium foil several microns thick.
  It was assumed since then that the <i>cathode rays</i> were
  immaterial and had a wave-like nature similar to light. This
  opinion was held principally by Lenard (1894) who showed that
  these rays can leave the tube where they are formed, through a
  "window" made of a fairly thick foil to support the atmospheric
  pressure, and that they can be studied in this way in any gas or
  in an absolute vacuum.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me, however, that the
  electrified projectiles imagined by Crookes <i>might differ
  sufficiently, in size and in velocity, from ordinary molecules,
  to pass through walls which were impermeable to these
  molecules,</i> and seeking to apply without complication the very
  definition of the electric charge, I made cathode rays penetrate
  into a "Faraday cylinder" contained inside a protective chamber.
  As soon as the rays (which can, first, be drawn aside by a
  magnetic field which is just strong enough to do so) enter the
  cylinder, the latter presents phenomena which give precisely the
  definition of a negative electric charge, and which enable it to
  be measured (1895). This experiment was successful even when the
  protective chamber was entirely closed, the rays penetrating it
  through a thin metal foil. Almost at the same time I showed
  (1896) that cathode rays are deflected by an electric field, and
  that there is a method here for measuring the drop in potential
  which had until then been unknown and from which they obtained
  their energy.</p>

  <p>These experiments were at once repeated,
  and confirmed, by Lenard himself (whose theory they ruined), by
  Wiechert, by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/index.html">Wien</a>, and by J.J.
  Thomson.</p>

  <p>I had begun to make measurements which were
  intended to give the velocity (obviously variable according to
  the circumstances) of the cathode projectiles and the e/m ratio
  of its charge to its mass, supplementing the measurement of the
  drop in potential with that of the magnetic field capable of
  producing a given deflection. I was anticipated here by J. J.
  Thomson who in the very paper in which he published the
  confirmation of my experiments showed that once the
  electrification of the rays had been demonstrated, it was easy to
  obtain the velocity and the charge of the projectiles from the
  action of the electrical field and the magnetic field. He found
  that the <i>e/m</i> ratio, independently of all the
  circumstances, is approximately 2,000 times greater than it is
  for hydrogen in electrolysis, and consequently he had the honour
  of proving that the cathode projectile is much lighter than the
  hydrogen atom (1897). The experimental idea of the
  <i>electron</i> as a universal subatomic constituent was
  therefore reached, and my experiments had played a certain part
  in this growth of our knowledge of the manner in which matter is
  discontinuous.</p>

  <p>The problem of the structure of the atom
  was immediately raised as it ceased to be the ultimate unit of
  matter. J. J. Thomson assumed that whilst the atom as a whole was
  neutral, it consisted of a homogeneous sphere of positive
  electricity inside which the electrons were held in such
  positions that the attractions and repulsions were in
  equilibrium.</p>

  <p>I was, I believe, the first to assume that
  the atom had a structure reminding to that of the solar system
  where the "planetary" electrons circulate around a positive
  "Sun", the attraction by the centre being counterbalanced by the
  force of inertia (1901). But I never tried or even saw any means
  of verifying this conception. Rutherford (who had doubtless
  arrived at it independently, but who also had the delicacy to
  refer to the short phrase dropped during a lecture in which I had
  stated it) understood that the essential difference between his
  conception and that of J.J. Thomson was that there existed near
  the positive and quasi-punctual Sun, enormous electrical fields
  as compared with those which would exist inside or outside a
  homogeneous positive sphere having the same charge, but embracing
  the whole atom.</p>

  <p>The result was that if a positive charge
  which is itself quasi-punctual, is sufficiently fast to be able
  to pass near such a nucleus, it will be strongly deflected just
  as a comet can be deflected when it comes from the infinite and
  passes near the Sun. It was in this way (1911), that Rutherford
  discovered and explained that certain <font face=
  "Symbol">a</font> rays (rays described by helium atoms projected
  by radioactive substances) undergo very strong deflections when
  they pass through a thin film, producing on a phosphorescent
  screen, really far from the mean impact of the bundle of rays,
  scintillations which mark their individual arrivals. All these
  deflections are explained quantitatively on condition that the
  <i>nucleus</i> is credited with a charge such that the number of
  planetary electrons is equal to the "rank number" of the atom in
  Mendeleev's series. In this way each atom consists of an
  unimaginably small positive nucleus where almost the entire mass
  of the atom is concentrated and around which the planetary
  electrons, the presence of which determines the physical and
  chemical properties of the corresponding element. revolve at
  relatively colossal distances.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The nucleus itself, lastly, has been
  revealed as being discontinuous and composed of hydrogen nuclei,
  or <i>protons</i>, which are possibly "cemented " by nuclear
  electrons.</p>

  <p>As Prout had predicted, each atom can, in
  fact, be regarded as resulting from the condensation on a whole
  number of hydrogen atoms (the deviating elements having proved to
  be mixtures of <i>isotopes</i>, which confirm the law
  separately); the small differences which exist are explained (by
  applying Einstein's law of the mass of energy) by the large
  variations of internal energy which may accompany these
  condensations (Langevin). And I have pointed out (1920) that the
  loss of energy which must then accompany the condensation of
  hydrogen into helium suffices alone to account for approximately
  one hundred milliard years of solar radiation at the present rate
  (the first theory to allow the understanding of the stupendous
  antiquity of climatic conditions only slightly different from the
  present conditions: the Helmholtz-Kelvin theory explained only a
  maximum of 50 million-years, a grossly insufficient figure as far
  as geology is concerned).</p>

  <p>This led me to think that the atoms of
  hydrogen, and then of helium (the only ones revealed by spectrum
  analysis in the non-resolvable nebulae) condense progressively,
  in the course of stellar evolution, into heavier and heavier
  atoms, radioactive disintegration being the exception and atomic
  integration being the rule.</p>

  <p>However, Rutherford succeeded in proving,
  in admirable experiments (1922), that when a nucleus of nitrogen,
  aluminium, or phosphorus is struck forcefully by an a projectile
  (sufficiently fast to "hit" it in spite of the electrical
  repulsion), a proton is expelled (<font face="Symbol">a</font>
  ray) with an energy which may exceed that of the a projectile,
  and Rutherford interpreted this <i>transmutation</i> as being the
  effect of an explosive disintegration (similar to that of a shell
  which is exploded by an impact). I maintained, on the contrary
  (1923), that there was then an integration, that the helium
  nucleus at first combines with the nucleus that it has hit, to
  form a radioactive atom (of a species as yet unknown) which soon
  expels a proton, and that there finally remains an atom which is
  three units heavier than the atom that has been hit. This has
  since been confirmed by Blackett (1925) in the very laboratory of
  Rutherford: three converging rays are counted (by the method of
  C.T.R. Wilson) when a Rutherford transmutation occurs, instead of
  the four which would exist if the striking projectile retained
  its individuality after the impact.</p>

  <p>But this refers rather to the evolution of
  Matter than to its discontinuity; if I were to say any more, I
  should be departing from the subject on which I came here to
  speak.</p>
