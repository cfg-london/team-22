  <h2>The Pursuit of Peace and Japan in the Nuclear Age</h2>

  <p>Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  Having the exceptional honor to receive the Nobel Peace Prize,
  rich in tradition and honored throughout the world, before such a
  distinguished assembly, was, indeed, the most memorable occasion
  of my life.</p>

  <p>I believe that it is not upon me alone that
  this rare honor has been bestowed; the Japanese people share it
  with me. All through the years since World War II, the Japanese
  people have, I am convinced, made strenuous efforts to preserve
  and promote world peace, contributing to the progress and
  prosperity of mankind.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, on behalf of the Japanese
  people as well that I respectfully express my profound gratitude
  to the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament for their
  decision to award this prize to us. It is with great pride as a
  Japanese and with deep humility as an individual that I accept
  this prize.</p>

  <p>I have held the post of Prime Minister of
  Japan for one-third of the 22-year period since the San Francisco
  Peace Treaty<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> entered into force.
  It seems to me that this is an appropriate opportunity to look
  back upon the Japanese people's opting for peace, and the efforts
  they have made to give substance to that decision.</p>

  <p>If the attainment of peace is the ultimate
  objective of all statesmen, it is, at the same time, something
  very ordinary, closely tied to the daily life of each individual.
  In familiar terms, it is the condition that allows each
  individual and his family to pursue, without fear, the purpose of
  their lives. It is only in such circumstances that each
  individual will be able to devote himself, without the loss of
  hope for the future of mankind, to the education of his children,
  to an attempt to leave upon the history of mankind the imprint of
  his own creative and constructive achievements in the arts,
  culture, religion and other activities fulfilling social
  aspirations. This is the peace which is essential for all
  individuals, peoples, nations, and thus for the whole of
  humanity.</p>

  <p>Though frequent turmoils vitiated life in
  other parts of the world during the two and half centuries from
  the beginning of the 17th century, Japan managed to live in
  tranquility in a state of isolation, neither threatening other
  nations nor threatened by them. It was only in the mid-19th
  century that Japan, faced with the growing presence of European
  powers in Asia, abandoned its policy of isolation, and opened its
  doors to the outside world, and, with the Meiji
  Restoration<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>, began to move
  towards the creation of a modern nation state.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, the Japanese people
  experienced a variety of vicissitudes and were involved in
  international disputes, eventually, for the first time in their
  history, experiencing the horrors of modern warfare on their own
  soil during World War II. Japan is the only country in the world
  to have suffered the ravages of atomic bombing. That experience
  left an indelible mark on the hearts of our people, making them
  passionately determined to renounce all wars.</p>

  <p>Fully conscious of the bitter lessons of
  defeat in 1945 and unswervingly determined to seek an enduring
  peace, our people revised the old Constitution. The new
  Constitution is founded on the principles of the protection of
  human rights on the one hand, and the renunciation of war on the
  other. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution stipulates as
  follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on
    justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as
    a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or the use of
    force as means of settling international disputes".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Such a declaration renouncing the use of
  force in the settlement of international disputes, incorporating
  the philosophy of the Kellogg-Briand pact<a href=
  "#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>, has been made by peoples other than
  the Japanese. It is noteworthy, however, that a major power like
  Japan should have persevered in this direction by national
  consensus and be determined to retain this attitude in the
  future.</p>

  <p>Japan has changed greatly during the thirty
  years since the period of confusion following defeat - rebuilding
  the nation's life and regaining its sovereign independence, with
  vigorous economic and social development complemented by
  scientific and technological progress in the sixties. In the
  meantime, our people made certain important choices.</p>

  <p>The first among them was the spontaneous
  formation of a national consensus not to be armed with nuclear
  weapons. It has often been pointed out that, with the rise in the
  level of economic activity and the great strides made in science
  and technology, Japan has the capacity to produce nuclear arms.
  However, it is, in spite of Japan's potential, or precisely for
  that reason, that our people have, on their own initiative, made
  the firm choice not to be armed with nuclear weapons. This is
  also the firm policy of the Japanese Government. I wish to take
  this opportunity to declare this again unequivocally, and beg
  that my distinguished audience will bear this fact in mind.</p>

  <p>It is only natural that for any statesman
  at the helm of any government the question of his country's
  security should be a concern of the utmost importance.</p>

  <p>Upon assuming the reins of government, I
  adopted, always conscious of the importance of the role of the
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United Nations</a>, a
  policy of following a formula of collective security based on the
  Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of my country's
  security in the prevailing international situation. In the light
  of the circumstances in which my country was placed, this meant
  the maintenance of the Japan-US Mutual Security and Cooperation
  Treaty which took effect in 1960. This treaty is not directed
  against any country but rather seeks to establish the basic
  conditions prerequisite for the maintenance of peace. This is the
  meaning of the treaty.</p>

  <p>We, in the latter part of the 20th century,
  are, however, living in the nuclear age. I pointed out in a basic
  policy speech delivered in the National Diet in early 1968, that
  the common task confronting all countries today is the question
  of how we are to survive this nuclear age.</p>

  <p>I established three non-nuclear principles
  as a policy of the Japanese Government after deep reflection on
  the course Japan should take as a country which will not possess
  nuclear arms. This policy states that we shall not manufacture
  nuclear weapons, that we shall not possess them and that we shall
  not bring them into our country. This was later reaffirmed by a
  resolution of our Diet. I have no doubt that this policy will be
  pursued by all future governments.</p>

  <p>It was also during my tenure of office that
  the Japanese Government agreed to the conclusion of a Nuclear
  Non-Proliferation Treaty and signed it, pursuing a policy in
  harmony with the avowed desire of the people. Under the terms of
  our Constitution, the assent of the Diet is required before
  ratification procedures can be completed; it is my desire to see
  these procedures completed with the least possible delay.</p>

  <p>Thermonuclear energy, used as a means of
  warfare, has terrifying potential for destruction. In fact, the
  proliferation of nuclear weapons may well jeopardize the very
  survival of mankind. Nuclear disarmament has now become a matter
  of the utmost urgency. Consequently, it is gratifying that the
  Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the
  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have made a certain amount of
  progress.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this progress represents only
  a freezing at present level. It is the earnest hope of our people
  that the world may see the day when all nuclear weapons are
  abolished. If I may, however, be allowed to put this in more
  realistic, if more modest, terms, the nuclear Powers, with the
  United States and the USSR taking the lead, should, at least,
  cease their quantitative and qualitative nuclear arms race, and
  sincerely explore effective and practical means for the gradual
  reduction and international control of nuclear arms.</p>

  <p>In this context, I wish to point out to the
  five nations which at present possess nuclear weapons that they
  have especially heavy responsibilities for assuring the peace and
  security of the world. The Japanese people hope most earnestly
  that constructive efforts will be made by these nuclear powers
  with a view to bringing about some epoch-making progress in
  nuclear arms control and disarmament.</p>

  <p><br>
  II.</p>

  <p>The second achievement during my tenure of
  office that I should like to refer to was Japan's attainment of
  the reversion to Japan of the Ogasawara and Okinawa Islands.</p>

  <p>The international order established at the
  end of World War II could certainly have been worse. However,
  this order did contain certain factors which bore within them the
  seeds of instability. The divided countries provide the most
  vivid example of this situation. Moreover, the fact that the
  majority of the divided countries in the world are in Asia
  indicates how global tensions might concentrate in that
  continent.</p>

  <p>Under the Japanese Peace Treaty, signed in
  San Francisco in 1951, Okinawa and Ogasawara, integral parts of
  our national territory, were placed under the administration of
  the United States, with Japan retaining residual sovereignty. The
  fact of defeat obliged our country to acquiesce in this
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>However, with the passing of time, the
  world gradually moved towards stability and prosperity, while our
  country regained sufficient economic and diplomatic potential to
  contribute to the progress and development of the community of
  nations. As these developments took place, the desire that the
  arrangements I have mentioned should be revised gradually gained
  ground in our national consciousness.</p>

  <p>It was a clearly anomalous situation for
  one million Japanese people to be still under foreign domination
  more than twenty years after the termination of hostilities. The
  desire to see Okinawa returned to Japan developed into a broad
  national consensus among our people.</p>

  <p>By that time, Okinawa had come to occupy a
  key strategic position in Asia in the framework of the Cold War.
  Nevertheless I declared soon after my assumption of office as
  Prime Minister my conviction that: "Until Okinawa is returned,
  Japan will not have completely emerged from her post-war period".
  For I had came to the conviction that to leave Okinawa in such an
  anomalous state would create greater tension in Asia because of
  the very important position of this group of islands and that to
  realize the reversion of Okinawa would contribute to a stable
  peace in the Western Pacific.</p>

  <p>I came to be convinced that between
  countries like Japan and the United States, each with a
  democratic system and a high standard of living, it would, by
  means of peaceful negotiations, not be at all impossible to avoid
  a confrontation, even given considerable differences of interest.
  The negotiations on the reversion of Okinawa did indeed present a
  challenge. Fortunately, owing to the wisdom and foresight of its
  drafters, Article 3 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty left us
  with ways to obtain a readjustment.</p>

  <p>In the light of the mutually shared basis
  of friendship and trust in the soundness of Japan-US relations,
  and with the purpose of relaxing tensions in Asia, with the
  ultimate aim of achieving a stable world peace, I sought from the
  United States the return of Okinawa in the form of a peaceful
  alteration of the then prevailing situation.</p>

  <p>It cannot be said that these negotiations
  were easy. However, the United States, as a friendly country,
  lent a willing ear to the Japanese request. Finally, the great
  achievement of realizing the return of territory through
  diplomatic negotiations, an event rarely witnessed in world
  history, was achieved.</p>

  <p>As a result of this political solution,
  peace and stability in the East Asian region surrounding Japan
  have been strengthened. Furthermore, the friendly relations
  existing between America and Japan, which are the key to this
  peace and stability, have been placed on an even firmer
  foundation. A situation had been created, moreover, which would
  serve as the basis for a gradual relaxation of tension with
  China.</p>

  <p>It is my belief that the return of Okinawa
  is a shining example of a peaceful modification of the status quo
  and that it also contributed to the relaxation of tension in
  Asia, and to stability in the Western Pacific region. As for
  Japan, the return of Okinawa has served as a major factor in
  fostering political stability.</p>

  <p><br>
  III.</p>

  <p>In the area of foreign relations, I have
  always sought to maintain friendly relations with all countries,
  indeed to improve them further. Prince Shotoku who lived from the
  end of the 6th century to the 7th century was a distinguished
  political leader of ancient Japan, as well as a great religious
  leader of the period when Buddhism was introduced into Japan.
  Japan's first constitution established by Prince Shotoku begins
  with the declaration: "Harmony is the basic principle to be
  respected". This spirit is a national and popular ideal which has
  run throughout Japanese history.</p>

  <p>As for myself, I have expressed this spirit
  of harmony in the words "magnanimity and harmony", making it one
  of the guiding principles of my political life. There is a
  favorite saying of mine: "Here I stand and there stand you; but
  we remain friends". It is only natural that people should differ.
  Nevertheless, all should accept these differences with tolerance
  and seek a way in which they can live together in peace through
  mutual understanding. This, indeed, is the moral principle which
  has guided me in the reality of politics. I am happy to say that
  it has the support of many people of goodwill in Japan and
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>This spirit, when applied in the fields of
  external relations, can develop into policies for the maintenance
  of peaceful and fraternal relations, whatever differences may
  exist among countries whose ideologies, social systems and
  policies differ.</p>

  <p>Prompted by this spirit, I emphasized first
  and foremost the development of good-neighbor diplomacy in Asia.
  Depending on the countries and the problems involved, there were
  occasions when it was not easy to put this policy into practice.
  However, I never adopted a policy which meant that we looked upon
  a foreign country with hostility, and I always conducted myself
  with the utmost sincerity, always being ready for dialogue.</p>

  <p>It was with this viewpoint in mind that I
  undertook in earnest negotiations to normalize relations with the
  Republic of Korea soon after my assumption to office as Prime
  Minister. These negotiations encountered numerous difficulties,
  due largely to national feeling on the part of both the Japanese
  and Korean peoples, attributable to the historical fact of the
  past domination of Korea by Japan and to the reality of the
  Korean Peninsula being divided into two camps.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the guiding spirit of
  equality and mutual advantage and the realistic approach of
  seeking to establish friendship with close neighbors first proved
  effective. In January, 1966, the Treaty on Basic Relations
  between Japan and the Republic of Korea and the related
  agreements became effective, thus solving a major pending issue
  in post-war Japanese diplomacy.</p>

  <p>Now to look at Southeast Asia in the 1960s.
  The economy developed over the entire area at a comparatively
  steady pace, despite the grave problem of the Vietnam War which
  fortunately did not spread beyond the Indo-China Peninsula.</p>

  <p>This progress was the fruit of the
  unceasing initiatives and efforts made by various countries under
  the wise leadership of their leaders. I believe that Japan was
  also able to make some contribution to this progress. Japan was
  in the forefront of the nations participating in the
  establishment of the Asian Development Bank in 1966, took an
  active part in the convening of the first Ministerial Conference
  for the Economic Development of Southeast Asia, and also
  participated in the Asian and Pacific Council. She, thus, made
  every effort to further the development of regional cooperation
  and mutual solidarity. The leaders of Southeast Asia rate highly
  the role our country has played in the non-military areas of the
  economy and technology. I believe we must continue this
  cooperation ever more actively in order to achieve tangible
  results. In addition, the activities of the Youth Overseas
  Cooperation Corps, whose members devote themselves to working
  hand-in-hand with and sweat alongside the local people for the
  improvement of the standard of living in developing countries,
  not only in Southeast Asia but throughout the developing world,
  greatly increased during my premiership.</p>

  <p>I like to believe that, thanks to numerous
  opportunities for heart-to-heart talks with Asian leaders in
  order to deepen mutual understanding, I was able to contribute to
  the cultivation of friendly and good-neighborly relations in our
  part of the world.</p>

  <p><br>
  IV.</p>

  <p>By an interesting coincidence, my life
  began in 1901, the year in which the first Nobel Peace Prize was
  awarded. For 74 years the Nobel Prize has witnessed the bright
  and dark phases in the quest for world peace. During my lifetime,
  I have also shared the same experiences. Therefore, I feel that I
  might be allowed to venture some observations on one of the
  subjects confronting our contemporary civilization.</p>

  <p>That subject is none other than the problem
  of the utilization of thermonuclear energy.</p>

  <p>One of the aspects of thermonuclear energy
  is its massive, and potentially destructive, power. For this
  reason, this energy source could clearly pose a dire threat to
  humanity, depending on the manner in which it is used. Another
  aspect which cannot be denied is that it is a source of
  potentially limitless energy which could well open up new vistas
  for the civilization of tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Today, humanity faces difficult challenges
  in areas such as population, food, natural resources, energy and
  the environment.</p>

  <p>These are grave problems which could
  destroy peace in this world should we make wrong choices in our
  efforts to find solutions. The discord among the advanced
  industrialized countries, the countries possessing natural
  resources, and the developing countries is growing greater.
  Unless this difficulty is overcome by the promotion of new
  sources of energy, especially the peaceful use of nuclear energy,
  which could assure a stable supply of energy throughout the
  world, we shall come to an impasse.</p>

  <p>However, this peaceful utilization of
  atomic energy confronts us with problems such as the disposal of
  waste materials and safety, and one has the impression that its
  development has come to a standstill. Such a standstill, however,
  is an unavoidable stage we must accept until technological
  innovation achieves a major breakthrough. I am convinced that so
  long as we maintain an unshakable confidence in the progress of
  science and technology, and provided the world's most brilliant
  minds are united in their efforts, humanity is capable of
  building a new civilization of untold possibilities for the
  future. However, research and development in nuclear fusion -
  which is considered to be the cleanest source of nuclear energy -
  face grave problems when reaching the stage of practical use,
  unless an international system and organization for research and
  cooperation is established.</p>

  <p>Several years ago, I set down the three
  non-nuclear principles which gave concrete expression to the
  determination of the Japanese people to achieve peace. As I said
  before, this was because the entire nation is against the use of
  thermonuclear energy as a means of killing their fellow men.</p>

  <p>However, I am entirely in favor of the
  peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. That is why I wish to
  express here today three views on the peaceful uses of this
  energy.</p>

  <p>First of all, we need the creation of
  international safety standards. I believe that research and
  development in the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be
  carried out under common worldwide regulations that take
  environmental problems into account. One of the basic
  requirements for this is the establishment of internationally
  unified safety standards. I hope to see early progress in the
  establishment of such standards by the International Atomic
  Energy Agency, which is contributing effectively towards the
  promotion of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.</p>

  <p>Next, an international agreement on the
  exchange and allocation of nuclear fuel will have to be
  concluded. In view of the trend towards a worldwide shortage of
  energy resources, there is the risk that at some time in the
  future an unbridled race for the acquisition of nuclear fuel may
  develop. Needless to say, such a development would be a threat to
  peace and detrimental to the well-being of mankind. Therefore, I
  believe that effective steps should be taken now, based upon a
  sound vision for the future.</p>

  <p>In the light of the above, it would be most
  desirable to see the establishment of a system where, under the
  terms of an agreement to be concluded for the exchange and
  allocation of nuclear fuel, such fuels would be placed under the
  control of an international agency, which would see to it that
  countries needing fuel would be assured of a stable supply.
  However, an immediate issue upon which the development of the
  peaceful use of atomic energy hinges is an international
  agreement providing for, at the very least, mutual accommodation
  with regard to nuclear fuel needs.</p>

  <p>Lastly, there is the problem of
  international cooperation in research and development work on
  nuclear fusion. The rapid development of a system for the
  effective use of thermonuclear energy seems to be beyond the
  capacity of a single nation, no matter how great its resources
  may be. I suppose that if we could bring together the greatest
  minds of the world, the time required to bring nuclear fusion
  into practical use might be considerably shortened, as against
  present predictions that such a breakthrough may require another
  twenty to thirty years.</p>

  <p>Japan has reached an advanced stage in
  science and technology. I have no doubt that, should an
  international research facility be created, young and able brains
  from among us will gladly volunteer to participate in its
  work.</p>

  <p>I would like to state the three points I
  have referred to as the "Three Principles for the Peaceful Uses
  of Nuclear Energy". For a considerable time now, warnings have
  been given of an approaching fossil fuel energy resources crisis.
  In spite of these warnings, only inadequate progress has been
  made in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. One of the reasons
  for this has been attributed to narrow-minded nationalism. It is
  true that nationalism has played a role as a symbol of the
  freedom and equality of each of the countries which make up the
  community of nations. Politically speaking, the historical role
  of nationalism has not as yet been played out in the world.</p>

  <p>However, it is clear that, when looked at
  from the point of view of enlarging the future of mankind,
  narrow-minded and near-sighted nationalism does indeed hamper
  progress in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. It
  certainly does not promote its progress. All peoples should be
  united in positive efforts to make peace a reality and to
  strengthen the foundations on which that peace rests so as to
  secure for all humanity progress and a better life.</p>

  <p><br>
  V.</p>

  <p>I feel extremely fortunate to have been
  awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at this point in time, as a result
  of the decision of the distinguished members of the Peace
  Committee. I am deeply moved, because this means that my
  sustained efforts for peace over the years have received
  international recognition. However, when I look back on Japan's
  history, I am inclined to think that there were people in my
  country before me who worked for peace, whose achievements far
  exceeded my own, and who might have been worthier than I to
  receive the Peace Prize.</p>

  <p>I am thinking not only of contributions to
  peace in the narrow sense of the term. I am convinced that our
  people, by dint of their ability and efforts, are intrinsically
  capable of making a great contribution to world civilization.</p>

  <p>Had the Nobel Prize been established a
  thousand years ago, the first recipient of the Prize for
  Literature might well have been a Japanese woman. Also, had Japan
  taken part in the life of the international community several
  centuries earlier, Japanese recipients of the Physics, Chemistry,
  Biology and Economic Science Prizes might well have been
  numerous. At present, the Japanese recipients of Nobel Prizes,
  including myself, number only five<a href=
  "#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>. To me, it seems, this offers food for
  thought.</p>

  <p>I say this because Japanese history and
  culture have followed very unique paths. It is a fact that,
  because of our long isolation from other nations, we suffer from
  social awkwardness and we as a people have been unable to
  contribute actively to world civilization in a measure
  commensurate with our potential. We should, I think, reflect
  deeply on the unfortunate inadequacy of our efforts to influence
  or, rather, to communicate with the peoples of the world.
  Especially in recent times, in our haste to absorb Western
  civilization and culture, we have been somewhat deficient, I
  fear, in our efforts to let foreign nations know about our own
  civilization and culture.</p>

  <p>Japan is basically a difficult nation to
  understand because the foundation of our culture differs so much
  from those of the West and of other Asian countries. Because this
  was so, we should have tried to make ourselves better understood.
  I cannot but admit that at a time when international
  understanding was required, our efforts to promote such
  understanding were inadequate.</p>

  <p>When I think of the geniuses and great men
  of our country who failed to obtain international recognition, I
  feel all the more fortunate to have been accorded this precious
  prize. At the same time, I feel deeply the need to increase our
  own efforts to promote better international understanding.</p>

  <p>I intend to make this award culturally
  meaningful. I, therefore, plan to use the prize I received to
  further the links between our country and the rest of the
  world.</p>

  <p>The intention of Alfred Nobel in
  instituting the Nobel Prizes in his will was undoubtedly to
  promote peaceful relations among nations. I should like to stress
  that for my part, following in Alfred Nobel's steps, I shall
  devote myself to increasing still more my people's capacity to
  contribute to the well-being of the international community, and
  to obtaining the world's understanding for such efforts.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
