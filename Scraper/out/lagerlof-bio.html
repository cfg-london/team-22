  <h1>Selma Lagerl&ouml;f - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lagerlof.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Selma Lagerl&ouml;f</b>
  (1858-1940) was born in &Ouml;stra Emterwik, V&auml;rmland,
  Sweden. She was brought up on M&aring;rbacka, the family estate,
  which she did not leave until 1881, when she went to a teachers'
  college at Stockholm. In 1885 she became a teacher at the girls'
  secondary school in Landskrona. She had been writing poetry ever
  since she was a child, but she did not publish anything until
  1890, when a Swedish weekly gave her the first prize in a
  literary competition and published excerpts from the book which
  was to be her first, best, and most popular work. <i>G&ouml;sta
  Berlings Saga</i> was published in 1891, but went unnoticed until
  its Danish translation received wide critical acclaim and paved
  the way for the book's lasting success in Sweden and elsewhere.
  In 1895 financial support from the royal family and the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/lagerlof-bio.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> encouraged her to abandon teaching altogether. She
  travelled in Italy and wrote <em>Antikrists mirakler</em> (1897) [<i>The
  Miracles of Antichrist</i>], a novel set in Sicily. After several
  minor works she published <i>Jerusalem</i> (1901-1902) [<i>The
  Holy City</i>], a novel about Swedish peasants who emigrated to
  the Holy Land and whom she had visited in 1900. This work was her
  first immediate success. A book intended as a primer for
  elementary schools became one of the most charming children's
  books in any language: <i>Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom
  Sverige</i> (1906) [<i>The Wonderful Adventures of Nils</i>].</p>

  <p>None of her later works matched the power
  or success of <i>G&ouml;sta Berlings Saga</i>. In the
  mid-twenties she published the historical trilogy:
  <i>L&ouml;wensk&ouml;ldska Ringen</i> (1925), <i>Charlotte
  L&ouml;wensk&ouml;ld</i> (1927), and <i>Anna Sv&auml;rd</i>
  (1928) [<i>The Ring of the L&ouml;wensk&ouml;lds, 3 vols.</i>].
  She also published several volumes of reminiscences under the
  title <i>M&aring;rbacka</i> (1922-32).</p>
