  <h1>Ronald Ross - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ross.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Ronald
  Ross</b> was born on May 13, 1857, as the son of Sir C.C.G. Ross,
  a General in the English army. He commenced the study of medicine
  at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1875; entered the
  Indian Medical Service in 1881. He commenced the study of malaria
  in 1892. In 1894 he determined to make an experimental
  investigation in India of the hypothesis of Laveran and Manson
  that mosquitoes are connected with the propagation of the
  disease. After two and a half years' failure, Ross succeeded in
  demonstrating the life-cycle of the parasites of malaria in
  mosquitoes, thus establishing the hypothesis of Laveran and
  Manson. In 1899 he joined the Liverpool School of Tropical
  Medicine under the direction of Sir Alfred Jones. He was
  immediately sent to West Africa to continue his investigations,
  and there he found the species of mosquitoes which convey the
  deadly African fever. Since then the School has been unremitting
  in its efforts to improve health, and especially to reduce the
  malaria in West Africa. Ross' researches have been confirmed and
  assisted by many distinguished authorities, especially by
  <a href="../1905/index.html">Koch</a>, Daniels, Bignami, Celli,
  Christophers, Stephens, Annett, Austen, Ruge, Ziemann, and many
  others.<br>
  <br>
  In 1901 Ross was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of
  Surgeons of England and also a Fellow of the Royal Society, of
  which he became Vice-President from 1911 to 1913. In 1902 he was
  appointed a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of Bath by His
  Majesty the King of Great Britain. In 1911 he was elevated to the
  rank of Knight Commander of the same Order. In Belgium, he was
  made an Officer in the Order of Leopold II.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 a movement was set on foot to commemorate the valuable
  services rendered to the School of Tropical Medicine by its
  originator and Chairman, Sir Alfred Jones, by founding a Chair of
  Tropical Medicine in University College to be connected with the
  School. The movement was met with enthusiastic support, and an
  amount of money was quickly collected sufficient to found
  &laquo;Sir Alfred Jones' Chair of Tropical Medicine&raquo;. Ross
  was appointed to the Professorship in 1902 and retained the Chair
  until 1912, when he left Liverpool, and was appointed Physician
  for Tropical Diseases at Kings College Hospital, London, a post
  which he held together with the Chair of Tropical Sanitation in
  Liverpool. He remained in these posts until 1917, when he was
  appointed Consultant in Malariology to the War Office, his
  service in this capacity, and in special connection with epidemic
  malaria then occurring on combatant troops, being recognized by
  his elevation to the rank of Knight Commander, St. Michael and
  St. George, in 1918. He was later appointed Consultant in Malaria
  to the Ministry of Pensions. In 1926 he assumed the post of
  Director in Chief of the Ross Institute and Hospital of Tropical
  Diseases and Hygiene, which had been created by admirers of his
  work, and he remained in this position until his death. He was
  also a President of the Society of Tropical Medicine. His Memoirs
  (London, 1923) were &laquo;inscribed to the people of Sweden and
  the memory of Alfred Nobel&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  During this active career, Ross' interest lay mainly in the
  initiation of measures for the prevention of malaria in different
  countries of the world. He carried out surveys and initiated
  schemes in many places, including West Africa, the Suez Canal
  zone, Greece, Mauritius, Cyprus, and in the areas affected by the
  1914-1918 war. He also initiated organizations, which have proved
  to be well established, for the prevention of malaria within the
  planting industries of India and Ceylon. He made many
  contributions to the epidemiology of malaria and to methods of
  its survey and assessment, but perhaps his greatest was the
  development of mathematical models for the study of its
  epidemiology, initiated in his report on Mauritius in 1908,
  elaborated in his <i>Prevention of Malaria</i> in 1911 and
  further elaborated in a more generalized form in scientific
  papers published by the Royal Society in 1915 and 1916. These
  papers represented a profound mathematical interest which was not
  confined to epidemiology, but led him to make material
  contributions to both pure and applied mathematics. Those related
  to &laquo;pathometry&raquo; are best known and, 40 years later,
  constitute the basis of much of the epidemiological understanding
  of insect-borne diseases.<br>
  <br>
  Through these works Ross continued his great contribution in the
  form of the discovery of the transmission of malaria by the
  mosquito, but he also found time and mental energy for many other
  pursuits, being poet, playwright, writer and painter.
  Particularly, his poetic works gained him wide acclamation which
  was independent of his medical and mathematical standing.<br>
  <br>
  He received many honours in addition to the Nobel Prize, and was
  given Honorary Membership of learned societies of most countries
  of Europe, and of many other continents. He got an honorary M.D.
  degree in Stockholm in 1910 at the centenary celebration of the
  Caroline Institute. Whilst his vivacity and single-minded search
  for truth caused friction with some people, he enjoyed a vast
  circle of friends in Europe, Asia and America who respected him
  for his personality as well as for his genius.<br>
  <br>
  Ross married Rosa Bessie Bloxam in 1889. They had two sons,
  Ronald and Charles, and two daughters, Dorothy and Sylvia. His
  wife died in 1931, Ross survived her until a year later, when he
  died after a long illness, at the Ross Institute, London, on
  September 16, 1932.</p>
