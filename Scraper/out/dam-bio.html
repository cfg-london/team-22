  <h1>Henrik Dam - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dam.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>(Carl Peter)
  Henrik Dam</b> was born in Copenhagen on 21st February 1895, to
  Emil Dam, apothecary, and his wife Emilie (n&eacute;e Peterson), a
  teacher.<br>
  <br>
  The young man graduated in chemistry from the Polytechnic
  Institute, Copenhagen in 1920, and the same year was appointed
  instructor (assistant) in chemistry at the School of Agriculture
  and Veterinary Medicine, progressing to instructor in
  biochemistry at the Physiological Laboratory of the University of
  Copenhagen, 1923. The following year saw his marriage, to
  Inger, n&eacute;e Olsen.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 Dam studied microchemistry in Graz (Austria) with
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1923/index.html">F. Pregl</a>. He
  became Assistant Professor at the Institute of Biochemistry,
  Copenhagen University, in 1928, and was promoted to Associate
  Professor at the same place in 1929, continuing to hold this post
  although he was working abroad part of the time, till 1941. On
  submitting a thesis <i>Nogle Unders&oslash;gelser over Sterinernes
  Biologiske Betydning</i> (Some investigations on the biological
  significance of the sterines) to the University of Copenhagen in
  1934, Dam was awarded Ph.D. in Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  To further his studies of the metabolism of sterols, Dam obtained
  a Rockefeller Fellowship and worked in Rudolph Schoenheimer's
  Laboratory in Freiburg, Germany, during 1932-1933, and later
  worked with <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/index.html">P.
  Karrer</a>, of Zurich, in 1935. He discovered vitamin K while
  studying the sterol metabolism of chicks in Copenhagen. He
  studied this vitamin further with respect to its occurrence and
  biological function in animals and plants, as well as its
  application in human medicine, its fundamental chemical and
  physical properties and its purification and isolation - the
  latter part of this research being carried out in collaboration
  with P. Karrer. From the study of vitamin K arose the observation
  of some new symptoms in experimental animals, such as increased
  capillary permeability and colouration of adipose tissue, which
  turned out to be due to the ingestion of certain fats in the
  absence of vitamin E.<br>
  <br>
  He was on a lecture tour of Canada and the United States under
  the auspices of the American Scandinavian Foundation in 1940-1941, this
  tour having been planned before the occupation of Denmark by
  German troops in April, 1940. He was able to carry out research
  in Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories during the summer
  and autumn of 1941, and at the University of
  Rochester, N.Y., between 1942-1945 as a Senior Research
  Associate - it was during this period that he was awarded the
  1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine - and at the Rockefeller
  Institute for Medical Research in 1945 as an Associate
  Member.<br>
  <br>
  During his absence, Dam was appointed Professor of Biochemistry
  at the Polytechnic Institute, Copenhagen, in 1941, though the
  designation of his Chair at the Polytechnic Institute was changed
  to Professor of Biochemistry and Nutrition in 1950.<br>
  <br>
  After his return to Denmark in 1946, Dam's main research subjects
  were vitamin K, vitamin E, fats, cholesterol, and, in recent
  years, nutritional studies in relation to gall-stone formation.
  He has been leader of the Biochemical Division of the Danish Fat
  Research Institute from 1956 to 1962.<br>
  <br>
  He has published or has collaborated in the publication of about
  315 articles on biochemical problems, mainly concerning the
  biochemistry of sterols, vitamins K and E, and fats.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Dam is a member of the Danish Academy of Technical
  Sciences (1947); the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters
  (1948); he was Correspondant &Eacute;tranger, Acad&eacute;mie Royale
  de M&eacute;decine de Belgique (1951); elected Hon. Fellow of the
  Royal
  Society, Edinburgh (1953); became Joint Honorary President,
  International Union of Nutritional Sciences in 1954, and was
  Corresponding Member of the German Association for Nutrition in
  1961, following on the award of the Norman Medal by the German
  Association for Fat Research the previous year.</p>
