  <h1>Andr&eacute; Lwoff - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lwoff.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Andr&eacute; Michel 
              Lwoff</b> was born on 8 May 1902 in Ainay-le-Ch&acirc;teau (Allier). 
              He joined the Institut Pasteur 
              at the age of 19. He had graduated in science and had done one year 
              of medicine. Lwoff completed his studies while working in the laboratory. 
              In 1921, he had the good fortune to study under a very great microbiologist, 
              Edouard Chatton; Lwoff remained his colleague for seventeen years. 
              It was through him that Lwoff joined the Institut Pasteur in the 
              laboratory of F&eacute;lix Mesnil. His first investigations were 
              on the parasitic ciliates, their developmental cycle, and morphogenesis. 
              Later, he worked on the problems involved in the nutrition of protozoans. 
              Andr&eacute; Lwoff obtained his M. D. in 1927 and his Ph. D. in 
              1932.<br>
              <br>
              In 1932-1933 a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to spend a year in Heidelberg 
              in the laboratory of <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a>. He studied haematin - a growth factor 
              for the flagellates - the specificity of protohaematin, its quantitative 
              effect on growth, and the part it played in the respiratory catalyst 
              system.<br>
              <br>
              Then in 1936, again with the aid of a grant from the Rockefeller 
              Foundation, Lwoff and his wife spent seven months in Cambridge in 
              the laboratory of David Keilin; factor V, which is required by <i>Haemophilus 
              influenzae</i>, was identified with cozymase and its physiological 
              role for the bacterium was defined.<br>
              <br>
              There were many other investigations on growth factors for flagellates 
              and ciliates with regard to growth factors, loss of function, and 
              physiological development until the time when Lwoff began working 
              on the problem of lysogenic bacteria.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Lwoff was appointed Head of the Department at the Institut Pasteur 
              in 1938, and Professor of Microbiology at the Science Faculty in 
              Paris in 1959.<br>
              <br>
              The observation of isolated bacteria led him to the conclusion that 
              lysogenic bacteria did not secrete bacteriophages, that the production 
              of bacteriophages led to the death of the bacterium, and above all 
              that this production must be induced by external factors. It was 
              this hypothesis which, together with Louis Siminovitch and Niels 
              Kjeldgaard, led Lwoff to discover the inductive action of ultraviolet 
              irradiation (1950).<br>
              <br>
              In 1954 Prof. Lwoff began studying poliovirus. Experiments on the 
              relations between the temperature sensitivity of viral development 
              and neurovirulence led him to consider the problem of viral infection. 
              In this way it became clear that non-specific factors play an important 
              part in the development of the primary infection. He has now begun 
              to investigate the action mechanism of specific inhibitors of viral 
              development.<br>
              <br>
              Andr&eacute; Lwoff has been honoured by the following prizes of 
              the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences: Lallemant, Noury, Longchampt, 
              Chaussier, Petit d'Ormoy prizes and the Charles-L&eacute;opold Mayer 
              Foundation prize. He also received the Barbier prize from the Acad&eacute;mie 
              de M&eacute;decine, and the Leeuwenhoek Medal of the Royal 
              Netherlands Academy of Science and Arts (Amsterdam, 1960), as 
              well as the Keilin Medal of the British Biochemical Society (1964).<br>
              <br>
              He is a Honorary Member of the Harvey Society (1954), of the American 
              Society of Biological Chemists (1961), of the Society for General Microbiology 
              (1962), and a Corresponding Member of the Botanical 
              Society of America (1956).<br>
              <br>
              He is President of the International Association of Microbiological 
              Societies, and a Member of the International Committee for the Organization 
              of Medical Sciences. He is a Member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
              Zoologique de France, of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Pathologie 
              exotique, of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Biologie and president 
              of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Microbiologistes de langue fran&ccedil;aise. 
              Furthermore a Honorary Member of the New York Academy of Sciences (1955), 
              Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 
              (1958), Associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (1955),
