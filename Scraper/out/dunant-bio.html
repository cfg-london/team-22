  <h1>Henry Dunant - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dunant.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Jean Henry
  Dunant</b>'s life (May 8, 1828-October 30, 1910) is a study in
  contrasts. He was born into a wealthy home but died in a hospice;
  in middle age he juxtaposed great fame with total obscurity, and
  success in business with bankruptcy; in old age he was virtually
  exiled from the Genevan society of which he had once been an
  ornament and died in a lonely room, leaving a bitter testament.
  His passionate humanitarianism was the one constant in his life,
  and the <a href="../1963/index.html">Red Cross</a> his living
  monument.<br>
  <br>
  The Geneva household into which Henry Dunant was born was
  religious, humanitarian, and civic-minded. In the first part of
  his life Dunant engaged quite seriously in religious activities
  and for a while in full-time work as a representative of the
  Young Men's
  Christian Association, traveling in France, Belgium, and
  Holland.<br>
  <br>
  When he was twenty-six, Dunant entered the business world as a
  representative of the Compagnie genevoise des Colonies de
  S&eacute;tif in North Africa and Sicily. In 1858 he published his
  first book, <i>Notice sur la R&eacute;gence de Tunis</i> [An
  Account of the Regency in Tunis], made up for the most part of
  travel observations but containing a remarkable chapter, a long
  one, which he published separately in 1863, entitled
  <i>L'Esclavage chez les musulmans et aux &Eacute;tats-Unis
  d'Am&eacute;rique</i> [Slavery among the Mohammedans and in the
  United States of America].<br>
  <br>
  Having served his commercial apprenticeship, Dunant devised a
  daring financial scheme, making himself president of the
  Financial and Industrial Company of Mons-G&eacute;mila Mills in
  Algeria (eventually capitalized at 100,000,000 francs) to exploit
  a large tract of land. Needing water rights, he resolved to take
  his plea directly to Emperor Napoleon III. Undeterred by the fact
  that Napoleon was in the field directing the French armies who,
  with the Italians, were striving to drive the Austrians out of
  Italy, Dunant made his way to Napoleon's headquarters near the
  northern Italian town of Solferino. He arrived there in time to
  witness, and to participate in the aftermath of, one of the
  bloodiest battles of the nineteenth century. His awareness and
  conscience honed, he published in 1862 a small book <i>Un
  Souvenir de Solf&eacute;rino</i> [<i>A Memory of Solferino</i>],
  destined to make him famous.<br>
  <br>
  <i>A Memory</i>&nbsp;has three themes. The first is that of the
  battle itself. The second depicts the battlefield after the
  fighting - its &laquo;chaotic disorder, despair unspeakable, and
  misery of every kind&raquo; - and tells the main story of the
  effort to care for the wounded in the small town of Castiglione.
  The third theme is a plan. The nations of the world should form
  relief societies to provide care for the wartime wounded; each
  society should be sponsored by a governing board composed of the
  nation's leading figures, should appeal to everyone to volunteer,
  should train these volunteers to aid the wounded on the
  battlefield and to care for them later until they recovered. On
  February 7, 1863, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; genevoise d'utilit&eacute;
  publique [Geneva Society for Public Welfare] appointed a
  committee of five, including Dunant, to examine the possibility
  of putting this plan into action. With its call for an
  international conference, this committee, in effect, founded the
  Red Cross. Dunant, pouring his money and time into the cause,
  traveled over most of Europe obtaining promises from governments
  to send representatives. The conference, held from October 26 to
  29, with thirty-nine delegates from sixteen nations attending,
  approved some sweeping resolutions and laid the groundwork for a
  gathering of plenipotentiaries. On August 22, 1864, twelve
  nations signed an international treaty, commonly known as the
  Geneva Convention, agreeing to guarantee neutrality to sanitary
  personnel, to expedite supplies for their use, and to adopt a
  special identifying emblem - in virtually all instances a red
  cross on a field of white<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Dunant had transformed a personal idea into an international
  treaty. But his work was not finished. He approved the efforts to
  extend the scope of the Red Cross to cover naval personnel in
  wartime, and in peacetime to alleviate the hardships caused by
  natural catastrophes. In 1866 he wrote a brochure called the
  <i>Universal and International Society for the Revival of the
  Orient</i>, setting forth a plan to create a neutral colony in
  Palestine. In 1867 he produced a plan for a publishing venture
  called an &laquo;International and Universal Library&raquo; to be
  composed of the great masterpieces of all time. In 1872 he
  convened a conference to establish the &laquo;Alliance universelle
  de l'ordre et de la civilisation&raquo; which was to consider the
  need for an international convention on the handling of prisoners
  of war and for the settling of international disputes by courts
  of arbitration rather than by war.<br>
  <br>
  The eight years from 1867 to 1875 proved to be a sharp contrast
  to those of 1859-1867. In 1867 Dunant was bankrupt. The water
  rights had not been granted, the company had been mismanaged in
  North Africa, and Dunant himself had been concentrating his
  attention on humanitarian pursuits, not on business ventures.
  After the disaster, which involved many of his Geneva friends,
  Dunant was no longer welcome in Genevan society. Within a few
  years he was literally living at the level of the beggar. There
  were times, he says<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>, when he
  dined on a crust of bread, blackened his coat with ink, whitened
  his collar with chalk, slept out of doors.<br>
  <br>
  For the next twenty years, from 1875 to 1895, Dunant disappeared
  into solitude. After brief stays in various places, he settled
  down in Heiden, a small Swiss village. Here a village teacher
  named Wilhelm Sonderegger found him in 1890 and informed the
  world that Dunant was alive, but the world took little note.
  Because he was ill, Dunant was moved in 1892 to the hospice at
  Heiden. And here, in Room 12, he spent the remaining eighteen
  years of his life. Not, however, as an unknown. After 1895 when
  he was once more rediscovered, the world heaped prizes and awards
  upon him.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the prizes and the honors, Dunant did not move from Room
  12. Upon his death, there was no funeral ceremony, no mourners,
  no cortege. In accordance with his wishes he was carried to his
  grave &laquo;like a dog&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Dunant had not spent any of the prize monies he had received. He
  bequeathed some legacies to those who had cared for him in the
  village hospital, endowed a &laquo;free bed&raquo; that was to be
  available to the sick among the poorest people in the village,
  and left the remainder to philanthropic enterprises in Norway and
  Switzerland.</p>
