  <h1>Sidney Altman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="altman.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Montreal in 1939, the
  second son of poor immigrants. My mother worked in a textile mill
  and my father in a grocery store before they met and married. It
  was from them that I learned that hard work in stable
  surroundings could yield rewards, even if only in infinitesimally
  small increments.<br>
  <br>
  For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of
  opportunity. However, it was made clear to the first generation
  of Canadian-born children that the path to opportunity was
  through education. No sacrifice was too great to forward our
  education and, fortunately, books and the tradition of study were
  not unknown in our family.<br>
  <br>
  I am conscious of two events that sparked my early interest in
  science, the first being the appearance of the A-bomb. The
  mystique associated with the bomb, the role that scientists
  played in it, and its general importance could not fail to
  impress even a six-year old. About seven years later I was given
  a book about the periodic table of the elements. For the first
  time I saw the elegance of scientific theory and its predictive
  power. I should mention that while I was growing up, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> was presented
  as a worthy role model for a young boy who was good at his
  studies. I added various writers of fiction and stars of ice
  hockey and baseball to my pantheon.<br>
  <br>
  By the time I reached high school my father's grocery store had
  made our life adequately comfortable and I was able to choose,
  without any practical encumbrances, the subjects that I wanted to
  pursue in college. My intention was to enroll at McGill University but
  an unexpected series of events led me to study physics at the
  Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology. There I experienced four years of
  over-stimulation among brilliant, arrogant and zany peers and
  outstanding teachers. Lee Grodzins supervised my senior thesis in
  nuclear physics and provided me with a wonderful research
  experience and with his friendship. During my final semester at
  MIT, I took a short introductory course in molecular biology to
  find out what all the excitement was about. That course, taught
  by Cyrus Levinthal, familiarized me with nucleic acids and
  molecular genetics and prepared me for future encounters with
  these topics.<br>
  <br>
  I spent eighteen months as a graduate student in physics at
  Columbia
  University, waiting unhappily for an opportunity to work in a
  laboratory and wondering if I should continue in physics. Eight
  months later, having left Columbia, I was studying physics in a
  summer program and working in Colorado when I decided to enroll
  as a graduate student in biophysics. George Gamow, the physicist,
  had steered me to Leonard Lerman, then working on the
  intercalation of acridines into DNA at the University of Colorado
  Medical Center. In the excellent department chaired by Theodore
  T. Puck, Lerman provided the guidance, friendship and critical
  analysis that enabled me to enjoy molecular biology in a
  productive manner. After working on the effects of acridines on
  the replication of bacteriophage T4 DNA, I joined Mathew
  Meselson's laboratory at Harvard University to study a DNA
  endonuclease involved in the replication and recombination of T4
  DNA. Two years later I was privileged to become a member of the
  group led by Sydney Brenner and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick</a> at the
  Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
  Cambridge,
  England. As an ex-physicist, I felt as if I was joining the
  equivalent of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr's</a> group in
  Copenhagen in the 1920's. It turned out to be scientific
  heaven.<br>
  <br>
  At the MRC laboratory I started the work that led to the
  discovery of RNase P and the enzymatic properties of the RNA
  subunit of that enzyme. John D. Smith, as well as several
  post-doctoral colleagues, provided me with much good advice that
  enabled me to test my ideas. The discovery of the first
  radiochemically pure precursor to a tRNA molecule enabled me to
  get a job as an assistant professor at Yale University in
  1971, a difficult time to get any job at all.<br>
  <br>
  My career at Yale followed a standard academic pattern with
  promotion through the ranks until I became Professor in 1980. I
  was Chairman of my department from 1983 - 1985 and in 1985 became
  the Dean of Yale College for four years, an experience that not
  only provided me with the opportunity to make many new friends,
  mostly outside the sciences, but also revealed to me the full
  panorama of human and academic problems that exist in a
  university community. On July 1, 1989 I returned to the post of
  Professor on a fulltime basis.<br>
  <br>
  I have been blessed with outstanding mentors, people who became
  personal friends and who have illuminated so many aspects of
  human creativity for me with their intellectual power, expertise
  as scientists and qualities as human beings. In particular, they
  are Leonard Lerman, Mathew Meselson, Sydney Brenner and Lee
  Grodzins. There are, of course, many others whose names I cannot
  list here. My life has been enormously enriched by my marriage to
  Ann Korner in 1972. My wife is my colleague, mentor and friend in
  every respect. She and our two wonderful children, Daniel, born
  in 1974 and Leah, born in 1977, have contributed immeasurably to
  whatever success I have achieved.</p>
