  <h1>Roald Hoffmann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hoffmann.jpg" class="bio-img">I came to a
  happy Jewish family in dark days in Europe. On July 18, 1937 I
  was born to Clara (n&eacute;e Rosen) and Hillel Safran in Zloczow,
  Poland. This town, typical of the Pale of the Settlement, was
  part of Austria-Hungary when my parents were born. It was Poland
  in my time and is part of the Soviet Union now. I was named after
  Roald Amundsen, my first Scandinavian connection. My father was a
  civil engineer, educated at the Lvov (Lemberg) Polytechnic, my
  mother by training a school teacher.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 the war began. Our part of Poland was under Russian
  occupation from 1939-1941. Then in 1941 darkness descended, and
  the annihilation of Polish Jewry began. We went to a ghetto, then
  a labor camp. My father smuggled my mother and me out of the camp
  in early 1943, and for the remainder of the war we were hidden by
  a good Ukrainian in the attic of a school house in a nearby
  village. My father remained behind in the camp. He organized a
  breakout attempt which was discovered. Hillel Safran was killed
  by the Nazis and their helpers in June 1943. Most of the rest of
  my family suffered a similar fate. My mother and I, and a handful
  of relatives, survived. We were freed by the Red Army in June
  1944. At the end of 1944 we moved to Przemysl and then to Krakow,
  where I finally went to school. My mother remarried, and Paul
  Hoffmann was a kind and gentle father to me until his death, two
  months prior to the Nobel Prize announcement.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 we left Poland for Czechoslovakia. From there we moved to
  a displaced persons' camp, Bindermichl, near Linz, in Austria. In
  1947 we went on to another camp in Wasseralfingen bei Aalen in
  Germany, then to M&uuml;nchen. On Washington's Birthday 1949 we
  came to the United States.<br>
  <br>
  I learned English, my sixth language at this point, quite
  quickly. After P.S. 93 and P.S. 16, Brooklyn, I went on to the
  great Stuyvesant High School, one of New York's selective science
  schools. Among my classmates were not only future scientists but
  lawyers, historians, writers - a remarkable group of boys. In the
  summers I went to Camp Juvenile in the Catskills, a formative
  experience. Elinor, my younger sister, was born in 1954.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955 I began at Columbia College as a premedical student. That
  summer and the next I worked at the National Bureau of Standards
  in Washington with E.S. Newman and R.E. Ferguson. The summer
  after I worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with J.P.
  Cumming. These summers were important because they introduced me
  to the joys of research, and kept me going through some routine
  courses at Columbia. I did have some good chemistry teachers,
  G.K. Fracnkel and R.S. Halford, and a superb teaching assistant,
  R. Schneider. But I must say that the world that opened up before
  me in my non science courses is what I remember best from my
  Columbia days. I almost switched to art history.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 I began graduate work at Harvard. I intended to work with W.E.
  Moffitt, a remarkable young theoretician, but he died in my first
  year there. A young instructor, M.P. Gouterman, was one of the
  few faculty members at Harvard who at that time was interested in
  doing theoretical work, and I began research with him. In the
  summer of 1959 I got a scholarship from P.O. Lowdin's Quantum
  Chemistry Group at Uppsala to attend a Summer School. The school
  was held on Liding&ouml;, an island outside of Stockholm. I
  met Eva B&ouml;rjesson who had a summer job as a receptionist at
  the school, and we were married the following year.<br>
  <br>
  I came back to Harvard, began some abortive (and explosive)
  experimental work, and Eva and I took off for a year to the
  Soviet Union. It was the second year of the U.S.-U.S.S.R graduate
  student exchange. I worked for 9 months at Moscow University with
  A.S. Davydov on excitor theory. Eva and I lived in one of the
  wings, Zona E, of that great central building of Moscow
  University. My proficiency in Russian and interest in Russian
  culture date from that time.<br>
  <br>
  On returning to the U.S. I switched research advisors and started
  to work with W.N. Lipscomb, who had just come to Harvard.
  Computers were just coming into use. With Lipscomb's
  encouragement and ebullient guidance, L.L. Lohr and I programmed
  what was eventually called the extended H&uuml;ckel method. I
  applied it to boron hydrides and polyhedral molecules in general.
  One day I discovered that one could get the barrier to internal
  rotation in ethane approximately right using this method. This
  was the beginning of my work on organic molecules.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 I received my doctorate, as the first Harvard Ph.D. of
  both Lipscomb and Gouterman. Several academic jobs were
  available, and I was also offered a Junior Fellowship in the
  Society of Fellows at Harvard. I chose the Junior Fellowship. The
  three ensuing years in the Society (1962 - 65), gave me the time
  to switch my interests from theory to applied theory,
  specifically to organic chemistry. It was EJ. Corey who taught
  me, by example, what was exciting in organic chemistry. I began
  to look at all kinds of organic transformations, and so I was
  prepared when in the Spring of 1964 R.B. Woodward asked me some
  questions about what subsequently came to be called electrocyclic
  reactions. That last year at Harvard was exciting. I was learning
  organic chemistry at a great pace, and I had gained access to a
  superior mind. <a href="../1965/index.html">R.B. Woodward</a>
  possessed clarity of thought, powers of concentration,
  encyclopedic knowledge of chemistry, and an aesthetic sense
  unparalleled in modern chemistry. He taught me, and I have taught
  others.<br>
  <br>
  The 1962 - 65 period was creative in other ways as well: Our two
  children, Hillel Jan and Ingrid Helena, were born to Eva and
  me.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965 I came to Cornell where I have been ever since. A collegial
  department, a great university and a lovely community have kept
  me happy. I am now the John A. Newman Professor of Physical
  Science. I have received many of the honors of my profession. I
  am especially proud that in addition to the American Chemical
  Society's A.C. Cope Award in Organic Chemistry, which I received
  jointly with R.B. Woodward in 1973, I have just been selected for
  the Society's Award in Inorganic Chemistry in 1982, the only
  person to receive these two awards in different subfields of our
  science.<br>
  <br>
  I have been asked to summarize my contributions to science.<br>
  <br>
  My research interests are in the electronic structure of stable
  and unstable molecules, and of transition states in reactions. I
  apply a variety of computational methods, semiempirical and
  nonempirical, as well as qualitative arguments, to problems of
  structure and reactivity of both organic and inorganic molecules
  of medium size. My first major contribution was the development
  of the extended Huckel method, a molecular orbital scheme which
  allowed the calculation of the approximate sigma- and pie-
  electronic structure of molecules, and which gave reasonable
  predictions of molecular conformations and simple potential
  surfaces. These calculations were instrumental in a renaissance
  of interest in sigma electrons and their properties. My second
  major contribution was a two-pronged exploration of the
  electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in
  organic reactions. In a fruitful collaboration R.B. Woodward and
  I applied simple but powerful arguments of symmetry and bonding
  to the analysis of concerted reactions. These considerations have
  been of remarkable predictive value and have stimulated much
  productive experimental work. In the second approach I have
  analyzed, with the aid of various semiempirical methods, the
  molecular orbitals of most types of reactive intermediates in
  organic chemistry-carbonium ions, diradicals, methylenes,
  benzynes, etc.<br>
  <br>
  Recently I and my collaborators have been exploring the structure
  and reactivity of inorganic and organometallic molecules.
  Approximate molecular orbital calculations and symmetry-based
  arguments have been applied by my research group to explore the
  basic structural features of every kind of inorganic molecule,
  from complexes of small diatomics to clusters containing several
  transition metal atoms. A particularly useful theoretical device,
  the conceptual construction of complex molecules from
  ML<sub>n</sub> fragments, has been used by my research group to
  analyze cluster bonding and the equilibrium geometries and
  conformational preferences of olefin and polyene metal carbonyl
  complexes. A satisfactory understanding of the mode of binding of
  essentially every ligand to a metal is now available, and a
  beginning has been made toward understand ing organometallic
  reactivity with the exploration of potential energy surfaces for
  ethylene insertion, reductive elimination and alkyl migrative
  insertion reactions. Several new structural types, such as the
  triple-decker and porphyrin sandwiches, have been predicted, and
  recently synthesized by others. On the more inorganic side, we
  have systematically explored the geometries, polytopal
  rearrangement and substitution site preferences of five, six,
  seven and eight coordination, the factors that influence whether
  certain ligands will bridge or not, the constraints of
  metal-metal bonding, and the geometry of uranyl and other
  actinide complexes. I and my coworkers are beginning work on
  extended solid state structures and the design of novel
  conducting systems.<br>
  <br>
  The technical description above does not communicate what I think
  is my major contribution. I am a teacher, and I am proud of it.
  At Cornell University I have taught primarily undergraduates, and
  indeed almost every year since 1966 have taught first-year
  general chemistry. I have also taught chemistry courses to
  non-scientists and graduate courses in bonding theory and quantum
  mechanics. To the chemistry community at large, to my fellow
  scientists, I have tried to teach "applied theoretical
  chemistry": a special blend of computations stimulated by
  experiment and coupled to the construction of general models -
  frameworks for understanding.</p>
