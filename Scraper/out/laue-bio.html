  <h1>Max von Laue - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="laue.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Max Laue</b> was born on October 9,
  1879 at Pfaffendorf, near Koblenz. He was the son of Julius von
  Laue, an official in the German military administration, who was
  raised to hereditary nobility in 1913 and who was often sent to
  various towns, so that von Laue spent his youth in Brandenburg,
  Altona, Posen, Berlin and Strassburg, going to school in the
  three last-named cities. At the Protestant school at Strassburg
  he came under the influence of Professor Goering, who introduced
  him to the exact sciences.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 he left school and for a year did his military service.
  He then went to the University of Strassburg where he studied
  mathematics, physics and chemistry; but soon he moved to the
  University
  of G&ouml;ttingen, where he worked under Professor W. Voigt
  and Professor W. Abraham, who greatly influenced him. After a
  semester at the University of Munich he went, in 1902, to the
  University of
  Berlin to work under Professor <a href=
  "../1918/index.html">Max Planck</a>. Here he attended lectures by
  O. Lummer on interference spectroscopy and heat radiation, the
  influence of which was shown in von Laue's dissertation on
  interference phenomena in plane-parallel plates.<br>
  <br>
  After obtaining his doctorate at Berlin in 1903, von Laue went
  for two years to the University of G&ouml;ttingen. In 1905 he was
  offered the post of assistant to Max Planck at the Institute for
  Theoretical Physics at Berlin. Here he worked on the application
  of entropy to radiation fields and on the thermodynamic
  significance of the coherence of light waves.<br>
  <br>
  In 1909 he went as Privatdozent to the University of Munich,
  where he lectured on optics, thermodynamics and the theory of
  relativity and in 1912 he became Professor of Physics at the
  University of
  Zurich. In 1914 he moved, as Professor of Physics, to
  Frankfurt
  on Main and from 1916 he was engaged in war work at the
  University
  of W&uuml;rzburg on high vacuum tubes used for telephony and
  wireless communication. In 1919 he was appointed Professor of
  Physics at the University of Berlin, a post which he held until
  1943. From 1934 onwards he acted as consultant to the
  Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt at
  Berlin-Charlottenburg.<br>
  <br>
  In 1917, when the Institute for Physics was established at
  Berlin-Dahlem with <a href="../1921/index.html">Einstein</a> as
  its Director, von Laue had charge, as Second Director, of most of
  the administrative work of this Institute, which was in close
  touch with German scientific research. Von Laue exerted, during
  this period and also later, considerable influence on the
  development of scientific research in Germany. When Berlin was
  bombed, this Institute moved to Hechingen, in W&uuml;rttemberg
  and von Laue accompanied it there. He remained at Hechingen from
  1944 until 1945 and here, to distract his thoughts from the war,
  he wrote a History of Physics, which went into four editions and
  was translated into seven other languages. Here he welcomed the
  arrival of the French troops and was taken by an Anglo-American
  mission, together with nine other German scientists, to England
  where he remained until 1946 During his confinement in England he
  wrote a paper on the low absorption of X-rays during diffraction,
  which he contributed in 1948, to the International Union of
  Crystallographers at Harvard University. In 1946 he went to
  G&ouml;ttingen as Acting Director of the Max Planck Institute and
  Titular Professor in the University there.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951 he was elected Director of the Fritz Haber
  Institute for Physical Chemistry at Berlin-Dahlem and here he
  did much work on X-ray optics in collaboration with Borrmann and
  others.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 he retired and in 1959 his 80th birthday was celebrated
  in Berlin-Dahlem. He lived on, still actively at work, for
  another six months.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from his earlier work already mentioned, von Laue's
  scientific work extended over a wide field. Early in his career
  he was greatly excited by Einstein's theory of relativity and
  between 1907 and 1911 he published eight papers on the
  application of this theory. In 1911 he published a book on the
  restricted theory and in 1921 another on the general theory, both
  books going into several editions<br>
  <br>
  His best known work, however, for which he received the Nobel
  Prize for Physics for 1914, was his discovery of the diffraction
  of X-rays on crystals. This discovery originated, as he related
  in his Nobel Lecture, when he was discussing problems related to
  the passage of waves of light through a periodic, crystalline
  arrangement of particles. The idea then came to him that the much
  shorter electromagnetic rays, which X-rays were supposed to be,
  would cause in such a medium some kind of diffraction or
  interference phenomena and that a crystal would provide such a
  medium. Although his colleagues Sommerfeld, W. Wien and others,
  with whom he discussed the idea on a skiing expedition, raised
  objections to the idea, W. Friedrich, one of Sommerfeld's
  assistants and P. Knipping tested it out experimentally and,
  after some failures, succeeded in proving it to be correct. Von
  Laue worked out the mathematical formulation of it and the
  discovery was published in 1912. It established the fact that
  X-rays are electromagnetic in nature and it opened the way to the
  later work of <a href="../1915/index.html">Sir William and Sir
  Lawrence Bragg</a>. Subsequently von Laue made other
  contributions to this subject.<br>
  <br>
  Also prominent in von Laue's work were his contributions to the
  problems of superconductivity which he made when he was Professor
  of Theoretical Physics at Berlin University. At this time Walther
  Meissner was studying at the Physikalisch-Technische
  Reichsanstalt in Berlin, the remarkable disappearance of ohmic
  resistance shown by many metals at temperatures of the order of
  that of liquid helium. An especially valuable contribution then
  made by von Laue was his explanation, in 1932, of the fact that
  the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys
  superconductivity varies with the shape of the body because, when
  the magnetic field is established after the state of
  superconductivity has been established, the magnetic field is
  deformed by the supercurrents induced at the surface of the metal
  being used. This explanation was confirmed and it opened the way
  to Meissner's subsequent discovery that a superconductor
  eliminates the whole magnetic field in its interior and this
  became the basic idea of F. and H. London's theory of
  superconductivity. Von Laue published one paper in collaboration
  with F. and H. London and between 1937 and 1947 he published a
  total of 12 papers and a book on this subject.<br>
  <br>
  Among the many honours and distinctions which he was awarded were
  the Ladenburg Medal, the Max-Planck Medal and the
  Bimala-Churn-Law Gold Medal of the Indian Association at
  Calcutta. He held Honorary Doctorates of the Universities of
  Bonn, Stuttgart, Munich, Berlin, Manchester and Chicago, was a
  member of the Russian Academy and the Academy of Sciences of
  Berlin, the German Physical Society and Mathematical Society, the
  Kant Society, the Academy of Sciences of Vienna, the American
  Physical Society, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de
  Physique and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Mineralogie
  et Crystallographie. He was also Honorary Senator of the
  MaxPlanck Society and Honorary Member of the German R&ouml;ntgen
  Society, and Corresponding Member of the Academies of Sciences of
  G&ouml;ttingen, Munich, Turin, Stockholm, Rome (Papal), Madrid,
  the Academia dei Lincei of Rome, and the Royal Society of London.
  In 1948 he became Honorary President of the International Union
  of Crystallographers, in 1952 he was made a Knight of the Order
  Pour le M&eacute;rite, in 1953 he received the Grand Cross with
  Star for Federal Services, and in 1957 he became an Officer of
  the Legion of Honour of France.<br>
  <br>
  Much esteemed by his contemporaries for his character and sound
  judgment, von Laue's opinions were often sought and during his
  life he exerted great influence on the direction and development
  of German scientific work. Among his characteristics were a deep
  love and admiration of Prussia and a strong sense of justice and
  fair play. When Hitler and the National Socialist Party were in
  power, he defended, even at the risk of reprimand or personal
  injury, scientific views, such as the theory of relativity, which
  were not approved by the Party or by such strong adherents to it
  as the physicist Lenard. When Einstein resigned from the Berlin
  Academy and the Vice-President of this Academy stated that this
  was no loss, von Laue was the only member of the Academy who
  protested.<br>
  <br>
  Chief among his recreations were sailing, skiing, mountaineering
  and motoring. Von Laue was not a rock-climber, but preferred to
  tour the Alpine glaciers with his scientific friends. As a
  motorist he was famous in Berlin, first on the motor bicycle on
  which he went at high speed to his lectures; and later in a car.
  He loved high speeds, but never, until the fatal collision that
  ended his life, had any accident.<br>
  <br>
  In his later years he suffered from attacks of depression and a
  feeling of being persecuted by scientists and by the military
  authorities, whom he disliked intensely. Usually, however, he
  successfully overcame these attacks and regained his sense of
  humour and joy in life. He did not practise any art, but he took
  an interest in many arts, especially in classical music; and he
  read widely history and the philosophy of science. He thought of
  the stars, the mountain peaks and the achievements of the human
  with awe and humility and was at heart a deeply religious man. He
  asked that his tombstone should bear the statement that he died
  trusting firmly in the mercy of God.<br>
  <br>
  In 1910 von Laue married Magdalena Degen.<br>
  <br>
  On April 8, 1960, when he was driving alone to his laboratory, a
  motor cyclist, who had only received his licence two days
  previously, collided with von Laue's car. The motor cyclist was
  instantly killed and von Laue's car overturned in the Berlin
  speedway and he was taken from beneath it by the Fire Brigade.
  Although he showed at first some signs of recovery from his
  injuries, he died of them on April 24, at the age of 80.</p>
