  <h1>Rabindranath Tagore - Biographical</h1>
  

<p><img src="tagore.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Rabindranath Tagore</b> (1861-1941) was
  the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo
  Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century
  Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic
  basis of Hinduism as laid down in the <i>Upanishads</i>. He was
  educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to
  England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies
  there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided
  literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project
  which brought him into close touch with common humanity and
  increased his interest in social reforms. He also started an
  experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his
  Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he
  participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his
  own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political
  father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was
  knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a
  few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British
  policies in India.</p>
  
  <p>Tagore had early success as a writer in his native Bengal. With
  his translations of some of his poems he became rapidly known in
  the West. In fact his fame attained a luminous height, taking him
  across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship. For
  the world he became the voice of India's spiritual heritage; and
  for India, especially for Bengal, he became a great living
  institution.</p>
  
  <p>Although Tagore wrote successfully in all literary genres, he was
  first of all a poet. Among his fifty and odd volumes of poetry
  are <i>Manasi</i> (1890) [The Ideal One], <i>Sonar Tari</i>
  (1894) [The Golden Boat], <i>Gitanjali</i> (1910) [Song
  Offerings], <i>Gitimalya</i> (1914) [Wreath of Songs], and
  <i>Balaka</i> (1916) [The Flight of Cranes]. The English
  renderings of his poetry, which include <i>The Gardener</i>
  (1913), <i>Fruit-Gathering</i> (1916), and <i>The Fugitive</i>
  (1921), do not generally correspond to particular volumes in the
  original Bengali; and in spite of its title, <i>Gitanjali: Song
  Offerings</i> (1912), the most acclaimed of them, contains poems
  from other works besides its namesake. Tagore's major plays are
  <i>Raja</i> (1910) [<i>The King of the Dark Chamber</i>],
  <i>Dakghar</i> (1912) [<i>The Post Office</i>],
  <i>Achalayatan</i> (1912) [The Immovable], <i>Muktadhara</i>
  (1922) [The Waterfall], and <i>Raktakaravi</i> (1926) [<i>Red
  Oleanders</i>]. He is the author of several volumes of short
  stories and a number of novels, among them <i>Gora</i> (1910),
  <i>Ghare-Baire</i> (1916) [<i>The Home and the World</i>], and
  <i>Yogayog</i> (1929) [Crosscurrents]. Besides these, he wrote
  musical dramas, dance dramas, essays of all types, travel
  diaries, and two autobiographies, one in his middle years and the
  other shortly before his death in 1941. Tagore also left numerous
  drawings and paintings, and songs for which he wrote the music
  himself.</p>
