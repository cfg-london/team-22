  <h1>Vincent du Vigneaud - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="vigneaud.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Vincent du Vigneaud</b> was
  born in Chicago, Illinois, on 18th May, 1901, the son of the late
  inventor and machine designer Alfred J. du Vigneaud and his wife,
  Mary Theresa. He studied under Professor C.S. Marvel at The University of
  Illinois and took his B.Sc. degree in 1923 and M.Sc. in
  1924.<br>
  <br>
  During the year 1924-1925 he was assistant biochemist to Dr. W.G.
  Farr at the Philadelphia General Hospital and served on the Staff
  of the Graduate School of Medicine of Pennsylvania
  University. In 1927 he worked with Professor J.R. Murlin and
  submitted a thesis to the School of Medicine of Rochester
  University which earned him the Ph.D. As a Fellow of the
  National Research Council he worked with Professor J.J. Abel at
  Johns Hopkins University Medical School, with Professor George
  Barger at Edinburgh University Medical School and with Professor
  Charles R. Harington at London University College Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to America, du Vigneaud joined the Physiological
  Chemical Staff at The University of Illinois under Professor W.C.
  Rose and in 1932 he became Head of the Biochemistry Department at
  the George Washington University School of Medicine. The Cornell
  University Medical College offered him a Professorship as Head of
  the Biochemistry Department in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  Du Vigneaud has held many lectureships in universities in the
  United States and England, among the latter the Liversidge
  Lectureship at Cambridge, and in the summer of 1947 he was Visiting
  Lecturer of the American Swiss Foundation for Scientific Exchange
  in Switzerland. His Messenger Lectures at Cornell University in
  1950 were published in 1952 as <i>A Trail of Research in Sulphur
  Chemistry and Metabolism and Related Fields</i>. Many learned
  chemical societies in America have conferred awards on du
  Vigneaud and he received the Chandler Medal of Columbia
  University in 1955 and the Willard Gibbs Medal of the
  American Chemical Society a year later. Honorary science
  doctorates were bestowed on him by New York and Yale Universities in 1955, and by The
  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960.<br>
  <br>
  Honorary fellowships have been conferred on du Vigneaud by the
  Royal
  Society of Edinburgh, the Chemical Society and the Royal
  Institute of Chemistry, London. He has been elected to membership
  of many scientific academies among the most noteworthy being the
  Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Institute and the National
  Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases.<br>
  <br>
  His researches have centred mainly about sulphur-containing
  compounds of biochemical importance, being concerned originally
  with the sulphur of insulin and more recently with two hormones
  of the posterior pituitary gland-oxytocin and vasopressin. He has
  also studied intermediary metabolism, amino acids and peptides,
  transmethylation and metabolism of onecarbon compounds,
  transsulphuration, biotin and penicillin.<br>
  <br>
  Du Vigneaud married Zella Zon Ford in 1924; they have a son,
  Vincent, Jr. (b. 1933) and a daughter, Marilyn Ren&eacute;e (b.
  1935).</p>
