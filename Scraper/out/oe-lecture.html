  <h2>Japan, The Ambiguous, and Myself</h2>

  <p>During the last catastrophic World War I
  was a little boy and lived in a remote, wooded valley on Shikoku
  Island in the Japanese Archipelago, thousands of miles away from
  here. At that time there were two books by which I was really
  fascinated: <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>The
  Wonderful Adventures of Nils.</i> The whole world was then
  engulfed by waves of horror. By reading <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> I
  felt I was able to justify my act of going into the mountain
  forest at night and sleeping among the trees with a sense of
  security which I could never find indoors. The protagonist of
  <i>The Adventures of Nils</i> is transformed into a little
  creature, understands birds' language and makes an adventurous
  journey. I derived from the story sensuous pleasures of various
  kinds. Firstly, living as I was in a deep wood on the Island of
  Shikoku just as my ancestors had done long ago, I had a
  revelation that this world and this way of life there were truly
  liberating. Secondly, I felt sympathetic and identified myself
  with Nils, a naughty little boy, who while traversing Sweden,
  collaborating with and fighting for the wild geese, transforms
  himself into a boy, still innocent, yet full of confidence as
  well as modesty. On coming home at last, Nils speaks to his
  parents. I think that the pleasure I derived from the story at
  its highest level lies in the language, because I felt purified
  and uplifted by speaking along with Nils. His worlds run as
  follows (in French and English translation):<br>
  <br>
  "Maman, Papa! Je suis grand, je suis de nouveau un homme!"
  cria-t-il.<br>
  <br>
  "Mother and father!" he cried. "I'm a big boy. I'm a human being
  again!"<br>
  <br>
  I was fascinated by the phrase 'je suis de nouveau un homme!' in
  particular. As I grew up, I was continually to suffer hardships
  in different realms of life - in my family, in my relationship to
  Japanese society and in my way of living at large in the latter
  half of the twentieth century. I have survived by representing
  these sufferings of mine in the form of the novel. In that
  process I have found myself repeating, almost sighing, 'je suis
  de nouveau un homme!' Speaking like this as regards myself is
  perhaps inappropriate to this place and to this occasion.
  However, please allow me to say that the fundamental style of my
  writing has been to start from my personal matters and then to
  link it up with society, the state and the world. I hope you will
  forgive me for talking about my personal matters a little
  further.<br>
  <br>
  Half a century ago, while living in the depth of that forest, I
  read The <i>Adventures of Nils</i> and felt within it two
  prophecies. One was that I might one day become able to
  understand the language of birds. The other was that I might one
  day fly off with my beloved wild geese - preferably to
  Scandinavia.<br>
  <br>
  After I got married, the first child born to us was
  mentally handicapped. We named him <i>Hikari,</i> meaning 'Light'
  in Japanese. As a baby he responded only to the chirps of wild
  birds and never to human voices. One summer when he was six years
  old we were staying at our country cottage. He heard a pair of
  water rails <i>(Rallus aquaticus)</i> warbling from the lake
  beyond a grove, and he said with the voice of a commentator on a
  recording of wild birds: "They are water rails". This was the
  first moment my son ever uttered human words. It was from then on
  that my wife and I began having verbal communication with our
  son.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Hikari</i> now works at a vocational training centre for the
  handicapped, an institution based on ideas we learnt from Sweden.
  In the meantime he has been composing works of music. Birds were
  the originators that occasioned and mediated his composition of
  human music. On my behalf <i>Hikari</i> has thus accomplished the
  prophecy that I might one day understand the language of birds. I
  must say also that my life would have been impossible but for my
  wife with her abundant female force and wisdom. She has been the
  very incarnation of Akka, the leader of Nils's wild geese.
  Together with her I have flown to Stockholm and the second of the
  prophecies has also, to my utmost delight, now been
  realised.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="../1968/index.html">Kawabata Yasunari</a>, the first
  Japanese writer who stood on this platform as a winner of the
  Nobel Prize for Literature, delivered a lecture entitled
  <i>Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself.</i> It was at once very
  beautiful and <i>vague.</i> I have used the English word
  <i>vague</i> as an equivalent of that word in Japanese
  <i>aimaina.</i> This Japanese adjective could have several
  alternatives for its English translation. The kind of vagueness
  that Kawabata adopted deliberately is implied in the title itself
  of his lecture. It can be transliterated as 'myself <i>of</i>
  beautiful Japan'. The vagueness of the whole title derives from
  the Japanese particle 'no' (literally 'of') linking 'Myself' and
  'Beautiful Japan'.<br>
  <br>
  The vagueness of the title leaves room for various
  interpretations of its implications. It can imply 'myself as a
  part of beautiful Japan', the particle 'no' indicating the
  relationship of the noun following it to the noun preceding it as
  one of possession, belonging or attachment. It can also imply
  'beautiful Japan and myself', the particle in this case linking
  the two nouns in apposition, as indeed they are in the English
  title of Kawabata's lecture translated by one of the most eminent
  American specialists of Japanese literature. He translates
  'Japan, the beautiful <i>and</i> myself'. In this expert translation the
  <i>traduttore</i> (translator) is not in the least a
  <i>traditore</i> (betrayer).<br>
  <br>
  Under that title Kawabata talked about a unique kind of mysticism
  which is found not only in Japanese thought but also more widely
  Oriental thought. By 'unique' I mean here a tendency towards Zen
  Buddhism. Even as a twentieth-century writer Kawabata depicts his
  state of mind in terms of the poems written by medieval Zen
  monks. Most of these poems are concerned with the linguistic
  impossibility of telling truth. According to such poems words are
  confined within their closed shells. The readers can not expect
  that words will ever come out of these poems and get through
  to us. One can never understand or feel sympathetic towards these
  Zen poems except by giving oneself up and willingly penetrating
  into the closed shells of those words.<br>
  <br>
  Why did Kawabata boldly decide to read those extremely esoteric
  poems in Japanese before the audience in Stockholm? I look back
  almost with nostalgia upon the straightforward bravery which he
  attained towards the end of his distinguished career and with
  which he made such a confession of his faith. Kawabata had been
  an artistic pilgrim for decades during which he produced a host
  of masterpieces. After those years of his pilgrimage, only by
  making a confession as to how he was fascinated by such
  inaccessible Japanese poems that baffle any attempt fully to
  understand them, was he able to talk about 'Japan, the Beautiful,
  and Myself', that is, about the world in which he lived and the
  literature which he created.<br>
  <br>
  It is noteworthy, furthermore, that Kawabata concluded his
  lecture as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My works have been described as works of emptiness, but it is
    not to be taken for the nihilism of the West. The spiritual
    foundation would seem to be quite different. Dogen entitled his
    poem about the seasons 'Innate Reality', and even as he
    sang of the beauty of the seasons he was deeply immersed in
    Zen.<br>
    <i>(Translation by Edward Seidensticker)</i></p>
  </blockquote>

 <p>Here also I detect a brave and
  straightforward self-assertion. On the one hand Kawabata
  identifies himself as belonging essentially to the tradition of
  Zen philosophy and aesthetic sensibilities pervading the
  classical literature of the Orient. Yet on the other he goes out
  of his way to differentiate emptiness as an attribute of his
  works from the nihilism of the West. By doing so he was
  whole-heartedly addressing the coming generations of mankind with
  whom Alfred Nobel entrusted his hope and faith.<br>
  <br>
  To tell you the truth, rather than with Kawabata my compatriot
  who stood here twenty-six years ago, I feel more spiritual
  affinity with the Irish poet <a href="../1923/index.html">William
  Butler Yeats,</a> who was awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature
  seventy one years ago when he was at about the same age as me. Of
  course I would not presume to rank myself with the poetic genius
  Yeats. I am merely a humble follower living in a country far
  removed from his. As William Blake, whose work Yeats revalued and
  restored to the high place it holds in this century, once wrote:
  'Across Europe &amp; Asia to China &amp; Japan like
  lightnings'.<br>
  <br>
  During the last few years I have been engaged in writing a
  trilogy which I wish to be the culmination of my literary
  activities. So far the first two parts have been published and I
  have recently finished writing the third and final part. It is
  entitled in Japanese <i>A Flaming Green Tree.</i> I am indebted
  for this title to a stanza from Yeats's poem
  <i>Vacillation:</i></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A tree there is that from its topmost bough<br>
    Is half all glittering flame and half all green<br>
    Abounding foliage moistened with the dew ...<br>
    ('Vacillation', 11-13)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In fact my trilogy is so soaked in the
  overflowing influence of Yeats's poems as a whole. On the
  occasion of Yeat's winning the Nobel Prize the Irish Senate
  proposed a motion to congratulate him, which contained the
  following sentences:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>... the recognition which the nation has gained, as a prominent
    contributor to the world's culture, through his success."<br>
    ... a race that hitherto had not been accepted into the comity
    of nations.<br>
    ... Our civilization will be assesed on the name of Senator
    Yeats.<br>
    ... there will always be the danger that there may be a
    stampeding of people who are sufficiently removed from insanity
    in enthusiasm for destruction.<br>
    (The Nobel Prize: Congratulations to Senator Yeats)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yeats is the writer in whose wake I would
  like to follow. I would like to do so for the sake of another
  nation that has now been 'accepted into the comity of nations'
  but rather on account of the technology in electrical engineering
  and its manufacture of automobiles. Also I would like to do so as
  a citizen of such a nation which was stamped into 'insanity in
  enthusiasm of destruction' both on its own soil and on that of
  the neighbouring nations.<br>
  <br>
  As someone living in the present would such as this one and
  sharing bitter memories of the past imprinted on my mind, I
  cannot utter in unison with Kawabata the phrase 'Japan, the
  Beautiful and Myself'. A moment ago I touched upon the
  'vagueness' of the title and content of Kawabata's lecture. In
  the rest of my lecture I would like to use the word 'ambiguous'
  in accordance with the distinction made by the eminent British
  poet Kathleen Raine; she once said of William Blake that he was
  not so much vague as ambiguous. I cannot talk about myself
  otherwise than by saying 'Japan, the Ambiguous, and
  Myself'.<br>
  <br>
  My observation is that after one hundred and twenty years of
  modernisation since the opening of the country, present-day Japan
  is split between two opposite poles of ambiguity. I too am living
  as a writer with this polarisation imprinted on me like a deep
  scar.<br>
  <br>
  This ambiguity which is so powerful and penetrating that it
  splits both the state and its people is evident in various ways.
  The modernisation of Japan has been orientated toward learning
  from and imitating the West. Yet Japan is situated in Asia and
  has firmly maintained its traditional culture. The ambiguous
  orientation of Japan drove the country into the position of an
  invader in Asia. On the other hand, the culture of modern Japan,
  which implied being thoroughly open to the West or at least that
  impeded understanding by the West. What was more, Japan was
  driven into isolation from other Asian countries, not only
  politically but also socially and culturally.<br>
  <br>
  In the history of modern Japan literature the writers most
  sincere and aware of their mission were those 'post-war writers'
  who came onto the literary scene immediately after the last War,
  deeply wounded by the catastrophe yet full of hope for a rebirth.
  They tried with great pains to make up for the inhuman atrocities
  committed by Japanese military forces in Asian countries, as well
  as to bridge the profound gaps that existed not only between the
  developed countries of the West and Japan but also between
  African and Latin American countries and Japan. Only by doing so
  did they think that they could seek with some humility
  reconciliation with the rest of the world. It has always been my
  aspiration to cling to the very end of the line of that literary
  tradition inherited from those writers.<br>
  <br>
  The contemporary state of Japan and its people in their post -
  modern phase cannot but be ambivalent. Right in the middle of the
  history of Japan's modernisation came the Second World War, a war
  which was brought about by the very aberration of the
  modernisation itself. The defeat in this War fifty years ago
  occasioned an opportunity for Japan and the Japanese as the very
  agent of the War to attempt a rebirth out of the great misery and
  sufferings that were depicted by the 'Post-war School' of
  Japanese writers. The moral props for Japanese aspiring to such a
  rebirth were the idea of democracy and their determination never
  to wage a war again. Paradoxically, the people and state of Japan
  living on such moral props were not innocent but had been stained
  by their own past history of invading other Asian countries.
  Those moral props mattered also to the deceased victims of the
  nuclear weapons that were used for the first time in Hiroshima
  and Nagasaki, and for the survivors and their off-spring affected
  by radioactivity (including tens of thousands of those whose
  mother tongue is Korean).<br>
  <br>
  In the recent years there have been criticisms levelled against
  Japan suggesting that she should offer more military forces to
  the <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> forces and
  thereby play a more active role in the keeping and restoration of
  peace in various parts of the world. Our heart sinks whenever we
  hear these criticisms. After the end of the Second World War it
  was a categorical imperative for us to declare that we renounced
  war forever in a central article of the new Constitution. The
  Japanese chose the principle of eternal peace as the basis of
  morality for our rebirth after the War.<br>
  <br>
  I trust that the principle can best be understood in the West
  with its long tradition of tolerance for conscientious rejection
  of military service. In Japan itself there have all along been
  attempts by some to obliterate the article about renunciation of
  war from the Constitution and for this purpose they have taken
  every opportunity to make use of pressures from abroad. But to
  obliterate from the Constitution the principle of eternal peace
  will be nothing but an act of betrayal against the peoples of
  Asia and the victims of the Atom Bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
  It is not difficult for me as a writer to imagine what would be
  the outcome of that betrayal.<br>
  <br>
  The pre-war Japanese Constitution that posited an absolute power
  transcending the principle of democracy had sustained some
  support from the populace. Even though we now have the
  half-century-old new Constitution, there is a popular sentiment
  of support for the old one that lives on in reality in some
  quarters. If Japan were to institutionalise a principle other
  than the one to which we have adhered for the last fifty years,
  the determination we made in the post-war ruins of our collapsed
  effort at modernisation - that determination of ours to establish
  the concept of universal humanity would come to nothing. This is
  the spectre that rises before me, speaking as an ordinary
  individual.<br>
  <br>
  What I call Japan's 'ambiguity' in my lecture is a kind of
  chronic disease that has been prevalent throughout the modern
  age. Japan's economic prosperity is not free from it either,
  accompanied as it is by all kinds of potential dangers in the
  light of the structure of world economy and environmental
  conservation. The 'ambiguity' in this respect seems to be
  accelerating. It may be more obvious to the critical eyes of the
  world at large than to us within the country. At the nadir of the
  post-war economic poverty we found a resilience to endure it,
  never losing our hope for recovery. It may sound curious to say
  so, but we seem to have no less resilience to endure our anxiety
  about the ominous consequence emerging out of the present
  prosperity. From another point of view, a new situation now seems
  to be arising in which Japan's prosperity is going to be
  incorporated into the expanding potential power of both
  production and consumption in Asia at large.<br>
  <br>
  I am one of the writers who wish to create serious works of
  literature which dissociate themselves from those novels which
  are mere reflections of the vast consumer cultures of Tokyo and
  the subcultures of the world at large. What kind of identity as a
  Japanese should I seek? W.H. Auden once defined the novelist as
  follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>..., among the dust<br>
    Be just, among the Filthy filthy too,<br>
    And in his own weak person, if he can,<br>
    Must suffer dully all the wrongs of Man.<br>
    ('The Novelist', 11-14)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is what has become my 'habit of life'
  (in Flannery O'Connor's words) through being a writer as my
  profession.<br>
  <br>
  To define a desirable Japanese identity I would like to pick out
  the word 'decent' which is among the adjectives that George
  Orwell often used, along with words like 'humane', 'sane' and
  'comely', for the character types that he favoured. This
  deceptively simple epithet may starkly set off and contrast with
  the word 'ambiguous' used for my identification in 'Japan, the
  Ambiguous, and Myself'. There is a wide and ironical discrepancy
  between what the Japanese seem like when viewed from outside and
  what they wish to look like.<br>
  <br>
  I hope Orwell would not raise an objection if I used the word
  'decent' as a synonym of 'humanist' or 'humaniste' in French,
  because both words share in common qualities such as tolerance
  and humanity. Among our ancestors were some pioneers who made
  painstaking efforts to build up the Japanese identity as 'decent'
  or 'humanist'.<br>
  <br>
  One such person was the late Professor Kazuo Watanabe, a scholar
  of French Renaissance literature and thought. Surrounded by the
  insane ardour of patriotism on the eve and in the middle of the
  Second World War, Watanabe had a lonely dream of grafting the
  humanist view of man on to the traditional Japanese sense of
  beauty and sensitivity to Nature, which fortunately had not been
  entirely eradicated. I must hasten to add that Professor Watanabe
  had a conception of beauty and Nature different from that
  conceived of by Kawabata in his 'Japan, the Beautiful, and
  Myself. '<br>
  <br>
  The way Japan had tried to build up a modern state modelled on
  the West was cataclysmic. In ways different from, yet partly
  corresponding to, that process Japanese intellectuals had tried
  to bridge the gap between the West and their own country at its
  deepest level. It must have been a laborious task or
  <i>travail</i> but it was also one that brimmed with joy.
  Professor Watanabe's study of Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais was thus one
  of the most distinguished and rewarding scholarly achievements of
  the Japanese intellectual world.<br>
  <br>
  Watanabe studied in Paris before the Second World War. When he
  told his academic supervisor about his ambition to translate
  Rabelais into Japanese, the eminent elderly French scholar
  answered the aspiring young Japanese student with the phrase:
  "L'entreprise inouie de la traduction de l'intraduisible
  Rabelais" (the unprecedented enterprise of translating into
  Japanese untranslatable Rabelais). Another French scholar
  answered with blunt astonishment: "Belle entreprise
  Pantagru&eacute;lique" (an admirably Pantagruel-like enterprise).
  In spite of all this not only did Watanabe accomplish his great
  enterprise in a poverty-stricken environment during the War and
  the American Occupation, but he also did his best to transplant
  into the confused and disorientated Japan of that time the life
  and thought of those French humanists who were the forerunners,
  contemporaries and followers of Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais.<br>
  <br>
  In both my life and writing I have been a pupil of Professor
  Watanabe's. I was influenced by him in two crucial ways. One was
  in my method of writing novels. I learnt concretely from his
  translation of Rabelais what Mikhail Bakhtin formulated as 'the
  image system of grotesque realism or the culture of popular
  laughter'; the importance of material and physical principles;
  the correspondence between the cosmic, social and physical
  elements; the overlapping of death and passions for rebirth; and
  the laughter that subverts hierarchical relationships.<br>
  <br>
  The image system made it possible to seek literary methods of
  attaining the universal for someone like me born and brought up
  in a peripheral, marginal, off-centre region of the peripheral,
  marginal, off-centre country, Japan. Starting from such a
  background I do not represent Asia as a new economic power but an
  Asia impregnated with ever-lasting poverty and a mixed-up
  fertility. By sharing old, familiar yet living metaphors I align
  myself with writers like Kim Ji-ha of Korea, Chon I and Mu Jen,
  both of China. For me the brotherhood of world literature
  consists in such relationships in concrete terms. I once took
  part in a hunger strike for the political freedom of a gifted
  Korean poet. I am now deeply worried about the destiny of those
  gifted Chinese novelists who have been deprived of their freedom
  since the Tienanmen Square incident.<br>
  <br>
  Another way in which Professor Watanabe has influenced me is in
  his idea of humanism. I take it to be the quintessence of Europe
  as a living totality. It is an idea which is also perceptible in
  Milan Kundera's definition of the spirit of the novel. Based on
  his accurate reading of historical sources Watanabe wrote
  critical biographies, with Rabelais at their centre, of people
  from Erasmus to S&eacute;bastien Castellion, and of women connected
  with Henri IV from Queen Marguerite to Gabrielle Destr&eacute;. By
  doing so Watanabe intended to teach the Japanese about humanism,
  about the importance of tolerance, about man's vulnerability to
  his preconceptions or machines of his own making. His sincerity
  led him to quote the remark by the Danish philologist Kristoffer
  Nyrop: "Those who do not protest against war are accomplices of
  war." In his attempt to transplant into Japan humanism as the
  very basis of Western thought Watanabe was bravely venturing on
  both "l'entreprise inou&iuml;e" and the "belle entreprise
  Pantagru&eacute;lique".<br>
  <br>
  As someone influenced by Watanabe's humanism I wish my task as a
  novelist to enable both those who express themselves with words
  and their readers to recover from their own sufferings and the
  sufferings of their time, and to cure their souls of the wounds.
  I have said I am split between the opposite poles of ambiguity
  characteristic of the Japanese. I have been making efforts to be
  cured of and restored from those pains and wounds by means of
  literature. I have made my efforts also to pray for the cure and
  recovery off my fellow Japanese.<br>
  <br>
  If you will allow me to mention him again, my mentally
  handicapped son Hikari was awakened by the voices of birds to the
  music of Bach and Mozart, eventually composing his own works. The
  little pieces that he first composed were full of fresh splendour
  and delight. They seemed like dew glittering on grass leaves. The
  word <i>innocence</i> is composed of <i>in</i> - 'not' and <i>nocere</i>
  - 'hurt', that is, 'not to hurt'. Hikari's music was in this
  sense a natural effusion of the composer's own innocence.<br>
  <br>
  As Hikari went on to compose more works, I could not but hear in
  his music also 'the voice of a crying and dark soul'. Mentally
  handicapped as he was, his strenuous effort furnished his act of
  composing or his 'habit of life' with the growth of compositional
  techniques and a deepening of his conception. That in turn
  enabled him to discover in the depth of his heart a mass of dark
  sorrow which he had hitherto been unable to identify with
  words.<br>
  <br>
  'The voice of a crying and dark soul' is beautiful, and his act
  of expressing it in music cures him of his dark sorrow in an act
  of recovery. Furthermore, his music has been accepted as one that
  cures and restores his contemporary listeners as well. Herein I
  find the grounds for believing in the exquisite healing power of
  art.<br>
  <br>
  This belief of mine has not been fully proved. 'Weak person'
  though I am, with the aid of this unverifiable belief, I would
  like to 'suffer dully all the wrongs' accumulated throughout the
  twentieth century as a result of the monstrous development of
  technology and transport. As one with a peripheral, marginal and
  off-centre existence in the world I would like to seek how - with
  what I hope is a modest decent and humanist contribution - I can
  be of some use in a cure and reconciliation of mankind.</p>
