  <h1>Harold E. Varmus - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="varmus.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in the shadow of World War II,
  on December 18, 1939, on the south shore of Long Island, a
  product of the early twentieth century emigration of Eastern
  European Jewry to New York City and its environs. My father's
  father, Jacob Varmus, left a village of uncertain name near
  Warsaw just after the turn of the century to become a farmer in
  Newburgh, New York, and later a hatter in Newark, New Jersey. His
  wife, Eleanor, was a victim of the influenza epidemic of 1918,
  when my father was eleven. My mother's parents, Harry and Regina
  Barasch, came from farming villages around Linz, Austria, to
  found a children's clothing store, still in existence, in
  Freeport, New York. As children of immigrants, my parents both
  had notable educations, my father (Frank) at Harvard College
  (until financial considerations required him to withdraw after
  two years) and at Tufts Medical School, and my mother (Beatrice)
  at Wellesley College and the New York School of Social
  Work.<br>
  <br>
  Three years before my birth, my parents settled in Freeport, my
  mother's home town, where my father established a general medical
  practice, while my mother commuted to a social services job in
  New York City. With the entry of the United States into the War,
  however, my father was assigned to an Air Force Hospital near
  Winter Park, Florida, and my first memories were to be of long
  beaches, and bass fishing on a lake with alligators. We remained
  in Florida, spared the pain of war, until early in 1946. In the
  interim, my only sibling, Ellen Jane, was born; she is now a
  genetic counselor and mother of three in Berkeley,
  California.<br>
  <br>
  My growing-up in Freeport was undemanding and in many ways
  privileged. The public schools I attended were dominated by
  athletics and rarely inspiring intellectually, but I enjoyed a
  small circle of interesting friends, despite my ineptitude at
  team sports and my preference for reading. Life was enriched by
  frequent outings to Jones Beach State Park (where my father was
  the medical officer for many years), family skiing vacations to
  New England, and many outdoor adventures with the Boy Scouts and
  later the Putney Summer Work Camp.<br>
  <br>
  The most decisive turn in my intellectual history came in the
  fall of 1957, when I entered Amherst College intending to prepare for
  medical school. The evident intensity and pleasure of academic
  life there challenged my presumptions about my future as a
  physician, and my course of study drifted from science to
  philosophy and finally to English literature. At the same time, I
  became active in politics and journalism, ultimately serving as
  the editor of the college newspaper. Following graduation from
  Amherst, a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship enabled me to test the depth
  of my interest in literary scholarship by beginning graduate
  studies at Harvard University. Within the year, I again felt
  the lure of medicine and entered Columbia College of Physicians
  and Surgeons. Although I began medical school with strong
  interests in psychiatry and international health, I was
  influenced towards basic medical sciences by the lectures of
  (among others) Elvin Kabat, Harry Rose, Herbert Rosenkrantz,
  Erwin Chargaff and Paul Marks. My desires to practice medicine
  abroad were also tempered by an apprenticeship in a mission
  hospital in Bareilly, India.<br>
  <br>
  In preparation for a career in academic medicine, I worked as a
  medical house officer at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital from 1966
  to 1968, and then joined Ira Pastan's laboratory at the National Institutes of
  Health as a Clinical Associate. This provided me with my
  first serious exposure to laboratory science and to the
  excitement of experimental success. Our studies of bacterial gene
  regulation by cyclic AMP (in collaboration with Bob Perlman and
  Benoit de Crombrugge) and the evening courses offered to
  incipient physician-scientists at NIH stimulated me to seek
  further postdoctoral training in molecular biology, specifically
  in tumor virology. This decision, combined with an interest in
  trying life in the San Francisco area, led me to <a href=
  "index.html">Mike Bishop's</a> door in 1969. I joined him as a
  post-doctoral fellow at UC San Francisco in 1970, was appointed
  Lecturer shortly thereafter, and in 1972 became a regular member
  of the faculty in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology
  (led initially by Ernest Jawetz, later by Leon Levintow),
  ascending to the rank of Professor by 1979.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout the nearly two decades I have been associated with
  UCSF, most of
  my research interests have been focused upon the behavior of
  retroviruses: various aspects of their unusual life cycle, the
  nature and origin of their transforming genes, and their
  potential to cause genetic change. Much of this work has been
  performed in collaboration with Mike Bishop, particularly in the
  years before 1984 when we shared facilities, personnel, and
  funds. Other faculty interactions during the 1970's stimulated
  work on hemoglobinopathies (with Y.W. Kan) and on glucocorticoid
  action (with Gordon Tomkins and Keith Yamamoto). During the
  1980's, I also worked extensively on hepatitis B viruses in
  collaboration with Don Ganem (who was initially a post-doctoral
  fellow and later a faculty colleague). My career at UCSF has been
  greatly enhanced by the extraordinary collegiality of the
  faculty, the excellence of our graduate and medical students, an
  unremitting stream of first-rate post-doctoral fellows, and the
  loyalty of our staff research associates, especially Suzanne
  Ortiz, Nancy Quintrell, and Jean Jackson.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969 I married Constance Louise Casey, then a reporter for
  <i>Congressional Quarterly</i> in Washington, D.C., her home
  town, and now the Book Critic for the <i>San Jose Mercury
  News</i>. Shortly after we moved to California, my parents died,
  my mother of breast cancer in 1971, my father of coronary artery
  disease in 1972. Our lives have been made more interesting by the
  births of Jacob Carey in 1973 and Christopher Isaac in 1978; the
  boys attend public schools in San Francisco, root for the Giants,
  and are musically-inclined (Jacob, especially, is a talented
  trumpeter). California weather has promoted my love of outdoor
  sports, particularly bicycling, running, backpacking, skiing, and
  fishing, but I also maintain strong interests in the arts -
  literature, theatre, music, and film. We have lived almost
  continuously since 1971 in a Victorian house in the
  Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, with the exception of
  1978-79, when I was a sabbatic visitor in Mike Fried's laboratory
  at the Imperial
  Cancer Research Fund in London, and 1988-89, when the award
  of a Nieman Fellowship to Connie brought her to Harvard and me to
  the laboratories of Bob Weinberg and <a href=
  "../1975/index.html">David Baltimore</a> at the Whitehead
  Institute.<br>
  <br>
  Most of the significant honors I have received have been awarded
  jointly to Mike Bishop, with whom I also share the Nobel Prize.
  The earlier awards include California Scientist of the Year
  (1982), the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1982),
  the Passano Foundation Award (1983), the Armand Hammer Cancer
  Prize (1984), the Alfred P. Sloan Prize from the General Motors
  Cancer Foundation (1984), the Gairdner Foundation International
  Award (1984), and the American College of Physicians Award
  (1987). In addition, I was elected to the National Academy of
  Science (1984) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
  (1988). I received an honorary degree from Amherst College (1985)
  and the Alumni Gold Medal from the College of Physicians and
  Surgeons (1989), and I have been the American Cancer Society
  Professor of Molecular Virology since 1984.</p>
