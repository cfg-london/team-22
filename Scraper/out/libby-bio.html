  University, till 1945.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the war, in 1945, Libby accepted the post of
  Professor of Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry and
  Institute for Nuclear Studies (now the Enrico Fermi Institute for
  Nuclear Studies) of University of Chicago, remaining there till his
  appointment by President Eisenhower on 1st October, 1954, as a
  member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.<br>
  <br>
  This appointment was renewed by the President for a further

  30th June, 1959, to become Professor of Chemistry in the University of California at
  Los Angeles, being appointed Director of the Institute of
  Geophysics and Planetary Physics on 1st January, 1962.<br>
  <br>
  Libby has performed a wide range of scientific advisory and
  technical consultant work with industrial firms associated with
  the Institute for Nuclear Studies, as well as with defence
  departments, scientific organizations and universities. From 1945
  to 1952 he was a Member of the Committee of Senior Reviewers of

  tracer work. He became well-known at University of Chicago for his
  work on natural carbon-14 (radiocarbon) and its use in dating
  archaeological artifacts, and natural tritium, and its use in
  hydrology and geophysics.<br>
  <br>
  Besides the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1960, he received other
  distinctions, including the Research Corporation Award for 1951
  for the radiocarbon dating technique; the Chandler Medal of
  Columbia University for outstanding achievement in the field of
