  <h1>Allvar Gullstrand - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gullstrand.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Allvar Gullstrand</b>, eldest son of Dr. Pehr Alfred
  Gullstrand, Principal Municipal Medical Officer, and his wife
  Sofia Mathilda <i>n&eacute;e</i> Korsell, was born on June 5, 1862,
  at Landskrona. He was educated at schools in Landskrona and
  J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping, where he passed his matriculation in 1880;
  he then went to Uppsala University, which he left in 1885, and spent
  a year at Vienna, afterwards continuing his medical studies at
  Stockholm where he graduated in medicine in 1888, presented his
  doctorate thesis in 1890, and was appointed Lecturer in
  Ophthalmology in 1891. After holding various appointments as
  Doctor and Lecturer and serving on the Swedish Medical Board, he
  was appointed the first Professor of Ophthalmology at Uppsala
  University in 1894.<br>
  <br>
  He occupied this post until 1913. As from 1914 onwards he held a
  Personal Professorship in Physical and Physiological Optics at
  Uppsala University. He was appointed Emeritus Professor in
  1927.<br>
  <br>
  He was entirely self-taught in the fields covering his most
  important work (geometric and physiological optics). The basis of
  the science he developed was laid in 1890 in his thesis <i>Bidrag
  till astigmatismens teori</i> (Contribution to the theory of
  astigmatism). The complete proof of this theory is found in the
  following three works: <i>Allgemeine Theorie der
  monochromatischen Aberrationen und ihre n&auml;chsten Ergebnisse
  f&uuml;r die Ophthalmologie</i> (General theory of monochromatic
  aberrations and their immediate significance for ophthalmology),
  1900, which received awards from the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1911/gullstrand-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/" target="_blank">Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences</a> and the
  Swedish Medical Association; <i>Die reelle optische Abbildung</i>
  (The true optical image), 1906; and <i>Die optische Abbildung in
  heterogenen Medien und die Dioptrik der Kristallinse des
  Menschen</i> (The optical image in heterogeneous media and the
  dioptrics of the human crystalline lens), 1908, which was awarded
  the Centenary Gold Medal of the Swedish Medical Association. The
  results are combined in the works <i>Tatsachen und Fiktionen in
  der Lehre von der optischen Abbildung</i> (Facts and fictions in
  the theory of the optical image), 1907; <i>Handbuch der
  physiologischen Optik</i> (Handbook of physiological optics), by
  H. von Helmholtz, 3rd edition, Vol. I, 1909, and
  <i>Einf&uuml;hrung in die Methoden der Dioptrik der Augen des
  Menschen</i> (Introduction to the methods of the dioptrics of the
  human eyes), 1911.<br>
  <br>
  Of his other works, the following received awards: <i>Objektive
  Differential-diagnostik und photographische Abbildung von
  Augenmuskell&auml;hmungen</i> (The objective differential
  diagnosis and photographic illustration of disabilities of the
  eye muscles), 1892; <i>Photographisch-ophthalmometrische und
  klinische Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Hornhautrefraktion</i>
  (Photographic-ophthalmometric and clinical investigations of
  corneal refractions), 1896; <i>Die Farbe der Macula centralis
  retinae</i> (The pigments of the central macula of the retina),
  1905; the first two received awards from the Swedish Medical
  Association and the latter received the Bj&ouml;rk&eacute;n Prize
  of the Uppsala Faculty of Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  As the holder of the Research Professorship in Physical and
  Physiological Optics, Gullstrand devoted himself mainly to
  calculations and methods for achieving a more suitable form of
  refracting surfaces in optical instruments, and to investigation
  of optical system laws of higher order. A result of the former is
  a record which is kept in the Uppsala University library and
  which relates to calculations for optical systems, <i>inter
  alia</i> optical systems with appropriate non-spherical surfaces,
  and the publication <i>&Uuml;ber asph&auml;rische Fl&auml;chen in
  optischen Instrumenten</i> (On aspheric surfaces in optical
  instruments), 1919. As a result of the latter we may mention the
  publications <i>Das allgemeine optische Abbildungssystem</i> (The
  general optical image system), 1915 and <i>Optische Systemgesetze
  zweiter und dritter Ordnung</i> (Laws of the optical system of
  the second and third order), 1924. He gave the last summary of
  his optical experiments in <i>Einiges &uuml;ber optische
  Bilder</i> (Some aspects of optical images), 1926.<br>
  <br>
  His methods of focal illumination, particularly by means of the
  slit lamp (1911), have acquired the greatest importance to the
  practical ophthalmologist. His reflex-free ophthalmoscope (1911)
  is also a valuable instrument to the ophthalmological
  diagnostician.<br>
  <br>
  His great administrative ability found expression particularly in
  the Faculty of Medicine and the Council of Uppsala University and
  the Swedish Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Gullstrand was an honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the
  Universities of Uppsala, Jena and Dublin, and a member of a
  number of Swedish and foreign scientific societies. In 1911 he
  received the Nobel Prize for his work on the dioptrics of the
  eye. He was member of the Nobel Physics Committee of the Swedish
  Academy of Sciences (1911-1929), and its Chairman (1922-1929). In
  1927 he was awarded the Graefe Medal of the Deutsche
  Ophthalmologische Gesellschaft.<br>
  <br>
  In 1885 he married Signe Christina Breitholtz. They had one
  daughter, who died at an early age. Gullstrand died in Stockholm
  on July 28, 1930.</p>
