  <h1>Wendell M. Stanley - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stanley.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Wendell Meredith Stanley</b> was born
  in Ridgeville, Indiana, on August 16th, 1904. He began his
  advanced education at Earlham College and graduated Bachelor of Science in
  1926 when he entered the University of Illinois, gaining a Master
  of Science degree in 1927 and a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1929. He
  continued at Illinois as a research associate and later as an
  instructor before leaving, in the latter half of 1930, to do
  research at Munich as a National Research Council Fellow. In
  Munich he worked with <a href="../1927/index.html">Heinrich
  Wieland</a> until late 1931 when he returned to the United States
  to take up a post as Assistant at the Rockefeller Institute. He
  remained with the Institute until 1948, becoming an Associate
  Member in 1937, and a Member in 1940. In 1948, he was appointed
  Professor of Biochemistry and Director of the Virus Laboratory,
  University of California; during 1948-1953 he was Chairman of the
  Department of Biochemistry, and in 1958 he became Professor of
  Virology and Chairman of the Department.<br>
  <br>
  Stanley has been responsible for much important work on
  lepracidal compounds, diphenyl stereochemistry and the chemistry
  of the sterols. His researches on the virus which causes the
  mosaic disease in tobacco plants led to the isolation of a
  nucleoprotein which displayed tobacco mosaic virus activity. The
  virus appeared to act like an inanimate chemical but it presented
  evidence of being a living and growing organism. His more recent
  work on the preparation and investigation of influenza and
  similar viruses has led to his development of the centrifuge-type
  influenza vaccine. He is a recognized world authority on viruses
  and, as such, he has written over 150 papers on the topic and
  contributed chapters to several books.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Stanley was awarded the American Association for the
  Advancement of Science Prize in 1937, and his many other honours
  and awards include the Rosenburger Medal (University of
  Chicago), Alder Prize (Harvard), and Scott Award (City of
  Philadelphia), 1938; Gold Medal of the American Institute of New
  York, 1941; Copernican Citation, 1943; Nichols Medal (American
  Chemical Society), 1946; Gibbs Medal (American Chemical Society),
  1947; Franklin Medal and Presidential Certificate of Merit, 1948;
  the Modern Medicine Award, 1958; and the American Cancer
  Society's Medal for Distinguished Service in Cancer Control,
  1963. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by
  many universities and colleges, including Earlham, Harvard,
  Yale (1938),
  Princeton
  (1947) and Illinois (1959); honorary Doctor of Law degrees of the
  Universities of California (1946) and Indiana (1951), the Jewish Theological

  learned societies, and as consultant and advisor to the United
  States government and the World Health Organization. He continues
