  <h1>Walter H. Brattain - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="brattain.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Walter H. Brattain</b> was
  born in Amoy, China, on February 10, 1902, the son of Ross R.
  Brattain and Ottilie Houser. He spent his childhood and youth in
  the State of Washington and received a B.S. degree from Whitman College in
  1924. He was awarded the M.A. degree by the University of Oregon
  in 1926 and the Ph.D. degree by the University of Minnesota in
  1929.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Brattain has been a member of the Bell Laboratories technical
  staff since 1929. The chief field of his research has been the
  surface properties of solids. His early work was concerned with
  thermionic emission and adsorbed layers on tungsten. He continued
  on into the field of rectification and photo-effects at
  semiconductor surfaces, beginning with a study of rectification
  at the surface of cuprous oxide. This work was followed by
  similar studies of silicon. Since World War II he has continued
  in the same line of research with both silicon and
  germanium.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Brattain's chief contributions to solid state physics have
  been the discovery of the photo-effect at the free surface of a
  semiconductor; the invention of the point-contact transistor
  jointly with Dr. John Bardeen, and work leading to a better
  understanding of the surface properties of semiconductors,
  undertaken first with Dr. Bardeen, later with Dr. C.G.B. Garrett,
  and currently with Dr. P.J. Boddy.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Brattain received the honorary Doctor of Science degree from
  Portland University in 1952, from Whitman College and Union
  College in 1955, and from the University of Minnesota in 1957. In
  1952 he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin
  Institute, and in 1955 the John Scott Medal. The degree at Union
  College and the two medals were received jointly with Dr. John
  Bardeen, in recognition of their work on the transistor.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Brattain is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the
  Franklin Institute; a Fellow of the American Physical Society,
  the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association
  for the Advancement of Science. He is also a member of the
  commission on semiconductors of the International Union of Pure
  and Applied Physics, and of the Naval Research Advisory
  Committee.<br>
  <br>
  In 1935 he married the late Dr. Keren (Gilmore) Brattain; they
  had one son, William Gilmore Brattain. In 1958 he married Mrs.
  Emma Jane (Kirsch) Miller. Dr. Brattain lives in Summit, New
  Jersey, near the Murray Hill (N.J.) laboratory of Bell Telephone
  Laboratories.</p>
