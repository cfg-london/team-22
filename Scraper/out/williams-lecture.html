  <h1>Jody Williams - Nobel Lecture</h1>
            <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, Oslo, December 10, 1997</p>
            <p class="smalltext">&nbsp;</p>
       

            <p>Your Majesties, Honorable Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,
              Excellencies and Honored Guests,</p>
            <p>It is a privilege to be here today, together
              with other representatives of the International Campaign to Ban
              Landmines, to receive jointly the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. Our appreciation
              goes to those who nominated us and to the Nobel Committee for chosing
              this year to recognize, from among so many other nominees who have
              worked diligently for peace, the work of the International
              Campaign.</p>
            <p>I am deeply honored - but whatever personal
              recognition derives from this award, I believe that this high tribute
              is the result of the truly historic achievement of this humanitarian
              effort to rid the world of one indiscriminate weapon. In the words
              of the Nobel Committee, the International Campaign &quot;started
              a process which in the space of a few years changed a ban on antipersonnel
              mines from a vision to a feasible reality.&quot;</p>
            <p>Further, the Committee noted that the Campaign
              has been able to &quot;express and mediate a broad range of popular
              commitment in an unprecedented way. With the governments of several
              small and medium-sized countries taking the issue up ... this
              work has grown into a convincing example of an effective
              policy for peace.&quot;</p>
            <p>The desire to ban landmines is not new. In
              the late 1970s, the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1917/index.html">International
              Committee of the Red Cross</a>, along
              with a handful of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), pressed
              the world to look at weapons that were particularly injurious
              and/or indiscriminate. One of the weapons of special concern was
              landmines. People often ask why the focus on this one weapon. How
              is the landmine different from any other conventional weapon?</p>
            <p>Landmines distinguish themselves because once
              they have been sown, once the soldier walks away from the weapon,
              the landmine cannot tell the difference between a soldier or a
              civilian - a woman, a child, a grandmother going out to collect
              firewood to make the family meal. The crux of the prob&shy;lem
              is that while the use of the weapon might be militarily justifiable
              during the day of the battle, or even the two weeks of the battle,
              or maybe even the two months of the battle, once peace is declared
              the landmine does not recognize that peace. The landmine is eternally
              prepared to take victims. In common parlance, it is the perfect
              soldier, the &quot;eternal
              sentry.&quot; The war ends, the landmine goes on killing.</p>
            <p>Since World War II most of the conflicts in
              the world have been internal conflicts. The weapon of choice in
              those wars has all too often been landmines - to such a degree
              that what we find today are tens of millions of landmines contaminating
              approximately 70 countries around the world. The overwhelming majority
              of those countries are found in the developing world, primarily
              in those countries that do not have the resources to clean up the
              mess, to care for the tens of thousands of landmine victims. The
              end result is an international community now faced with a global
              humanitarian crisis.</p>
            <p>Let me take a moment to give a few examples
              of the degree of the epidemic. Today Cambodia has somewhere between
              four and six million landmines, which can be found in over 50 percent
              of its national territory. Afghanistan is littered with perhaps
              nine million landmines. The U.S. military has said that during
              the height of the Russian invasion and ensuing war in that country,
              up to 30 million mines were scattered throughout Afghanistan. In
              the few years of the fighting in the former Yugoslavia, some six
              million landmines were sown throughout various sections of the
              country - Angola nine million, Mozambique a million, Somalia a
              million - I could go on, but it gets tedious. Not only do we have
              to worry about the mines already in the ground, we must be concerned
              about those that are stockpiled and ready for use. Estimates range
              between one and two hundred million mines in stockpiles around
              the world.</p>
            <p>When the ICRC pressed in the 1970s for the
              governments of the world to consider increased restrictions or
              elimination of particularly injurious or indiscriminate weapons,
              there was little support for a ban of landmines. The end result
              of several years of negotiations was the 1980 Convention on Conventional
              Weapons (CCW). What that treaty did was attempt to regulate the
              use of landmines. While the Convention tried to tell commanders
              in the field when it was okay to use the weapon and when it was
              not okay to use the weapon, it also allowed them to make decisions
              about the applicability of the law in the midst of battle. Unfortunately,
              in the heat of battle, the laws of war do not exactly come to mind.
              When you are trying to save your skin you use anything and everything
              at your disposal to do so.</p>
            <p>Throughout these years the Cold War raged on,
              and internal conflicts that often were proxy wars of the Super
              Powers proliferated. Finally, with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc,
              people began to look at war and peace differently. Without the
              overarching threat of nuclear holocaust, people started to look
              at how wars had actually been fought during the Cold War. What
              they found was that in the internal conflicts fought during that
              time, the most insidious weapon of all was the antipersonnel landmine
              - and that it contaminated the globe in epidemic proportion.</p>
            <p>As relative peace broke out with the end of
              the Cold War, the U.N. was able to go into these nations that had
              been torn by internal strife, and what they found when they got
              there were millions and millions of landmines which affected every
              aspect of peacekeeping, which affected every aspect of post-conflict
              reconstruction of those societies. You know, if you are in Phnom
              Penh in Cambodia, and you are setting up the peacekeeping operations,
              it might seem relatively easy. But when you want to send your troops
              out into the hinterlands where four or six million landmines are,
              it becomes a problem, because the main routes are mined. Part of
              the peace agreement was to bring the hundreds
              of thousands of refugees back into the country so that they could
              parti&shy;cipate in the voting, in the new democracy being forged
              in Cambodia. Part of the plan to bring them back included giving
              each family enough land so that they could be self-sufficient,
              so they wouldn't be a drain on the country, so that they could
              contribute to reconstruction. What they found: So many landmines
              they couldn't give land to the families. What did they get? Fifty
              dollars and a year's supply of rice. That is the impact of landmines.</p>
            <p>It was the NGOs, the nongovernmental organizations,
              who began to seriously think about trying to deal with the root
              of the problem - to eliminate the problem, it would be necessary
              to eliminate the weapon. The work of NGOs across the board was
              affected by the landmines in the developing world. Children's groups,
              development organizations, refugee organizations, medical and humanitarian
              relief groups - all had to make huge adjustments in their programs
              to try to deal with the landmine crisis and its impact on the people
              they were trying to help. It was also in this period that the first
              NGO humanitarian demining organizations were born - to try to return
              contaminated land to rural communities.</p>
            <p>It was a handful of NGOs, with their roots
              in humanitarian and human rights work, which began to come together,
              in late 1991 and early 1992, in an organized effort to ban antipersonnel
              landmines. In October of 1992, Handicap International, Human Rights
              Watch, Medico International, Mines Advisory Group, Physicians for
              Human Rights and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation came together
              to issue a 'Joint Call to Ban Antipersonnel Landmines.&quot; These
              organizations, which became the steering committee of the
              International Campaign to Ban Landmines called for an end to the
              use, production, trade and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines.
              The call also pressed governments to increase resources for humanitarian
              mine clearance and for victim assistance.</p>
            <p>From this inauspicious beginning, the International
              Campaign has become an unprecedented coalition of 1,000 organizations
              working together in 60 countries to achieve the common goal of
              a ban of antipersonnel landmines. And as the Campaign grew, the
              steering committee was expanded to represent the continuing growth
              and diversity of those who had come together in this global movement.
              We added the Afghan and Cambodian Campaigns and R&auml;dda Barnen in
              1996, and the South African Campaign and Kenya Coalition early
              this year as we continued to press toward our goal. And in six
              years we did it. In September of this year, 89 countries came together
              - here in Oslo - and finished the negotiations of a ban treaty based
              on a draft drawn up by Austria only at the beginning of this year.
              Just last week in Ottawa, Canada, 121 countries came together again
              to sign that ban treaty. And as a clear indication of the
              political will to bring this treaty into force as soon as possible,
           three countries ratified the treaty upon signature - Canada, Mauritius
              and Ireland.</p>
            <p>In its first years, the International Campaign
              developed primarily in the North - in the countries which had been
              significant producers of antipersonnel landmines. The strategy
              was to press for national, regional and international measures
              to ban landmines. Part of this strategy was to get the governments
              of the world to review the CCW and in the review process - try
              to get them to ban the weapon through that convention. We did not
              succeed. But over the two and one-half years of the review process,
              with the pressure that we were able to generate - the heightened
              international attention to the issue - began to raise the stakes,
              so that different governments wanted to be seen as leaders on what
              the world was increasingly recognizing as a global humanitarian
              crisis.</p>
            <p>The early lead had been taken in the United
              States, with the first legislated moratorium on exports in 1992.
              And while the author of that legislation, Senator Leahy, has continued
              to fight tirelessly to ban the weapon in the U.S., increasingly
              other nations far surpassed that early leadership. In March of
              1995, Belgium became the first country to ban the vise, production,
              trade and stockpiling domestically. Other countries followed suit:
              Austria, Norway, Sweden, and others. So even as the CCW review
              was ending in failure, increasingly governments were calling for
              a ban. What had once been called a Utopian goal of NGOs was gaining
              in strength and momentum.</p>
            <p>While we still had that momentum, in the waning
              months of the CCW review, we decided to try to get the individual
              governments which had taken action or had called for a ban to
              come together in a self-identifying bloc. There is, after all,
              strength in numbers. So during the final days of the CCW we invited
              them to a meeting and they actually came. A handful of governments
              agreed to sit down with us and talk about where the movement to
              ban landmines
              would go next. Historically, NGOs and governments have too often
              seen each other as adversaries, not colleagues, and we were shocked
              that they came. Seven or nine came to the first meeting, 14 to
              the second, and 17 to the third. By the time we had concluded the
              third meeting, with the conclusion of the Review Conference
              on May 3rd of 1996, the Canadian govern&shy;ment had offered to
              host a governmental meeting in October of last year, in which pro-ban
              governments would come together and strategize about how to bring
              about a ban. The CCW review process had not produced the results
              we sought, so what do we do next?</p>
            <p>From the third to the fifth of October we met
              in Ottawa. It was a very fascinating meeting. There were 50 governments
              there as full participants and 24 observers. The International
              Campaign was also participating in the conference. The primary
              objectives of the conference were to develop an Ottawa Declaration,
              which states would sign signalling their intention to ban landmines,
              and an &quot;Agenda for Action,&quot; which outlined concrete steps
              on the road to a ban. We were all prepared for that, but few were
              prepared for the concluding comments by Lloyd Axworthy, the Foreign
              Minister of Canada. Foreign Minister Axworthy stood up and congratulated
              everybody for formulating the Ottawa Declaration and the Agenda
              for Action, which were clearly seen as giving teeth to the ban
              movement. But the Foreign Minister did not end with congratulations.
              He ended with a challenge. The Canadian government challenged the
              world to return to Canada in a year to sign an international treaty
              banning antipersonnel landmines.</p>
            <p>Members of the International Campaign to Ban
              Landmines erupted into cheers. The silence of the governments in
              the room was defeaning. Even the truly pro-ban states were horrified
              by the challenge. Canada had stepped outside of diplomatic process
              and procedure and put them between a rock and a hard place. They
              had said they were pro-ban. They had come to Ottawa to develop
              a road map to create a ban treaty and had signed a Declaration
              of intent.
              What could they do? They had to respond. It was really breath-taking.
              We stood up and cheered while the governments were moaning. But
              once they recovered from that initial shock, the governments that
              really wanted to see a ban treaty as soon as possible, rose to
              the challenge and negotiated a ban treaty in record time.</p>
            <p>What has become known as the Ottawa Process
              began with the Axworthy Challenge. The treaty itself was based
              upon a ban treaty drafted by Austria and developed in a series
              of meetings in Vienna, in Bonn, in Brussels, which culminated in
              the three-week long treaty negotiating conference held in Oslo
              in September. The treaty negotiations were historic. They were
              historic for a number of reasons. For the first time, smaller and
              middle-sized powers had come together, to work in close cooperation
              with the nongovernmental organizations of the International Campaign
              to Ban Landmines, to negotiate a treaty which would remove from
              the world's arsenals a weapon in widespread use. For the first
              time, smaller and middle-sized powers had not yielded ground to
              intense pressure from a superpower to weaken the treaty to accommodate
              the policies of that one country. Perhaps for the first time, negotiations
              ended with a treaty stronger than the draft on which the negotiations
              were based! The treaty had not been held hostage to rule by consensus,
              which would have inevitably resulted in a gutted treaty.</p>
            <p>The Oslo negotiations gave the world a treaty
              banning antipersonnel landmines which is remarkably free of loopholes
              and exceptions. It is a treaty which bans the use, production,
              trade and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines. It is a treaty
              which requires states to destroy their stockpiles within four years
              of its entering into force. It is a treaty which requires mine
              clearance within ten years. It calls upon states to increase assistance
              for mine clearance and for victim assistance. It is not a perfect
              treaty - the Campaign has concerns about the provision allowing
              for antihandling devices on antivehicle mines; we are concerned
              about mines kept for training purposes; we would like to see the
              treaty directly apply to nonstate actors and we would like stronger
              language regarding victim assistance. But, given the close cooperation
              with governments which resulted in the treaty itself, we are certain
              that these is&shy;sues can be addressed through the annual meetings
              and review conferences provided for in the treaty.</p>
            <p>As I have already noted, last week in Ottawa,
              121 countries signed the treaty. Three ratified it simultaneously
              - signalling the political will of the international community
              to bring this treaty into force as soon as possible. It is remarkable.
              Landmines have been used since the U.S. Civil War, since the Crimean
              War, yet we are taking them out of arsenals of the world. It is
              amazing. It is historic. It proves that civil society and governments
              do not have to see themselves as adversaries. It demonstrates that
              small and middle powers can work together with civil society and
              address humanitarian concerns with breathtaking speed. It shows
              that such a partnership is a new kind of &quot;superpower&quot; in
              the post-Cold War world.</p>
            <p>It is fair to say that the International Campaign
              to Ban Landmines made a difference. And the real prize is the treaty.
              What we are most proud of is the treaty. It would be foolish to
              say that we are not deeply honored by being awarded the Nobel Peace
              Prize. Of course, we are. But the receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize
              is recognition of the accomplishment of this Campaign. It is recognition
              of the fact that NGOs have worked in close cooperation with governments
              for the first time on an arms control issue, with the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United
              Nations</a>,
              with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Together, we
              have set a precedent. Together, we have changed history. The closing
              remarks of the French ambassador in Oslo to me were the best. She
              said, &quot;This is historic not just because of the treaty.
              This is historic because, for the first time, the leaders of states
              have come together to answer the will of civil society.&quot;</p>
            <p>For that, the International Campaign thanks
              them - for together we have given the world the possibility of
              one day living on a truly mine-free planet.</p>
            <p><i> Thank you.</i></p>
