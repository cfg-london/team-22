  <h1>Antony Hewish - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hewish.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Fowey, Cornwall, on 11 May
  1924, the youngest of three sons and my father was a banker. I
  grew up in Newquay, on the Atlantic coast and there developed a
  love of the sea and boats. I was educated at King's College,
  Taunton and went to the University of Cambridge in 1942. From 1943-46 I was
  engaged in war service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment,
  Farnborough and also at the Telecommunications Research
  Establishment, Malvern. I was involved with airborne
  radar-counter-measure devices and during this period I also
  worked with Martin Ryle.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to Cambridge in 1946 I graduated in 1948 and
  immediately joined Ryle's research team at the Cavendish
  Laboratory. I obtained my Ph.D. in 1952, became a Research Fellow
  at Gonville and Caius College where I had been an undergraduate,
  and in 1961 transferred to Churchill College as Director of Studies in
  Physics. I was University Lecturer during 1961-69, Reader during
  1969-71 and Professor of Radio Astronomy from 1971 until my
  retirement in 1989. Following Ryle's illness in 1977 I assumed
  leadership of the Cambridge radio astronomy group and was head of
  the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory from 1982-88.<br>
  <br>
  My decision to begin research in radio astronomy was influenced
  both by my wartime experience with electronics and antennas and
  by one of my teachers, Jack Ratcliffe, who had given an excellent
  course on electromagnetic theory during my final undergraduate
  year and whom I had also encountered at Malvern. He was head of
  radiophysics at the Cavendish Laboratory at that time.<br>
  <br>
  My first research was concerned with propagation of radiation
  through inhomogeneous transparent media and this has remained a
  lifelong interest. The first two radio "stars" had just been
  discovered and I realised that their scintillation, or
  "twinkling", could be used to probe conditions in the ionosphere.
  I developed the theory of diffraction by phase-modulating screens
  and set up radio interferometers to exploit my ideas. Thus I was
  able to make pioneering measurements of the height and physical
  scale of plasma clouds in the ionosphere and also to estimate
  wind speeds in this region. Following our Cambridge discovery of
  interplanetary scintillation in 1964 I developed similar methods
  to make the first ground-based measurements of the solar wind and
  these were later adopted in the USA, Japan and India for long
  term observations. I also showed how interplanetary scintillation
  could be used to obtain very high angular resolution in radio
  astronomy, equivalent to an interferometer with a baseline of
  1000 km - something which had not then been achieved in this
  field. It was to exploit this technique on a large sample of
  radio galaxies that I conceived the idea of a giant phased-array
  antenna for a major sky survey. This required instrumental
  capabilities quite different from those of any existing radio
  telescope, namely very high sensitivity at long wavelengths, and
  a multi-beam capability for repeated whole-sky surveys on a day
  to day basis.<br>
  <br>
  I obtained funds to construct the antenna in 1965 and it was
  completed in 1967. The sky survey to detect all scintillating
  sources down to the sensitivity threshold began in July. By a
  stroke of good fortune the observational requirements were
  precisely those needed to detect pulsars. Jocelyn Bell joined the
  project as a graduate student in 1965, helping as a member of the
  construction team and then analysing the paper charts of the sky
  survey. She was quick to spot the week to week variability of one
  scintillating source which I thought might be a radio flare star,
  but our more detailed observations subsequently revealed the
  pulsed nature of the signal.<br>
  <br>
  Surprisingly, the phased array is still a useful research
  instrument. It has been doubled in area and considerably improved
  over the years and one of my present interests is the way our
  daily observations of scintillation over the whole sky can be
  used to map large-scale disturbances in the solar wind. At
  present this is the only means of seeing the shape of
  interplanetary weather patterns so our observations make an
  useful addition to <i>in-situ</i> measurements from spacecraft
  such as Ulysses, now (1992) on its way to Jupiter.<br>
  <br>
  Looking back over my forty years in radio astronomy I feel
  extremely privileged to have been in at the beginning as a member
  of Martin Ryle's group at the Cavendish. We were a closely-knit
  team and besides my own research programmes I was also involved
  in the design and construction of Ryle's first antennas employing
  the novel principle of aperture synthesis.<br>
  <br>
  Teaching physics at the University, and more general lecturing to
  wider audiences has been a major concern. I developed an
  association with the Royal Institution in London when it was
  directed by Sir Lawrence Bragg, giving one of the well known
  Christmas Lectures and subsequently several Friday Evening
  Discourses. I believe scientists have a duty to share the
  excitement and pleasure of their work with the general public,
  and I enjoy the challenge of presenting difficult ideas in an
  understandable way.<br>
  <br>
  I have been happily married since 1950. My son is a physicist and
  obtained his Ph.D. for neutron scattering in liquids, while my
  daughter is a language teacher.</p>
