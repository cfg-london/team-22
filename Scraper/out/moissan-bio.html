  <h1>Henri Moissan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="moissan.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Henri Moissan</b> was born in Paris on September 28,
  1852. His advanced education began in the Coll&egrave;ge de Meaux
  and later in Edmond Fr&eacute;my's laboratory at the Mus&eacute;e
  d'Histoire Naturelle, where he attended lectures by E.H.
  Sainte-Claire Deville and Henri Debray. A year later, he removed
  to Deh&eacute;rain's laboratory in the &Eacute;cole Pratique des
  Haute &Eacute;tudes and subsequently he directed a small laboratory
  of his own before joining Debray and Troost in the laboratories
  of the Sorbonne. He was appointed to a junior position in the
  Agronomic Institute in 1879 and he gained his doctoral degree in
  1880 with a thesis on the cyanogen series. He became assistant
  lecturer and senior demonstrator at the School of Pharmacy and in
  1886 he was elected Professor of Toxicology. In 1899 he took the
  Chair of Inorganic Chemistry and in 1900 he was appointed
  Assessor to the Director of that School. In the same year, he
  succeeded Troost as Professor of Inorganic Chemistry, University
  of Paris.<br>
  <br>
  Moissan's first researches concerned the interchange of oxygen
  and carbon dioxide in the leaves of plants. He was soon to leave
  biology for the field of inorganic chemistry, where his early
  work was on the oxides of iron-group metals and chromium and a
  study of the chromous salts. In 1884 he turned his attention to
  fluorine chemistry, preparing some organic and phosphorus
  derivatives of that element. The following year he discovered
  that solutions of potassium fluoride in hydrogen fluoride at
  certain strengths remained liquid and conducted electrolytically
  at sub-zero temperatures: a year later he successfully
  electrolysed these solutions to isolate fluorine for the first
  time. He made a full study of the properties of the gas and its
  reactions with other elements.<br>
  <br>
  In 1892, Moissan theorized that diamonds could be synthesized by
  crystallizing carbon under pressure from molten iron. He designed
  and developed the electric-arc furnace, attaining temperatures up
  to 3,500&deg;C, to assist him in work which led to the
  production of tiny artificial stones. He subsequently used the
  furnace to volatilize many substances which had been regarded as
  infusible and to prepare many new compounds, particularly
  carbides, silicides and borides; in 1891 he discovered
  carborundum. His close study of the carbides and their reaction
  with water led to his theory that, in some cases, petroleum may
  be formed by subterraneous reaction between certain carbides and
  water. He prepared the hydrides of calcium, sodium and potassium
  and showed them to be non-conductive and, using the electric
  furnace, isolated many metals.<br>
  <br>
  Moissan is credited with over three hundred publications, his
  greatest works being <i>Le Four &Eacute;lectrique</i> (The
  electric-arc furnace) (1897), <i>Le Fluor et ses
  Compos&eacute;s</i> (Fluorine and its compounds) (1900) and
  <i>Trait&eacute; de Chimie Minerale</i> (Treatise on inorganic
  chemistry) (five volumes 1904-1906). He was an excellent lecturer
  and a meticulous and patient experimentalist.<br>
  <br>
  Moissan, a Commandeur de la L&eacute;gion d'Honneur, was elected
  member of the Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine (1888),
  Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (1891), Conseil d'Hygi&egrave;ne de la
  Seine (1895 ), and the Comit&eacute; Consultatif des Arts et
  Manufactures (1898). In 1887 he was awarded the Prix Lacaze; he
  was Davy medallist in 1896 and Hofmann medallist in 1903. He was
  honoured by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia and awarded
  Fellowships of the Royal Society of London and The Chemical Society
  (London). He held honorary memberships of many other learned
  societies.<br>
  <br>
  He died suddenly in Paris on February 20, 1907, shortly after his
  return from the prize-giving ceremony in Stockholm.</p>
