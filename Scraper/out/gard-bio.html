  <h1>Roger Martin du Gard - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gard.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Roger Martin du Gard</b> (1881-1958) was
  born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, attended two of the finest Paris
  lycees and, in 1906, was graduated from the &Eacute;cole des
  Chartes with a thesis on an archaeological subject and with the
  degree of archivist-paleographer. To this training in history and
  scholarship he attributes his scrupulous realism and attention to
  minute detail.<br>
  <br>
  Martin du Gard's first success was the novel <i>Jean Barois</i>,
  published by his former school friend Gaston Gallimard in 1913.
  It anticipates some of the thematic material of <i>Les
  Thibault</i>. Largely in dialogue form, <i>Jean Barois</i> is the
  story of a life deeply divided by two world views, that of the
  Catholic Church and that of a freethinking, unflinching,
  humanistic philosophy of facing and mastering reality. In 1920 he
  published the peasant farce <i>Le Testament du P&egrave;re
  Leleu</i>. He became attached to the circle of the <i>Nouvelle
  Revue Fran&ccedil;aise</i> and was close to <a href=
  "../1947/index.html">Gide</a>, Copeau, and J. Schlumberger.<br>
  <br>
  After the years of the First World War, which Martin du Gard spent
  almost entirely in the front lines, he devoted most of his time
  to the writing of the &laquo;roman-fleuve&raquo;, <i>Les
  Thibault</i>, which culminates in the three volumes of
  <i>L'&Eacute;t&eacute; 1914</i> [<i>Summer 1914</i>]. The twelve
  individual volumes of the series of novels appeared between 1922
  and 1940.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Les Thibault</i> is a monumental picture of the world before
  the outbreak of the First World War. Its rambling plot traces the
  history of Jacques Thibault, the rebel son of an upper
  middle-class family, against the background of the more staid
  destinies of his relatives. The work gives a detailed account of
  the hero's despair at the outbreak of fighting and the failure of
  his insane attempt to stop it. Various minor works, written for
  distraction or relaxation, include the drama <i>Un Taciturne</i>
  (1932) [The Silent One], the short novel <i>confdence
  africaine</i> (1931) [African Secret], and a collection of
  village sketches, <i>Vieille France</i> (1933) [The Postman]. His
  <i>Notes sur Andr&eacute; Gide 1913-1951</i> [<i>Recollections of
  Andr&eacute; Gide</i>] appeared in 1951. The complete works of
  Martin du Gard were published in two volumes in 1955.</p>
