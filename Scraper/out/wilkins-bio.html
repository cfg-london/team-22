  <h1>Maurice Wilkins - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wilkins.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins</b> was
  born at Pongaroa, New Zealand, on December 15th, 1916. His
  parents came from Ireland; his father Edgar Henry Wilkins was a
  doctor in the School Medical Service and was very interested in
  research but had little opportunity for it.<br>
  <br>
              At the age of 6, Wilkins was brought to England and educated at 
              King Edward's School, Birmingham. He studied physics at St. John's College, Cambridge, 
              taking his degree in 1938. He then went to Birmingham 
              University, where he became research assistant to Dr. J. T. 
              Randall in the Physics Department. They studied the luminescence 
              of solids. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1940, his thesis being mainly 
              on a study of thermal stability of trapped electrons in phosphors, 
              and on the theory of phosphorescence, in terms of electron traps 
              with continuous distribution of trap depths. He then applied these 
              ideas to various war-time problems such as improvement of cathoderay 
              tube screens for radar. Next he worked under Professor M. L. E. 
              Oliphant on mass spectrograph separation of uranium isotopes for 
              use in bombs and, shortly after, moved with others from Birmingham 
              to the Manhattan Project in Berkeley, California, where these studies 
              continued.<br>
  <br>
  In 1945, when the war was over, he was lecturer in physics at
  St.
  Andrews' University, Scotland, where Professor J. T. Randall
  was organizing biophysical studies. He had spent seven years in
  physics research and now began in biophysics. The biophysics
  project moved in 1946 to King's College, London, where he was a member of the
  staff of the newly formed Medical Research Council Biophysics
  Research Unit. He was first concerned with genetic effects of
  ultrasonics; after one or two years, he changed his research to
  development of reflecting microscopes for ultraviolet
  microspectrophotometric study of nucleic acids in cells. He also
  studied the orientation of purines and pyrimidines in tobacco
  mosaic virus and in nucleic acids, by measuring the ultraviolet
  dichroism of oriented specimens, and he studied, with the
  visible-light polarizing microscope, the arrangement of virus
  particles in crystals of TMV and measured dry mass in cells with
  interference microscopes. He then began X-ray diffraction studies
  of DNA and sperm heads. The discovery of the well-defined
  patterns led to the deriving of the molecular structure of DNA.
  Further X-ray studies established the correctness of the <a href=

  for DNA structure. Relevant publications are &laquo;The molecular
  configuration of deoxyribonucleic acid. I. X-ray diffraction
  study of a crystalline form of the lithium salt&raquo;, by R.
  Langridge, H. R. Wilson, C. W. Hooper, M. H. F. Wilkins, and L.
  D. Hamilton in <i>J. Mol. Biol.</i>, 2 (1960) 19, and
  &laquo;Determination of the helical configuration of ribonucleic
  acid molecules by X-ray diffraction study of crystalline
  amino-acid-transfer ribonucleic acid&raquo;, by M. Spencer, W.
  Fuller, M. H. F. Wilkins, and G. L. Brown in <i>Nature</i>, 194
  (1962) 1014.<br>
  <br>
  Wilkins became Assistant Director of the Medical Research
  Council Unit in 1950 and Deputy Director in 1955. A
  sub-department of Biophysics was formed in King's College, and he
  was made Honorary Lecturer in it. In 1961 a full Department of
  Biophysics was established.<br>
  <br>
  He was elected F.R.S. in 1959, given the Albert Lasker Award
  (jointly with Watson and Crick) by the American Public Health
  Association in 1960, and made Companion of the British Empire in
  1962.<br>
  <br>
  He married Patricia Ann Chidgey in 1959; they have a daughter
  Sarah and a son George. He finds his recreations in his
  collection of sculptures and in gardening.</p>
