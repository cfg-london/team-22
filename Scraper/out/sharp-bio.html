  <h1>Phillip A. Sharp - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sharp.jpg" class="bio-img">A sense of place was and remains an
  important part of my life. I was born in a rural community in the
  northern hill country of Kentucky. My earliest memories are those
  of a child playing around the house on our family farm, located
  in a bend of the Licking River near McKinneysburg. My mother,
  Kathrin Colvin Sharp, had grown up in that same house and her
  family had been part of this community for many generations. My
  father, Joseph Walter Sharp, grew up nearby within walking
  distance of the nearest town and county-seat, Falmouth. Both
  parents came from large families and I was surrounded by
  grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings and cousins.<br>
  <br>
  My formal education was entirely in the public schools of
  Pendleton County: McKinneysburg Elementary, Butler Elementary and
  High School and Pendleton County High School. Even though my
  studies never interfered with sports or fun, I managed to gain an
  appreciation of math and science.<br>
  <br>
  All through my childhood, my parents strongly encouraged me to
  attend college. With that in mind, they taught me to save my
  money for college tuition, and, even more important, they allowed
  me to earn it by raising cattle for the market and growing
  tobacco. The rural background of my childhood made me feel more
  comfortable attending a small institution in a familiar
  environment. Therefore, I entered a small liberal arts school,
  Union College, in the foothills of eastern Kentucky. Union is in
  Barbourville, the county-seat of Knox County, and in those days
  it was one of the gateways for the youth from the mountains in
  the eastern part of the state to emerge into a larger world.
  While at Union, I majored in chemistry and mathematics and
  decided that I wanted to continue to study and learn about
  science, particularly chemistry. I also met and married a lovely
  girl from New Jersey, Ann Holcombe (Sharp).<br>
  <br>
  A young professor at Union, Dr. Dan Foote, became a good friend
  and encouraged me to apply to the Department of Chemistry at the
  University of Illinois. This old and distinguished department
  must have recognized some hidden promise as I was offered a
  fellowship and soon began graduate studies under Victor
  Bloomfield in physical chemistry. Victor was an excellent mentor
  as he encouraged both my scientific as well as cultural growth.
  He provided funds for my participation in national scientific
  meetings and broadened my perspective on society and culture by
  being a long-haired liberal, well-read and artistic friend.
  Fortunately, I was deferred from the Vietnam draft for a number
  of years and was able to finish graduate school. My thesis dealt
  primarily with the description of DNA as a polymer using
  statistical and physical theories. My attempts at experimental
  science at this stage were juvenile. In spite of my youth on the
  farm, I was never very skilled in manual tasks; in fact, I soon
  lost interest in any complex "hands on" manipulations.<br>
  <br>
  The 1966 volume of the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on <i>The
  Genetic Code</i> stimulated my interest in molecular biology and
  genetics. A subsequent letter to Norman Davidson at the California Institute of
  Technology resulted in an offer of a postdoctoral position in
  1969 and my immersion into a vibrant research program in
  molecular biology. Ron Davis, a graduate student in Norman's lab
  at the time, had previously developed the heteroduplex method for
  visualizing deletions in phage genomes with the electron
  microscope. Jerome Vinograd in an adjacent laboratory had
  discovered the superhelical structure of animal virus genomes. In
  this environment, I began the transition to experimental
  molecular biology by using the heteroduplex method and electron
  microscopy to study the structure of plasmids of the sex factors
  and drug resistant factors of bacteria. I was particularly
  interested in how sex factor plasmids acquired genomic sequences
  from the bacterial chromosome. We found that both sex and drug
  resistance factors contained transposable elements. This
  experience taught me many things, including the power of novel
  methodology and how a simple experiment can transform the
  understanding of an important problem.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of my stay at Caltech, I opted to extend my
  postdoctoral period and begin to study the structure and pathway
  of expression of genes in human cells. The expression of genes of
  animal viruses with DNA genomes was the only experimentally
  approachable system at that time, and this led me to a further
  postdoctoral year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory under the mentorship
  of <a href="../1962/index.html">Jim Watson</a>. Here, I entered a
  close-knit scientific commune of extremely talented people who
  lived and worked together in an isolated environment for nine
  months, and then were immersed in a continuous scientific meeting
  for the remaining three summer months.<br>
  <br>
  At the Lab Joe Sambrook, a staff member, I, and others used
  hybridization techniques to map sequences in the simian virus 40
  genome that were expressed as stable RNAs in both infected cells
  and oncogenic cells transformed by this virus. These were
  important results for understanding the biology of this
  papovavirus and helped move the laboratory into a very rapidly
  advancing field of research - the molecular and cell biology of
  tumor viruses. Luckily, or perhaps by design at a higher level,
  Ulf Pettersson, an expert in the growth of human adenovirus who
  had done graduate studies with Lennart Philipson in Uppsala,
  Sweden, was a fellow postdoctoral associate and my office mate at
  Cold Spring Harbor. Adenoviruses are common causes of respiratory
  and other types of infections in man; however, when infected into
  newborn rodents, they can cause tumors. The high levels of both
  replication and viral protein expression made the growth cycle of
  this virus ideal for the study of gene structure and regulation.
  Furthermore, the then recent discovery of restriction
  endonucleases offered the prospect of fragmenting the viral
  genome of 35,000 base pairs into tractable units. Ulf, I, and
  others generated the first restriction endonuclease maps of this
  virus, and Dr. S. Jane Flint and I began to analyze the regions
  of the genome expressed as mRNAs in both productively infected
  cells and in adenovirus transformed cells. This was an exciting
  period in the molecular biology of adenovirus with the
  discoveries (a) that only one specific fragment of the genome,
  the E1 region, was responsible for oncogenic transformation; (b)
  that restriction endonuclease length polymorphism could be
  utilized to generate genetic maps; (c) the mapping of specific
  genes on the viral genome; and (d) generation of a viral map of
  sequences expressed as stable RNAs.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="../1969/index.html">Salvador Luria</a>, the Director of
  the then recently established Center for Cancer
  Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called in
  1974 to inquire if I would be interested in a position at the
  Center. After a brief visit to MIT I accepted. Fortunately, I was
  assigned laboratory space on the 5th floor, which was shared with
  <a href="../1975/index.html">David Baltimore</a>, Nancy Hopkins,
  Robert Weinberg and David Housman. Salva
     was a visionary who protected his young faculty from
     unnecessary interruptions, thus allowing their research
     programs to flourish in an ideal scientific environment. He
     was also a role model for how a scientist could shape and lead
     a community. That summer, Jane Flint moved with me to MIT and
     we continued our analysis of adenovirus transcription,
     focusing on quantitating the levels of RNA from all parts of
     the genome in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the
     cell. We found that the nuclei of cells productively infected
     by adenovirus contained abundant sets of viral RNAs which were
     not transported to the cytoplasm. We speculated that these
     long nuclear RNAs were processed to generate the cytoplasmic
     mRNAs. This stimulated our interest in comparing the relative
     structures of nuclear precursor RNA and cytoplasmic mRNA from
     the adenovirus genome. We were joined in the latter part of
     these studies by a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Susan Berget. For
     Sue, these studies were the beginning of a much more
     interesting series of experiments which form the first part of
     the lecture.<br>
  <br>
  As mentioned above, Ann and I were married in 1964 while still
  undergraduates at Union College. Our three daughters arrived on a
  schedule which approximated a seven year itch: Christine Alynn
  was born in 1968, while I was still in graduate school, Sarah
  Katherin was born in 1974, just before we moved to New England,
  and Helena Holcombe was born in 1981. Ann teaches a preschool
  class in Newton, Massachusetts, the town we have made our home
  since moving from Cold Spring Harbor. My family and are deeply
  enamored with New England. We enjoy its rural towns, coastal
  beauty, and the changes of seasons.<br>
  <br>
  Through the years at MIT my environment has remained relatively
  constant, though changes have occurred. David Baltimore and
  Robert Weinberg left the Center in 1983 to found the Whitehead Institute,
  which is associated with MIT. Salva retired from MIT in 1985 and
  I assumed his position as Director of the Center for Cancer
  Research. In 1991, I relinquished the Directorship to Richard
  Hynes and became the Head of the Department of Biology. The
  development of biotechnology has both enriched and complicated my
  work. <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/index.html">Walter
  Gilbert</a> of Harvard and I, along with a number of European
  colleagues, founded the biotechnology company Biogen in 1978 in
  Geneva, Switzerland. This organization and the friends who have
  worked for it have remained an important part of my life
  since.<br>
