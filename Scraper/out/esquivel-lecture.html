  <h1>Adolfo P&eacute;rez Esquivel - Nobel Lecture</h1>


  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1980</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Members of the Nobel Committee, Brothers
  and Sisters,<br>
  <br>
  I come before you, having just received the Nobel Peace Prize
  from so prestigious an academy, in order to share a reflection
  about my continent and our struggle.</p>

  <p>I would like to give thanks to everyone for
  the invitation to speak in this chamber of high learning. Not
  only to receive me personally, but by the mark of appreciation,
  recognition and esteem that this invitation implies with respect
  to the values and actions which sustain and are the hope and
  faith of our people in the struggle for justice and respect for
  the dignity of persons as the necessary condition for attaining
  true peace.</p>

  <p>I come as a man of the people, with
  humility and steadfastness to share with you this reality that I
  live and know.</p>

  <p>When receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, I
  said, from the first moment, I do not assume a personal honor,
  but receive it in the name of the people of Latin America, and
  most especially in the name of the poor, the most small and
  needy, the indigenous, the peasants, the workers, the young, and
  the many thousand members of the religious orders who work in the
  most inhospitable places of our continent, and of all those
  persons of goodwill who work and struggle to build a society free
  from domination.</p>

  <p>I would like to turn my attention to the
  anguish and hopes of our Latin Americans, not as a politician or
  technocrat in regard to social problems, but as a man identifying
  with the cause of the people in the daily struggle in defense of
  human rights and the affirming of values, and as a man who shares
  their hopes and faith in complete liberation.</p>

  <p>In the last decades the Church initiated a
  new kind of reflection and action: the consideration of faith in
  regard to the brother or sister who suffers, who is dispossessed,
  the poor.</p>

  <p>It is the faces of our workers, peasants,
  young, old, indigenous, and children that are the face of our
  Lord, Jesus Christ, who calls us to the obligation to <i>love our
  brothers and sisters.</i></p>

  <p>The Latin American bishops, gathered in
  Puebla de los Angeles in Mexico to assess the Latin American
  reality, gave thought from this perspective: to assume for the
  Church an inescapable commitment: the first priority must be the
  poor.</p>

  <p>And from all which stood in the way of
  reflection on the life of our peoples, there is surging forth a
  new active theology and way of living the faith.</p>

  <p>Thus is assumed a reasoned understanding of
  faith, an intent to know and explain the desperate reality that
  we live. The poor will not now be seen as objects of charity, as
  isolated individuals, but as products of a system of structures
  of injustice that produce marginalisation, misery, and hunger for
  our people.</p>

  <p>It was a sharing of experiences and
  apprehending knowledge of this reality in all its aspects and
  facets. For Christians, faith cannot be foreign to these
  problems; theology, then, was considered as a reflection of this
  faith and of the moral force of the Word, for the work of
  liberation from injustice and from sin, in its structural as well
  as personal dimension.</p>

  <p>Reflection is only a partial understanding
  of truth if it does not translate itself in practice into
  commitments to the common good and justice. Truth is not mere
  abstraction, but something to be done; and is only apprehended
  when this is realized.</p>

  <p>It is this concrete work, which Christians
  must undertake in great numbers, that will lead to the process of
  liberation of our people.</p>

  <p>Like many other persons and Christian
  organizations, ours, the Service for Peace and Justice in Latin
  America - of which as General Coordinator I am the current voice
  for its work and objectives - tries to encourage and exert our
  efforts on the path toward achieving a society free from
  domination that overcomes systems of injustice and inspires the
  fraternal embrace between humans and the reconciliation with
  God.</p>

  <p>Our voice seeks to be the voice of those
  who have no voice, of those who are excluded, of the humble and
  small.</p>

  <p>Our hands seek to speak the language of
  those who labor, to add to the effort to construct a new world
  solidarity founded on love, justice, liberty and truth.</p>

  <p>Our analysis is a direct consequence of
  this commitment; our practice is the theory and use of
  nonviolence based on the gospel. This is a spirit and a method,
  the participative power of the struggle for the needs of the most
  small who are the elect of our Lord, who animates them with His
  spirit to organize themselves and unite to accomplish their own
  liberation. It is thus, in this way we are facing our work in
  Latin America.</p>

  <p>I would like now to speak of Latin America,
  this reality which was defined by the beloved Pope Paul VI as
  <i>el Continente de la Esperanza,</i> (&quot;the Continent of
  Hope&quot;).</p>

  <p>It seems that in Latin America, as we come
  wanting to help, we suffer the shock of the contradictions
  between two models of development of our nations sustained by
  force and social diversity.</p>

  <p>Our Latin American nations have said of our
  people: &quot;They have taken opportunities to use their talents and
  to organize themselves and have shown they can succeed to obtain
  vindication for their just rights&quot;.</p>

  <p>The stifling of these rights weighs heavily
  on this creative capacity and also weighs down the natural
  economic richness and development of our countries. Latin America
  lives the anguish of an economically unequal growth that
  accompanies a development not integral to the participation of
  the people. This generates conflict that manifests itself in many
  ways in all parts of our societies.</p>

  <p>I speak of situations like that of Bolivia
  where a military regime pays no heed and oppresses the will of a
  people.</p>

  <p>I speak of Salvador where the general
  violence, product of structures of domination and injustices with
  the force of law, seen for decades, compromises today the
  practical possibility of a peaceful solution.</p>

  <p>I speak of Cuba, its prisoners and
  politicians responsible for clear transgressions against human
  rights. I speak of Paraguay, Chile, Brazil, Guatemala, countries
  where there exists no capacity for constitutional order nor any
  intent to institute such order for the openly limited and
  deceitful forms that will not grant to the people their authentic
  right to be makers of their own destiny.</p>

  <p>I speak of my own Argentina where
  situations have led to systems of injustice that we share with
  the rest of our large Latin American fatherland. These have
  devolved into violence from both the Left and the Right which
  have resulted in the murdered, the injured, the disappeared, the
  tortured, prisoned, and exiled.</p>

  <p>This situation, anguished and unjust, is
  shared by all responsible sectors of national life. It is felt
  with sorrow by the families of the disappeared, and especially
  the mothers, like the mothers of the Plaza de Mayo whose valorous
  and international action for peace is a patient witness bearing
  the sorrow of uncertainty about the fate of their sons.</p>

  <p>The churches, the workers' organizations,
  the political parties and the institutions for the defense of
  human rights have all demanded a solution of this problem that
  stands in the way of a real meeting of the Argentines.</p>

  <p>I do not wish to speak more of the above
  mentioned injustices, since I do not believe the latter is the
  struggle for you here. These are things I must deal with in my
  own country and confront with the present government.</p>

  <p>I want to express, with special emphasis,
  my total support for the Pope's mediation regarding the boundary
  conflict between the Argentine republic and that of Chile, my
  brothers.</p>

  <p>We know, as His Holiness John Paul II has
  observed, that there are no differences between our countries
  that cannot be overcome peacefully. We also know the unique
  benefits this belief could bring in a similar disaster; and
  already disasters are in the making from the traffickers in arms
  and those who want to help certain parties to divide the Latin
  American peoples.</p>

  <p>The only possible solution is peace, since
  war means only a useless spilling of blood, and, besides, a grave
  violation of the dignity of both peoples, and even those who are
  mere spectators of the conflict.</p>

  <p>I speak of a continent where millions of
  persons live who are subjected to the violence of hunger, of
  endemic disease, of illiteracy, of homelessness, of persecution,
  both for political reasons and against labor unions.</p>

  <p>I speak, in summary, of Latin America where
  we experience constant violations of the human rights of the
  people. The violence is expressed toward the disappeared, the
  prisoners, the tortured, the exiles, the lack of freedom of the
  press, etc. ... it is not only with the attacks against the
  rights of persons that we must deal. We must analyze also, in all
  the dimensions of this reality, the deep structural causes which
  generate these conflict situations. For that, the struggle for
  the dignity of the individual must consider society as much as
  the individual in all which has to do with the development of the
  rights of the people.</p>

  <p>But this same continent and these same
  human beings live, besides, in the hope of making their own
  history. And to this immense task, where I humbly include myself,
  we take no more than our own hands and great faith.</p>

  <p>To those of you also involved in this
  struggle on behalf of the poor, I want to bring you the image of
  this deeply absorbing situation and its significance for world
  peace.</p>

  <p>Latin America does not see itself in the
  same way, but finds itself caught between an economic-political
  system and an international social system in profound
  transformation. Its image of violence reflects the violence of
  our contemporary world. Its injustices are bound up within an
  unjust international system, a system whose mechanisms, in the
  words of John Paul II, &quot;are mechanisms encountered impregnated
  not with an authentic humanism, but with materialism producing an
  international standard with the rich ever richer at the expense
  of the poor ever poorer&quot;.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to create the conditions
  that permit displacing the mechanisms which secure the domination
  of one country over another. I want to affirm, together with our
  Latin American pastors in the meeting at Puebla, that in the
  ability to live together, &quot;... all human beings hold the common
  good as fundamental, consistent with the ever more fraternal
  realization of common dignity which does not use some persons as
  tools for the benefit of others, and that all be disposed to
  sacrifice for some particular good ends&quot;. This common dignity
  necessarily implies the existence of liberty.</p>

  <p>And for us liberty is that inalienable
  capacity that all humans alike have at their disposal.</p>

  <p>This is the capacity that permits the
  building of communion and participation which encourage human
  beings to relate fully with the world, with their brothers and
  sisters and with God.</p>

  <p>I see with concern that this new
  international system, marked as it is by the existence of great
  multinational corporations, is far from increasing participation
  and improving channels of expression for the majority. What is
  essential are new constructs that allow political participation,
  eliminating the distance between the governors and the governed,
  that support the privileges of minorities, and do not hold on to
  the old, the known and worn-out structures of injustice.</p>

  <p>The rules of the game established by the
  powerful and imposed on the rest of the world make possible the
  grand crime of our epoch, the arms race. This produces a useless
  diversion of resources which could be dedicated to the
  development of our nations. These powers produce and reproduce
  the conditions of injustice and domination. Such obstacles
  obstruct the exercise of the full rights of the people and oblige
  the workers of all latitudes to struggle for labor and political
  rights - as much in Latin America, as in Poland, in Africa and
  Asia.</p>

  <p>The cause for human rights is the same, in
  one way or another, in the United States and the Soviet
  Union.</p>

  <p>We would especially like to express our
  solidarity with <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/index.html">Dr.
  Andrei Sakharov</a>, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate of 1975. May
  he soon regain his liberty, together with Mr. Anatoly
  Shcharansky, both of whom are detained in the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>We have been speaking here of the anguish
  over the reality in which Latin America is living, and in
  particular I have referred to the situation in my country,
  Argentina. Also I have shown here our active preoccupation with
  the problems that all people of the world live with in their
  tireless struggle in defense of their inalienable rights.</p>

  <p>I would like now to speak of my hope
  because it is that which empowers our actions and commitment.</p>

  <p>Beginning to speak of this, I am
  remembering a martyr to peace, the Archbishop of Salvador,
  Monsignor Oscar Romero, who in his work of the gospel, shared in
  the way of the people even to giving his life for them. Even his
  martyrdom is a sign of hope.</p>

  <p>Our hope is the benevolent notice of Christ
  Jesus, who in these days of the Advent and Christmas season
  fortifies human conscience in all latitudes. We take hope because
  we believe with St. Paul that love never dies, and that
  humankind, in the historical process, has always created enclaves
  of love in solidarity with the active practice of the full rights
  of persons.</p>

  <p>For this, our testimony in the world cannot
  be limited to the exercise of critical judgement of the
  injustices of the social, economic, and political order or to the
  consequent denunciation of the sins of those responsible.</p>

  <p>The Christian must act. Act, not based on the conviction that
  the Christian possesses the key to the secrets of social problems
  or because he knows how to extract from the Gospels infallible
  models to transform all situations.</p>

  <p>The Christian must act together with all men of goodwill,
  bringing his humble strength to support the building of a world
  more just and humane.</p>

  <p>I want to affirm with emphasis: <i>this world is
  possible.</i></p>

  <p>The social order we seek is not a utopia.
  It is a world where political life is understood in terms of
  active participation by the governors and the governed in the
  realization of the common good.</p>

  <p>We do not believe in consensus by force. We
  are accustomed to hearing, wherever human rights are being
  violated, that it is being done in the name of higher interests.
  I declare that there exists no higher interest than the human
  being.</p>

  <p>I point out my conviction in the maturity
  of the people, who are able to govern themselves without
  paternalistic guardians.</p>

  <p>For this reason we have hope. We believe in
  the vocation and participation of our people, who day to day are
  awakened to their political conscience and express their desire
  for change and the complete democratization of society. A change
  based on justice, built with love, and which will bring us the
  most anxiously desired fruit of peace.</p>

  <p>We must all commit ourselves to this task.
  And I want my voice to help build the chorus of voices so that
  the clamor for justice will become deafening.</p>

  <p>I live this hope which I am sure I share
  with many others. I am confident that one day our daily effort
  will have its reward.</p>

  <p>We are working to serve the plan of the
  Lord, the One whom the prophet Isaiah promised us when he
  said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">The Lord shall govern the nations,
    direct and set right the peoples; they shall beat their swords
    into ploughshares and quit the use of their spears. One nation
    will not lift its sword against another, neither shall they
    learn war any more.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I wish, finally, to show my deep gratitude
  to the members of the Nobel Committee and to all those present
  and to all the people of Norway for having given me such a high
  distinction.</p>

  <p>I am deeply moved and commit myself to
  redouble my efforts in the struggle for peace.</p>

  <p>I implore our Lord that He may, with his
  infinite mercy, illumine us and guide us on the road to peace and
  justice.</p>

  <p>Peace and good wishes to all.</p><br>

  <p>Muchas gracias. Many thanks.</p>
