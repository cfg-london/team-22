  <h1>Kofi Annan - Nobel Lecture</h1>
  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, Oslo, December 10, 2001</p>
  <p class="smalltext">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses,
  Excellencies,<br>
  Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Ladies and
  Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  Today, in Afghanistan, a girl will be born. Her mother will hold
  her and feed her, comfort her and care for her &#8211; just as
  any mother would anywhere in the world. In these most basic acts
  of human nature, humanity knows no divisions. But to be born a
  girl in today's Afghanistan is to begin life centuries away from
  the prosperity that one small part of humanity has achieved. It
  is to live under conditions that many of us in this hall would
  consider inhuman.<br>
  <br>
  I speak of a girl in Afghanistan, but I might equally well have
  mentioned a baby boy or girl in Sierra Leone. No one today is
  unaware of this divide between the world&#8217;s rich and poor.
  No one today can claim ignorance of the cost that this divide
  imposes on the poor and dispossessed who are no less deserving of
  human dignity, fundamental freedoms, security, food and education
  than any of us. The cost, however, is not borne by them alone.
  Ultimately, it is borne by all of us &#8211; North and South,
  rich and poor, men and women of all races and religions.<br>
  <br>
  Today's real borders are not between nations, but between
  powerful and powerless, free and fettered, privileged and
  humiliated. Today, no walls can separate humanitarian or human
  rights crises in one part of the world from national security
  crises in another.<br>
  <br>
  Scientists tell us that the world of nature is so small and
  interdependent that a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon
  rainforest can generate a violent storm on the other side of the
  earth. This principle is known as the "Butterfly Effect." Today,
  we realize, perhaps more than ever, that the world of human
  activity also has its own "Butterfly Effect" &#8211; for better
  or for worse.<br>
  <br>
  Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  We have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If
  today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we
  see further &#8211; we will realize that humanity is indivisible.
  New threats make no distinction between races, nations or
  regions. A new insecurity has entered every mind, regardless of
  wealth or status. A deeper awareness of the bonds that bind us
  all &#8211; in pain as in prosperity &#8211; has gripped young
  and old.<br>
  <br>
  In the early beginnings of the 21st century &#8211; a century
  already violently disabused of any hopes that progress towards
  global peace and prosperity is inevitable -- this new reality can
  no longer be ignored. It must be confronted.<br>
  <br>
  The 20th century was perhaps the deadliest in human history,
  devastated by innumerable conflicts, untold suffering, and
  unimaginable crimes. Time after time, a group or a nation
  inflicted extreme violence on another, often driven by irrational
  hatred and suspicion, or unbounded arrogance and thirst for power
  and resources. In response to these cataclysms, the leaders of
  the world came together at mid-century to unite the nations as
  never before.<br>
  <br>
  A forum was created &#8211; the United Nations &#8211; where all
  nations could join forces to affirm the dignity and worth of
  every person, and to secure peace and development for all
  peoples. Here States could unite to strengthen the rule of law,
  recognize and address the needs of the poor, restrain man&#8217;s
  brutality and greed, conserve the resources and beauty of nature,
  sustain the equal rights of men <i>and</i> women, and provide for
  the safety of future generations.<br>
  <br>
  We thus inherit from the 20th century the political, as well as
  the scientific and technological power, which &#8211; if only we
  have the will to use them &#8211; give us the chance to vanquish
  poverty, ignorance and disease.<br>
  <br>
  In the 21st Century I believe the mission of the United Nations
  will be defined by a new, more profound, awareness of the
  sanctity and dignity of every human life, regardless of race or
  religion. This will require us to look beyond the framework of
  States, and beneath the surface of nations or communities. We
  must focus, as never before, on improving the conditions of the
  individual men and women who give the state or nation its
  richness and character. We must begin with the young Afghan girl,
  recognizing that saving that one life is to save humanity
  itself.<br>
  <br>
  Over the past five years, I have often recalled that the United
  Nations' Charter begins with the words: "We the peoples." What is
  not always recognized is that "we the peoples" are made up of
  individuals whose claims to the most fundamental rights have too
  often been sacrificed in the supposed interests of the state or
  the nation.<br>
  <br>
  A genocide begins with the killing of one man &#8211; not for
  what he has done, but because of who he is. A campaign of 'ethnic
  cleansing' begins with one neighbour turning on another. Poverty
  begins when even one child is denied his or her fundamental right
  to education. What begins with the failure to uphold the dignity
  of one life, all too often ends with a calamity for entire
  nations.<br>
  <br>
  In this new century, we must start from the understanding that
  peace belongs not only to states or peoples, but to each and
  every member of those communities. The sovereignty of States must
  no longer be used as a shield for gross violations of human
  rights. Peace must be made real and tangible in the daily
  existence of every individual in need. Peace must be sought,
  above all, because it is the condition for every member of the
  human family to live a life of dignity and security.<br>
  <br>
  The rights of the individual are of no less importance to
  immigrants and minorities in Europe and the Americas than to
  women in Afghanistan or children in Africa. They are as
  fundamental to the poor as to the rich; they are as necessary to
  the security of the developed world as to that of the developing
  world.<br>
  <br>
  From this vision of the role of the United Nations in the next
  century flow three key priorities for the future: eradicating
  poverty, preventing conflict, and promoting democracy. Only in a
  world that is rid of poverty can all men and women make the most
  of their abilities. Only where individual rights are respected
  can differences be channelled politically and resolved
  peacefully. Only in a democratic environment, based on respect
  for diversity and dialogue, can individual self-expression and
  self-government be secured, and freedom of association be
  upheld.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout my term as Secretary-General, I have sought to place
  human beings at the centre of everything we do &#8211; from
  conflict prevention to development to human rights. Securing real
  and lasting improvement in the lives of individual men and women
  is the measure of all we do at the United Nations.<br>
  <br>
  It is in this spirit that I humbly accept the Centennial Nobel
  Peace Prize. Forty years ago today, the Prize for 1961 was
  awarded for the first time to a Secretary-General of the United
  Nations &#8211; posthumously, because Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld had
  already given his life for peace in Central Africa. And on the
  same day, the Prize for 1960 was awarded for the first time to an
  African &#8211; Albert Luthuli, one of the earliest leaders of
  the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. For me, as a
  young African beginning his career in the United Nations a few
  months later, those two men set a standard that I have sought to
  follow throughout my working life.<br>
  <br>
  This award belongs not just to me. I do not stand here alone. On
  behalf of all my colleagues in every part of the United Nations,
  in every corner of the globe, who have devoted their lives
  &#8211; and in many instances risked or given their lives in the
  cause of peace &#8211; I thank the Members of the Nobel Committee
  for this high honour. My own path to service at the United
  Nations was made possible by the sacrifice and commitment of my
  family and many friends from all continents &#8211; some of whom
  have passed away &#8211; who taught me and guided me. To them, I
  offer my most profound gratitude.<br>
  <br>
  In a world filled with weapons of war and all too often words of
  war, the Nobel Committee has become a vital agent for peace.
  Sadly, a prize for peace is a rarity in this world. Most nations
  have monuments or memorials to war, bronze salutations to heroic
  battles, archways of triumph. But peace has no parade, no
  pantheon of victory.<br>
  <br>
  What it does have is the Nobel Prize &#8211; a statement of hope
  and courage with unique resonance and authority. Only by
  understanding and addressing the needs of individuals for peace,
  for dignity, and for security can we at the United Nations hope
  to live up to the honour conferred today, and fulfil the vision
  of our founders. This is the broad mission of peace that United
  Nations staff members carry out every day in every part of the
  world.<br>
  <br>
  A few of them, women and men, are with us in this hall today.
  Among them, for instance, are a Military Observer from Senegal
  who is helping to provide basic security in the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo; a Civilian Police Adviser from the United
  States who is helping to improve the rule of law in Kosovo; a
  UNICEF Child Protection Officer from Ecuador who is helping to
  secure the rights of Colombia's most vulnerable citizens; and a
  World Food Programme Officer from China who is helping to feed
  the people of North Korea.<br>
  <br>
  Distinguished guests,<br>
  <br>
  The idea that there is one people in possession of the truth, one
  answer to the world&#8217;s ills, or one solution to
  humanity&#8217;s needs, has done untold harm throughout history
  &#8211; especially in the last century. Today, however, even
  amidst continuing ethnic conflict around the world, there is a
  growing understanding that human diversity is both the reality
  that makes dialogue necessary, and the very basis for that
  dialogue.<br>
  <br>
  We understand, as never before, that each of us is fully worthy
  of the respect and dignity essential to our common humanity. We
  recognize that we are the products of many cultures, traditions
  and memories; that mutual respect allows us to study and learn
  from other cultures; and that we gain strength by combining the
  foreign with the familiar.<br>
  <br>
  In every great faith and tradition one can find the values of
  tolerance and mutual understanding. The Qur&#8217;an, for
  example, tells us that "We created you from a single pair of male
  and female and made you into nations and tribes, that you may
  know each other." Confucius urged his followers: "when the good
  way prevails in the state, speak boldly and act boldly. When the
  state has lost the way, act boldly and speak softly." In the
  Jewish tradition, the injunction to "love thy neighbour as
  thyself," is considered to be the very essence of the
  Torah.<br>
  <br>
  This thought is reflected in the Christian Gospel, which also
  teaches us to love our enemies and pray for those who wish to
  persecute us. Hindus are taught that "truth is one, the sages
  give it various names." And in the Buddhist tradition,
  individuals are urged to act with compassion in every facet of
  life.<br>
  <br>
  Each of us has the right to take pride in our particular faith or
  heritage. But the notion that what is ours is necessarily in
  conflict with what is theirs is both false and dangerous. It has
  resulted in endless enmity and conflict, leading men to commit
  the greatest of crimes in the name of a higher power.<br>
  <br>
  It need not be so. People of different religions and cultures
  live side by side in almost every part of the world, and most of
  us have overlapping identities which unite us with very different
  groups. We <i>can</i> love what we are, without hating what
  &#8211; and who &#8211; we are <i>not</i>. We can thrive in our
  own tradition, even as we learn from others, and come to respect
  their teachings.<br>
  <br>
  This will not be possible, however, without freedom of religion,
  of expression, of assembly, and basic equality under the law.
  Indeed, the lesson of the past century has been that where the
  dignity of the individual has been trampled or threatened &#8211;
  where citizens have not enjoyed the basic right to choose their
  government, or the right to change it regularly &#8211; conflict
  has too often followed, with innocent civilians paying the price,
  in lives cut short and communities destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  The obstacles to democracy have little to do with culture or
  religion, and much more to do with the desire of those in power
  to maintain their position at any cost. This is neither a new
  phenomenon nor one confined to any particular part of the world.
  People of all cultures value their freedom of choice, and feel
  the need to have a say in decisions affecting their lives.<br>
  <br>
  The United Nations, whose membership comprises almost all the
  States in the world, is founded on the principle of the equal
  worth of every human being. It is the nearest thing we have to a
  representative institution that can address the interests of all
  states, and all peoples. Through this universal, indispensable
  instrument of human progress, States can serve the interests of
  their citizens by recognizing common interests and pursuing them
  in unity. No doubt, that is why the Nobel Committee says that it
  "wishes, in its centenary year, to proclaim that the only
  negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of
  the United Nations".<br>
  <br>
  I believe the Committee also recognized that this era of global
  challenges leaves no choice but cooperation at the global level.
  When States undermine the rule of law and violate the rights of
  their individual citizens, they become a menace not only to their
  own people, but also to their neighbours, and indeed the world.
  What we need today is better governance &#8211; legitimate,
  democratic governance that allows each individual to flourish,
  and each State to thrive.<br>
  <br>
  Your Majesties,<br>
  Excellencies,<br>
  Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
  <br>
  You will recall that I began my address with a reference to the
  girl born in Afghanistan today. Even though her mother will do
  all in her power to protect and sustain her, there is a
  one-in-four risk that she will not live to see her fifth
  birthday. Whether she does is just one test of our common
  humanity &#8211; of our belief in our individual responsibility
  for our fellow men and women. But it is the only test that
  matters.<br>
  <br>
  Remember this girl and then our larger aims &#8211; to fight
  poverty, prevent conflict, or cure disease &#8211; will not seem
  distant, or impossible. Indeed, those aims will seem very near,
  and very achievable &#8211; as they should. Because beneath the
  surface of states and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate
  of individual human beings in need. Answering their needs will be
  the mission of the United Nations in the century to come.</p>

  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
