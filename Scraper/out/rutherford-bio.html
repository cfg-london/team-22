  <h1>Ernest Rutherford - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rutherford.jpg" alt="Ernest Rutherford" class="bio-img"><b>Ernest Rutherford</b> was born on August 30,
  1871, in Nelson, New Zealand, the fourth child and second son in
  a family of seven sons and five daughters. His father James
  Rutherford, a Scottish wheelwright, immigrated to New Zealand with
  Ernest's grandfather and the whole family in 1842. His mother,
  n&eacute;e Martha Thompson, was an English schoolteacher, who, with
  her widowed mother, also went to live there in 1855.<br>
  <br>
  Ernest received his early education in Government schools and at
  the age of 16 entered Nelson Collegiate School. In 1889 he was
  awarded a University scholarship and he proceeded to the
  University of New Zealand, Wellington, where he entered
  Canterbury College<a href="#not">*</a>. He graduated M.A. in 1893
  with a double first in Mathematics and Physical Science and he
  continued with research work at the College for a short time,
  receiving the B.Sc. degree the following year. That same year,
  1894, he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship,
  enabling him to go to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a research student at
  the Cavendish
  Laboratory under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a>. In 1897 he
  was awarded the B.A. Research Degree and the Coutts-Trotter
  Studentship of Trinity College. An opportunity came when the
  Macdonald Chair of Physics at McGill University, Montreal, became vacant,
  and in 1898 he left for Canada to take up the post.<br>
  <br>
  Rutherford returned to England in 1907 to become Langworthy
  Professor of Physics in the University of Manchester, succeeding Sir
  Arthur Schuster, and in 1919 he accepted an invitation to succeed
  Sir Joseph Thomson as Cavendish Professor of Physics at
  Cambridge. He also became Chairman of the Advisory Council, H.M.
  Government, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research;
  Professor of Natural Philosophy, Royal Institution, London; and Director of
  the Royal
  Society Mond Laboratory, Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  Rutherford's first researches, in New Zealand, were concerned
  with the magnetic properties of iron exposed to high-frequency
  oscillations, and his thesis was entitled <i>Magnetization of
  Iron by High-Frequency Discharges</i>. He was one of the first to
  design highly original experiments with high-frequency,
  alternating currents. His second paper, <i>Magnetic
  Viscosity</i>, was published in the <i>Transactions of the New
  Zealand Institute</i> (1896) and contains a description of a
  time-apparatus capable of measuring time intervals of a
  hundred-thousandth of a second.<br>
  <br>
  On his arrival at Cambridge his talents were quickly recognized
  by Professor Thomson. During his first spell at the Cavendish
  Laboratory, he invented a detector for electromagnetic waves, an
  essential feature being an ingenious magnetizing coil containing
  tiny bundles of magnetized iron wire. He worked jointly with
  Thomson on the behaviour of the ions observed in gases which had
  been treated with X-rays, and also, in 1897, on the mobility of
  ions in relation to the strength of the electric field, and on
  related topics such as the photoelectric effect. In 1898 he
  reported the existence of alpha and beta rays in uranium
  radiation and indicated some of their properties.<br>
  <br>
  In Montreal, there were ample opportunities for research at
  McGill, and his work on radioactive bodies, particularly on the
  emission of alpha rays, was continued in the Macdonald
  Laboratory. With R.B. Owens he studied the "emanation" of thorium
  and discovered a new noble gas, an isotope of radon, which was
  later to be known as thoron. <a href=
  "../1921/index.html">Frederick Soddy</a> arrived at McGill in
  1900 from Oxford, and he collaborated with Rutherford in
  creating the "disintegration theory" of radioactivity which
  regards radioactive phenomena as atomic - not molecular -
  processes. The theory was supported by a large amount of
  experimental evidence, a number of new radioactive substances
  were discovered and their position in the series of
  transformations was fixed. <a href="../1944/index.html">Otto
  Hahn</a>, who later discovered atomic fission, worked under
  Rutherford at the Montreal Laboratory in 1905-06.<br>
  <br>
  At Manchester, Rutherford continued his research on the
  properties of the radium emanation and of the alpha rays and, in
  conjunction with H. Geiger, a method of detecting a single alpha
  particle and counting the number emitted from radium was devised.
  In 1910, his investigations into the scattering of alpha rays and
  the nature of the inner structure of the atom which caused such
  scattering led to the postulation of his concept of the
  "nucleus", his greatest contribution to physics. According to him
  practically the whole mass of the atom and at the same time all
  positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a minute space at
  the centre. In 1912 <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a> joined him at
  Manchester and he adapted Rutherford's nuclear structure to
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Max Planck</a>'s
  quantum theory and so obtained a theory of atomic structure
  which, with later improvements, mainly as a result of
  Heisenberg's concepts, remains valid to this day. In 1913,
  together with H. G. Moseley, he used cathode rays to bombard
  atoms of various elements and showed that the inner structures
  correspond with a group of lines which characterize the elements.
  Each element could then be assigned an atomic number and, more
  important, the properties of each element could be defined by
  this number. In 1919, during his last year at Manchester, he
  discovered that the nuclei of certain light elements, such as
  nitrogen, could be "disintegrated" by the impact of energetic
  alpha particles coming from some radioactive source, and that
  during this process fast protons were emitted. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1948/index.html">Blackett</a> later proved,
 with the cloud chamber, that the nitrogen in this process actually could be transformed into an oxygen isotope.
  <a href="../1943/index.html">G. de Hevesy</a> was also one of
  Rutherford's collaborators at Manchester.<br>
  <br>
  An inspiring leader of the Cavendish Laboratory, he steered
  numerous future Nobel Prize winners towards their great
  achievements: <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/index.html">Chadwick</a>, Blackett,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/index.html">Cockcroft and
  Walton</a>; while other laureates worked with him at the
  Cavendish for shorter or longer periods: <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/index.html">G.P. Thomson</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1947/index.html">Appleton</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1950/index.html">Powell</a>, and <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Aston</a>. C.D. Ellis, his co-author in 1919
  and 1930, pointed out "that the majority of the experiments at
  the Cavendish were really started by Rutherford's direct or
  indirect suggestion". He remained active and working to the very
  end of his life.<br>
  <br>
  Rutherford published several books: <i>Radioactivity</i> (1904);
  <i>Radioactive Transformations</i> (1906), being his Silliman
  Lectures at Yale
  University; <i>Radiation from Radioactive Substances</i>,
  with James Chadwick and C.D. Ellis (1919, 1930) - a thoroughly
  documented book which serves as a chronological list of his many
  papers to learned societies, etc.; <i>The Electrical Structure of
  Matter</i> (1926); <i>The Artificial Transmutation of the
  Elements</i> (1933); <i>The Newer Alchemy</i> (1937).<br>
  <br>
  Rutherford was knighted in 1914; he was appointed to the Order of
  Merit in 1925, and in 1931 he was created First Baron Rutherford
  of Nelson, New Zealand, and Cambridge. He was elected Fellow of
  the Royal Society in 1903 and was its President from 1925 to
  1930. Amongst his many honours, he was awarded the Rumford Medal
  (1905) and the Copley Medal (1922) of the Royal Society, the
  Bressa Prize (1910) of the Turin Academy of Science, the Albert
  Medal (1928) of the Royal Society of Arts, the Faraday Medal
  (1930) of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the D.Sc.
  degree of the University of New Zealand, and honorary doctorates
  from the Universities of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, McGill, Birmingham,
  Edinburgh,
  Melbourne, Yale, Glasgow, Giessen, Copenhagen, Cambridge, Dublin, Durham, Oxford,
  Liverpool,
  Toronto, Bristol, Cape Town, London and Leeds.<br>
  <br>
  Rutherford married Mary Newton, only daughter of Arthur and Mary
  de Renzy Newton, in 1900. Their only child, Eileen, married the
  physicist R.H. Fowler. Rutherford's chief recreations were golf
  and motoring.<br>
  <br>
  He died in Cambridge on October 19, 1937. His ashes were buried
  in the nave of Westminster Abbey, just west of Sir Isaac Newton's
  tomb and by that of Lord Kelvin.</p>
