  <h1>Robert F. Furchgott - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="furchgott.jpg" class="bio-img">
  I was born in the lovely coastal city of Charleston, S.C. in 1916
  and lived there until I was thirteen. In Charleston I first
  became enamored of "natural history" when I attended nature study
  classes and field trips to nearby beaches, marshes and woods,
  sponsored by the Charleston Museum. I became an avid shell
  collector and bird watcher (that was before the term "birder" was
  coined), and I still enjoy these hobbies. In 1929, my family
  moved from Charleston to Orangeburg, S.C., an inland, rural town
  of about 8,000 inhabitants, where my mother had grown up and
  still had some family. The reason for the move was that the
  Furchgott department store in Charleston, which had been started
  by my grandfather and was being run by my father and his two
  brothers, was unable to survive in the midst of the Depression,
  and my father decided to open a women's clothing store in
  Orangeburg. So I spent my high school years in Orangeburg,
  enjoying small town life and competing with my first cousin Edwin
  Moseley for the highest grades in our class. He won.<br>
  <br>
  Within the first couple of years of high school, I knew that I
  would like to be a scientist. My parents were encouraging: they
  gave me chemistry sets and a small microscope as presents. I
  liked to read popular books about scientists, although there were
  not many available at that time. My father subscribed to the
  Sunday New York Times, in which there was often a column on
  science that I found very exciting.<br>
  <br>
  During the four years that I was in high school, my older brother
  Arthur was at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I
  wanted to attend college there also, but that was not possible
  when I finished high school in 1933 because tuition for me, as an
  out-of-state resident, was more than my father could afford at
  that time. So I spent my freshman year at the University of South
  Carolina, where my tuition was much less. However, by the
  summer of 1934, my father moved his business from Orangeburg to
  Goldsboro, N.C., where he felt that the local economy was better.
  So now, as a resident of North Carolina, I was able to register
  at the University at Chapel Hill as a sophomore majoring in
  chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  At Chapel Hill, I had a number of excellent teachers in
  chemistry. During my junior and senior years, I had a small
  amount of financial support from an NYA job (NYA being the
  initials of the National Youth Administration set up by the
  federal government to help students during the Depression). In
  that job, I was a lab assistant in research to a junior faculty
  member working on the physical chemistry of solutions of
  cellulose. I had decided early in my college years that I would
  go on to graduate work in some branch of chemistry. My preference
  by the time I was a senior was physical organic chemistry. I sent
  letters to dozens of chemistry departments applying for a
  graduate fellowship or teaching assistantship. I had an excellent
  academic record, but by graduation time I still had no definite
  offer of a position for graduate training. I was almost resigned
  to taking a job in chemical industry, when around the middle of
  June while I was in Florence, S.C., where my parents now lived,
  an unexpected offer of a teaching assistantship came to me from
  the Physiological Chemistry Department of Northwestern
  University Medical School in Chicago. I was to be a graduate
  student of Dr Henry Bull, who had recently come to Northwestern,
  and whose research interests were physical chemical aspects of
  biochemistry.<br>
  <b><br>
  Northwestern and Cold Spring Harbor (1937-1940)</b><br>
  Before I went to Chicago, I worked for two summer months in 1937
  for Eastern Airlines at the Philadelphia airport - a job which my
  older brother Arthur, who was employed by that airline, helped me
  obtain. The job allowed me to save some money and also allowed me
  free air travel to Chicago. That helped a lot since my stipend as
  a teaching assistant at Northwestern was only $50 a month for a
  nine-month academic year. When I arrived in Chicago, it had
  already been arranged for me to share a room with two more
  advanced graduate students. Living in Chicago was quite a change
  from living in the Carolinas. When I would walk to work in the
  winter from our rooming house, which was about a mile from the
  medical school, the chill wind whipping in from Lake Michigan
  along Chicago Avenue was quite an experience for a Southern
  boy.<br>
  <br>
  My course work at Northwestern was partly at the medical school,
  and partly at the Evanston campus to which I would travel via the
  El. At the Evanston campus, my courses were mainly in physical
  chemistry under Dr Malcolm Dole, who was also on my PhD advisory
  committee. At the Chicago campus, I had to take physiology and
  bacteriology (along with medical students), Henry Bull's course
  on physical chemistry in biochemistry, and some assorted graduate
  courses in physiology and biochemistry. The physiology course was
  under the direction of Dr Andrew Ivy, who had built up a sizeable
  physiology department faculty for those times. In contrast, the
  biochemistry faculty consisted only of the chairman, Dr Chester
  Farmer, Dr Bull and two part-time lecturers.<br>
  <br>
  My laboratory work with Bull started out with the preparation of
  purified egg albumin. He was studying physical chemical changes
  in this protein after different methods of denaturation. He had
  begun to involve me in some of his studies when the summer of
  1938 came along, and that turned out to be a special summer for
  me. Bull had been invited to present a paper on his work at the
  sixth Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology which
  was to take place at the Cold Spring Harbor Biological Laboratory
  of the Long Island Biological Association. The theme of the
  symposium, which was to run for five weeks in a leisurely fashion
  was the structure and function of proteins. Bull had obtained
  permission from the director of the Cold Spring Harbor
  Laboratory, Dr Eric Ponder, for me to attend the symposium, while
  earning my room and board by running the lantern slide projector
  at the lectures. The symposium was very exciting. I met many
  distinguished scientists. Ponder and a physician-scientist,
  Harold Abramson, arranged to have me assist in a research project
  at the laboratory for the rest of the summer after the symposium
  was over. The project was on the electrophoretic mobility of
  rabbit erythrocytes and ghosts, measured with the use of a
  microelectrophoresis cell and light- and dark-field
  microscopy.<br>
  <br>
  By the end of the summer, I had become very interested in the
  physical chemistry of the red blood cell membrane. When I
  returned to Northwestern in the fall of 1938, Bull approved
  continuation of my research on red blood cells as a PhD thesis
  project. In particular, I was fascinated by the unexplained
  phenomenon of the transformation of mammalian red blood cells,
  suspended in unbuffered isotonic saline from discs to perfect
  spheres when a small drop of the suspension was placed between
  slide and coverglass. I discovered that the disc-sphere
  transformation depended on two factors. The first was a rise in
  pH to over 9.0 in the unbuffered suspension, as a result of the
  alkaline nature of the glass surfaces (pH being measured with a
  semi-micro glass electrode that I constructed). The second factor
  was the removal from the suspension of the red blood cells by
  adsorption onto the glass surfaces of the slide and coverglass of
  a substance in the suspension that prevented sphering on
  elevation of pH of the suspension. I demonstrated that this
  substance, which I termed the anti-sphering factor, was serum
  albumin which could not be effectively removed from the red cells
  simply by multiple washing and centrifuging. In addition to the
  work on shape changes in erythrocytes, my PhD thesis work
  involved additional studies on the electrophoresis of the cells
  under various conditions and on other aspects of the physical
  chemistry of erythrocyte membranes.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1939 at the invitation of Ponder, with whom I
  had extensive correspondence during the year and who had become
  in effect the major advisor for my PhD thesis research, I
  returned to Cold Spring Harbor to continue research on red blood
  cells. To earn my room and board, I waited on tables in the
  communal dining room. I also was able to attend the symposium
  talks of that year, which were on the subject of biological
  oxidations. There I first became aware of the new developments in
  oxidative energy metabolism and the importance of high energy
  phosphate compounds. Among the many outstanding biochemists
  attending were L. Michaelis, <a href="../1953/index.html">Fritz
  Lipmann</a> and <a href="../1947/index.html">Carl Cori</a>.
  Ponder and his young wife Ruth were very hospitable to me. I was
  much impressed with his skill in applying mathematics in his
  research, his facility in scientific writing, and his large
  collection of records of classical music.<br>
  <br>
  I was able to complete and defend my thesis in time to receive
  the Ph.D. degree in June of 1940. Earlier that spring I had
  attended the annual meeting of the Federation of American
  Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) in New Orleans. I had
  fortunately been asked by Henry Tauber, an Austrian biochemist
  working for a pharmaceutical firm in Chicago, to share the
  driving in his car on the round trip to New Orleans as well as
  his room in a rundown hotel in New Orleans. Thus, I was able to
  attend this meeting at very little expense. At the FASEB meeting
  in New Orleans, where gatherings of participants were still
  called "smokers" and even a fancy meal was not more than two
  dollars, I had some interviews with persons about possible
  post-doctoral jobs. One of the interviews was with Dr. Ephraim
  Shorr, an Associate Professor of Medicine at Cornell University
  Medical School in New York City, whom I had met at Cold Spring
  Harbor the summer before. A few weeks later Shorr offered me a
  postdoctoral position in his laboratory. Although I was hoping to
  get a position which would allow me to continue work on physical
  chemistry of proteins or cell membranes, none came through, and I
  accepted the position with Shorr, with the understanding that I
  would begin in September.<br>
  <br>
  The reason for waiting until September to begin work at Cornell
  was because I wanted to spend one more summer at the Biological
  Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor. This time, however, I went
  there as an invited speaker at the symposium which that summer
  was on the topic of permeability of cell membranes. My talk was
  entitled "Observations on the structure of red cell ghosts." At
  that symposium, there were again a number of established
  distinguished scientists like K.S. Cole, Robert Chambers and F.O.
  Schmitt; and in addition, a number of bright young scientists
  like Hans Neurath, who had also been at the 1938 symposium, Hugh
  Davson, who with Danielli had developed the lipid bilayer
  membrane model, and Benjamin Zweifach, with whom I was to
  collaborate later in research.<br>
  <b><br>
  Cornell University Medical College (1940-1949)</b><br>
  I stayed at Cornell University Medical College working in the
  laboratory of' Ephraim Shorr for nine years. When I arrived, Sam
  Barker, a young research associate, was there to instruct me in
  methods and procedures they were using to study tissue metabolism
  (largely using Warburg manometers) and the turnover of rather
  ill-defined tissue organic phosphate fractions from canine
  cardiac muscle during incubations <i>in vitro.</i> For such
  studies the lab was one of the first to use radioactive
  phosphate, which we obtained from the cyclotron laboratory at
  Berkeley. Barker left toward the end of my first year at Cornell;
  and I was then responsible for running the laboratory for Shorr.
  Shorr himself, would sometimes take part in preparing tissue for
  the Warburg experiments. He was quite capable in the laboratory
  in addition to being a busy and excellent clinician.<br>
  <br>
  During my first two years at Cornell, my major project was on
  phosphate exchange and turnover, using radioactive phosphate and
  slices of dog left ventricular muscle. A full paper on the work
  was published in the journal of Biological Chemistry in 1943. The
  methods and equipment we used in that work have long been
  superseded, but we did manage with chemical and some early
  enzymatic methods to show the extremely fast turnover of
  creatinine phosphate and the terminal phosphate of ATP in resting
  cardiac muscle.<br>
  <br>
  The 1943 paper was my first full publication after three years of
  work at Cornell. One likely reason for sparse output was that the
  United States had entered World War II in December of 1941, and
  Shorr, like many others, began to undertake research that had
  more relevance to the war effort. With government and other
  support, he shifted the major research in the lab to circulatory
  shock - first on changes in tissue energy metabolism resulting
  from hypoxia associated with hemorrhagic shock, and then mainly
  on factors that might account for "irreversible" shock, the
  condition in which restoration of blood volume is no longer able
  to raise pressure and sustain life in the animal subjected to
  maintained low blood pressure as a result of controlled
  hemorrhage. To help in this new line of research, Shorr recruited
  Benjamin Zweifach, then a bright young physiologist who had
  trained with Robert Chambers and had developed a beautiful method
  for microscopic observation of blood flow in part of the
  mesentery (the "mesoappendix" area) of the anesthetized rat. In
  brief, the "rat mesoappendix test", conducted by Zweifach and
  technicians whom he trained, produced evidence by 1944 for two
  vasoactive factors in circulatory shock. The first factor
  appeared in the plasma of dogs in the early reversible (by
  transfusion) stage of hemorrhage. Intravenous injections of this
  plasma increased the sensitivity of the small arterioles and
  pre-capillary sphincters to topically applied epinephrine in the
  mesoappendix test. This factor was termed VEM (for vasoexcitatory
  materials). As the irreversible stage of circulatory shock
  developed, VEM activity disappeared from the plasma and a new
  factor appeared which markedly decreased the sensitivity to
  epinephrine in the mesoappendix test. This factor was termed VDM
  (for vasodepressor material). We developed evidence, in part from
  <i>in vitro</i> experiments with tissue slices, that hypoxic
  kidney was the probable source of VEM and that hypoxic liver was
  the probable source of VDM. By late 1945, these developments led
  to a lead article in the journal <i>Science</i> by Shorr,
  Zweifach and myself.<br>
  <br>
  During the war years, I was not solely involved in research on
  tissue metabolism and circulatory shock. In 1943, Eugene DuBois,
  chairman of the Department of Physiology at Cornell, arranged
  that I join his department as an instructor in order to replace a
  staff member lost to military service. Although I was teaching in
  physiology, I still spent most of my time in research in Shorr's
  lab, which was partially funded by the federal Office of
  Scientific Research and Development. The work on VEM and VDM
  continued after the war ended. I had attempted to isolate the
  VEM-like material that accumulated in incubation fluid when
  kidney slices were incubated anaerobically. I was able to
  concentrate it somewhat and it appeared to be a labile dialyzable
  peptide, but I failed to isolate it. On the other hand, Abraham
  Mazur, a professor of biochemistry at the City College of New
  York who worked part time with us, purified a VDM-like
  material from liver which appeared to be ferritin. (Ferritin or
  not, we might now wonder whether VDM could somehow be related to
  nitric oxide!)<br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, the only bioassay procedure for detecting VEM and
  VDM activity was that involving changes in sensitivity to
  epinephrine in the rat mesoappendix test. Intravenous injections
  of solutions containing high levels of impure VEM or purified
  ferritin did not effect blood pressure in experimental animals.
  Attempts to develop an <i>in vitro</i> bioassay system also
  failed. These failures tempered my enthusiasm, and I think that
  of Zweifach, for the significance of VEM and VDM in the
  regulation of circulation. However, the failed attempts to
  develop an <i>in vitro</i> bioassay for VEM and VDM were very
  important for me for they introduced me to the pharmacology of
  smooth muscle, a subject that has been a major interest of mine
  ever since.<br>
  <br>
  Two of the isolated smooth muscle preparations that I
  unsuccessfully tested for bioassay of VEM and VDM were a
  helically-cut strip of rabbit aorta, which responded with
  contraction to epinephrine, and a longitudinal segment of rabbit
  duodenum, which exhibited spontaneous rhythmic contractions that
  were inhibited by epinephrine and stimulated by acetylcholine. At
  that time, contractions of such smooth muscle preparations
  mounted in organ baths were recorded with isotonic levers on
  kymographs. One day in the course of making tests on segments of
  rabbit duodenum mounted in oxygenated Krebs solution, I was
  surprised to see that during the first hours of the experiment,
  contraction amplitude did not stabilize as usual but declined
  gradually and markedly even though the rhythmic frequency
  remained unchanged. I suspected that my technician had forgotten
  to add glucose to the Krebs solution. Adding glucose now quickly
  increased contraction amplitude to the normal level. This finding
  led to a simple procedure for finding out what sugars and fatty
  acids could be utilized for energy for contraction in the
  intestinal smooth muscle under aerobic and anaerobic conditions
  and to analyze the sites of action of metabolic inhibitors.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1949, 1 had two interesting offers at the
  assistant professorship level - one in physiology at Duke and one in
  pharmacology at Washington University School of Medicine. I
  decided on Washington University, partly because the new chairman
  there, Oliver Lowry, was someone I had known in the Enzyme Club
  in New York City and partly because I had begun to be very
  interested in pharmacology as a discipline. This was partly
  because of the studies I had begun on the effects of drugs and
  other agents on smooth muscle preparations <i>in vitro,</i> but
  also in large part because of my close friendship with Walter
  Riker, who was then a junior member in the Pharmacology
  Department at Cornell at the beginning of a distinguished career.
  His enthusiasm for research in pharmacology was contagious.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1949, my family and I drove from New York to St.
  Louis. My wife, Lenore, a native New Yorker, said she felt like
  she was going West in a covered wagon. By that time we had two
  daughters, ages four and one. Later we had a third daughter born
  in St. Louis. It might be noted here that none of my daughters
  became scientists. Instead, they all went into art (like my
  younger brother, Max). It might also be noted here that my wife
  Lenore died in 1983; and that now I have a new wife, Margaret
  (Maggie). I have been very fortunate in having wives who
  encouraged my work, even though it often reduced the time I could
  give to family matters.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Washington University (1949-1956)</b><br>
  My seven years in the Pharmacology Department at Washington
  University were enjoyable ones. Oliver (Ollie) Lowry had been
  appointed chairman of that department a year or so before I came.
  He was already well recognized for his ingenuous methods
  involving enzymology , spectrometry and fluorometry in the
  quantitative analysis of important enzymes, substrates and
  products in extremely small amounts of tissue. He was very
  helpful in introducing me to enzymatic-spectroscopic methods (as
  developed by kalckar) for analysis of ATP, ADP and AMP. As a new
  chairman, Lowry inherited two faculty members, Helen Graham and
  Edward Hunter, and recruited two new ones, namely myself and
  Morris (Morrie) Friedkin. I had never had a course in
  pharmacology as a student, much less taught in one, and so I had
  to spend a lot of time during my first year in St. Louis keeping
  ahead of the medical students. Later, when I set up my own
  department in Brooklyn, I adopted for the pharmacology course
  there much of the lecture, laboratory and conference program that
  I had participated in at St. Louis.<br>
  <br>
  Lowry's department was a stimulating place for research. Over the
  years I was there, the departmental staff grew steadily. Lowry
  attracted outstanding postdoctoral fellows, such as Eli Robbins
  and Jack Strominger. We often joined the members of Carl Cori's
  Biochemistry Department for seminars and journal club
  meetings.<br>
  <br>
  My first research project at Washington University was a
  continuation of the work I had begun at Cornell on
  energy-metabolism and function of rabbit intestinal smooth
  muscle. I was able to obtain a small grant to support my research
  on smooth muscle, and to hire a technician, Marilyn (Wales)
  McCaman, who later became my first graduate student. By the
  middle of 1951, my favorite <i>in vitro</i> smooth muscle
  preparation had shifted from the rabbit duodenum to the rabbit
  thoracic aorta. I had found that the helical (spiral) strip of
  that vessel, properly cut and mounted in organ chambers for
  isotonic recording, gave very reproducible contractions to
  epinephrine and norepinephrine after equilibration in oxygenated
  Krebs bicarbonate solution. I had at first planned to study the
  effects of disturbances in energy-metabolism on these
  contractions, but I became much more interested in using the
  aortic strip for studies on drug-receptor interactions.<br>
  <br>
  By 1953, I had published a paper entitled "Reactions of strips of
  rabbit aorta to epinephrine, isoproterenol, sodium nitrite and
  other drugs". Among the other drugs was acetylcholine. I found
  that it only produced contractions, whether it was added to
  resting strips or strips precontracted with some other agent.
  That was a paradoxical response since acetylcholine was known to
  be a very potent vasodilator <i>in vivo.</i> Little did I suspect
  then what I was able to show many years later - namely, that
  relaxation of arteries by acetylcholine is strictly
  endothelium-dependent, and that my method of preparing the strips
  inadvertently resulted in the mechanical removal of all the
  endothelial cells.<br>
  <br>
              In 1954, I published a paper on the use of dibenamine in differentiating 
              receptors in the aortic strip, and in 1955 a review in Pharmacological 
              Reviews on the pharmacology of vascular smooth muscle. In that review, 
              I tried to develop receptor theory as a logical base for interpreting 
              the responses of vascular smooth muscle to many neuro transmitters, 
              hormones and drugs. In order to derive equations to account for 
              the very slow onset and offset kinetics of competitive antagonists 
              as compared to the fast kinetics of agonists, I developed a biophase 
              model in which the agents moved between an aqueous extracellular 
              phase and a lipid membrane phase containing the receptors. Although 
              I paid homage in my review to A. J. Clark for his pioneering work 
              in developing receptor theory, I took issue with his hypothesis 
              that response of a tissue to an agonist is proportional to the fraction 
              of receptors occupied by the agonist. Our results with dibenamine, 
              which behaved as an irreversible competitive blocking agent of adrenergic 
              <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig1.gif" width=
  "13" height="14" alt="alpha"></sub>-receptors, had indicated that with a strong 
              agonist like epinephrine, one could still achieve well over half 
              of the maximum contraction when only a small fraction of receptors 
              were still active. This was the beginning of my interest in the 
              concept of "receptor reserve" or "spare receptors." (A year later, 
              R.P. Stephenson published his classic paper on the subject in which 
              he introduced the concepts of efficacy, full agonist and partial 
              agonist.)<br>
  <br>
  In the review of 1955, I also briefly reported on a newly
  discovered phenomenon - namely, that strips of rabbit aorta
  undergo reversible relaxation when exposed to light of proper
  wavelength and intensity. This photorelaxation was an accidental
  discovery that came from the observation that in one experiment
  active contractile tone of two strips in one pair of organ
  chambers fluctuated with time, whereas that of two strips in
  another pair of chambers remained steady. The two strips showing
  fluctuations did so synchronously. Those two strips, but not the
  other two, were in organ chambers near a window through which
  they were exposed to skylight. Suspecting that the fluctuations
  in tone were due to fluctuations in light intensity on the strips
  near the window (it was a cloudy-bright day), I closed the shade
  on the window and both strips increased in tone. I opened the
  shade and both decreased in tone. From that point on, we never
  allowed our strips to be exposed to direct skylight. (The usual
  overhead fluorescent lights do not produce photorelaxation.) Some
  studies on the characteristics of photorelaxation were begun in
  St. Louis, and then extended when I moved to Brooklyn.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to working on <i>in vitro</i> smooth muscle
  preparations at Washington University, I also began what became
  many years of research on the pharmacology of an <i>in vitro</i>
  cardiac muscle preparation - namely the isolated
  electrically-driven right atrium of the guinea pig. In starting
  that work, I had the assistance of a very able technician,
  Taisija De Gubareff. Using chemical and enzymatic methods for
  analysis of creatinine phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP, we showed
  that neither development of "experimental failure" <i>in
  vitro</i> (a steady loss of contractile force over hours) nor
  recovery from failure on addition of a cardiac glycoside was due
  to changes in concentration of these high-energy phosphates. We
  also reported on the effects of anaerobiosis and of a number of
  positive and negative inotropic agents. We collaborated with my
  good friend William Sleator of the Physiology Department in the
  study of changes in cellular action potentials (measured with
  intracellular microelectrodes) associated with the changes in
  contractility of the guinea pig atrium in response to epinephrine
  and acetylcholine, and a number of other inotropic agents.<br>
  <b><br>
  Suny Medical Center in Brooklyn (1956-)</b><br>
  In 1956, I accepted the position of chairman of the new
  Department of Pharmacology at the State University of New York
  (SUNY) College of Medicine at New York City (actually in
  Brooklyn, and later changed in name to SUNY Downstate Medical
  Center and more recently to SUNY Health Science Center at
  Brooklyn). The department had previously been part of a joint
  physiology and pharmacology department headed by Chandler Brooks
  but with the opening of a new, relatively huge (for the time)
  basic science building for the medical school and with good
  financial support from the State University, there was ample room
  and resources for a separate department. From the former joint
  department, I inherited Julius Belford as an associate professor
  and Bernard Mirkin as an assistant professor. For additional
  faculty, I recruited Kwang Soo Lee, Leonard Procita, Lowell
  Greenbaum, Walter Wosilait and Arthur Zimmerman, all in time for
  them to teach our first course for medical students. The
  following year C. Y. Kao joined the staff. Also during the first
  year, we accepted our first graduate students, namely Maurice
  Feinstein, who worked with me, and Arnold Schwartz, who worked
  with Lee. During that year I didn't do much bench work in the
  research lab since most of my time was spent organizing the
  department and learning how to be a chairman. (I never became a
  well-organized administrator and was always poor at delegating
  authority.)<br>
  <br>
  In Brooklyn, I continued research on photorelaxation of blood
  vessels, factors influencing contractility of cardiac muscle,
  peripheral adrenergic mechanisms, and receptor theory and
  mechanisms. Then, about twenty-three years after moving to
  Brooklyn, the research in my laboratory largely shifted to
  endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels. For
  convenience, I shall divide the discussion of research in
  Brooklyn into subsections corresponding to the areas that I have
  listed.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Photorelaxation of Blood Vessels</i><br>
  Helping with this research were Eugene Greenblatt, my first
  postdoctoral fellow, and Stuart Ehrreich, my third graduate
  student. Among other things, we were able to obtain an accurate
  action spectrum (with a peak at 310 nm) for the photorelaxation.
  Later we observed that addition of sodium nitrite to the bathing
  medium greatly sensitized the rabbit aortic strip to
  photorelaxation and shifted the peak of the action spectrum to
  about 355 nm. Ehrreich and I found that many other smooth muscle
  preparations (from stomach, intestine and uterus) which did not
  ordinarily relax in response to radiation did so in the presence
  of inorganic nitrite. Percy Lindgren, a visiting faculty member
  from the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1998/furchgott-autobio.html&object=ki&to=http://info.ki.se/index_en.html" target="_blank">Karolinska Institute</a>, also worked with us for a
  while on photosensitization by nitrite.<br>
  <br>
  Many years later in the early 1980's, after the discovery of
  endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), I again began
  research on photorelaxation. Although photorelaxation did not
  depend on the presence of endothelium on the strip or ring of
  rabbit aorta, we found many similarities between it and
  endothelium-dependent relaxation (as produced by acetylcholine or
  A23187). Not only was photorelaxation, like endothelium-dependent
  relaxation, causally dependent on the elevation of cyclic GMP as
  a result of stimulation of guanylate cyclase, but both were
  inhibited by hemoglobin and by methylene blue. This work was
  carried out with Desingarao Jothianandan, who has been a most
  helpful research associate in my lab over the past seventeen
  years. Then, after EDRF was identified in 1986 as nitric oxide,
  Kazuki Matsunaga (a postdoctoral fellow) and I reinvestigated the
  potentiation of photorelaxation by sodium nitrite. Using a
  cleverly designed perfusion-bioassay type apparatus, Matsunaga
  clearly demonstrated that the potentiation was due to the
  photoactivated release of NO from nitrite. It is tempting to
  hypothesize that light (in the absence of added nitrite) produces
  relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by photoactivating the
  release of NO from some endogenous compound in the muscle
  cell.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Factors Influencing Contractility of Cardiac Muscle</i><br>
  My first graduate student in Brooklyn, Maurice Feinstein, did his
  Ph.D. thesis research on the effects of experimental congestive
  heart failure, asphyxia and ouabain on high energy phosphates and
  creatine content of the guinea pig heart. My second graduate
  student, Albert Grossman, who began work in 1957, did his thesis
  research on the effects of frequency of stimulation,
  extracellular calcium concentration and various drugs on calcium
  exchange and contractility of the guinea-pig left atrium.
  Grossman and I published three papers based on his thesis
  research, which was one of the first attempts to determine the
  rates of exchange of calcium (using <sup>45</sup>Ca) between
  extracellular fluid and various intracellular "pools" of calcium
  in cardiac muscle under various conditions affecting
  contractility. We showed that the positive inotropic effects of
  norepinephrine and strophanthin-K were correlated with an
  increase in rate of exchange of calcium in an intracellular pool
  associated with the contractile process and that the negative
  inotropic effects of acetylcholine and adenosine were correlated
  with a decrease in rate of exchange in that pool.<br>
  <br>
  We also continued work with ryanodine, which produced a negative
  inotropic effect on the guinea-pig atrium and actually changed
  the force-frequency effect from a positive to negative staircase
  (mimicking the normal staircase in frog heart). Sleator, De
  Gubareff and I had shown that the decrease in force with
  ryanodine (unlike that with acetylcholine or adenosine) was not
  associated with a decrease in duration of the action potential.
  The thesis research of Grossman and a few years later that of
  another graduate student, Peter Wolf, also using <sup>45</sup>Ca
  to measure effects of ryanodine on calcium exchange, led to a
  hypothetical model that fits fairly well with more recent work of
  others on the reactions of ryanodine with "receptors" involved
  with calcium transport in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Peripheral Adrenergic Mechanisms</i><br>
  In writing the 1955 review on the "Pharmacology of vascular
  smooth muscle," I had become very interested in the mechanisms by
  which sympathetic postganglionic denervation and certain drugs
  like cocaine markedly potentiate the response of effector organs
  to epinephrine and norepinephrine, yet markedly reduce the
  response to the sympathomimetic tyramine. My second postdoctoral
  fellow, Sadashiv (Sada) Kirpekar, was assigned to work in this
  area. He proved to be a gifted investigator, and we published a
  number of papers together on work carried out between 1959 and
  1962. In one paper, with the running page heading of "the cocaine
  paradox," we presented evidence that in aortic strips of rabbit
  and isolated electrically-driven atria from guinea pig and cat,
  cocaine potentiated responses to norepinephrine and inhibited
  those to tyramine by blocking one and the same site on adrenergic
  nerve terminals. Blockade of this site inhibited the neuronal
  uptake of no repinephrine from the region of the adrenergic
  receptors, thus potentiating its action; however, blockade of the
  site also inhibited uptake of tyramine, whose sympathomimetic
  action depends on release of norepinephrine from neuronal storage
  sites, thus inhibiting its action. The site, which we called the
  "transfer site" later became known as the uptake-1 (UI) site. In
  the same paper we showed that reserpine, which depleted neuronal
  storage granules of norepinephrine, did not interfere with
  activity of the uptake site. In addition to Kirpekar, Peter
  Cervoni came in as a postdoctoral fellow to work on peripheral
  adrenergic mechanisms. Both he and Kirpekar later became faculty
  members in the department with Kirpekar staying on and becoming a
  stellar figure in the field of adrenergic mechanisms before his
  untimely death in 1983.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960, I was invited to present a paper on some of my studies
  on receptors for sympathomimetic amines at a CIBA Foundation
  conference on Adrenergic Mechanisms held at CIBA House in London.
  It was the occasion for my first trip abroad and was very
  exciting. Among the many distinguished pharmacologists at the
  conference were Sir Henry Dale, Sir John Gaddum and J.H. Burn.
  Burn at that time was pushing his "cholinergic-link" hypothesis
  for norepinephrine release at adrenergic nerve terminals. I felt
  strongly that he had misinterpreted the experimental results
  which had led to the hypothesis and in the discussion sessions I
  presented our own results with isolated atria which indicated
  that there were nicotinic cholinergic receptors on adrenergic
  nerve terminals which when stimulated by nicotine or
  acetylcholine triggered a transient release of norepinephrine,
  but which played no role in release of norepinephrine on
  electrical stimulation of the nerve.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962-63, 1 spent a sabbatical year in the Department of
  Physiology of the University of Geneva, where Jean Posternak was
  chairman. Although I did some research and teaching there, I
  spent most of my time writing papers on research that my
  colleagues and I had completed during the preceding few years and
  on a review on receptor mechanisms (see below). I also visited a
  number of laboratories in Europe where outstanding research on
  adrenergic mechanisms was in progress. Among these were the
  laboratories of <a href="../1970/index.html">S. von Euler</a> in
  Stockholm, E. Muscholl in Mainz and John Gillespie in
  Glasgow.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1965 and 1970 I was fortunate in having a number of very
  competent coworkers in research on peripheral adrenergic
  mechanisms. In addition to Kirpekar, there were Pedro
  Sanchez-Garcia, (a visiting research associate who later became a
  leading pharmacologist in his native Spain), Jerome Levin (a
  postdoctoral fellow) and Arun Wakade (a graduate student who
  later became a faculty member).<br>
  <br>
  In early 1971, I began my second sabbatical leave, this time at
  the relatively new medical school of the University of California
  at San Diego (located in La Jolla). I became a visiting
  professor in Steve Mayer's Pharmacology Division of the
  Department of Medicine. One reason for this choice of a
  sabbatical site was that I wanted to learn the method for
  analysis of cyclic AMP that Mayer had developed (this was before
  the development of radioimmunoassays for cyclic nucleotides).
  However, I did not do a lot of research at La Jolla, partly
  because a fair amount of my time that year was devoted to duties
  as president of the American Society for Pharmacology and
  Experimental Therapeutics.<br>
  <br>
  On returning from La Jolla to Brooklyn in 1972, I continued
  research on the role of receptors located on prejunctional
  terminals (varicosities) of adrenergic nerves. I collaborated
  with Kirpekar in an attempt to characterize the inhibitory
  prejunctional <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig1.gif" width="13"
  height="14" alt="alpha"></sub>-adrenergic receptors on the nerve
  terminals in cat spleen. At the same time, one of my graduate
  students, Odd Steinsland, was conducting a very exciting thesis
  project on cholinergic receptors on prejunctional adrenergic
  nerve terminals in the isolated, perfused central ear artery of
  the rabbit. He first pharmacologically characterized with the use
  of various muscarinic agonists and antagonists the prejunctional
  receptor through which acetylcholine produces a marked inhibition
  of norepinephrine release (monitored by both the degree of
  vasoconstriction and [<sup>3</sup>H]norepinephrine release). He
  then went on to study the release of norepinephrine from the
  adrenergic neurons in the ear artery by cholinergic agonists
  acting on prejunctional nicotinic receptors. At the same time I
  was continuing studies, with the assistance of Taruna Wakade, on
  the pharmacology of cholinergic nicotinic receptors on adrenergic
  prejunctional terminals in the guinea-pig left atrium.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Receptor Theory and Mechanisms</i><br>
  When I first gave a course on receptor theory and mechanisms to
  graduate students in 1957-1958, the literature on the subject was
  relatively sparse: papers by Clark, Gaddum, Schild, Ari&euml;ns,
  Stephenson, Nickerson and myself. I became interested in
  developing suitable theory (occupation theory) and <i>in
  vitro</i> procedures for differentiating and characterizing
  receptors. In particular, I concentrated on receptors for
  adrenergic and cholinergic agents using as test tissues the
  rabbit aortic strip, duodenal segment, and stomach fundus muscle,
  and the guinea-pig electrically driven left atrium and tracheal
  ring.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, toward the end of my sabbatical year at the University
  of Geneva, I completed a review on "Receptor Mechanisms" for
  Volume 4 of the Annual Review of Pharmacology. In it, I took the
  opportunity to stress the importance of Stephenson's ideas on
  efficacy and spare receptors. In 1965 at a symposium on receptor
  mechanisms at Chelsea College in London, I presented a paper on
  the use of <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11"
  height="17" alt="beta"></sub>-haloalkylamines, as irreversible
  receptor antagonists, in the differentiation of receptors and in
  the determination of dissociation constants of receptor-agonist
  complexes. Using a slightly modified form of Stephenson's
  equations and introducing a term, <sub><img src=
  "furchgott-biofig3.gif" width="13" height="14" alt="epsilon"></sub>,
  for intrinsic efficacy, I derived a simple equation that
  predicted that the slope and ordinate intercept of a double
  reciprocal plot of equiactive concentrations of an agonist before
  and after irreversible inactivation of a fraction of its
  receptors, could permit the determination of both the fraction of
  receptors still active as well as the dissociation constant
  (K<sub>A</sub>) of the agonist-receptor complex. For different
  agonists acting on the same receptor, one could calculate from
  the K<sub>A</sub> values the fractional occupation by each to
  obtain the same standard response before receptor inactivation,
  and thus obtain relative efficacies. Using this approach, Paula
  (Bursztyn) Goldberg (a graduate student) and I compared the
  dissociation constants and relative efficacies of agonists acting
  on muscarinic cholinergic receptors of isolated strips of rabbit
  stomach fundus muscle; and later John Besse (a postdoctoral
  fellow) and I compared the dissociation constants and relative
  efficacies of agonists acting on <sub><img src=
  "furchgott-biofig1.gif" width="13" height="14" alt=
  "alpha">1</sub>-adrenergic receptors of rabbit aorta. In light of
  what is now known about receptor signalling pathways through
  G-proteins, it is probably better to admit that the
  pharmacological procedure which we developed for obtaining
  agonist-receptor dissociation constants can only give approximate
  relative values. Nevertheless, the procedure has proven useful in
  a number of studies.<br>
  <br>
  In 1972, I published a review entitled "The classification of
  adrenoceptors (adrenergic receptors). An evaluation from the
  standpoint of receptor theory". In it I attempted to formulate
  the methods and necessary conditions for the classification and
  differentiation of receptors by pharmacological procedures
  designed to give accurate dissociation constants of competitive
  antagonists, acting on a given receptor, and accurate relative
  potencies and, if possible, dissociation constants of agonists
  acting on the same receptor. In particular, I attempted to point
  out pitfalls in such procedures and how to avoid them. For
  example, I derived theoretical equations to illustrate how
  removal of the agonist from the region of the receptor by active
  uptake or enzymatic destruction could markedly alter the slope of
  a Schild plot for competitive antagonism from the theoretical
  slope of 1. Later, Aaron Jurkiewicz, a visiting research
  associate from Sao Paulo, Niede Jurkiewicz and I successfully
  used these theoretical equations in the analysis of propranolol
  antagonism to isoproterenol in guinea-pig tracheal strips before
  and after blockade of removal of the agonist by active
  uptake.<br>
  <br>
  In 1977, I organized for the annual FASEB meeting a symposium on
  receptors. By then binding of radioligands (usually
  <sup>3</sup>H-labelled competitive antagonists) had been used for
  several years for quantifying specific receptors in membranes
  from homogenized cells and for determining the dissociation
  constants of competitive antagonists and agonists for those
  receptors. Most of the papers at the symposium were reports of
  studies with radioligands (e.g., R. J. Lefkowitz on both
  <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig1.gif" width="13" height="14" alt="alpha"></sub>-and <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11"
  height="17" alt="beta"></sub>-adrenergic receptors; P. Seeman on
  dopamine receptors; S. Snyder and colleagues on serotonin
  receptors and opiate receptors). My paper at the symposium was
  partly a discussion of how pharmacological procedures for
  differentiating and characterizing receptors based on occupation
  theory were still very useful in conjunction with the exciting
  new developments in receptor research being made with specific
  radioligands.<br>
  <br>
  Also, I reviewed work that had been carried out in my laboratory
  on <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17"
  alt="beta"></sub>-adrenergic receptors mediating relaxation of
  guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle, and presented results of
  pharmacological experiments that showed that this smooth muscle
  did not have exclusively the <sub><img src=
  "furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt=
  "">2</sub>-type of the <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif"
  width="11" height="17" alt="beta"></sub>-adrenergic receptor, as
  dogma of that time would have it, but had an admixture of the
  <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt="beta">1</sub>-type as well - usually as a small fraction of the
  total of <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height=
  "17" alt="beta"></sub>-receptors, but, depending on the guinea-pig
  used, sometimes much more.<br>
  <i><br>
  Endo Thelium-dependent Relaxation</i><br>
  Having obtained pharmacological evidence that guinea-pig tracheal
  smooth muscle sometimes has a sizeable fraction of the
  <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt="beta">1</sub>-type adrenergic receptor along with the
  <sub><img src="furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt="beta">2</sub>-type (see above), I decided that it would be well to
  reexamine the smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta to see if it
  also might have varying amounts of the <sub><img src=
  "furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt="beta">1</sub>-type receptor mixed with the <sub><img src=
  "furchgott-biofig2.gif" width="11" height="17" alt="beta">2</sub>-type. However, in the very first experiment designed
  for this new study in May 1978, an accidental finding as a result
  of a technician's error completely changed the course of research
  in my laboratory. The accidental finding was that on the
  preparation of rabbit aorta being used in the experiment, the
  muscarinic agents acetylcholine and carbachol induced relaxation
  rather than the expected contraction. Why this accidental finding
  was so exciting, how it led to our discovery of the
  endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), and how that factor
  was eventually identified as nitric oxide will not be discussed
  here since those matters will be considered in detail in my Nobel
  Lecture.<br>
  <br>
  In 1982, I resigned from the chairmanship of the Department of
  Pharmacology at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, but continued
  as a professor. In 1989, I retired from my professorship
  (receiving emeritus status), so that I now was free of teaching
  duties and committee work related to the medical curriculum but
  could still continue research in the department. My retirement
  also now allowed me to spend about three and a half months each
  winter as an adjunct Professor in the Department of Molecular and
  Cellular Pharmacology of the University of Miami School of
  Medicine. Most of my time there I have spent trying to catch up
  on the writing of manuscripts and on the reading of the
  burgeoning literature in the field of nitric oxide research - an
  impossible task these days! During the winter sojourns in Miami,
  I keep in touch with what is going on in my research laboratory
  in Brooklyn by means of an occasional visit, but mainly by
  frequent fax and telephone communications with my one or two
  coworkers there. I consider myself very fortunate in having this
  Brooklyn-Miami arrangement. Of course, an additional advantage
  for my wife Maggie and me is that the arrangement allows us to
  enjoy the very pleasant winter weather in Miami and some of the
  outdoor activities that it fosters (golf, for instance, in my
  case).<br>
  <br>
  From 1982 until the present writing, I have been the recipient of
  a number of honors and awards for my research. Naturally, I have
  been very pleased to be the recipient. Yet, in thinking back
  about what aspects of my research have given me the greatest
  pleasure, I would not place the honors and awards first. I think
  that my greatest pleasure has come from each first demonstration
  in my laboratory that experiments designed to test a new
  hypothesis developed to explain some earlier, often puzzling or
  paradoxical finding, have given results consistent with the
  hypothesis. It is not just the immediate pleasure of obtaining
  such results but also the anticipated pleasure of discussing the
  results with others doing research in the same area - obviously
  an ego supportive aspect.<br>
  <br>
  I still enjoy doing bench work in the laboratory with my
  co-workers. The research still is rather "old fashion"
  pharmacological research. I was very lucky to stumble on
  unexpected results in 1978 that led to the finding of
  endothelium-dependent relaxation and EDRF, and eventually to NO;
  for if I had not, I would probably have still concentrated on
  research on receptor theory and mechanisms, and been left far
  behind by others in that field who have so brilliantly and
  successfully developed and used molecular biological and other
  advanced methodologies in their research.</p>
