  <h1>Stanley Cohen - Biographical</h1> 
<p><img src="cohen.jpg" class="bio-img">

 I was born in Brooklyn in 1922. Both my mother and father 
              were Russian Jewish emigrants who came to America in the early 1900's. 
              My father was a tailor and my mother, a housewife. Though of limited 
              education themselves, they instilled in me the values of intellectual 
              achievement and the use of whatever talents I possessed.<br>
              <br>
              I was educated in the public school system of New York City and 
              was bright enough to be accepted at Brooklyn College. Fortunately 
              for me, my college education was most thorough (I majored in both 
              Biology and Chemistry). Perhaps equally important was the fact that 
              Brooklyn College was a city school and had a policy of no tuition; 
              the cost of an education would have been prohibitive for my parents.<br>
              <br>
              My scientific interests throughout my undergraduate days were directed 
              to cell biology and especially the mysteries of embryonic development. 
              I think my one insight into these problems was the recognition that 
              much could be learned by the application of chemistry to biology.<br>
              <br>
              After working for a short period as a bacteriologist in a milk processing 
              plant to save enough money to go to graduate school, fellowships 
              enabled me to continue my education, first at Oberlin College, where 
              I received an M.A. in Zoology in 1945, and then in the Biochemistry 
              Department at the University of Michigan where I received a Ph.D. 
              in 1948. My Ph.D. thesis concerned the metabolic mechanism by which 
              the end product of nitrogen metabolism in the earthworm is switched 
              from ammonia to urea during starvation. I remember spending my nights 
              collecting over 5,000 worms from the University campus green.<br>
              <br>
              I believe it was my ability to stomach-tube earthworms that convinced 
              Dr. Harry Gordon to offer me my first job in the Pediatrics and 
              Biochemistry Departments of the University of Colorado, where 
              I was involved in metabolic studies of premature infants.<br>
              <br>
              Feeling the need to gain experience with the then emerging application 
              of radioisotope methodology to biological research, I left Colorado 
              and went to Washington University in 1952 to work with Martin Kamen in the 
              Department of Radiology at Washington University as a postdoctoral 
              fellow of the American Cancer Society. I learned isotope methodology 
              while studying carbon dioxide fixation in frog eggs and embryos, 
              and also derived a priceless education participating in the journal 
              club administered by Dr. <a href=
  "../1959/index.html">Arthur Kornberg</a> who had just arrived at Washington 
              University.<br>
              <br>
              In 1953 I became associated with the Department of Zoology under 
              the leadership of Viktor Hamburger at Washington University with 
              a two-fold purpose in mind. I joined with <a href=
  "index.html">Rita Levi-Montalcini</a> to isolate a Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) 
              that Dr. Levi-Montalcini had discovered in certain mouse tumors 
              and to become educated in the field of experimental embryology. 
              I leave it to Dr. Levi-Montalcini, with whom I am honored to share 
              this Nobel Award, to recount the results of our early collaboration.<br>
              <br>
              I came to Vanderbilt University in 1959 as an Assistant Professor in the 
              Biochemistry Department where I have been ever since, exploring 
              the chemistry and biology of epidermal growth factor (EGF) that 
              is the subject of this lecture.<br>
              <br>
              In 1976 I was appointed an American Cancer Society Research Professor 
              and in 1986 Distinguished Professor. The works recognized by this 
              Nobel Prize are clearly a group effort of achievement as may be 
              seen from the names associated with our publications on EGF. They 
              share in this honor. I have received much recognition during my 
              research career and I am most grateful.</p>
