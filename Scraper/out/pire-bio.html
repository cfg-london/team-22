  <h1>Georges Pire - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pire.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Georges
  Charles Clement Ghislain Pire</b> (February 10, 1910-January 30,
  1969), born in Dinant, Belgium, the first child of Georges and
  Berthe (Ravet) Pire, assigned his life to action in striving to
  achieve understanding among peoples of the world, to eliminate
  poverty and hopelessness in the emerging nations, to alleviate
  the lot of the refugees of the post-World War II period. His
  refugee work may well have stirred memories of his own childhood,
  for when he was four and a half, he and his family fled from
  Belgium before the advancing German troops in 1914, spending four
  years in France and returning to find their home a charred
  ruin.<br>
  <br>
  In Dinant where his father was a civic official, Georges Pire
  studied classics and philosophy at the Coll&egrave;ge de Bellevue
  and at eighteen entered the Dominican monastery of La Sarte in
  Huy, Belgium, where he took the name Henri Dominique and said his
  final vows on September 23,1932.<br>
  <br>
  He continued his studies at the Collegio Angelico, the Dominican
  university in Rome, was ordained in 1934, and granted the
  doctorate in theology in 1936. After a year of study in the
  social sciences at the University
  of Louvain in Belgium, he returned to the monastery at Huy to
  teach sociology and moral philosophy.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938, the Reverend Father Pire began his long service of
  organizational work for the unfortunate by founding the Service
  d'entr'aide familiale [Mutual Family Aid] and Stations de plein
  air de Huy [Open Air Camps] for children. During and after World
  War II the stations were more than camps; they were missions that
  fed thousands of Belgian and French children.<br>
  <br>
  Father Pire himself during World War II was chaplain to the
  resistance movement, agent for the intelligence service, and
  participant in the underground escape system that returned downed
  Allied flyers to their own forces. For his services, this man of
  peace was awarded the Military Cross with Palms, the Resistance
  Medal with Crossed Swords, the War Medal, and the National
  Recognition Medal.<br>
  <br>
  Constantly supplementing his duties as cur&eacute; of La Sarte,
  Father Pire decided early in 1949 to study the refugee problem.
  He visited the camps for refugees in Austria, wrote a book, <i>Du
  Rhin au Danube avec 60,000 D. P</i>., and founded an
  organization, Aid to Displaced Persons.<br>
  <br>
  There were three levels of action in Father Pire's work for the
  refugees. There was, first, his &laquo;sponsoring&raquo; movement
  in which interested people could &laquo;sponsor&raquo; a family of
  refugees, sending parcels and letters of encouragement; by 1960
  there were some 18,000 sponsors. On a second level there were his
  homes for the aged, four of them, all situated in Belgium: at Huy
  (1950), Esneux (1951), Aertslaer (1953), and Braine-le-Comte
  (1954).<br>
  <br>
  It was evident, however, that the refugees needed to have the
  opportunity to put down roots, to gain economic independence, to
  achieve psychological wholeness. Consequently, Father Pire
  conceived the idea of building small villages for them, to be
  located on the outskirts of a city where these communities would
  be free to grow, not in the center of a city where they might
  degenerate into ghettoes. Using private contributions from the
  &laquo;hearts of men&raquo;, he constructed seven &laquo;European
  Villages&raquo;, each for about 150 people: at Aix-la-Chapelle,
  Germany (1956); Bregenz, Austria (1956); Augsburg, Germany
  (1957); Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Belgium, (the Fridtjof Nansen
  Village, 1958); Spiesen in the Saar (the Albert Schweitzer
  Village, 1958); Wuppertal, Germany (the Anne Frank Village,
  1959); Euskirchen, Germany (1962). All seven of these villages
  still exist, each now housing about twenty D. P. families.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957, Aid to Displaced Persons, the organization charged with
  executive authority in carrying out activities on behalf of the
  refugees, became Aid to Displaced Persons and European Villages,
  an international charitable association, with self-governing
  sections in ten European states. The funds spent by this
  organization on activities for the relief of refugees in 1958 and
  in later years were raised by a continuous crusade called Europe
  of the Heart, a crusade aimed at the hearts of all men regardless
  of religious, national, racial, and linguistic barriers.<br>
  <br>
  After winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Father Pire pursued more
  aggressively a worldwide application of effort. Beginning June 5,
  1959, the crusade was henceforth carried on by an official
  organization known as The Heart Open to the World. Its program is
  both abstract and concrete, welding human attitudes and specific
  actions. The objective is international fraternity; the technique
  is that of &laquo;fraternal dialogue&raquo;; the agencies are the
  University of Peace, World Friendships, World Sponsorships, and
  Islands of Peace.<br>
  <br>
  Father Pire founded the University of Peace at Huy in 1960 and by
  1965 had completed a major building, with dormitory space for
  fifty, a large conference room and several small ones, kitchen
  and dining facilities. The University is open to anyone who
  wishes to devote himself to constructive work for peace. He may
  enroll in &laquo;long sessions,&raquo; of two weeks held in the
  summer or in &laquo;short sessions&raquo; of two days scheduled
  throughout the year, or even in individual sessions to hear
  lectures given in four languages - French, English, German, and
  Dutch - and to participate in face-to-face fraternal dialogue.
  About 4,000 people from forty countries have taken part in the
  sessions of the University.<br>
  <br>
  World Friendships is an agency that encourages fraternal dialogue
  carried on at a distance by correspondence between people of
  different heritages. About 6,500 are enrolled in this program.
  World Sponsorships enables people to sponsor, with material help,
  refugee families in Africa or in Asia. This program, emphasizing
  education of children and adolescents, now has about 400 enrolled
  sponsors or &laquo;godparents&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  After a Pakistan visit in 1960, Father Pire inaugurated a new
  venture that would combine local self-help with private
  international aid in order to increase food production, improve
  medical services, and develop educational and recreational
  programs. His idea was to select a rural area made up of several
  villages, to encourage the people of the area to form
  organizations that would require intervillage collaboration for
  specified purposes, to provide these organizations with outside
  technical experts and some material aid, to devise plans of
  action with targets to be reached in five or six years, and
  finally, at the end of the specified period, to turn over the
  entire program to the initiative of the local inhabitants. The
  first of these ventures, running from 1962 to 1967, was at Gohira
  in East Pakistan; the second, begun in 1969, is a six-year
  program at Kalakkad, near the southern point of the Indian land
  mass. Father Pire called these programs Islands of Peace.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his thirty-two years of work for peace and human
  dignity, Father Henri Dominique Pire lived simply in the
  monastery at Huy, discharging his religious duties and continuing
  to lecture. He died at fifty-eight at Louvain Roman Catholic
  Hospital on January 30, 1969, of complications following
  surgery.</p>
