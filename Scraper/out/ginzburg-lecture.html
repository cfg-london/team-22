Ginzburg held his Nobel Lecture December 8, 2003, at Aula Magna, Stockholm University. He was presented by Professor Mats Jonson, Chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics.<br/><br/>Summary: Influenced by Lev Landau, Ginzburg&#039;s theoretical work on superconductivity began in 1943. His theoretical work including phase transitions, effective charge, pairing and critical field is described. A turning point was the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity which created great interest. Ginzburg stressed that work is still needed to understand thermoelectric effects. The inspiring lecture ends with Ginzburg persuading physicists to have a broad view of physics, and stating that every physicist should know about his list of the 30 most important problems in physics. </p></div>
