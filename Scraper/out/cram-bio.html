  <h1>Donald J. Cram - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cram.jpg" class="bio-img">The beginning is distant, and was a time
  when we as a people were without much of the fruits of science
  that now refine our lives. But it was also a good time, when
  family and town were the domain of our existence. My father of
  Scottish, and mother of German extraction, migrated with their
  three children from Ontario, Canada, to rural Chester, Vermont,
  USA, where I was born in the spring of 1919, as the Cram's fourth
  and only male child. Two years later, the family moved to
  Brattleboro, Vermont.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Joanna, was high-spirited throughout her 94 years,
  starting with a girlhood rebellion against the strict Mennonite
  faith in which she was raised. My father, William, was a
  romantic, a cavalry officer, later working alternately as a
  successful lawyer and unsuccessful farmer. He died of pneumonia
  at 53, leaving my mother with a set of Victorian upper-class
  English values, and the task of providing for and raising my
  sisters and me, then aged four.<br>
  <br>
  According to my oldest sister, Elizabeth, I was as a child
  precocious, curious, and constantly in, or causing, trouble. This
  character trait started at birth; I weighed over ten pounds, and
  had an unusually large head! Determined to walk at seven months,
  I pulled a pan of fresh eggs down from a table onto that head. At
  three years, I broke my first window. My father took me directly
  to our neighbor, Mr. Mason, to apologize. Reputedly, I said to
  him, "Sorry, you nasty Mason".<br>
  <br>
  By the time I was four and a half, I was reading children's
  books. My mother, steeped in English literature, cultivated
  incentive by reading to me only the <i>beginnings</i> of tales
  that involved heroes, heroines, hypocrites, and villains. When we
  reached the exciting part, she left me with the story to finish
  by myself. My childhood was adventuresome and idyllic in the
  things that mattered.<br>
  <br>
  Elementary schooling for me was series of multiclass single-room
  buildings, where the young and very young witnessed each other
  being taught. On report card days, I faced searching questions
  and criticism during which "character grades" were stressed over
  academic accomplishments. I usually was marked "A" in attitude
  and accomplishment, "B" in effort, and "C" in obedience.<br>
  <br>
  What I call my real <i>education</i> occurred principally outside
  of the classroom, in a private world of books and brooks. All of
  Dickens, Kipling, Scott, Shaw, and much of Shakespeare were read.
  I learned how to run up spring-fed brooks, jumping from one
  glacier-polished stone to another. I carried firewood, emptied
  ashes, and shoveled snow for music lessons. I picked apples to be
  paid in apples, strawberries to be paid in strawberries; and I
  moved the lawns of a large estate belonging to the dentist who
  filled my cavities and pulled my teeth.<br>
  <br>
  The rate of exchange of my time for his was fifty to one. During
  the Christmas rush, I sold ties, shirts, shoes, gloves, and
  jackets in return for the same. By the time I was fourteen, my
  mother's barter arrangements were replaced by a flat fee of 15
  cents an hour working for neighbors, raking leaves, hoeing corn,
  digging potatoes, pitching hay, and delivering newspapers. The
  last job taught me about debts, dogs, and bicycle bags.<br>
  <br>
  At sixteen, I left my home in Brattleboro, Vermont, a handsome
  old town on the Connecticut River. By then I had learned how to
  adapt to eighteen different employers, and had played high school
  varsity tennis, football, and ice hockey. I also had my full
  growth of 195 pounds, and was 6 feet tall.<br>
  My family dispersed at that time, and I drove two elderly ladies
  to Florida in a Model-A Ford, without benefit of a license, and
  in return for transportation. Stopping at Lake Worth, Florida, I
  worked in an ice-cream shop and weeded lawns in return for room
  and board. There, I continued my secondary schooling while
  suffering an acute case of homesickness for New England. Nine
  months later, I hitchhiked north again to Massachusetts, and
  passed the summer as a house painter and roofer. My twelfth grade
  was spent at Winwood, a little private school on Long Island, New
  York, working as a factotum for my tuition and board. While
  there, I did three things significant to my future. I took a
  course in chemistry, taught myself solid geometry from a book,
  and won a $6,000 four-year National Rollins College Honor
  Scholarship.<br>
  <br>
  While at Rollins, in the resort town of Winter Park, Florida, I
  worked at chemistry and played at philosophy (four courses!). I
  read Dostoevski, Spengler, and Tolstoy, and sang in the choir and
  in a barbershop quartet. In four halcyon years, I obtained an
  airplane pilot's license, acted in plays, produced-announced a
  minor radio program, and, while my fellow students complained,
  dined on the best food I had yet encountered.<br>
  <br>
  During the summers of 1938 to 1941, I worked for the National
  Biscuit Company in New York City, at first as a salesman covering
  an area from 144th Street to 78th Street on the tough East Side.
  The largest city in the country was also its best teacher. This
  was my first exposure to ghetto slums, youth gang warfare, drugs,
  prostitution, and petty thievery. The northern end of my
  territory was dominated by Jewish delicatessens, out of which at
  first (but not later) I was urged to leave. I got to know
  everybody, and everybody's business. In the Irish-run grocery
  stores, we would conduct "wakes" for the last fig bar in the bin.
  Harlem was a place where each street was a playground, and each
  store a small fort. The Puerto Rican district was full of street
  vendors of all sorts. I started that summer weighing 195 pounds,
  and ended it at 155. My $ 15 per week provided me with cash, and
  a crash course in ethnic groups and big city street-life. The
  other summers involved analyzing cheeses for moisture and fat
  content in the National Biscuit Laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  From these routine jobs, I extracted pleasure by making them into
  games. They taught me self-discipline, and illustrated how I did
  not want to spend my life. But this period provided me with a
  keen interest in the differences between people, and an
  overwhelming dislike of repetitive activities. When the word
  "research" entered my vocabulary, it had a magic ring, suggesting
  the search for new phenomena. Chemical research became my god,
  and the conducting of it, my act of prayer, from 1938 to the
  present. When told by my first college chemistry professor, Dr.
  Guy Waddington, that he thought I would make a good industrial
  investigator - but probably not a good academic one - I
  determined upon an academic research career in chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Out of 17 applications for teaching assistantships to go to
  graduate school, three offers came. I accepted the University of Nebraska's, where an MS was granted in
  1942. My thesis research there was done under the supervision of
  Dr. Norman O. Cromwell. By then, World War II was upon us, so I
  went to work for Merck &amp; Co., ultimately on their penicillin
  project, where my search for excellence was symbolized by Dr. Max
  Tishler. Immediately after the war ended in 1945, Max arranged
  for me to attend Harvard University, working for Professor L.F.
  Fieser. The work for my Ph.D. degree on a National Research
  Council Fellowship was in hand in eighteen months.<br>
  <br>
  At Harvard, scientific excellence was personified for me by
  Professors Paul D. Bartlett and Robert B. Woodward. After three
  months at M.I.T., working for Professor John D. Roberts, I set
  out for the University of California at Los Angeles on August 1,
  1947, and have taught and researched there ever since, after 1985
  as the S. Winstein Professor of Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In retrospect, I judge that my father's death early in my life
  forced me to construct a model for my character composed of
  pieces taken from many different individuals, some being people I
  studied, and others lifted from books. The late Professor Saul
  Winstein, my colleague, friend, and competitor, contributed much
  to this model. It was almost complete by the time I was 35 years
  of age. Thus, through the early death of my father, I had an
  opportunity - indeed the necessity - to animate that father image
  that was slowly maturing in my mind's eye. And, at last, I
  realized who in fact this figure was. It was I.<br>
  <br>
  The times and environment have been very good to me during my
  forty-six years of chemical research. I entered the profession at
  a period when physical, organic, and biochemistry were being
  integrated, when new spectroscopic windows on chemical structures
  were being opened, and when UCLA, a fine new university campus,
  was growing from a provincial to a world-class institution. My
  over 200 co-workers have shared with me the miseries of many
  failures and the pleasures of some triumphs. Their careers are my
  finest monument. My countrymen have supported our research
  without mandating its character. Jean Turner Cram, as my first
  wife, sacrificed for my career from 1940 to 1968. Dr. Jane
  Maxwell Cram, my second wife, acted as foil, unsparing but
  inspiring critic and research strategist in ways beyond
  mention.<br>
  <br>
  My fellow scientists have generously honored my research program
  with three American Chemical Society awards: for Creative Work in
  Synthetic Organic Chemistry; the Arthur C. Cope Award for
  Distinguished Achievement in Organic Chemistry; and the Roger
  Adams Award in Organic Chemistry. Local sections of the same
  society awarded me the Willard Gibbs and Tolman Medals. I was
  elected to membership in the National Academy of Science (1961), to become
  the 1974 California Scientist of the Year, and the 1976 Chemistry
  Lecturer and Medalist of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (UK).
  In 1977, I was given an Honorary Doctor's degree from Sweden's
  Uppsala
  University, and in 1983 a similar one from the University of Southern
  California.<br>
  <br>
  I have contributed directly to the teaching of organic
  chemistry-about 12,000 undergraduate students-and, indirectly, by
  writing three textbooks: Organic Chemistry (with G.S. Hammond;
  translated into twelve languages), Elements of Organic Chemistry
  (with D.H. Richards and G. S. Hammond; three translations), and
  Essence of Organic Chemistry (with J.M. Cram; one translation),
  plus the monograph, "Fundamentals of Carbanion Chemistry" (one
  translation). I enjoy skiing and surfboarding, playing tennis,
  and playing the guitar as an accompaniment to my singing folk
  songs. The award of a Nobel Prize at the age of 68 years was
  ideally timed to enhance rather than divert my research
  career.<br>
  <br>
  In the four years that have elapsed since I shared a Nobel Prize
  in Chemistry (1987), the effect of receiving this honor on my
  life has been profound. Most importantly, the Prize has extended
  my career by enough years to allow me to obtain the most exciting
  results of my 50 years of carrying out research. The Prize has
  also broadened the range of my experiences, most of which have
  been both interesting and educational. Finally, the research
  field of molecular recognition in organic chemistry gained much
  impetus by being recognized by the Nobel Prize. I am grateful
  that our research results were chosen as a vehicle for honoring
  those who know the joys of carrying out organic chemical
  research.</p>
