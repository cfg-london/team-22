  <h1>Ryoji Noyori - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="noyori.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  September 3, 1938 in a suburb of Kobe (now Ashiya), Japan, the
  first son of Kaneki and Suzuko Noyori. Our family moved to Kobe
  soon afterwards. I grew up with two younger brothers and a sister
  in a pleasant city blessed by beautiful natural surroundings.
  Except for a short period at the end of World War II, I attended
  an elementary school affiliated to Kobe University
  from ages six to twelve, and then moved on to Nada Middle and
  High School from ages twelve to eighteen. I enjoyed many out-door
  activities in my youth.</p>

  <p>My father, Kaneki, was a gifted research
  director of a chemical company, and his profession strongly
  influenced the path of my life. At home, we were surrounded by
  his scientific journals and books and various samples of plastics
  and synthetic fibers, and were frequently asked to test the
  quality of products which were under development for
  commercialization. When I entered middle school, my father took
  me to a public conference, the topic of which was "nylon". The
  lecturer explained proudly that this new fiber could be
  synthesized from coal, air, and water (the then famous
  catchphrase of DuPont company). Although I knew nothing about
  industrial technology, I was deeply impressed by the power of
  chemistry. Chemistry can create important things from almost
  nothing! The event had an enormous impact on this 12-year-old
  schoolboy, because it was in 1951, shortly after World War II
  when Japan was so poor. We were very hungry. It was at this point
  that it became my dream to be a leading chemist to contribute to
  the society by inventing beneficial products.</p>

  <p>My appetite for chemistry was further
  wetted through class work led by enthusiastic teachers in
  middle/high school including Dr. Kazuo Nakamoto (then Osaka
  University and afterward Illinois Institute of Technology and Marquette University)
  who gave me my first chemistry lesson. I also liked other
  sciences and mathematics. Together with regular schoolwork,
  "judo" (one of Japan's traditional sports) was a major passion at
  this time. It was very popular amongst us because Nada School and
  Kodokan Judo School were founded by the same family. I highly
  appreciate the educational efforts of many schoolteachers as well
  as the warm friendship of classmates in those days, which
  strongly influenced the formation of my personal character.</p>

  <p>In 1957, at the age of 18, I entered
  Kyoto University, which was known to be the most
  active institution in the research of polymer chemistry.
  Incidentally, this was the year when the USSR launched into space
  for the first time an artificial satellite, the Sputnik, thereby
  demonstrating the power of sciencebased technology. I recall that
  this success substantially shocked young science students in
  Japan. After three years, I started to study organic chemistry,
  rather than polymer chemistry, under the guidance of Professor
  Keiiti Sisido. The laboratory environment was very hospitable and
  I obtained my Bachelor degree in 1961. Upon completion of my
  Master's degree in 1963, I was immediately appointed Instructor
  of Professor Hitosi Nozaki's laboratories at Kyoto University
  and, in 1967, received my doctorate (DEng). My career path, that
  is the appointment to Instructor without a doctorate, is a little
  unusual but this is partly due to the difference in Japanese and
  Western education/teaching systems. Professor Nozaki strongly
  encouraged us to pursue new, original chemistry rather than
  tracing traditional subjects, while I served as a leader of his
  subgroup working on flourishing physical organic chemistry. It
  was under such conditions that in 1966 we discovered an
  interesting asymmetric catalysis that later became a life-long
  interest. This finding emerged during the course of an
  investigation of the transition metal effects in carbene
  reactions. Reaction of styrene and ethyl diazoacetate in the
  presence of a small amount of a chiral Schiff base-Cu(II) complex
  gave optically active cyclopropane derivatives, albeit with
  &lt;10 % ee. Although the enantioselectivity was not
  synthetically meaningful, this was probably the first example of
  asymmetric catalysis using structurally well-defined
  organometallic molecular complexes. In the early 1960s,
  homogeneous catalysis (typically Reppe chemistry) was already
  well known, however, the notion of "molecular catalysis" that
  utilizes the structural and electronic characteristics of
  molecules more positively, was not clearly documented. This
  discovery opened my research perspective. In any event, I
  intended first to expand my scientific background under the
  supervision of an eminent chemist abroad, and Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1990/index.html">E.J. Corey</a> at Harvard kindly
  agreed to accommodate me in his laboratories as a postdoctoral
  fellow. This plan, however, was postponed for reasons outlined
  below.</p>

  <p>The situation changed drastically in the
  fall of 1967, when I received a totally unexpected offer from
  Nagoya University. I was asked to chair a newly
  created organic chemistry laboratory. This invitation surprised
  me. I was a mere 29-year-old Instructor at Kyoto enjoying daily
  research work with some young students. Nothing had prepared me
  to be a Professor at a major national university. Being too young
  and inexperienced to be a Full Professor, I was first appointed
  Associate Professor of Chemistry. In February, 1968, when I
  launched my own research group, Professor Yoshimasa Hirata, a
  senior faculty known for his outstanding accomplishments in
  natural products of organic chemistry, asked me to create a new
  stream of organic chemistry at Nagoya, different from his own
  field, thereby making the Chemistry Department more visible. I
  immediately decided to focus on organic synthesis using
  organometallic chemistry, which then comprised a branch of
  inorganic chemistry. Although not many researchers were aware of
  the high utility in organic synthesis, I was intuitively
  confident of the bright future of this scientific field.
  Professor Hirata consistently helped me in many aspects during
  his time at Nagoya University.</p>

  <p>In 1969, as planned earlier, I went to
  Harvard. I was amazed by the enormous difference in the standard
  of living and science between the US and my mother country.
  Professor Corey was then already a leading organic chemist and I
  learned much from him. In addition, I became acquainted with many
  promising students and postdoctoral fellows including K. Barry
  Sharpless who was working with Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/index.html">Konrad Bloch</a>. Later
  many of these reliable friends, together with their scientific
  relatives, grew to become eminent researchers in the scientific
  community and helped me in many ways. Synthesis of prostaglandins
  (PGs) was my research theme in the Corey group. After completing
  several works, I was asked to selectively hydrogenate a
  PGF<sub>2<font face="Symbol">a</font></sub> derivative that has
  two C = C bonds to a PGF<sub>1<font face="Symbol">a</font></sub>
  compound possessing a single C = C bond. This was the start of my
  three-decade-long work on hydrogenation. My interest in
  homogenous hydrogenation was enhanced by reading almost all
  available literature on this very new topic and also through
  personal interaction with Assistant Professor John A. Osborn, who
  had joined Harvard Chemistry Department from Geoffrey Wilkinson's
  laboratory at Imperial College, London. Osborn, an authority of
  Rh-catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation, taught me many aspects of
  organometallic chemistry. It was in 1968, when W.S. Knowles and
  L. Horner reported independently the first homogeneous asymmetric
  hydrogenation using chiral phosphine-Rh catalyts, albeit in low
  optical yields. The fruitful Harvard experience, coupled with our
  earlier asymmetric cyclopropanation in 1966, led to my life-long
  research on asymmetric hydrogenation.</p>

  <p>After returning to Nagoya in 1970, I began
  to study organic synthesis and homogeneous catalysis via
  organometallic chemistry, while in August 1972, at the age of 33,
  I was promoted to Full Professor. In the hope of development of
  efficient asymmetric hydrogenation and other reactions, we became
  interested in BINAP
  [2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl], a novel
  C<sub>2</sub> chiral diphosphine possessing a beautiful molecular
  shape. Synthesis of the optically pure diphosphine was
  unexpectedly difficult. It was in 1974, that I started
  stereospecific synthesis from optically pure
  2,2'-diamino-1,1'-binaphthyl with my long-term collaborator, the
  late Professor Hidemasa Takaya, who was with me at Nagoya and
  afterwards moved to the Institute of Molecular Science and Kyoto
  University. After two years, we managed to obtain optically
  active BINAP, however, the result was disappointingly
  irreproducible. In 1978, we reached a reliable method for
  resolution of racemic BINAP with a chiral amine-Pd complex.
  Unfortunately, the results of BINAP-Rh(I) catalyzed asymmetric
  hydrogenation of dehydro amino acids were highly variable
  depending on the reaction conditions. Eventually, in 1980 after a
  six-year endeavour, thanks to the unswerving efforts of my young
  colleagues and students, we were able to publish our first work
  on asymmetric synthesis of amino acids via this BINAP
  chemistry.</p>

  <p>The success in our asymmetric hydrogenation
  largely relies on the invention of BINAP and the use of Ru
  element, which behaves differently from conventional Rh. A major
  breakthrough in asymmetric hydrogenation came in 1986, when we
  developed BINAP-Ru(II) dicarboxylate complexes that enjoy a much
  greater scope of olefinic substrates. Furthermore, in 1987-1988,
  179 we developed a versatile general asymmetric hydrogenation of
  functionalized ketones with BINAP-Ru(II) dihalide complexes. The
  scope of this method is far reaching. These asymmetric
  hydrogenation methods allow for the synthesis of a wide array of
  terpenes, vitamins, <font face="Symbol">b</font>-lactam
  antibiotics, <font face="Symbol">a</font>- and <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-amino acids, alkaloids, prostaglandins, and
  other compounds of biological and physiological interest. BINAP
  chemistry has been applied to the large-scale production of the
  synthetic intermediates of antibiotic carbapenems (Takasago
  International Co.) and levofloxacin, a quinolone antibacterial
  agent (Takasago International Co./Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co.).
  The efficiency of BINAP chemistry rivals or in certain cases even
  exceeds that of enzymes. In addition, a team of the Noyori
  Molecular Catalysis Project (ERATO, 1991-1996) discovered the
  catalysts of type RuCl<sub>2</sub>(diphosphine)(diamine) leading
  to another major breakthrough in hydrogenation. The reaction of
  unsaturated ketones occurs preferentially the C = O function
  leaving the olefinic linkage intact. The combined use of the
  BINAP ligand and a chiral diamine effects asymmetric
  hydrogenation of a range of aromatic, hetero-aromatic, and
  olefinic ketones. The reaction is very rapid, productive and
  stereoselective, providing the most practical method for
  converting simple ketones to chiral secondary alcohols.</p>

  <p>BINAP-Rh(I) complexes are useful for
  asymmetric isomerization of allylic amines to enamines of high
  enantiomeric purity. In the early 1980s, a fruitful
  academic/industry collaboration was made between the groups at
  Osaka University (S. Otsuka and H. Tani), Nagoya University,
  Institute of Molecular Science (H. Takaya), Shizuoka
  University (J. Tanaka and K. Takabe), and Takasago
  International Co., realizing the industrial production of
  (-)-menthol and other optically active terpenes.</p>

  <p>In 1995-1996, we invented a range of Ru(II)
  catalysts modified with a chiral <font face=
  "Symbol">b</font>-amino alcohol or 1,2-diamine derivative that
  effects asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones and imines
  using 2-propanol or formic acid as hydrogen donors. More
  recently, the reaction has proven to proceed via a nonclassical
  metal - ligand bifunctional mechanism. My interest in asymmetric
  chemistry is broad. In 1986, we found a highly enantioselecive
  addition of dialkylzincs to aldehydes using a small quantity of a
  camphor-derived chiral amino alcohol, where the alkylation
  products with high enantiomeric excesses are accessible with a
  partially resolved chiral ancillary. We could fully elucidate the
  origin of this striking chiral amplification phenomenon at the
  molecular structure level. My stay at Harvard in 1969-1970
  spurred me to develop an efficient way to synthesize
  prostaglandins (PGs). In this connection, a series of selective
  synthetic methods was explored in our laboratories. Our
  binaphthol-modified lithium aluminum hydride reagent (1979) was
  applied to the commercial Corey PG synthesis (Ono Pharmaceutical
  Co.). Furthermore, we realized the long-sought three-component PG
  synthesis in 1985, which now plays an important role in
  biochemical and physiological studies of PGs.</p>

  <p>Chemical synthesis provides a logical basis
  for molecular science and related technologies which require a
  high degree of structural precision. I have 180 tried to select
  general and fundamental research subjects in this important
  field. A clear-cut solution to a long-persistent problem, when
  accomplished, often results in an enormous scientific or
  technological impact. Asymmetric hydrogenation is a typical
  example. BINAP chemistry is now utilized worldwide in research
  laboratories and also at the industrial level. In fact, the
  selective synthesis of single enantiomers using well-designed
  chiral molecular catalysts has now become common practice. This
  fascinating field is still growing rapidly, and recent advances
  have dramatically changed the way of chemical synthesis, opening
  tremendous potential for molecular technologies.</p>

  <p>Our broad research activity goes beyond
  asymmetric synthesis. In 1994, we discovered the remarkable
  utility of supercritical carbon dioxide as a medium for
  homogeneous catalysis. Thus Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation produces
  formic acid, methyl formate, and dimethylformamide with an
  extremely high turnover number. More recently, we devised
  practical, environmentally sound methods for olefin epoxidation
  and alcohol oxidation using aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
  whose utility is highlighted by the direct conversion of
  cyclohexene to adipic acid (1996-1998). The stereospecific living
  polymerization of phenylacetylenes was achieved by using a
  structurally defined tetracoordinate Rh complex (1994). We also
  developed an efficient synthesis of solid-anchored DNA oligomers
  using organopalladium chemistry (1990). In my early days at
  Nagoya, we invented the iron carbonyl-polybromo ketone reaction
  which allows the construction of five- and seven-member
  carbocycles in a 3 + 2 and 3 + 4 manner, respectively. In the
  late 1970s, we exercised initiative in the catalytic use of
  organosilicon compounds for organic synthesis.</p>

  <p>Organometallic chemistry is a scientific
  space leading to an enormous technical impact and even more
  general social benefits. I am very pleased to be involved in
  contributing to the progress of this significant scientific
  realm. The above described scientific accomplishments are not my
  own, but the credit in fact belongs to my research family at
  Nagoya University and many collaborators at other institutions.
  My initial ideas in solving problems were not always appropriate
  and, sometimes even nonsensical. However, my serendipitous
  collaborators incubated such research themes through careful
  experiments and much deliberation, and eventually reached new
  chemical concepts and useful methodologies. Their intellect,
  sense, and skills are highly appreciated. In addition, through my
  frequent traveling abroad as a visiting professor or invited
  lecturer at research institutions and conferences, I have met
  many superb colleagues from the international scientific
  community. Their encouragement as well as the exposure to
  different cultures and environments have deeply affected my way
  of thinking. Furthermore, for over three decades, my scientific
  work has been supported generously and consistently by the
  Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of
  Japan as well as the Research Development Corporation of Japan,
  various private foundations, and numerous industrial
  companies.</p>

  <p>My activities are not limited to education
  and research. I have served on the editorial boards of some
  thirty international journals including the editorship of
  <i>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis</i> (Wiley/VCH) which
  emphasizes the "practical elegance" of chemical synthesis.
  Furthermore, I have been involved in much administrative work,
  for example, as Science Advisor (1992-1996) and Member of the
  Scientific Council (1996-present) of the Ministry of Education,
  Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Dean of the Graduate
  School of Science at Nagoya University (1997-1999); and President
  of the Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan (1997-1999).
  Such official duties significantly hamper my research activity
  but are unavoidable for a senior scientist.</p>

  <p>In 1972, I married Hiroko Oshima (a
  daughter of a Professor of Medicine at Tokyo University) who was
  studying the immunology of cancer at a research institute in
  Tokyo. Since then, she has played the most important part in our
  private life at Nagoya. We have two children. Our first son, Eiji
  (born in 1973), is an active staff writer of a newspaper company,
  and our second son, Koji (born in 1978), studies painting at an
  art university in Tokyo.</p>
