  <h1>E. Donnall Thomas - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="thomas.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Dr.
  Edward E. Thomas was born in 1870 and moved to Texas with his
  family in a covered wagon in 1874. He grew up in frontier Texas
  and, with almost no formal schooling went to the University of
  Louisville, Kentucky, where he received his M. D. His first wife
  died of tuberculosis, and I was the only child of his second
  wife. He was 50 years old when I was born on March 15, 1920. He
  was a solo general practitioner in our small Texas village. Thus,
  together we span the time from horse and buggy house calls to
  modern high-tech medicine.<br>
  <br>
  My high school class consisted of about 15 people. I was not an
  outstanding student even in this small group. I entered the
  University of Texas in Austin in 1937. In my first semester I
  made only B grades, but as time went on and the courses became
  more difficult and challenging I began to enjoy the studies,
  mainly in chemistry and chemical engineering. I received a B. A.
  in 1941 and an M. A. in 1943.<br>
  <br>
  During my undergraduate years at the end of the depression money
  was almost non-existent so I worked at a number of odd jobs. One
  of the jobs was waiting tables at a girls' dormitory. One January
  morning it snowed, a rare event in Texas. As I emerged from the
  girls' dormitory, an attractive young woman hit me in the face
  with a snow ball. I naturally had to catch her and avenge the
  insult to my male ego. Thus, I meet Dorothy Martin, the Dottie
  who has participated in all my endeavors up to the present time.
  We have 3 children, Don Jr. who practices internal medicine in
  Montana, Jeffrey who is in business in Seattle and Elaine who is
  a Fellow in infectious diseases at the University of Washington.
  We have eight grandchildren.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Harvard Medical School in 1943. During medical
  school Dottie abandoned her journalism work to enter training as
  a laboratory technician while working to help support us. Her
  training in writing, laboratory technology and library science
  has been invaluable in our work. I received the M. D. in
  1946.<br>
  <br>
  There followed an internship, a year of hematology training under
  my life-long friend Dr. Clement Finch, two years in the army, a
  year of postdoctoral work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, two years of
  medical residency, the last as the chief medical resident at the
  Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. During that time Dr.
  <a href="index.html">Joseph Murray</a> was a surgical resident
  and we have been friends and colleagues over the years because of
  our common interests in transplantation. I was on the wards of
  the Brigham and helped care for his first kidney transplant
  patient.<br>
  <br>
  During medical school I became interested in the bone marrow and
  in leukemia. This interest was intensified by my early
  association with Dr. Sydney Farber who gave me my first
  laboratory in the new Jimmy Fund Building. I was fortunate to see
  the first child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose
  remission was induced with an anti-folate drug. I became
  interested in factors that stimulate marrow function in part due
  to Allan Erslev's attempt to demonstrate erythropoietin. During
  my year at M.I.T. I worked under Dr. John Loofborrow on
  stimulating factors released from irradiated yeast. I hoped to
  apply this knowledge to marrow stimulating factors. Fortunately I
  left the field of stimulating factors because it is only in
  recent years, with recombinant technology, that great strides
  have been made in this area.<br>
  <br>
  I had been intrigued by the studies of Dr. Leon Jacobsen et al.
  who demonstrated that shielding the spleen would protect mice
  against otherwise lethal irradiation and the subsequent
  demonstration by Egon Lorenz et al. that a marrow infusion was
  also protective. These observations were initially thought to be
  the result of stimulating factors. In 1955, Main and Prehn
  published their paper showing that a mouse protected against
  lethal irradiation by a marrow infusion would accept a skin graft
  from the marrow donor. Their study and the demonstration by Ford
  et al. using cytogenetic technology of donor chromosomes in such
  mice made it suddenly clear that the irradiation protection
  effect was due to the survival of living bone marrow cells.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955, at the invitation of Dr. Joseph Ferrebee I went to the
  Mary Imogene Basset Hospital in Cooperstown, N. Y., an affiliate
  of Columbia University. Immediately, we began to work on marrow
  transplantation in human patients and in the dog, as an outbred
  animal suitable for clinical care comparable to human patients.
  Except for an occasional patient with an identical twin, we
  quickly learned that allogeneic marrow transplants in man were
  going to be very difficult. Joe Ferrebee and I and our young
  colleagues concentrated on working with our dogs on many aspects
  of marrow transplantation. The long cold winters, absence of
  commuting problems and opportunity for long discussions were
  conducive to our work. Those years had a deep and abiding
  influence on subsequent work since most of the basic concepts
  were laid out during that time.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963 I moved to Seattle at the invitation of Dr. Robert
  Williams, a famous endocrinologist and first chairman of the
  Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. Professor Williams
  recognized that our School of Medicine was in its infancy and
  rather isolated in the Pacific Northwest. He envisioned the
  affiliation of all the relevant institutions in the area with the
  School of Medicine in order to create the critical mass necessary
  for academic excellence. Within that concept I established my
  program in the Seattle Public Health Hospital.<br>
  <br>
  The rest of the story seems short in retrospect. The recruitment
  of some brilliant young co-workers who still work with me,
  studies of immunology and irradiation biology in the dog,
  borrowing knowledge of human histocompatibility from Amos, Payne
  and <a href="../1980/index.html">Dausset</a>, the assembly and
  training of a critical care team of nurses, and, finally, the
  demonstration that some patients with advanced leukemia, aplastic
  anemia or genetic diseases could be cured by marrow
  transplantation.<br>
  <br>
  Our team of physicians and nurses proved to be stable and
  dedicated. We did face problems that at times seemed almost
  insurmountable. In 1972, the Seattle Public Health Hospital was
  faced with closure by the federal government. After many
  conferences with the Dean of the School of Medicine, it was
  apparent that we could not move to the University of Washington.
  We found temporary space at Providence Hospital for a two year
  period. In 1975 our team moved into the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
  Research Center which provided superb facilities and the
  opportunity to expand the program with the cooperation of the
  Swedish Hospital Medical Center. While continuing laboratory and
  animal research, our team has now carried out more than 4,000
  human marrow transplants.<br>
  <br>
  It is always difficult to identify the many threads that make up
  the fabric of a life's work. I know that my philosophy and ideas
  have been heavily influenced by more than 20 years of daily
  interaction with a small group of colleagues, all of whom are now
  distinguished scientists in their own right. Bob Epstein, Rainer
  Storb, Dean Buckner, Reg Clift, Paul Neiman and Alex Fefer were
  with me at the start of the Seattle adventure, and all except Bob
  are still my daily companions. Ted Graham moved with me from
  Cooperstown and has played an essential role in our animal
  research. Along the way we were joined by Joel Meyers, Fred
  Appelbaum, John Hansen and many others who made major
  contributions to the achievements honored by this award.</p>
