  <h2>Naturalism or Idealism?</h2>

  <p>The history of mankind knows of certain
  questions that are at once very old and always new: they are very
  old because any way of life contains an answer to them, and
  always new because the conditions on which those ways of life
  depend are constantly shifting and may at critical stages change
  so much that truths safely accepted for generations may become
  open problems causing conflict and bewilderment.<br>
  <br>
  Such a question is the contrast between naturalism and idealism
  with which we are dealing today. The meaning of these words has
  been blunted by usage; they cause many a misunderstanding, and
  only through laziness do we put up with such catchwords. But
  their inadequacy cannot conceal the great contrast which lies
  behind them and which sharply divides men. This contrast concerns
  our attitude to the whole of reality and the resulting task that
  dominates our life; it concerns the question whether man is
  entirely determined by nature or whether he can somehow - or
  indeed essentially - rise above it. We are all agreed on the very
  close ties between man and nature which he should not abandon.
  But it has been argued and is still being argued vehemently
  whether his whole being, his actions and sufferings, are
  determined by these ties or whether he possesses life of another
  kind which introduces a new stage of reality. The one attitude
  characterizes naturalism, the other idealism, and these two
  creeds differ fundamentally both in their goals and in their
  pursuits of them. For if the additional life of man exists only
  in his imagination, we should eradicate all traces of it from
  human opinions and institutions. Instead, we should aim at the
  closest ties with nature and develop to a pure state the natural
  character of human life; for thus life would restore the ties
  with its true origins which it severed unjustly and to its
  lasting damage. But if one recognizes in man a new element beyond
  nature, the task will consist in giving it the strongest possible
  support and contrasting it clearly with nature. In this case life
  will take up its main position in the new element and look at
  nature from that point of view. This contrast in attitudes
  emerges nowhere as clearly as in the place of the soul in the two
  systems. Nature, of course, has its share in the life of the soul
  and in numerous manifestations deeply influences human life. But
  this natural life of the soul is peripheral, mere appendix to the
  material phenomena of nature. Its only purpose is the
  preservation of physical life, for man's higher psychological
  development, his cleverness and resourcefulness, compensate for
  the brute strength, swiftness of movement, or sharpness of the
  senses in which animals excel. But even in its extreme form this
  life has neither purpose nor content in itself; it remains a
  conglomeration of disparate points. It does not coalesce in an
  inner community of life, nor does it constitute an inner world
  peculiar to itself. Thus action is never directed toward an inner
  purpose but toward the utilitarian purpose of preserving life.
  Naturalism, if it remains true to its purpose, reduces human life
  to that norm. Idealism, on the other hand, maintains the
  emancipation of inwardness; according to it the disparate
  phenomena of life coalesce in an all - embracing inner world. At
  the same time, idealism demands that human life should be
  governed by its peculiar values and goals, the true, the good,
  and the beautiful. In its view the subordination of all human
  aspiration to the goal of usefulness appears an intolerable
  humiliation and a complete betrayal of the greatness and dignity
  of man. Such divergent and even contradictory attitudes seem to
  be irreconcilable: we have to choose between harsh
  alternatives.<br>
  <br>
  With regard to this choice the present time is undeniably divided
  against itself, particularly since profound changes in the setup
  of life have brought new aspects of the problem to light.
  Centuries of tradition had accustomed us to striving primarily
  for an invisible world and to valuing the visible world only to
  the degree of its relation to the invisible world. To the
  medieval mind man's home is a transcendental world; in this world
  we are merely travellers abroad. We cannot penetrate it, nor does
  it give us any scope for achievements or hold us by any roots. In
  such a conception nature easily appears as a lower sphere which
  one approaches at one's own peril. When Petrarch had climbed
  Mount Ventoux and was enraptured by the splendour of the Alps, he
  had serious doubts whether such delight at the creation was not
  an injustice to the Creator and did not deprive Him of the
  worship due to Him alone. Thus he took refuge with St. Augustine
  to regain the security of a religious mood.<br>
  <br>
  These things have changed. We set greater store by the world of
  immediate experience and many things have helped to make it
  completely our home. Science has been the leader in this
  movement, for it has brought about a closer relationship with
  nature, resulting in many new impulses that have not only
  enriched parts of our life but have deeply affected its totality.
  The speculative and subjective thought of former ages was unable
  to analyze sensual perceptions and did not penetrate to the
  essence of things. Moreover, its recognition of certain
  regularities in nature lagged far behind the discovery of
  mathematical laws of nature first formulated by the genius of
  Kepler. And not only did it fail to penetrate nature, it failed
  equally to turn its powers to the use of man and to the
  advancement of his welfare. Occasional technical inventions were
  the result of chance rather than superior insight; on the whole,
  man remained defenceless against nature. Only a century ago men
  were still awkward and powerless in this regard. In that age of
  great poets and thinkers, how much time was wasted with
  overcoming natural obstacles, how inconvenient was travelling,
  and how cumbersome postal services. In all these respects our age
  has seen changes never dreamed of by history before. The
  accumulation of scientific knowledge since the seventeenth
  century was brought to a triumphant conclusion in the nineteenth.
  By unravelling the separate strands of natural processes and
  tracing them back to their ultimate elements, by formulating the
  effects of these elements in simple formulas, and finally by
  using the idea of evolution to combine what had been separated,
  scientific research has given us a closer and more direct
  experience of nature in all its aspects. At the same time the
  theory of evolution has shown man's dependence on nature:
  understanding himself in nature, his own essence appeared to
  become clearer to him.<br>
  <br>
  The change of concepts was accompanied by a change of the
  realities of life. Technology seized upon the results of science
  and caused a revolution in man's relationship with his
  environment. Former ages had held that his position in the world
  was essentially determined and not subject to change; man had to
  suffer whatever dark fate or the will of God had decreed. Even if
  he could - and was expected to - alleviate suffering in
  individual instances, he was no match for the totality of
  suffering and there was no hope of either tearing up evil by the
  root or making life richer and more joyous. In our age, however,
  we are translating into action the conviction that by common
  effort mankind can raise the level of life, that a rule of reason
  can gradually replace the tyranny of irrational forces. Man may
  again feel victorious and creative. Even if his powers are
  limited at any given moment, that moment is only one in a long
  chain. The impossibilities of a former age have been realized in
  ours. We have witnessed surprising breakthroughs in our own age
  and can see no limit to this progressive movement. Man's
  existence has been immeasurably enriched; it has become an
  attraction and a challenge for him.<br>
  <br>
  Technological progress becomes even more exciting when it enters
  into the service of the social idea which demands that not only a
  small &eacute;lite but humanity at large should profit by it. This
  demand creates an entirely new challenge, requiring tremendous
  energy but also giving rise to new complications and harsh
  contrasts which, in turn, intensify the passion of man's work in
  this world and enrich its meaning. The transformation of
  environment has become the purpose of human life; life seems real
  only insofar as it deals with things. Man no longer needs the
  escape to an invisible world in order to find and realize exalted
  goals.<br>
  <br>
  These facts are indisputable. Our material environment and our
  relation to it have assumed tremendous importance. Any philosophy
  and any course of action based on it must reckon with this fact.
  But naturalism goes beyond this fact, for it maintains that man
  is completely defined by his relationship with the world, that he
  is only a piece of the natural process. That is a different
  contention which requires careful examination. For history has
  taught us that our judgment is easily confused and exaggerated
  when revolutionary changes upset the old balance of things. Facts
  and opinions are confused by man, who is helpless against error
  and passion. At such a time, it becomes an urgent task to
  separate the facts from the interpretations given to them.
  Naturalism, too, is subject to such a scrutiny when it turns a
  fact into a principle, sees the totality of human life determined
  by man's closer relation to nature, and adjusts all values
  accordingly.<br>
  <br>
  The chief argument against such a limitation of human life is the
  result not of subjective reflection but of an analysis of the
  modern movement itself. The emergence and the progress of that
  movement reveal an intellectual capacity which, whether it
  manifests itself as intellectual and technical mastery of nature
  or as practical social work, proves the existence of a way of
  life that cannot be accounted for, if man is understood as a mere
  natural being. For in coming closer to nature man shows himself
  superior to it. As a mere part of nature, man's existence would
  be a series of isolated phenomena. All life would proceed from
  and depend on contact with the outside world. There would be no
  way of transcending the limitation of the senses. There would be
  no place at all for any activity governed by a totality or
  superior unity, nor for any inner coherence of life. All values
  and goals would disappear and reality would be reduced to mere
  actuality. But the experience of human work shows a very
  different picture.<br>
  <br>
  Modern science has not been the result of a gradual accumulation
  of sensual perceptions but a deliberate break with the entire
  stock of traditional knowledge. Such a break was deemed necessary
  because the old concepts had been too anthropomorphic, whereas a
  scientific understanding of nature presupposed an acknowledgment
  of its complete independence from man. But our concepts could not
  have formulated the independence of nature unless thought had
  emancipated itself from sensual impressions, and through analysis
  and new synthesis created a new view of nature. This re-creation
  was caused by the search for truth and the desire to identify
  with things as they are and thus to bring about an inner
  expansion of life. But how could nature be conceived in such a
  manner without the element of chance and distortion, inherent in
  the perspective of the individual, unless thought could operate
  independently of sensual perception? Logical thought, striving
  for a unified conception of the universe, transformed the
  immediate sensual perception; it provided the sensual existence
  with the foundation of a world of thought. Man's tremendous
  intellectual achievement of a conception of nature in its
  totality proves his superiority over the natural world and the
  existence of another level of reality. Thus we may say that
  naturalism with its emphasis on nature is refuted nowhere with
  more cogency than in modern science as it transformed nature into
  an intellectual conception. The more we recognize the
  intellectual achievement and inner structure of modern science,
  the clearer becomes the distance from naturalism.<br>
  <br>
  The superiority of man to mere nature is also proved by modern
  technology, for it demands and proves imaginative anticipation
  and planning, the tracing of new possibilities, exact
  calculations, and bold ventures. How could a mere natural being
  be capable of such achievements?<br>
  <br>
  The social movement, too, reveals man as not entirely limited by
  a given order, but as a being that perceives and judges a given
  situation and is confident that it can change it essentially by
  its own efforts. We have come to set greater store by material
  things, but we value them not because of their sensual
  characteristics but because they serve us to enhance life and to
  dominate the world completely. We do not aim at an increase in
  sensual pleasures but at a situation in which any man and all men
  together can develop their full strength. The mere mention of a
  social idea implies common interests beyond the egotism of the
  individual, and this idea would never have reached the power it
  has had it not been conceived of both as a duty and as a
  privilege. The ethical element inherent in it gave it the power
  to win over minds, to attract enthusiastic disciples, and to
  prevail even over reluctance. But there is no place at all for
  such an ethical element in the realm of mere nature; thus the
  mere existence of a social movement refutes naturalism.<br>
  <br>
  These considerations lead to the conclusion that naturalism is by
  no means an adequate expression of the modern way of life. On the
  contrary, that way of life has outgrown its origins and has
  revealed far greater spiritual independence than naturalism could
  acknowledge. Life itself has contradicted that interpretation of
  life. The fact that environment means more to us does not mean
  that we are a mere part of it. Naturalism makes the mistake of
  ascribing to nature itself the changes the mind effected in it.
  The mistake resulted from concentrating on the effects and
  ignoring the power which alone could produce them.<br>
  <br>
  Still the fact remains that mind needs environment as an object
  to work on, and to that extent it is dependent on it. But does
  not such a situation confront life with an intolerable conflict?
  The transformation of the environment has released vast
  intellectual energies which fortify the claim of life for
  happiness and satisfaction. Will life not feel intolerably
  confined if man must deal only with the outside world, if he may
  never return to himself and use the results of his stupendous
  labours for his own welfare? The achievement itself is limited
  narrowly if its object is invariably outside ourselves and can
  never be taken into our own life. Scientific research in an
  external object can never lead to true, complete, and inner
  knowledge. As long as we regard man simply as a being next to us,
  there can be no inner community of mutual love. Energy that is
  not dominated by, and does not return to, a centre, will never
  constitute the content of life; it leaves us empty in the midst
  of bustling excitement. This is a common and painful modern
  experience. But is not such a sensation of emptiness itself proof
  that there are more profound depths within us which demand
  satisfaction? Thus we are faced with the question whether life
  does not somehow go beyond the position reached so far, whether
  it could not return from an occupation with outside objects to an
  occupation with itself and to the experience and shaping of
  itself. Only life's own movement can give such an answer; let us
  see whether it is in the affirmative.<br>
  <br>
  I think we can say confidently that it is. We need only regard
  clear and indisputable individual phenomena as a whole and
  appreciate that whole in its full significance in order to
  recognize that there is indeed a great movement within us which
  generates an essentially new way of life. Hitherto our discussion
  had seen life as something between subject and object, between
  man and world, between energy and thing. However, the thing was
  touched only from the outside; it remained inwardly foreign to
  us. But now intellectual activity takes a turn to the effect that
  the object is taken into the process of life, is incorporated
  into the soul and excites and moves us as part of our own life.
  The artist's creative activity, for instance in Goethe, is an
  example of this. We call such creativity objective, but that is
  not to say that the outside world is pictured in its sensual
  being without any addition of the soul; rather, the external
  object becomes part of the soul. There is a fruitful relation of
  energy and object; they combine, enhance one another, and create
  a new complete living entity. In such life a soul is breathed
  into the object, or the soul that is in it is made to sound, and
  in effecting the object, energy loses its initial indeterminate
  character and assumes full definition. The poet appears as a
  magician who gives to things a language in which they proclaim
  their own being, but they come alive only in the soul of the
  poet, only in an inner world. Something similar to this artistic
  process occurs in practical life, in the relationship of men as
  it finds its expression in law and morality. The other man who at
  first seems a complete outsider is taken into the circle of our
  own life when we become capable of identifying ourselves with
  him. Nowhere is the process of making the seemingly strange your
  own as marked as in love, the highest relationship of two
  individuals. For here the gap between oneself and the other is
  completely bridged; what was strange becomes an integral part of
  one's own life. Nor can we love our people, our country, or the
  whole of mankind unless we find in them our own life and being.
  In another direction the search for truth leads to a broadening
  of our inner life. For how could we desire so powerfully to
  recognize the object unless it did not somehow exist within our
  own life, unless the toil spent on it did not contribute to the
  perfection of our own being?<br>
  <br>
  Thus the beautiful, the good, and the true agree in that the
  object becomes part of the inner process of life, but this cannot
  possibly happen without deep changes in the structure and meaning
  of that process. For now life is dealing primarily with itself;
  energy and object meet in it and demand a balance. However, there
  can be no balance unless both are comprehended in one whole,
  which finds its life and perfection in them. Thus life enters
  into a relationship with itself, it is structured in itself in
  different degrees and begets within itself a new depth, a
  comprehensive and persistent energy. If this happens, the whole
  can be present and effective in each detail. It is only in this
  way that convictions and attitudes are possible, and character
  and personality can manifest themselves in their manifold
  activities. The integration into the process of life gives to the
  object a new and higher form, and so life is not merely the
  representation or appropriation of a given reality; it enhances
  and creates; it does not find a world, but must make a world for
  itself.<br>
  <br>
  Thus life faces not only the outside world, but itself. It
  creates its own realm of the mind. By combining with each other,
  the different movements produce an inner world, and this inner
  world, through a complete reversal of the initial situation,
  becomes the point of departure for all intellectual activity.
  This world is not a private world; the good, true, and beautiful
  are not peculiar to each individual. We live in a common world
  and the individual achievement is valid for all and becomes their
  possession. In this consists the greatness of that new world. The
  new life in the individual has a universal character, and in the
  quest for this life the individual more and more finds his true
  self and abandons his limited point of departure. Mere
  self-preservation becomes increasingly less satisfying.<br>
  <br>
  If we look more closely at this development of life and consider
  its energies and forms, the complete reversal it caused and the
  new tasks it created, we cannot really doubt any more that it is
  not a mere figment of man's imagination designed for his pleasure
  and comfort. It is obviously a new level of reality which creates
  new tasks for man. The movement toward the new goals, the
  development of a more intimate basic relationship with reality,
  and the grafting of an infinite life onto human existence cannot
  possibly be mere human creations. Man could not even imagine such
  things. There must be an impulse of life from the universe that
  embraces and carries us and gives us the strength to fight for
  the new reality, to introduce it into the world of natural
  reality, and to participate in the movement of the universe.
  Without being rooted in the actuality of the universe, our
  aspirations could never gain a firm foothold and direction. Life
  on our level could not exist within itself and enhance itself
  unless the totality of reality exists within itself and is in an
  inward motion.<br>
  <br>
  The importance of man and the tension of his life increase
  immeasurably in this process of change. Belonging at first to the
  level of nature, he rises to a new level of reality in which he
  is active with the energy of the whole, and so he does not remain
  a mere part of a given order but becomes a stage on which worlds
  meet and search for their further development. And he is more
  than a stage. For although that movement of the world cannot
  arise out of him, it cannot be activated on this stage without
  his decision and action. He cooperates in the totality of worlds
  so that limitation and freedom, finiteness and infinity, meet in
  him. The world ceases to be foreign to him, and with the whole of
  its life it becomes his own and inmost essence.<br>
  <br>
  It is this development of life to its full self-realization which
  idealism seizes upon and on which it models its goals and
  concentrates its efforts, even though the level of nature remains
  and man's intellectual life can develop only in constant
  intercourse with it. But this does not dispose of the fundamental
  contrast that idealism, unlike naturalism, understands not mind
  by nature but nature by mind.<br>
  <br>
  The ever-renewed conflict between the two convictions is due to
  the fact that the new world, however much it must be effective
  from the bottom of our souls, can be gained only in a constant
  struggle that always creates new complications. It is not only
  the individual who has to make this world his own; mankind at
  large has to fight for its more definite form, which is not given
  to us but has to be discovered and realized by ourselves. History
  knows of many approaches to this goal, but none has proved
  perfect in the end. We experience the world of the mind at first
  only separately and vaguely; it is our task to achieve a
  comprehensive form to give it a fully definite character and make
  it a complete and safe possession. Now at high points of history,
  humanity has made the attempt at such a synthesis of life that
  would embrace and give form to the whole of being. Success may
  seem to attend such an effort in its first surge, but soon
  obstacles arise, and as they grow it becomes clear that life does
  not in its entirety fit the measure prescribed for it. Individual
  movements free themselves from the projected structure, and the
  period of positive creation and coalescence of the elements is
  followed by a period of criticism and disintegration, so that the
  search for the unity of life leads to a new synthesis. Thus,
  epochs of concentration and expansion follow upon each other, and
  both serve man's aspiration for a spiritual content of life. Past
  achievements will always appear too small, and the need for
  spiritual preservation of life will always lead to a new effort.
  In such tenacity of purpose, such continuous progress, and such
  struggle with infinity the tremendous greatness of mankind is
  realized.<br>
  <br>
  The experience of European civilization since the Greek era has
  revealed this process with particular forcefulness. Greek life
  has its lasting importance in the cheerful energy with which it
  engaged upon an original synthesis of the entire range of our
  existence. It did so by means of art, in particular fine arts,
  and this synthesis served as a point of departure for the
  manifold ramifications of civilization. Science tried to
  determine the permanent artifice of the cosmos behind the chaos
  of shifting phenomena. Action was to turn the human commonwealth
  into a strictly measured and well-constructed work of art, and
  the individual was to combine in perfect harmony all the manifold
  energies and desires of his soul. These endeavours resulted in a
  thorough patterning of life. Activity was aroused everywhere, a
  balance of conflicting sides was achieved together with stability
  and an inner cheerfulness. All these achievements have become a
  permanent gain. But mankind could not stop at this. The
  experience of life created greater tasks, greater contrasts and
  conflicts than could be solved by it. It became apparent that an
  end had been set abruptly and prematurely, and that the soul had
  depths not fully sounded by it. The whole had rested on the
  assumption of the immediate presence and irresistible power of
  the intellect in human life, and a weaker age came to doubt this
  presence. A period of disintegration followed. The manifold
  elements separated, but despite all its negative aspects, this
  period prepared for a new synthesis. Such a synthesis appeared in
  original Christianity, where the whole of reality was
  subordinated to the moral idea, and the variety of life was made
  subject to the moral obligation. But considering man's moral
  frailty and the lack of reason in the human world, the strength
  for the solution of such a task had to be derived from a
  superhuman order. Thus, the moral synthesis had at the same time
  a religious character and together with it affected the entire
  range of life. This concentration led to an enormous deepening of
  life; it created a pure inner world and first established the
  absolute supremacy of mind over nature.<br>
  <br>
  But though this life remains valid in our world, its original
  form has encountered increasingly strong opposition ever since
  the beginning of the modern period. A new humanity full of high
  spirits found in it too little for the development of its power.
  At the same time, a desire for a universal culture that would
  embrace all branches of life with equal love, felt confined by
  that moral-religious synthesis. Hence a new synthesis arose, in
  which the basic idea is the unlimited development of all energies
  and in which the enhancement of life has become its purpose. This
  urge has set in motion whatever appeared to be at rest. Constant
  progress has affected not only nature, but man himself. Nothing
  seems to be more characteristic of man than his ability to rise
  toward the infinite by the powers of his mind despite his natural
  limitations. This life is still flooding about us from all sides
  and is penetrating ever more deeply into the ramifications of
  being. However, at the bottom of our souls and at the height of
  intellectual effort, new doubts are beginning to arise about this
  solution. First we have begun to doubt whether the entire range
  of being can really be turned into an upward movement, and
  whether this movement itself does not create new problems and
  complications that it could not cope with; whether the release of
  all energies has not conjured up contrasts and passions that are
  threatening the sanity of our existence. And even if we could
  suppress these doubts, other and greater ones arise from the
  question whether the transformation into incessant activity
  really exhausts life and satisfies the soul. For if motion does
  not find its balance in a state of rest superior to it from which
  it can be comprehended, the possibility of life's existence
  within itself disappears. We can no longer assign any content to
  life; it is a constant and impatient longing for the remote which
  never returns to itself and forms itself. Nor can we defend
  ourselves against a boundless relativism, if the truth of today
  is superseded tomorrow. The restlessness and haste of such
  progressive activity cannot prevent a growing emptiness and the
  consciousness of it. Despite the greatness of technical
  achievements in particular fields, man in the entirety of his
  existence is doomed to decline: the powerful and individual
  personality will gradually disappear.<br>
  <br>
  But as soon as we realize the limitations and defects of this
  modern synthesis of life, we cease to believe in it. The old
  order will disintegrate and the contrasts will again emerge in
  full power. Self-assured activity once more will give way to
  brooding reflection; we shall once more enter from a positive
  into a critical period.<br>
  <br>
  If life thus lacks a dominating unity and a centre, while at the
  same time the transformation of the outside world achieves
  splendid triumphs, it is understandable if the balance of life is
  lost, and external successes gradually come to dominate the
  picture. The achievement makes us forget the power that produced
  it. Education works from the outside to the inside, and in the
  end man appears completely a product of his environment because
  the central energy could no longer cope with the affluence of the
  outside world. In such an atmosphere naturalism wields power over
  souls, and we fully understand how it gains ground as the
  expression of a peculiar situation. But it is precisely through
  our understanding of it that we are more firmly convinced that it
  is not the whole truth of human experience.<br>
  <br>
  Its attempt to reduce man entirely to the level of nature can
  succeed only so long as human existence does not bring forth new
  energies and goals. But since we have recognized that man
  represents a new degree of reality which makes intellectual
  activity possible, we can no longer simply return to nature. The
  new reality may temporarily be lost in the consciousness of man,
  but the results of history are embedded in his soul, in the midst
  of all struggles, doubts, and errors. Even in the midst of
  negation they have put him far above the level of mere nature,
  and naturalism appears to be sufficient only because it borrows
  widely and unscrupulously from idealism. If these borrowings
  disappear and naturalism has to rely on its own resources, its
  inadequacies become glaring. There will be a decisive rebellion
  against an intolerably shallow view of life, accompanied by a
  strong movement toward idealism and the search for a new
  synthesis of life.<br>
  <br>
  For certainly the new and strong desire for life's existence
  within itself and for a rich inner world cannot be satisfied by a
  return to an earlier stage. There may be imperishable truths in
  the older syntheses of life, but how can we explain the
  tremendous shocks and the feeling of uncertainty about the whole
  of life if those truths, as they have been historically
  transmitted, contained the final truth? We have considered the
  deep changes that the modern age has brought about, and we have
  recognized the closer concatenation of man with his environment
  and the greater importance of that environment. At the same time,
  we have seen the harsh obstacles met by the striving for a
  complete intellectualization of existence, we feel the deep gap
  between the immediate being of man and the demands of
  intellectual life, and we realize that we must revise our image
  of man in order to reach the point of intellectual creativity. We
  can no longer hope to set the whole of existence in motion at one
  stroke. First of all we must try to form a nucleus of life and to
  fortify that position; then we shall have to cope with
  environment and gradually encroach upon it. The new insights and
  tasks of the modern age will be fully utilized in this endeavour,
  especially the tremendous progress made in human welfare which we
  owe to science. Only we must not assimilate these new elements in
  their immediate sensual form. We shall have to extract the
  nucleus of truth, and this can be done only in the context of our
  entire historical experience. Any conviction that is to carry
  mankind needs an open mind for the movements of the time, but
  such open-mindedness should not lead to helpless drifting in
  their wake.<br>
  <br>
  A revival of idealism may well face many difficulties and
  obstacles, but the task is imperative and we cannot shirk it.
  Once mankind has attained an existence of life within itself it
  cannot resign it again; it has to use all its power and ingenuity
  to carry out that imperative demand. Once man has escaped from
  the fetters of natural life, he cannot possibly agree to them
  again; once risen to independent activity, he cannot again be the
  plaything of inscrutable powers; having penetrated to the
  universe and its infinity, he cannot again return to the
  limitations of a natural being; once the desire for an inner
  relationship to the world has stirred within him, external
  relationships will no longer satisfy him. Thus, there is an urge
  beyond naturalism in all directions.<br>
  <br>
  The peculiar experiences and needs of our own time most strongly
  demand the revival of the movement toward idealism. The steady
  increase of work and the rush of the struggle for existence have
  obscured the meaning of life and deprived our life of a
  dominating goal. Can we hope to regain such a goal without a
  powerful concentration and elevation in the soul of man? There
  are senile features in the colorful picture of modern life, and
  there is a great urge for rejuvenation, for a production of pure
  and original beginnings. Would not such an urge be folly if man
  were wholly determined by the necessity of a natural process? The
  creativity of the mind has at all times been surrounded and often
  covered by petty interests, but it makes a considerable
  difference whether we can check such obscurantism or not. If we
  can, we need a goal that unites and elevates men; otherwise we
  are at the mercy of human pettiness, and there is far too much of
  it in our world today. In the confusion of everyday life little
  distinction is made between what is high and low, true or
  seeming, genuine or spurious. There is no sense of the
  substantial, no acknowledgement of the great either-or pervading
  human life. We shall have to separate the wheat from the chaff
  and in an act of concentration gather whatever the time contains
  in good and important things, the wealth of good will and
  readiness to sacrifice, so that these things will unite for a
  common effort and give to life a content worth living for. But
  how can we carry out such a separation and such a collection
  unless there is an inner synthesis of life that lifts mankind
  above the insecurity of individual reflection?<br>
  <br>
  The contrast expressed in the struggle of naturalism and idealism
  is not confined to the general outline of life; it is found in
  any particular realm which represents a totality of conviction.
  It makes a tremendous difference whether man submits to a given
  existence and tries to improve it only in spots or whether,
  inspired by the belief in an ascending movement of the universe,
  he is able to contribute independently to that movement, to
  discover new goals, and to release new energies. Literature is a
  case in point, as I shall indicate in a few words. Naturalism
  cannot give to literature an inner independence or allow it an
  initiative of its own; for if literature is only a hand of life
  on the dial of time, it can only imitate and register events as
  they happen. By means of impressive descriptions it may help the
  time to understand its own desires better; but since creative
  power is denied to it, it cannot contribute to the inner
  liberation and elevation of man. At the same time it necessarily
  lacks dramatic power, which cannot exist without the possibility
  of an inner change and elevation. But the perspective and the
  task change completely if literature acknowledges the possibility
  of a decisive turn in human life, of the ascension to another
  level, and if it feels called upon to help bring about that
  ascension. In that case it can help to shape life and to lead the
  time, by representing and simultaneously guiding what is rising
  in man's soul. Literature can clarify and confirm by drawing
  certain simple outlines in the bewildering chaos of the time and
  by confronting us with the chief problems of our intellectual
  existence and persuading us of their importance. It can raise our
  life to greatness above the hubbub of everyday life by the
  representation of eternal truths, and in the midst of our dark
  situation it can strengthen our belief in the reason of life. It
  can act in the way envisaged by Alfred Nobel when he gave to
  literature a place of honour in his foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Thus there are strong reasons for our continued belief in
  idealism and for our attempt to give it a form that corresponds
  to the sum of our historical experiences. But such an attempt
  will never truly succeed unless it is considered a personal
  necessity and is carried out as a matter of intellectual
  self-preservation. Exhilaration, courage, and firm belief can
  arise only from such an acknowledgement of a binding necessity,
  not from a hankering after remote and alien goals, but from a
  belief in life as it is active within us and makes us participate
  inwardly in the large context of reality. Only such faith can
  enable us to cope with the enormous obstacles and fill us with
  the confidence of success.</p>
