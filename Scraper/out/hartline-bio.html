  <h1>Keffer Hartline - Keffer Hartline - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hartline.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Haldan Keffer Hartline</b> was born in
  Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, on December 22nd, 1903. His parents
  were teachers there in the State Normal School (now Bloomsburg
  State College) where he received his early education. His father,
  Daniel S. Hartline, was Professor of Biology, but a man whose
  wide interests also included Astronomy and Geology. It was
  through his father that Keffer became interested in Natural
  Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Keffer Hartline attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania,
  graduating in 1923 (B. Sc.). His college teacher of biology,
  Beverly W. Kunkel, encouraged him to undertake research; his
  first scientific paper concerned visual responses of land
  isopods. Summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole added to
  his biological training; there he was especially influenced by
  Jacques Loeb, Selig Hecht, and Merkel H. Jacobs.<br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1923 he entered the Johns Hopkins School where
  he was encouraged to continue his research interest in vision in
  the Department of Physiology under E. K. Marshall and C. D.
  Snyder. Dr. Snyder let him use his <a href=
  "../1924/press.html">Einthoven string galvanometer</a> with which
  Hartline undertook the study of the retinal action potential
  using frogs, decerebrate cats and rabbits. He learned to obtain
  electroretinograms from intact animals, and recorded clearly
  recognizable retinal action potentials from human subjects. He
  also used intact insects for quantitative studies.<br>
  <br>
  After receiving his M. D. from Johns Hopkins in 1927 a National
  Research Council Fellowship (Medical Sciences) enabled him to
  study Mathematics and Physics so as to strengthen his background
  for future biophysical research. He spent two years in the
  Physics Department of Johns Hopkins taking courses and working as
  a student in the laboratory of A. H. Pfund; F. D. Murnaghan was
  his teacher of mathematics. In 1929 he received an Eldridge
  Reeves Johnson Traveling Fellowship from the University of
  Pennsylvania, for a continuation of his studies in Physics.
  He spent one semester with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">W. Heisenberg</a>'s seminar
  group in the University of Leipzig and two semesters attending
  lectures by A. Somerfeld at the University of Munich.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1931 Hartline returned to the United States
  taking a position at the University of Pennsylvania, in
  Philadelphia, in the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical
  Physics, which was under the directorship of Detlev W.Bronk. This
  was the start of a stimulating association with Bronk, which has
  continued to the present time.<br>
  <br>
  At the Johnson Foundation Hartline began his studies on the
  activity of single optic nerve fibers in the eye of the horseshoe
  crab, <i>Limulus</i>, recording the responses of receptor units
  under various conditions of stimulation and adaptation. In the
  mid 1930's he undertook the single fiber analysis of the optic
  responses of the vertebrate retina, principally in the eye of the
  frog. In the early 1940's Hartline worked on problems of night
  vision in human subjects. In 1940-1941 he was Associate Professor
  of Physiology at Cornell Medical College in New York City, but
  returned to the Johnson Foundation where he stayed until
  1949.<br>
  <br>
  In 1949 Hartline accepted a position at Johns Hopkins
  University as Professor of Biophysics and Chairman of the
  Thomas C. Jenkins Department of Biophysics. There, he began with
  his colleagues work on intracellular recording from receptor
  units in the <i>Limulus</i> eye. It was at that time that he took
  up the study of the inhibitory interaction in the <i>Limulus</i>
  retina, begun briefly several years before. In 1953 he accepted
  his present position as Professor at the Rockefeller
  University (then the Rockefeller Institute). Hartline was
  joined there, in 1954, by Floyd Ratliff and they have continued
  to the present time collaboration in their joint laboratory on
  the study of receptor properties and inhibitory interaction in
  the eye of <i>Limulus</i>, and on related aspects of visual
  physiology.<br>
  <br>
  Hartline was awarded the William H. Howell Award (Physiology) in
  1927; the Howard Crosby Warren Medal (Society of Experimental
  Psychologists) in 1948; an Sc. D. (hon.) from Lafayette College,
  1959; the Albert A. Michelson Award ( Case Institute of
  Technology) in 1964; a degree of LL. D. from the Johns Hopkins
  University in 1969; and an hon. D.Sc. from the University of
  Pennsylvania in 1971; the Lighthouse Award in 1969; hon. M.D.
  Albert-Ludwigs University, Freiburg im Breisgau,
  1971.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Hartline is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences; Foreign Member of the
  Royal
  Society (London); Member of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences; Member of the American
  Philosophical Society, American Physiological Society, Optical Society of
  America, Biophysical Society, etc.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936 Haldan Keffer Hartline married Elizabeth Kraus, daughter
  of the eminent chemist C. A. Kraus. At that time she was
  instructor in Comparative Psychology at Bryn Mawr College. They
  have three sons, Daniel Keffer, Peter Haldan, and Frederick
  Flanders. Daniel Keffer and Peter Haldan have positions in
  neurophysiology in the University of California at San Diego; Frederick
  Flanders is still engaged in graduate studies in the biological
  sciences.</p>
