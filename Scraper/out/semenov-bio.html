  <h1>Nikolay Semenov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="semenov.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Nikolai Nikolaevic Semenov</b> was
  born in Saratov on April 3, 1896. He graduated from Petrograd
  University in 1917 and in 1920 he took charge of the electron
  phenomena laboratory of the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute. He
  lectured at the Polytechnical Institute and was appointed
  Professor in 1928. In 1931, he became Director of the Institute
  of Chemical Physics of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences (which
  has moved to Moscow in 1943); from 1944 he has been a Professor
  at the Moscow
  State University.<br>
  <br>
  Semenov's outstanding work on the mechanism of chemical
  transformation includes an exhaustive analysis of the application
  of the chain theory to varied reactions and, more especially, to
  combustion processes. He proposed a theory of degenerate
  branching which led to a better understanding of the phenomena
  associated with the induction periods of oxidation processes.
  Semenov has made valuable contributions to the field of molecular
  physics; he has also carried out investigations on electron
  phenomena, dielectric breakdown and the propagation of explosive
  waves.<br>
  <br>
  Semenov has written two important books concerned with his work.
  <i>Chemical Kinetics and Chain Reactions</i> was published in
  1934 with an English edition in 1935. It was the first book in
  the U.S.S.R. to develop a detailed theory of unbranched and
  branched chain reactions in chemistry. <i>Some Problems of
  Chemical Kinetics and Reactivity</i>, first published in 1954,
  was revised in 1958; there are also English, American, German,
  and Chinese editions.<br>
  <br>
  He became a Corresponding Member of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
  Sciences in 1929 and Academician in 1932: he was awarded five
  Orders of Lenin and the Order of Red Banner of Labour. He is a
  member of the Chemical Society (London), Foreign Member of the
  Royal
  Society, and foreign member of the American, Indian, German,
  and Hungarian Academies of Sciences. He also holds Honorary
  Doctorate degrees of Oxford and Brussels Universities, and since 1960 he
  has been Chairman of the All-Union Society for Propagation of
  Political and Scientific Knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  He married Natalya Nikolaevna Semenova; they have one son and one
  daughter.</p>
