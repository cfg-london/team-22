  <h1>Julian Schwinger - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schwinger.jpg" class="bio-img"> Julian Schwinger was born on
  12th February 1918 in New York City. The principal direction of
  his life was fixed at an early age by an intense awareness of
  physics, and its study became an all-engrossing activity. To
  judge by a first publication, he debuted as a professional
  physicist at the age of sixteen. He was allowed to progress
  rapidly through the public school system of New York City.
  Through the kind interest of some friends, and especially
  <a href="../1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a> of Columbia
  University, he transferred to that institution, where he
  completed his college education. Although his thesis had been
  written some two or three years earlier, it was in 1939 that he
  received the Ph.D. degree.<br>
  <br>
  For the next two years he was at the University of
  California, Berkeley, first as a National Research Fellow and
  then as assistant to J.R. Oppenheimer. The outbreak of the
  Pacific war found Schwinger as an Instructor, teaching elementary
  physics to engineering students at Purdue
  University.<br>
  <br>
  War activities were largely confined to the Radiation Laboratory
  at the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Being a confirmed
  solitary worker, he became the night research staff. More
  scientific influences were also at work. He first approached
  electromagnetic radar problems as a nuclear physicist, but soon
  began to think of nuclear physics in the language of electrical
  engineering. That would eventually emerge as the effective range
  formulation of nuclear scattering. Then, being conscious of the
  large microwave powers available, Schwinger began to think about
  electron accelerators, which led to the question of radiation by
  electrons in magnetic fields. In studying the latter problem he
  was reminded, at the classical level, that the reaction of the
  electron's field alters the properties of the particle, including
  its mass. This would be significant in the intensive developments
  of quantum electrodynamics, which were soon to follow.<br>
  <br>
  With the termination of the war Dr. Schwinger accepted an
  appointment as Associate Professor at Harvard University. Two
  years later he became full Professor. That was also the year of
  his marriage to Clarice Carrol of Boston.<br>
  <br>
  In subsequent years, he worked in a number of directions, but
  there was a pattern of concentration on general theoretical
  questions rather than specific problems of immediate experimental
  concern, which were nearer to the center ot hls earlier work. A
  speculative approach to physics has its dangers, but it can have
  its rewards. Schwinger was particularly pleased by an
  anticipation, early in 1957, of the existence of two different
  neutrinos associated, respectively, with the electron and the
  muon. This has been confirmed experimentally only rather
  recently. A related and somewhat earlier speculation, that all
  weak interactions are transmitted by heavy, charged, unit-spin
  particles still awaits a decisive experimental test. Schwinger's
  policy of finding theoretical virtues in experimentally unknown
  particles has culminated recently in a revived concern with
  magnetically charged particles, which may also be involved in the
  understanding of strong interactions.<br>
  <br>
  In later years, Schwinger has followed his own advice about the
  practical importance of a phenomenological theory of particles.
  He has invented and systematically developed source theory, which
  deals uniformly with strongly interacting particles, photons, and
  gravitons, thus providing a general approach to all physical
  phenomena. This work has been described in two volumes published
  under the title "<i>Particles, Sources, and Fields</i>".<br>

  Awards and other honors include the first Einstein Prize (1951),
  the U.S. National Medal of Science (1964), honorary D.Sc. degrees
  from Purdue University (1961) and Harvard University (1962), and
  the Nature of Light Award of the U.S. National Academy of
  Sciences (1949). Prof. Schwinger is a member of the latter body,
  and a sponsor of the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic
  Scientists.</i></p>
