  <h1>Ralph M. Steinman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="steinman.jpg" class="bio-img">Ralph M. Steinman was born in Montreal, Canada, on 14 January 1943, the
second of four children. His father Irving, a Jewish immigrant from Eastern
Europe, and his mother Nettie owned a department store in Sherbrooke
near Montreal. His father wanted him to continue in the family business,
but in high school Ralph became interested in science. He received a B.S.
with honors from McGill University in 1963, and an M.D. magna cum laude
from Harvard Medical School in 1968. While at Harvard, he spent a year as
a research fellow in the laboratory of Elizabeth Hay, who introduced him to
cell biology and the immune system. During his internship and residency at
the Massachusetts General Hospital, Steinman met Claudia Hoeffel, who was
a medical social worker in the hospital. They married in 1971.</p>

<p>After completing his medical training, he was drawn to biomedical
  research. He joined The Rockefeller University in 1970 as a postdoctoral
  fellow in the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology headed by
  physician-scientists Zanvil A. Cohn and James G. Hirsch. This laboratory was
  founded by the premier microbiologist René Dubos, who recognized the need
  to study the host during infection. Dubos, Cohn, and Hirsch were Steinman’s
  ideal mentors whose approach was not limited to immunology but embraced
  cell biology and biochemistry. He spent his entire career at Rockefeller, where
  he was appointed assistant professor in 1972, associate professor in 1976, and
  professor in 1988. He was named Henry G. Kunkel Professor in 1995 and
  director of the Christopher Browne Center for Immunology and Immune
  Diseases in 1998.</p>
  
  <p>Steinman’s early research in collaboration with Cohn was an attempt to
    understand the white cells of the immune system that operate in a variety of
    ways to spot, apprehend, and destroy infectious microorganisms and tumor
    cells. In 1973, Steinman and Cohn discovered dendritic cells, a previously
    unknown class of immune cells that constantly formed and retracted their
    processes. This discovery changed the field of immunology.</p>
    
    <p>For the next four decades, until his death in 2011, Steinman’s laboratory was at the forefront of dendritic cell research. He and his colleagues
      established that dendritic cells are critical sentinels of the immune system
      that control both its innate and adaptive responses - from silencing to
      actively resisting its challenges. He also showed that dendritic cells are the 2
main initiators of T cell-mediated immune responses. Steinman’s deep
insights into medicine led him to take his dendritic cell research into the
treatment of human disease. His most recent studies were focused on the
interface of several diseases with the immune system and included clinical
studies using dendritic cell- and immune-based vaccines and therapies for
such medical conditions as graft rejection, resistance to tumors, autoimmune
diseases, and infections. In 2010, he initiated at The Rockefeller University
Hospital a phase I clinical trial with the first dendritic cell-targeted vaccine
against HIV.</p>

<p>Steinman’s dynamic personality, boundless energy, and persistent leadership during these four decades allowed him to build international collaborations with many immunologists and scientists in other fields and to create an
entire new field of dendritic cell biology. As part of his efforts in establishing
this science, he personally trained and mentored more than a hundred postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in his laboratory. He published some
450 scientific papers. Beginning in 1978, he became editor of the
  <em>Journal of Experimental Medicine</em> and was one of its guiding forces. He also served as advisory editor of Human Immunology, the <em>Journal of Clinical Immunology</em>,
the <em>Journal of Immunologic Methods</em> and the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</em>.</p>

<p>For the first two decades of Steinman’s research, dendritic cells were
  underappreciated, but by the mid-1990s, the scientific community began to
  recognize his work on their critical role in the immune system. Steinman
  received numerous honors, including the Freidrich-Sasse (1996), Emil von
  Behring (1996), and Robert Koch (1999) Prizes, the Rudolf Virchow (1997)
  and Coley (1998) Medals. In 2004, he received the New York City Mayor’s
  Award for Science and Technology. He was honored with the Gairdner
  Foundation International Award in 2003, the Albert Lasker Award for Basic
  Medical Research in 2007, the Albany Medical Prize in 2009, and the A.H.
  Heineken Prize for Medicine in 2010. He was awarded honorary degrees
  from the University of Innsbruck, Free University of Brussels, Erlangen
  University, and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He was elected a
  member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2001 and the Institute of
  Medicine in 2002. He was also a corresponding fellow of the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh. In 2012, the Ralph M. Steinman Center for Cancer Vaccines was
  established in his honor at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research in
  Dallas, Texas.</p>
  
<p>Steinman was a trustee of the Trudeau Institute in Saranac Lake, New
York. He also served as a scientific advisor to several organizations including the Charles A. Dana Foundation, the Campbell Family Institute of
Breast Cancer Research in Toronto, Canada, the M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center for Immunology Research in Houston, Texas, Baylor Institute for
Immunology Research, RIKEN Center for Allergy and Immunology Research
in Yokohama, Japan, and CHAVI Center for HIV-AIDS Vaccine Immunology,
Durham, North Carolina. Steinman was a member of the American Society
of Clinical Investigation, the American Society of Cell Biology, the American Association of Immunologists, the Harvey, the Kunkel, and the Practitioners’
Societies, and the Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p>

<p>Diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in March 2007, Steinman
believed that dendritic cells had the potential to fight his aggressive tumor.
With many collaborators and leading-edge technology, he designed dendritic
cell-based immunotherapies for himself that he thought might also advance
medical science. For four-and-a-half years after his diagnosis, he remained
quite healthy and continued to travel, lecture, and pursue new laboratory
studies. Steinman died on 30 September 2011, three days before his Nobel
Prize was announced. Unaware of his death at the time of its announcement,
the Nobel Committee made an unprecedented decision that his award would
stand. In addition to his wife Claudia, Steinman was survived by his three
children Adam, Alexis, and Lesley, three grandchildren Isadola, Syla, and
Robert; his mother Nettie; his brothers Seymour and Mark; his sister Joni; his
daughter-in-law Jenny and his son-in-law Joseph.</p>

<p>Claudia Steinman and her children have donated the entire proceeds of
  Dr. Steinman’s Nobel Prize to charity, $500,000 of which they are giving to
  the Cohn-Steinman Professorship at the Rockefeller University and $250,000
  to The Steinman Family Foundation to support the careers of young scientists and science educaion.</p>
