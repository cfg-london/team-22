  <h2>The Latin American Novel<br>
  Testimony of an Epoch</h2>

 

  <p>I would have preferred this meeting to have
  been called a colloquium instead of lecture - a dialogue of
  doubts and assertions on the subject that concerns us. Let us
  start by analysing the antecedents of Latin American literature
  in general, focusing our attention on those aspects that have
  most connection with the novel. Let us follow the sources back to
  the millenarian origins of indigenous literature in its three
  great moments: Maya, Aztec and Inca.<br>
  <br>
  The following question arises: Was there something resembling the
  novel among the indigenous peoples? I believe there was. The
  history of the original cultures of Latin America has more of
  what we in the western world call the novel than of history. It
  is necessary to bear in mind that the books of their history -
  their novels we would now say - were painted by the Aztecs and
  Mayas and preserved in a figurative form which we still do not
  understand by the Incas. This assumes the use of pictograms in
  which the voice of the reader - the indigenous do not distinguish
  between reading and reciting since for them it is the same thing
  - recited the text to the listeners in song form.<br>
  <br>
  The reader, reciting stories or 'great language', the only person
  who understood what the pictograms meant, carried out an
  interpretation, recreating them for the enlightenment of those
  who listened. Later, these painted stories become fixed in the
  memory of the listeners and pass in oral form from generation to
  generation until the alphabet brought by the Spanish fixes them
  in their native tongues with Latin characters or directly in
  Spanish. In this way indigenous texts come to our knowledge with
  very little exposure to European corruption. The reading of these
  documents is what has allowed us to affirm that, among the native
  Americans, history has more of the characteristics of the novel
  than of history. They are accounts in which reality is dissolved
  in fable, legend, the trappings of beauty and in which the
  imagination, by dint of describing all the reality that it
  contains, ends up re-creating a reality that we might call
  surrealist.<br>
  <br>
  This characteristic of the annulment of reality through
  imagination and the re-creation of a more transcendental reality
  is combined with a constant annulment of time and space as well
  as something more significant: the use and abuse of parallel
  expressions, i.e. the parallel use of different words to
  designate the same object, to convey the same idea and express
  the same feelings. I wish to draw attention to this point - the
  parallelism in the indigenous texts allows an exercise of nuances
  that we find hard to appreciate but which undoubtedly permitted a
  poetic gradation destined to induce certain states of
  consciousness which were taken to be magic.<br>
  <br>
  If we return to the theme of the origin of a literary genre,
  similar to the novel, among the pre-Colombian peoples it is
  necessary to link the birth of this novel form with the epic. The
  heroic legend, exceeding the possibilities of historical fiction,
  was sung by the rhapsodists - the great voices of the tribes or
  'cuicanimes' who toured the cities reciting the texts in order
  that the beauty of their songs would be disseminated among the
  peoples like the golden blood of their gods.<br>
  <br>
  These epic songs that are so abundant in pre-Columbian
  literature, and so little known, possess what we call 'fictional
  plot' and what the Spanish friars and missionaries termed
  'tricks'.<br>
  <br>
  These fictional tales were originally the testimony of past
  epochs; the memory and fame of high deeds that others on hearing
  would desire to emulate, this literature of reality and fable is
  broken in the instant of servitude and remains as one of the many
  broken vessels of those great civilisations. Other narratives
  will follow - in this same documentary form - recounting not the
  evidence of greatness but of misery, not the testimony of liberty
  but of slavery, no longer the statements of the masters but those
  of the subjects and a new, emerging American literature
  attempting to fill the empty silences of an epoch.<br>
  <br>
  However, the literary genres that flourished in the Iberian
  peninsulas - the realistic novel and the theatre - were not to
  put down roots here. On the contrary, it is the indigenous
  effervescence, the sap and the blood, river, sea and mirage that
  affects the first Spaniard to write the first great American
  'novel' for the 'True Story of the Events of the Conquest of New
  Spain' written by Bernal Diaz del Castillo deserves to be called
  no less. Is it not rather bold to describe as a 'novel' what that
  soldier called not history but 'true history'? But are not novels
  frequently the true history? I repeat the question: is it really
  boldness to describe as a novel the work of this illustrious
  chronicler?<br>
  <br>
  To those who might call me daring in my description I would
  invite them to enter the cadenced and panting prose of this
  versatile foot soldier and they will notice how - on entering
  into it - they gradually forget that what happened was reality
  and it will seem to them increasingly a work of pure imagination.
  Indeed, even Bernal himself says no less, next to the very walls
  of Tenochtitlan: "this seemed to be the work of enchantment that
  is recounted in the book of Amadis!" But this is the work of a
  Spaniard - it will be said - although the only thing Spanish
  about it is its having been written by a 'peninsular' resident in
  Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala - where that glorious
  manuscript is kept - and its having been composed in the old
  language of Castile although it partakes of that masquerade
  characteristic of indigenous literature. To Don Marcelino
  Menendez y Pelayo - this expert in classic Spanish literature -
  the taste of this prose is strange and the fact that it has been
  written by a soldier he finds surprising. It escapes this eminent
  writer that Bernal, at the age of eighty, had not only heard many
  texts of indigenous literature being recited, being influenced by
  it, but through osmosis had absorbed America and had already
  become American.<br>
  <br>
  But there is another more impressive parenthesis. In their last
  sorrowful cantos the indigenous peoples - now subjugated - call
  for justice and Bernal Diaz Castillo expresses his deepest
  feelings in a chronicle which is a howl of protest at the
  oblivion into which they fell after being "fought and
  conquered."<br>
  <br>
  As from this moment, all Latin American literature, in song and
  novel, not only becomes a testimony for each epoch but also, as
  stated by the Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, an
  "instrument of struggle". All the great literature is one of
  testimony and vindication, but far from being a cold dossier
  these are moving pages written by one conscious of his power to
  impress and convince.<br>
  <br>
  Will the south give us a <i>mestizo?</i> The <i>mestizo</i> par
  excellence since - in order for nothing to be lacking - he was
  the first American exile: Inca Garcilaso. This Creole exile
  follows the indigenous voices already extinguished in his
  denunciation of the oppressors of Peru. The Inca offers us in his
  magnificent prose not only the native American - nor only the
  Spanish - but the mixture materialised in the fusion of the
  bloods, and in the same demand for life and justice.<br>
  <br>
  To start with nobody discerns the 'message' in the prose of Inca.
  This will be clarified during the struggle for independence. Inca
  will then appear with the dignity of the Indian that knew how to
  make fun of the empire of "the two knives" - that is to say civil
  and ecclesiastical censorship. The Spanish authorities, slow to
  fathom the message containing so much spirit, imagination and
  melancholy, wisely order the confiscation of the story of Inca
  Garcilaso where the Indians have "learned so many dangerous
  things."<br>
  <br>
  Not only poetry and works of fiction bear witness. The least
  expected authors such as Francisco Javier Clavijero, Francisco
  Javier Alegre, Andres Calvo, Manuel Fabri, Andres de Guevara gave
  birth to a literature of exiles which is - and will continue to
  be - a testimony of its epoch.<br>
  <br>
  Even the Guatemalan poet Rafael Land&iacute;var has his form of
  rebellion. His protest is silence - he calls the Spanish
  'Hispani' without qualifying the adjective. We refer to
  Land&iacute;var because, despite being the least known, he should
  be considered the standard bearer of American literature as the
  authentic expression of our lands, our people and landscapes.
  According to Pedro Henriquez-Urena, "among the poets of the
  Spanish colonies he is the first master of landscape, the first
  to break definitively with the conventions of the Renaissance and
  discover the characteristic features of nature in the New World -
  its flora and fauna, its countryside and mountains, its lakes and
  waterfalls. In his descriptions of customs, of the crafts and the
  games there is an amusing vivacity and - throughout the poem - a
  deep sympathy and understanding of the survival of the original
  cultures."<br>
  <br>
  In 1781 in Modena, Italy, there appeared under the title of
  'Rusticatio Mexicana' a poetic work of 3,425 Latin hexameters, in
  10 cantos, written by Rafael Land&iacute;var. One year later in
  Bologna the second edition appeared. The poet called by Menendez
  y Pelayo 'the Virgil of the modern age' proclaimed to the
  Europeans the excellence of the land, the life and the peoples of
  America. He was concerned for the people of the Old World to know
  that E1 Jorullo, a Mexican volcano, could rival Vesuvius and
  Etna, that the waterfalls and caves of San Pedro Martir in
  Guatemala were the equals of the famous fountains of Castalia and
  Aretusa and referring to the cenzontle - the bird whose song has
  400 tones - he elevated it above the realm of the
  nightingale.<br>
  <br>
  He sings the praises of the countryside, of the gold and silver
  that was filling the world with valuable coins and the sugar
  loaves offered at royal tables.<br>
  <br>
  His poem is not short of statistics concerning the riches of
  America. He cites the droves of cattle, the flocks of sheep, the
  herds of goats and pigs, the sources of medicinal waters, the
  popular games - some unknown in Europe - and he does not hide the
  glory of the cocoa and chocolate of Guatemala. But there is
  something that we should be aware of in the song of Landivar;
  namely his love of the indigenous. The Indian, for Landivar, is
  the race that succeeds in everything, he describes the marvels of
  the floating gardens created by the Indians, he holds them up as
  examples of charm and skill without forgetting their great
  sufferings. In this way he imparts poetic substance - in
  naturalistic poetry far from symbolism - to a fact that has
  always been denied: the superiority of the American Indian as
  farmer, as craftsman and worker.<br>
  <br>
  To the image of the bad Indian, lazy and immoral that was so
  widely propagated in Europe and accepted in America by those who
  exploit it Land&iacute;var opposes the picture of the Indian on
  whose shoulders has weighed - and continues to weigh - the burden
  of labour in America. And he does not do it by simply stating it
  - in which case we would have the right or not of believing it.
  In his poem we see the Indian on board his charming canoe,
  transporting his goods or travelling and we admire him extracting
  the purple and scarlet, laying out the snowy worms that produce
  the silk, holding on stubbornly to the rocks in order to remove
  the beautiful shellfish, patiently and doggedly ploughing,
  cultivating the indigo plant, extracting the silver from his
  native mines, exhausting the golden veins... <i>The Rusticatio of
  Land&iacute;var</i> confirms what we have said of the great
  American literature - it cannot accept a passive role while on
  our soil a famished people live in these abundant lands. In its
  content it is a form of novel in verse.<br>
  <br>
  Fifty years later, Andres Bello was to renovate the American
  adventure in his famous 'Silva', an immortal and perfect work in
  which the nature of the New World appears again with maize the
  leader - as haughty chief of the corn tribe - the cacao in 'coral
  urns', the coffee plants, the banana, the tropics in all their
  vegetable and animal power, contrasting the impoverished
  inhabitant with this grandiose vision 'of the rich soil.'<br>
  <br>
  Bello recalls Inca Garcilaso in his role as an exile, he is of
  the American lineage of Land&iacute;var, both represent the
  brilliant start of the great American odyssey in world
  literature. As from this moment the image of nature in the New
  World will awake in Europe an interest but it will never attain
  the incandescent fidelity that is achieved in the work of
  Land&iacute;var and Bello. A distorted vision of the marvels is
  offered us by Chateaubriand in 'Atala' and 'Les Natchez'.<br>
  <br>
  For the Europeans nature is a background without the
  gravitational force achieved by Creole romanticism. The romantics
  give nature a permanent presence in the creations of poets and
  novelists of the epoch. This is exemplified by Jos&eacute; Maria de
  Heredia singing of the Niagara Falls and Estaban Echeverria
  describing the desert in 'La Cautiva' to mention just two.<br>
  <br>
  Latin American romanticism was not only a literary school but a
  patriotic flag. Poets, historians and novelists divide their days
  and nights between political activities and dreaming their
  creations. Never has it been more beautiful to be a poet in
  America! Amongst the poets influenced by the <i>Patria</i>
  converted in Muse are Jos&eacute; M&aacute;rmol, author of one of the
  most widely read novels in Latin America - 'Amalia'. The pages of
  this book have been turned by our febrile and sweaty fingers when
  we suffered in our very bones the dictatorships that have plagued
  Central America. The critics, when referring to the novel of
  M&aacute;rmol, point out inconsistencies and carelessness without
  realising that a work of this type is written with a madly
  beating heart - pulsations that leave in the sentence, in the
  paragraph, on the page that abnormal heartbeat reflecting the
  distortion of the life force that troubled the entire country. We
  are in the presence of one of the most passionate examples of the
  American novel. Despite the years 'Amelia' - the imprecations of
  Jos&eacute;, M&aacute;rmol - continue to move readers to such an
  extent as to represent an act of faith.<br>
  <br>
  It is at this very moment that the voice of Sarmiento is heard
  posing his famous dilemma at the threshold of the century:
  'civilisation or barbarism'. Indeed, Sarmiento himself will be
  startled when he becomes aware that 'Facundo' turns his arms
  against him and against everyone, declaring himself to be the
  authentic representative of Creole America, of the America that
  refuses to die and attempts to break - with a breast already
  hardened - the antithetical scheme of civilisation and barbarism
  in order to find between these two extremes the point where the
  American peoples are able to find their authentic personality
  with their own essential values.<br>
  <br>
  In the middle of the last century another romantic, no less
  passionate, appears in Guatemala: Jos&eacute; Batres Mont&uacute;far.
  In the midst of tales of festive character the reader feels that
  he should forget the fiesta to listen to the poetry. The immortal
  Jos&eacute; Batres Mont&uacute;far, with abundant charm tinged with
  bitterness, was able to get to the core of issues that already -
  in the middle of the past century - were highly charged.<br>
  <br>
  Another voice was to ring out from north to south, that of
  Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;. His presence was felt, whether as an exile
  or in his beloved Cuba, the fre of his speech as poet or
  journalist being combined with the example of his
  sacrifice.<br>
  <br>
  The 20th century is full of poets, poets that have nothing more
  to say with very few exceptions. Among the latter stand out the
  immortal Rub&eacute;n Dar&iacute;o and Juan Ram&oacute;n Molina from
  Honduras. The poets flee from reality, maybe because this is one
  of the ways of being a poet. But there is nothing living in much
  of their work which instead tend towards garrulity.<br>
  <br>
  They are ignorant of the clear lesson of the native rhapsodists,
  they are forgetful of the colonial craftsmen of our great
  literature, satisfied with the bloodless imitation of the poetry
  of other latitudes and ridicule those who sang the bold gestures
  of the liberation struggle, considering them dazzled by a local
  patriotism.<br>
  <br>
  It is only when the First World War is passed that a handful of
  men - men and artists - embark on the reconquest of their own
  tradition. In their encounter with the indigenous peoples they
  drop anchor in their Spanish home port and return with the
  message that they have to deliver to the future.<br>
  <br>
  Latin American literature will be reborn under other signs - no
  longer that of verse. Now the prose is tactile, plural and
  irreverent in its attitude to conventions - to serve the purpose
  of this new crusade whose first move was to plunge into reality
  not so as to objectify but rather to penetrate the facts in order
  to identify fully with the problems of humanity. Nothing human -
  nothing which is real - will be foreign to this literature
  inspired by contact with America. And this is the case of the
  Latin American novel. Nobody doubts that the Latin American novel
  is at the leading edge of its genre in the world. It is
  cultivated in all our countries, by writers of different
  tendencies, which means that in the novel everything is forged
  from American material - the human witness of our historic
  moment.<br>
  <br>
  We, the Latin American novelists of today, working within the
  tradition of engagement with our peoples which has enabled our
  great literature to develop - our poetry of substance - also have
  to reclaim lands for our dispossessed, mines for our exploited
  workers, to raise demands in favour of the masses who perish in
  the plantations, who are scorched by the sun in the banana
  fields, who turn into human bagasse in the sugar refineries. It
  is for this reason that - for me - the authentic Latin American
  novel is the call for all these things, it is the cry that echoes
  down the centuries and is pronounced in thousands of pages. A
  novel that is genuinely ours; determined and loyal - in its pages
  - to the cause of the human spirit, to the fists of our workers,
  to the sweat of our rural peasants, to the pain for our
  undernourished children; calling for the blood and the sap of our
  vast lands to run once more towards the seas to enrich our
  burgeoning new cities.<br>
  <br>
  This novel shares - consciously or unconsciously - the
  characteristics of the indigenous texts; their freshness and
  power, the numismatic anguish in the eyes of the Creoles who
  awaited the dawn in the colonial night, more luminous however
  than this night that threatens us now. Above all, it is the
  affrmation of the optimism of those writers that defied the
  Inquisition, opening a breach in the conscience of the people for
  the march of the Liberators.<br>
  <br>
  The Latin American novel, our novel, cannot betray the great
  spirit that has shaped - and continues to shape - all our great
  literature. If you write novels merely to entertain - then burn
  them! This might be the message delivered with evangelical
  fervour since if you do not burn them they will anyway be erased
  from the memory of the people where a poet or novelist should
  aspire to remain. Just consider how many writers there have been
  who - down the ages - have written novels to entertain! And who
  remembers them now? On the other hand, how easy it is to repeat
  the names of those amongst us who have written to bear
  witness.<br>
  <br>
  To bear witness. The novelist bears witness like the apostle.
  Like Paul trying to escape, the writer is confronted with the
  pathetic reality of the world that surrounds him - the stark
  reality of our countries that overwhelms and blinds us and,
  throwing us to our knees, forces us to shout out: WHY DO YOU
  PERSECUTE ME? Yes, we are persecuted by this reality that we
  cannot deny, which is lived in the flesh by the people of the
  Mexican revolution, embodied in persons such as Mariano Azuela,
  Agustin Yanez and Juan Rulfo whose convictions are as sharp as a
  knife; those who share with Jorge Icaza, Ciro Alegr&iacute;a,
  Jes&uacute;s Lara the shout of protest against the exploitation and
  abandonment of the Indian; those who with Romulo Gallegos in
  'Done B&aacute;bara' create for us our Prometheus. Here is Horacio
  Quiroga who frees us from the nightmare of the tropics, a
  nightmare that is as peculiar to him as his style is American.
  'Los ros profundos' of Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Arguedas, the 'Rio
  oscuro' of the Argentinian Alfredo Varela, 'Hijo de hombre' of
  the Paraguayan Roa Bastos and 'La ciudad y los perros' of the
  Peruvian <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2010/">Vargas Llosa</a> make us see how the life-blood of the
  working people is drained in our lands.<br>
  <br>
  Mancisidor takes us to the oil fields to which are drawn -
  leaving their homes - the inhabitants of 'Cases muertas' of
  Miguel Otero Silva... David Vinas confronts us with the tragic
  Patagonia, Enrique Wernicke sweeps us along with the waters that
  overwhelm whole communities while Verbitsky and Mar&iacute;a de
  Jes&uacute;s lead us to the miserable shanty towns, the Dantesque
  and subhuman quarters of our great cities...<br>
  <br>
  Teitelboim in 'E1 hijo del salitre' tells us of the gruelling
  work in the saltpetre mines while Nicomedes Guzman makes us share
  in the lives of the children in the Chilean working class
  districts. We feel the countryside of E1 Salvador in 'Jaragua' of
  Napole&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez Ruiz and our small villages in
  'Cenizas del Izalco' of Flakol and Clarivel Alegria. We cannot
  think of the pampas without speaking of 'Don Segundo Sombra' by
  Guiraldes nor speak of the jungle without 'La voragine' of
  Eustasio Rivera, nor of the Negroes: without Jorge Amado, nor of
  the Brazilian plains without the 'Gran Sertao' of Guimaraes Rosa,
  nor of the plains of Venezuela without Ram&oacute;n D&iacute;az
  S&aacute;nchez.<br>
  <br>
  Our books do not search for a sensationalist or horrifying effect
  in order to secure a place for us in the republic of letters. We
  are human beings linked by blood, geography and life to those
  hundreds, thousands, millions of Latin Americans that suffer
  misery in our opulent and rich American continent. Our novels
  attempt to mobilise across the world the moral forces that have
  to help us defend those people. The <i>mestizo</i> process was
  already advanced in our literature and in rediscovering America
  it lent a human dimension to the grandiose nature of the
  continent. But this is a nature neither for the gods as in the
  texts of the Indians, nor a nature for heroes as in the writings
  of the romantics, but a nature for men and women in which the
  human problems will be addressed again with vigour and
  audacity.<br>
  <br>
  As true Latin Americans the beauty of expression excites us and -
  for this reason - each one of our novels is a verbal feat.
  Alchemy is at work. We know it. It is no easy task to understand
  in the executed work all the effort and determination invested in
  the materials used - the words.<br>
  <br>
  Yes, I say words - but by what laws and rules they have been
  transformed! They have been set as the pulse of worlds in
  formation. They ring like wood, like metals. This is
  onomatopoeia. In the adventure of our language the first aspect
  that demands attention is onomatopoeia. How many echoes -
  composed or disintegrated - of our landscape, our nature are to
  be found in our words, our sentences. The novelist embarks on a
  verbal adventure, an instinctive use of words. One is guided
  along by sounds. One listens, listens to the characters.<br>
  <br>
  Our best novels do not seem to have been written but spoken.
  There is verbal dynamics in the poetry enclosed in the very word
  itself and that is revealed first as sound and afterwards as
  concept.<br>
  <br>
  This is why the great Spanish American novels are vibrantly
  musical in the convulsion of the birth of all the things that are
  born with them.<br>
  <br>
  The adventure continues in the confluence of the languages.
  Amongst the languages spoken by the people, in which the Indian
  languages are represented, there is an admixture of the European
  and Oriental languages brought by the immigrants to
  America.<br>
  <br>
  Another language is going to rain its sparkle over sounds and
  words. The language of images. Our novels seem to be written not
  only with words but with images. Quite a few people when reading
  our novels see them cinematically. And this is not because they
  pursue a dramatic statement of independence but because our
  novelists are engaged in universalising the voice of their
  peoples with a language rich in sounds, rich in fable and rich in
  images.<br>
  <br>
  This is not a language artificially created to provide scope for
  the play of the imagination or so-called poetic prose; it is a
  vivid language that preserves in its popular speech all the
  lyricism, the imagination, the grace, the high-spiritidness that
  characterise the language of the Latin American novel.<br>
  <br>
  The poetic language which nourishes our novelistic literature is
  more or less its breath of life. Novels with lungs of poetry,
  lungs of foliage, lungs of rich vegetation. I believe that what
  most attracts non-American readers is what our novels have
  achieved by means of a colourful, brilliant language without
  falling into the merely picturesque, the spell of onomatopoeia
  cast by representing the music of the countryside and sometimes
  the sounds of the indigenous languages, the ancestral smack of
  those languages that flourish unconsciously in the prose that is
  used. There is also the importance of the word as absolute
  entity, as symbol. Our prose is distinguished from Castilian
  syntax because the word - in our novels - has a value of its own,
  just as it had in the indigenous languages. Word, concept, sound;
  a rich fascinating transposition. Nobody can understand our
  literature, our poetry if the power of enchantment is removed
  from the word.<br>
  <br>
  Word and language enable the reader to participate in the life of
  our novelistic creations. Unsettling, disturbing, forcing the
  attention of the reader who - forgetting his daily life - will
  enter into the situations and personalities of a novel tradition
  that retains intact its humanistic values. Nothing is used to
  detract from mankind but rather to perfect it and this is perhaps
  what wins over and unsettles the reader, that which transforms
  our novel into a vehicle of ideas, an interpreter of peoples
  using as instrument a language with a literary dimension, with
  imponderable magical value and profound human projection.</p>
