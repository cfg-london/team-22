  <h1>Renato Dulbecco - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="dulbecco.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born in
  Catanzaro, Italy, from a Calabrese mother and a Ligurian father.
  I stayed in that city for a short time; my father was called into
  the army (World War I) and we moved to the north, Cuneo and
  Torino. At the end of the war my father, who was in the "Genio
  Civile", was sent to Imperia, Liguria, where we stayed for many
  years. The life I remember begins at Imperia, where I went to
  school, including the Ginnasio-Liceo "De Amicis". What I remember
  most of that period, besides my family and the few friends, was
  the rocky beach where I spent most of my time during the summer
  holiday, and a small meteorological observatory, where I used to
  spend lots of my free time throughout the year. There I developed
  a strong liking for physics, which I put to good use by building
  an electronic seismograph, probably one of the first of its kind,
  which actually worked.<br>
  <br>
  I graduated from high school at 16 (1930) and went to the
  University in Torino. Although
  I liked especially physics and mathematics for which I had
  considerable talent, I decided to study medicine. This profession
  had for me a strong emotional appeal, which was reinforced by
  having an uncle who was an excellent surgeon.<br>
  <br>
  In Torino I was a very successful student, but I soon realized
  that I was interested in biology more than in applied medicine.
  So I went to work with Giuseppe Levi, the professor of Anatomy,
  where I learned Histology and the rudiments of cell culture. For
  my degree, however, I went to morbid anatomy and pathology. In
  Levi's laboratory I met two students who later had a strong
  influence on my life: <a href="../1969/index.html">Salvador
  Luria</a> and <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1986/index.html">Rita
  Levi-Montalcini</a>.<br>
  <br>
  All through the student years I was at the top of my class
  although I was two years younger than everybody else.<br>
  <br>
  After taking my MD degree in 1936 I was called up for military
  service as a medical officer. In 1938 I was discharged and
  returned to pathology. A year later, however, I was called up
  again because of the Second World War. I was sent briefly to the
  French front, and a year later to Russia. There I had a narrow
  escape on the front of the Don during a major Russian offensive
  in 1942: I was hospitalized for several months and sent home.
  When Mussolini's government collapsed and Italy was taken over by
  the German army I hid in a small village in Piemonte and joined
  the Resistance, as physician of the local partisan units. I
  continued to visit the Institute of Morbid Anatomy in Torino
  where I joined in underground political activities together with
  Giacomo Mottura, a senior colleague. I was part of the "Committee
  for National Liberation" of the city of Torino, and became a
  councillor of that city in the first postwar city council.
  However, the life of routine politics was not for me and within
  months I left that position to return to the laboratory. I also
  went back to school, enrolling in regular courses in physics,
  which I pursued for the next two years.<br>
  <br>
  I moved back to Levi's Institute and worked together with
  Levi-Montalcini, who encouraged me to go to the USA to work in
  modern biology. My dream was to work in genetics of some very
  simple organism, possibly using radiations. This dream became a
  reality after Luria, who had been in the USA since the beginning
  of the war, and was working in this very field, came in the
  summer of 1946 to Torino. He encouraged me and offered me a small
  salary for working in his group. I was urged in this direction by
  Rita Levi-Montalcini, who was herself preparing to go to another
  laboratory in USA. So in the autumn 1947 we both embarked for the
  US.<br>
  <br>
  I went to work with Luria in Bloomington, Indiana, where I shared with him a
  small laboratory under the roof, to be soon joined by <a href=
  "../1962/index.html">Jim Watson</a>. Within a year I had made two
  good pieces of work, using my mathematical knowledge, and
  discovered photoreactivation of phage inactivated by ultraviolet
  light. This attracted the interest of <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Max Delbr&uuml;ck</a>, who offered me a job
  in his group at Caltech.<br>
  <br>
  I moved to Caltech in the summer 1949. I remember that memorable
  trip from Indiana to California with my family in an old car,
  with our limited possessions in a small trailer behind. I was
  fascinated by the beauty and immensity of the USA and the
  kindness of its people. Reaching the Pacific Ocean in Oregon was
  like arriving at a new world, an impression that continued and
  increased as we made our way south to Pasadena. I resolved at
  that time that I would not like to live anywhere else in the
  world - a resolution that I changed only some twenty-three years
  later.<br>
  <br>
  At Caltech I continued to work with phages for a few years. One
  day I was told by Delbr&uuml;ck that a rich citizen had given
  Caltech a fund for work in the animal virus field. He asked me
  whether I was interested. My medical background and the
  experience gained in Levi's laboratory came back to me and I
  accepted. After visiting the major centers of animal virus work
  in the US I set out to discover the way to assay animal viruses
  by a plaque technique, similar to that used for phages, using
  cell cultures. Within less than a year, I worked out such a
  method, which opened up animal virology to quantitative work. I
  used the technique for studying the biological properties of
  poliovirus. These successes brought me an appointment first to
  associate professor, then to full professor at Caltech.<br>
  <br>
  In the late fifties I had as a student <a href=
  "index.html">Howard Temin</a>, who, together with Harry Rubin,
  then a postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory, worked on the Rous
  Sarcoma Virus. Their work started my interest in the tumor virus
  fields. I myself started working on an oncogenic virus, polyoma
  virus, in 1958, and continued until now. This work has led to
  discovering many aspects of the interaction of this virus (and of
  SV40) with the host cells in lytic infection and
  transformation.<br>
  <br>
  I moved from Caltech to the Salk Institute in 1962, and in 1972 to the
  Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories in
  London. One of the reasons for the latter move was the
  opportunity to work in the field of human cancer.<br>
  <br>
  My work throughout the years has been strongly influenced by my
  associates. Giuseppe Levi taught me the essential value of
  criticism in scientific work, Rita Levi-Montalcini helped me to
  determine my goals at an early stage; Salvador Luria introduced
  me to viruses; <a href="../1946/index.html">Herman Muller</a>, at
  the University of Indiana taught me the significance of Genetics;
  Max Delbr&uuml;ck helped me understand the scientific method and
  the goals of biology, and Marguerite Vogt
  contributed to my knowledge of animal cell cultures. Perhaps more
  important than all this, the daily interaction through the years
  with a continuously changing group of young investigators shaped
  my work. For although I had general goals, the actual path
  followed by my research was pragmatically determined by what
  could be done at any given time, and my young collaborators were
  an essential part of this process. I always did as much as
  possible of the experimental work with my own hands, but in the
  later part of my research career this became progressively less
  feasible, both because the demand on my time increased and
  because the increasing technical sophistication and complexities
  of the experiments demanded a great deal of specialized
  skills.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1962 my scientific life has had the support of my second
  wife, Maureen, who for some years helped in my experiments.
  Without her affectionate encouragement and sound advice I doubt
  whether I would have been able to accomplish what I have
  done.</p>
