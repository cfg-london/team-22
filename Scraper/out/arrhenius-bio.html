  <h1>Svante Arrhenius - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="arrhenius.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Svante August Arrhenius</b> was born on February
  19, 1859, the son of Svante Gustaf Arrhenius and Carolina
  Christina Thunberg. His ancestors were farmers; his uncle became
  Professor of Botany and Rector of the Agricultural High School at Ultuna near Uppsala and
  later Secretary of The Swedish Academy of Agriculture. His father
  was a land surveyor employed by the University of
  Uppsala and in charge of its estates at Vik, where Svante was
  born. The family moved to Uppsala in 1860. The boy was educated
  at the Cathedral school where the rector was a good physics
  teacher. From an early age Svante had shown an aptitude for
  arithmetical calculations, and at school he was greatly
  interested in mathematics and physics. In 1876 he entered the
  University of Uppsala, studying mathematics, chemistry and
  physics. The practical instruction in physics was not of the
  best, and in 1881 he went to Stockholm to work under Professor E.
  Edlund at the Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Here, Arrhenius began by assisting Edlund in his work on
  electromotive force measurements in spark discharges but soon
  moved to an interest of his own. This resulted in his thesis
  (1884) <i>Recherches sur la conductibilit&eacute; galvanique des
  &eacute;lectrolytes</i> (Investigations on the galvanic
  conductivity of electrolytes). From his results the author
  concluded that electrolytes, when dissolved in water, become to
  varying degrees split or dissociated into electrically opposite
  positive and negative ions. The degree to which this dissociation
  occurred depended above all on the nature of the substance and
  its concentration in the solution - being more developed the
  greater the dilution. The ions were supposed to be the carriers
  of the electric current, e.g. in electrolysis, but also of the
  chemical activity. The relation between the actual number of ions
  and their number at great dilution (when all the molecules were
  dissociated) gave a quantity of special interest ("activity
  constant").<br>
  <br>
  The idea of a connection between electricity and chemical
  affinity, once advocated by Berzelius, had, however, so
  completely vanished from the general consciousness of scientists
  that the value of Arrhenius' publication was not well understood
  by the science faculty at Uppsala, where the dissertation took
  place. On the other hand, Otto Pettersson, Professor of Chemistry
  at Stockholms
  H&ouml;gskola, emphasized the originality of the
  dissertation<a href="#fotnot">*</a>, and <a href=
  "../1909/index.html">Wi. Ostwald</a> travelled to Uppsala to make
  the acquaintance of the young author. The fundamental importance
  of Arrhenius' work was thus made clear, and at the end of 1884 he
  got a docentship at Uppsala in physical chemistry - the first in
  Sweden in this new branch of science. Through Edlund's influence
  he was awarded a travelling fellowship from the Academy of
  Sciences which enabled him to work in 1886 with Ostwald in Riga
  and with Kohlrausch in W&uuml;rzburg. In 1887 he was with
  Boltzmann in Graz and in 1888 he worked with <a href=
  "../1901/index.html">van 't Hoff</a> in Amsterdam. During these
  years Arrhenius was able to prove the influence of the
  electrolytic dissociation on the osmotic pressure, the lowering
  of the freezing point and increase of the boiling point of
  solutions containing electrolytes. Later on he studied its
  importance in connection with biological problems such as the
  relationship between toxins and antitoxins, serum therapy, its
  role for digestion and absorption as well as for the gastric and
  pancreatic juices. The paramount importance of the electrolytic
  dissociation theory is today universally acknowledged, even if
  certain modifications have been found necessary.<br>
  <br>
  In 1891, Arrhenius declined a professorship offered to him from
  Giessen, Germany, and soon afterwards he obtained a lectureship
  in physics at Stockholms H&ouml;gskola. In 1895 he became
  Professor of Physics there. He was in addition Rector from 1897
  to 1905, when he retired from the professorship. He had got an
  invitation to a professorship in Berlin, and the Academy of
  Sciences then decided (1905) to start a Nobel Institute for
  Physical Chemistry with Arrhenius as its chief. Initially he had
  to work in a rented flat, but a new building was inaugurated in
  1909. A large number of collaborators came to him from Sweden and
  from other countries, and helped to give his ideas wider
  currency.<br>
  <br>
  In 1900 Arrhenius published his <i>L&auml;robok i teoretisk
  elektrokemi</i> (Textbook of theoretical electrochemistry), in
  1906 followed <i>Theorien der Chemie</i> (Theories of Chemistry)
  and <i>Immunochemistry</i> and in 1918 the Silliman lectures
  <i>Theories of solutions</i>. He took a lively interest in
  various branches of physics, as illustrated by his theory of the
  importance of the CO<sub>2</sub>-content of the atmosphere for
  the climate, his discussion of the possibility that radiation
  pressure might enable the spreading of living spores through the
  universe (panspermy) and by his various contributions to our
  knowledge of the northern lights. In 1903 appeared his
  <i>Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik</i> (Textbook of cosmic
  physics).<br>
  <br>
  Many lectures and short publications gave witness of his interest
  and capacity for writing for the general public. Especially
  during the last decades of his life he published a number of
  popular books, which were usually translated into several
  languages and appeared in numerous editions. To these belong
  <i>V&auml;rldarnas utveckling</i> (1906, Worlds in the Making),
  <i>Stj&auml;rnornas &Ouml;den</i> (1915, Destiny of the Stars)
  and others. In 1913 appeared <i>Smittkopporna och deras
  bek&auml;mpande</i> (Smallpox and its combating) and in 1919
  <i>Kemien och det moderna livet</i> (Chemistry and modern
  Life).<br>
  <br>
  Arrhenius was elected a Foreign member of the Royal Society in
  1911, and was awarded the Society's Davy medal and also the
  Faraday Medal of the Chemical Society (1914). Among the many
  tokens of distinction that he received were honorary degrees from
  the Universities of Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh,
  Greifswald, Groningen, Heidelberg, Leipzig and Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  Arrhenius was a contented man, happy in his work and in his
  family life. During the First World War, he made successful
  efforts to release and repatriate German and Austrian scientists
  who had been made prisoners of war.<br>
  <br>
  He was twice married - in 1894 to Sofia Rudbeck, by whom he had
  one son, and in 1905 to Maria Johansson by whom he had one son
  and two daughters.<br>
  <br>
  He died at Stockholm on October 2, 1927, and is buried at
  Uppsala.</p>

  Stockholms H&ouml;gskola (High School of Stockholm) corresponded
  in those days to a science faculty of the universities, but it
  was a private foundation and did not have the right to hold
  examinations for degrees or to judge the value of theses. It was
  not until 1960 that the University of Stockholm, with its many
  faculties, was established by the State.</p>
