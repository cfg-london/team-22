  <h2>A Contribution to the Physiology of the Capillaries</h2>

  <p>At the beginning of the 17th century,
  Harvey succeeded in demonstrating that the blood within an
  organism was in constant circulation, passing out from the heart,
  through the arteries, to all the various organs, and returning
  through the veins. About 50 years later, Malpighi, (and, at about
  the same time, Leeuwenhoek), discovered that the connection
  between the smallest branches of the arteries and the veins was
  not by random cavities between the organs, but by a network of
  extremely fine vessels - the capillaries, visible only under the
  microscope. These have therefore been known for about 250 years,
  and it had been obvious, almost from the first, that they were,
  in one sense, the most important element in the whole circulatory
  system. All exchange between the blood and the organs, of
  nutrient materials and waste products, of oxygen and carbon
  dioxide, takes place through their walls. In them the blood
  fulfils its real function. One could say that the whole
  circulatory machine exists for their sake. It is all the more
  remarkable that their physiological behaviour has not been
  investigated to any extent, and even now is comparatively little
  known, so little known in fact that it has been possible for me
  to make original contributions by nothing more than patient
  observation under the microscope and simple probing with fine
  needles.</p>

  <p>I believe that it is easiest for me to
  present the results of my investigations in this field by setting
  forth, and dealing with, the problems in the order in which they
  occurred to me. I therefore begin by discussing the provision of
  oxygen for the muscles. In a muscle the capillaries run along the
  length of the muscle fibres, as shown in Fig. 1, and the oxygen
  in the blood has to diffuse through the wall of the capillary
  into the muscle substance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Through comparing various researches, some
    by Verz&agrave;r, some by Lindhard and myself, into the utilization
    of oxygen by muscles and its dependence, partly on the oxygen
    pressure in the blood, partly on muscular activity, I came, in
    1915, to the conclusion that, either there must be very serious
    errors in the researches concerned, or the circulation in the
    capillaries must otherwise occur in an entirely different way
    from that which one normally visualized. The conventional picture
    is that shown in Fig. 1. All the capillaries are open, and of
    about the same width, so that the blood passes through all of
    them at about the same rate. This rate was thought to be
    regulated by the greater or lesser contraction of the small
    arteries, which convey blood to the capillaries. When the small
    arteries constricted, and offered high resistance, the blood came
    to flow slowly through all capillaries. When they dilated, the
    blood flow increased very strongly, as was known to occur during
    muscular activity.</p>

  <p>The conclusion to which I was forced, in
  order to reconcile the results of earlier researches, was this,
  that in a resting muscle the blood could not flow through all of
  the capillaries, but only through a small percentage of them,
  which, further, must be more or less regularly distributed
  throughout the muscle, as is shown in Fig. 2, which is a wholly
  schematic representation of capillaries in a cross-section of
  muscle. This conclusion was rather daring at that stage, because
  it necessarily implied that the capillaries were not, as had
  hitherto been supposed by nearly everyone, tubes which quite
  passively permitted the passage of blood, and whose bore was
  determined by their internal pressure, but must have independent
  powers of contraction. It was therefore essential to test this
  assumption experimentally before one could give it any
  credence.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By direct observation, under the
  microscope, of living muscle, some from the frog, some from small
  mammals, it was comparatively easy to determine that the number
  of visible capillaries, which is the same as the number of
  capillaries through which blood flows, was rather small in
  resting muscle, and only increases very appreciably when the
  muscle has been active for some seconds. However, the other
  important question, as to whether the open capillaries were
  approximately regularly distributed, or whether perhaps they
  became empty of blood by groups, when the arterial branch which
  supplied the group closed, this was not so easy to answer.</p>

  <p>Here I had to begin by counting the
  capillaries. When one had filled the vascular system by injecting
  a strongly coloured medium which later hardens, one can make
  preparations which show the filled vessels with very great
  clarity. Fig. 3 shows in this way an extremely coarse capillary
  network from the stomach of the frog. Fig. 4 is a cross-section,
  approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, of muscle from the horse, in
  which the individual capillaries show themselves as small black
  dots between the muscle fibres, and from such a preparation one
  can count directly how many capillaries are found in a
  cross-section of a given size, say, one square mm. The counts I
  have carried out now show that the numbers vary appreciably in
  different animals, being comparatively low in the cold-blooded,
  high in the warm-blooded, particularly in small animals, where
  in, for example, a guinea-pig, one finds approximately 3,000 to
  the sq. mm, that is to say, in a cross-section of an area little
  larger than that of a pin's head. Because the length of each
  capillary is, on average, only 0.5 mm, the total number of
  capillaries in a large organism, such as the human, is incredibly
  large, and one can calculate, for example, that, if all the
  capillaries in a grown man formed a continuous tube, it could
  reach at least twice round the earth.</p>

  <p>In order to ascertain which of these many
  capillaries are open, and which are closed, at any one moment in
  the living organism, I dispersed a suspension of microscopic
  black particles (Indian ink was found to be the most suitable),
  in the blood of a living animal, by intravenous transfusion. When
  the animal is killed shortly afterwards, one finds Indian ink in
  those capillaries which were open at that particular moment,
  while the others will not be visible. Fig. 5 shows a muscle
  preparation from a frog, which had been subjected to muscular
  work immediately before transfusion with Indian ink, and in
  which, therefore, numerous capillaries were open. One can clearly
  see, in several places, the uncoloured corpuscles, outlined by
  the black-coloured blood plasma. The difference between active
  and resting muscle is brought out particularly clearly in such
  preparations, and it was found that, whether the open capillaries
  are few or numerous, their distribution is always fairly regular.
  Fig.6 shows an optical cross-section of a small area, ca. 1/80
  mm<sup>2</sup>, of three different muscles from the same
  guinea-pig. In the top specimen there are only 3 capillaries
  visible (a total of 200 per sq. mm). In the bottom specimen,
  which is from a respiration muscle which had been subjected to
  work right up to the moment the animal was killed, one finds
  2,500 open capillaries per sq. mm, or, in other words, nearly all
  the existing capillaries were in use. The illustration further
  shows that there is a great difference in the bore of the
  capillaries which are open. In resting muscle, all are very
  narrow, but in active muscle a number are rather wide. Comparison
  with the scale, which is marked in thousandths of a mm, shows
  that the diameter can decrease down to 2-3 thousandths of a mm.
  It is remarkable that blood corpuscles, which are round discs of
  7 <img src="my.gif" width="10" height="12" alt=" "> diameter,
  and 2 <img src="my.gif" width="10" height="12" alt=" ">
  thickness, can pass through such narrow channels, but Fig. 7
  shows this can occur, since they either roll up, or simply
  elongate into long sausage-shaped bodies.</p>

  <p>It clearly follows from the researches, of
  which I have now given a short account, that capillaries, at any
  rate in muscle, must obviously have powers of independent
  contraction, that, in other words, there must be a special
  capillary-motor system by which the bore of the capillaries can
  be regulated, but stating that fact raises a whole series of new
  questions: is variation in diameter of capillaries independent of
  the arteries, or does it follow from them? In what way can the
  capillaries be excited - chemical, electrical or mechanical? Are
  they under nervous control, and, if so, by which nerve? Can
  contractile histological elements be demonstrated in their walls?
  And so on. I have been engaged on these and other related
  questions for the past few years; research is in full progress at
  this moment, and there still seems so much to be done that I am
  tempted to use the metaphor from one of the works of my great
  fellow countryman, Nicolaus Steno - that our misgivings are like
  the heads of the Hydra of Lerna - every time one is cut off,
  several new ones arise. When one is in the middle of such work,
  where the working hypotheses are subject to constant change, it
  is extremely difficult to give a coherent report, and I must
  content myself with some examples of what has been achieved, and
  hint at conclusions which I hope to reach.</p>

  <p>First, I have attempted to solve the
  question as to whether capillary changes in the tongue of the
  frog are independent of the arteries. When the tongue of a frog
  is spread across a glass slide, it is a particularly suitable
  specimen for investigation. It is translucent and, on one side, a
  smooth mucous membrane is found, with a widely distributed
  capillary network, in which the individual capillaries are
  readily responsive to excitation, and where both the small
  arteries and veins can be observed directly. So long as the
  tongue is not excited, the great majority of these capillaries
  are closed, and the tongue is extremely pale and bloodless. It is
  well known that mechanical irritation of human skin by, for
  example, a scratch from a needle, produces a red streak, because
  the vessels fill with blood. A corresponding reaction can be
  produced very easily on the tongue of the frog, and under the
  microscope one can show that this depends, in the first instance,
  on capillary dilation, and one can bring about dilation of a
  single capillary, or part of a capillary. Fig. 8 shows such a
  capillary, part in uninfluenced condition, part after it has been
  lightly scratched in the middle. Fig.9 shows how it is further
  possible to find a completely closed capillary by careful
  scratching along a tiny venous branch (<i>v</i>). Blood passes
  out from the vein, and fills a part of the capillary, but does
  not flow through. By further scratching, one can obtain the
  capillary filled bit by bit, until it makes connection with an
  open capillary or artery, when flow suddenly commences. This
  experiment is important because it shows that the very low venous
  pressure is sufficient to fill capillaries whose walls are
  flaccid, while the high arterial pressure cannot force entry into
  a contracted capillary.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This behaviour is of great theoretical and
  practical importance. One can conclude from this and from many
  other analogous facts that, when appreciable capillary dilation
  occurs, it cannot be because of a simple rise in arterial blood
  pressure but must depend on change in condition of the capillary
  walls - a relaxation of their contractile elements. Widening of
  the arteries, on its own, only leads to a higher pressure in the
  capillaries, and a more rapid flow of blood through them. The
  greater or lesser red colouration of an organ depends, in the
  first instance, on the blood content of the capillaries, and one
  is therefore justified in concluding that, in all such cases,
  where there is marked redness, we are dealing with widened
  capillaries. However, only closer examination can give
  information as to whether, at the same time, the arteries are
  widened, and capillary pressure is also high. The capillaries in
  human skin become, for example, widened with strong heat and by
  excitation with strong light, and with different emotions, while
  cooling to a certain level and psychological depression results
  in contracted capillaries. The detailed mechanism of these
  reactions has not yet been studied. By various chemical agents,
  the capillaries can be made to dilate, and urethane, for example,
  in fairly strong solution, causes very great dilation of the
  capillaries of the frog's tongue, while it has no effect on the
  arteries. With urethane, one can produce the situation depicted
  in Fig. 10, where blood is pumped out from a very narrow artery
  into a capillary, which widens more and more, and retains all the
  blood corpuscles it receives. The capillary walls widen so
  forcefully that they become permeable to blood plasma, so that
  the capillary is at last filled by a solid mass of corpuscles.
  This observation is not irrelevant to the problem of oedema, and
  is at the moment being more closely investigated by my colleague,
  Dr. Harrop, along the lines of a determination of the size of
  openings which appear in the walls of the capillaries. Suitable
  substances are introduced into the blood through a vein. A group
  of capillaries in the tongue of the frog can be caused to dilate
  themselves, and observations made on the substance passing out
  through the capillary walls. If the colloidal dye "vital red" was
  administered, followed by application of urethane, a fine red
  stripe appeared alongside the widened capillary. If Indian ink,
  whose particles are on the borderline of the microscopically
  visible, was administered, the widened capillaries showed
  themselves closed towards that substance. We have similarly
  ascertained that molecules of starch can pass through.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A reaction corresponding to urethane
  dilation in the tongue of a frog is known from human skin, when
  it becomes reddish-blue under great cooling. We then also have
  strongly dilated capillaries and constricted arteries, so that
  the blood flow becomes very slow, and an essential part of the
  blood oxygen is used up during its passage, resulting in the blue
  colouration. This reaction is in line with many other vasomotor
  reactions in human skin, closely studied by Ebbecke, who
  described them concurrently with the commencement of my capillary
  researches, and derived a series of important conclusions. I am
  particularly anxious to emphasize Ebbecke's valuable work
  because, in my first report, I was not aware of its
  existence.</p>

  <p>A very large number of substances are found
  which produce capillary dilation and, by stronger action, oedema.
  Thus it is only necessary for me to consider the substances
  producing inflammation. I must draw attention, in this
  connection, to histamine, which Dale, in a very beautiful
  investigation, has shown to produce capillary dilation in various
  mammals. In the case of the frog's capillaries, histamine is
  virtually without action, and this fact illustrates in a striking
  way the observation that all capillaries do not at all show the
  same reactions. Even in the same animal there is a very great
  difference, which has naturally complicated the study, and added
  to its interest.</p>

  <p>I have closely investigated conditions in
  the skin and in the web of the frog. Here the capillary system is
  entirely different from that of the tongue. The capillary network
  is very dense and most capillaries are always open, though
  narrow. They react only weakly to chemical reagents which produce
  strong dilation in the tongue, and while very slight mechanical
  irritation can cause some dilation, as a rule they contract when
  the excitation is stronger. This is of interest because so far
  there has been no success in finding any stimulus which could
  produce contraction in the capillaries of the tongue.</p>

  <p>I describe as the capillaries' <i>tonus</i>
  the fact that they have the power of contracting to a greater or
  lesser extent, and of maintaining themselves contracted. In the
  frog's tongue, capillary tonus is very strongly developed, in
  that by far the majority are completely contracted. In the web,
  it is much weaker, in that the capillaries are only exceptionally
  completely closed. Most muscle capillaries take up an
  intermediate position. It can very easily be shown that blood
  flow is a condition for the maintenance of tonus, but that
  dependence on the blood is very varied. For example, if one stops
  the blood supply to the web for 10-20 minutes, all the
  capillaries dilate very strongly as soon as the blood is allowed
  to enter. They thus relax very rapidly when there is not a steady
  stream of fresh blood through them. If one performs the same
  experiment with the tongue, many hours must elapse before a
  similar reaction occurs, and even the slightest blood supply is
  adequate to maintain tonus. When the blood flow is restored
  following obstruction, marked hyperaemia results. This fact has
  long been known, and utilized in therapy. One has assumed that
  the alteration in the exchange of substances, which leads to
  oxygen deficiency and the production of acidic substances, was
  the causative factor. This explanation, at least so far as
  concerns the organs which I have investigated, is quite
  incorrect. They receive all the oxygen they require from the
  atmosphere, and, apart from this, we have found that much higher
  degrees of acidity than ever occur in the tissues are required to
  cause even the tongue's sensitive capillaries to dilate. The
  explanation must be sought in an entirely different direction.
  The blood must contain a substance which acts on the contractile
  elements in the capillary walls, and stimulates them to contract.
  To investigate, and if possible isolate this substance, is one of
  the problems which will be taken up in the near future.</p>

  <p>The presence of such a substance in the
  blood implies an extremely complete, regulatory mechanism, by
  which the blood is quite regularly distributed in the most
  economic way. If a capillary has been restricted of blood for a
  certain time, its tone will diminish, and blood will flow through
  until it can, once again, close itself. The open capillaries in
  the tongue or in muscle will thus continuously shift their place.
  Tissue elements which are at a given moment situated far from
  open capillaries and are therefore poorly supplied will receive
  blood passing close by a little while later. No part of the
  tissues will be deprived, and the blood is utilized in the most
  economic way.</p>

  <p>Time does not permit me to go into the
  conditions of the innervation of the capillaries, which shows
  many interesting features, but which, as yet, lacks much towards
  a complete elucidation. I must also content myself with the
  utmost brevity concerning the demonstration of the histology of
  the contractile elements. Dr. Vimtrup, among my collaborators, is
  working on this question, and has succeeded in observing,
  surrounding the capillaries, the branched cells which were
  described by Rouget as long ago as the 70's. However, no
  definitive results have yet been achieved. I think I have said
  enough to make it clear to you that the researches which I have
  explained deal with significant problems, and that it will need a
  great deal of work, difficult in many respects, to bring them to
  a satisfactory solution. The tremendous honour of the Nobel Prize
  is of the strongest incentive to me in my work, while the amount
  of the Prize will greatly simplify my task, and provide me with
  much valuable help in my work. I ask you to be assured that I
  will do all I possibly can to show myself worthy of the trust
  which the Caroline Institute has shown in me.</p>
