  <h1>Wilhelm Ostwald - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ostwald.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Wilhelm
  Ostwald</b> was born on September 2, 1853, in Riga, Latvia, as
  the son of master-cooper Gottfried Wilhelm Ostwald and Elisabith
  Leuckel.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at the "Real gymnasium" there and in 1872 was
  admitted to Dorpat
  University to read chemistry. After taking his final
  examinations three years later, he obtained the post of assistant
  at the Physics Institute under Professor Arthur von Oettingen,
  and subsequently took a similar position in the Chemistry
  Laboratory under Carl Schmidt. Ostwald himself declared that he
  was most indebted to these two teachers for his scientific
  training. In 1877 he was admitted as unpaid academic lecturer at
  Dorpat University, and this was followed (1881) by the
  appointment of full time Professor of Chemistry at the
  Polytechnicum in Riga. Six years later he accepted an invitation
  as Professor of Physical Chemistry at Leipzig
  University. Among his later famous pupils are <a href=

  "../1901/index.html">Van 't Hoff</a> (Nobel Prize 1901), <a href=
  "../1920/index.html">Nernst</a> (Nobel Prize 1920), Tammann and
  Wislicenus. Ostwald remained in Leipzig until he retired in 1906,
  with the short interruption for one term as first "Exchange
  Professor" at Harvard University, Cambridge (Mass.) in
  1904-1905.</p>

  <p>Ostwald started his experimental work in
  1875, with an investigation on the law of mass action of water in
  relation to the problems of chemical affinity, with special
  emphasis on electrochemistry and chemical dynamics.<br>
  <br>
  In consequence of his pioneering work especially in the field of
  electrochemistry, which also led to the discovery of the law of
  dilution named after him, his activities as a writer and his gift
  for organization, Ostwald became one of the founders of classical
  physical chemistry. He published numerous textbooks, starting
  with the <i>Lehrbuch der Allgemeinen Chemie</i> (Textbook of
  general chemistry) in 1884. This was followed by <i>Grundriss der
  Allgemeinen Chemie</i> (Outline of general chemistry) in 1889 and
  <i>Hand- und Hilfsbuch zur Ausf&uuml;hrung
  physikalisch-chemischer Messungen</i> (Handbook and manual for
  physicochemical measurements) in 1893. Numerous other scientific
  works on analytical chemistry, electrochemistry, inorganic
  chemistry followed.<br>
  <br>
  Ostwald also founded and edited the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
  physikalische Chemie</i> in 1887; Ostwald himself edited 100
  volumes, up to 1922.<br>
  <br>
  He was also in charge of the organization of the Department of
  Physical Chemistry at Leipzig University, and in 1894 he founded
  the "Deutsche Elektrochemische Gesellschaft" (German
  Electrochemical Society) which in 1902 expanded to become the
  "Deutsche Bunsen-Gesellschaft f&uuml;r angewandte physikalische
  Chemie" (German Bunsen-Society for Applied Physical
  Chemistry).<br>
  <br>
  In 1909 Ostwald was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his
  work on catalysis, chemical equilibria and reaction velocities.
  He received honorary doctorates from several universities in
  Germany, Great Britain and the USA, and was made an honorary
  member of learned societies in Germany, Sweden, Norway, the
  Netherlands, Russia, Great Britain and the USA. In 1899 he was
  made a "Geheimrat " by the King of Saxony.</p>

  <p>After his retirement in 1906, Ostwald found
  a new sphere for his scientific and organizatorial talents.
  Besides continuing his studies and publication on philosophy,
  such as <i>Der energetische Imperativ</i> (The energetic
  imperative), <i>Moderne Naturphilosophie</i> (Modern natural
  philosophy), <i>Die Pyramide der Wissenschaften</i> (The pyramid
  of the sciences), he also took an active part in public life. He
  supported the middle-class pacifist movement, was interested in
  educational reforms and in monism. He believed that in view of
  his position he could decisively fight the Church's claim to
  power in the field of natural sciences and to spread a modern
  scientific ideology. This aim he pursued in his writings
  <i>Monistische Sonntagspredigten</i> (Monistic Sunday sermons)
  and <i>Arbeiten zum Monismus</i> (Works on monism).<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 Ostwald founded <i>Annalen der Naturphilosophie</i> and
  edited 14 volumes up to 1921. He also founded <i>Klassiker der
  exakten Wissenschaften</i> in 1889, of which some 250 volumes
  have been published.<br>
  <br>
  Right up to the end of his life Ostwald studied colours and
  shapes, in the endeavour to find a scientific standardization for
  colours. His main works in this field are <i>Die Farbenfibel</i>
  (The coulour primer), <i>Die Farbenlehre</i> (Colour theory),
  <i>Die Harmonie der Farben</i> (Harmony of the colours). He also
  published a periodical <i>Die Farbe</i> (Colour).</p>

  <p>Ostwald was married to Helene von Reyher in
  1880. They had two daughters and three sons, one of whom, Dr.
  Karl Wilhelm Wolfgang (known in the scientific literature as Wo.
  Ostwald), was Lecturer in the University of Leipzig, and Editor
  of the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Chemie und Industrie der
  Kolloide</i>, the forerunner of the
  <i>Kolloid-Zeitschrift</i>.<br>
  <br>
                After an extremely active life, Ostwald died at his country home 
                near Leipzig on April 4, 1932.</p>
