  <h1>Theodore Roosevelt - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="roosevelt.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Theodore Roosevelt</b> (October 27, 1858&#8211;January 6,
  1919) was born in New York into one of the old Dutch families
  which had settled in America in the seventeenth century. At
  eighteen he entered Harvard College and spent four years there,
  dividing his time between books and sport and excelling at both.
  After leaving Harvard he studied in Germany for almost a year and
  then immediately entered politics. He was elected to the Assembly
  of New York State, holding office for three years and
  distinguishing himself as an ardent reformer.<br>
  <br>
  In 1884, because of ill health and the death of his wife,
  Roosevelt abandoned his political work for some time. He invested
  part of the fortune he had inherited from his father in a cattle
  ranch in the Badlands of Dakota Territory, expecting to remain in
  the West for many years. He became a passionate hunter,
  especially of big game, and an ardent believer in the wild
  outdoor life which brought him health and strength. In 1886
  Roosevelt returned to New York, married again, and once more
  plunged into politics.<br>
  <br>
  President Harrison, after his election in
  1889, appointed Roosevelt as a member of the Civil Service
  Commission of which he later became president. This office he
  retained until 1895 when he undertook the direction of the Police
  Department of New York City. In 1897 he joined President McKinley's administration as assistant
  secretary of the Navy. While in this office he actively prepared
  for the Cuban War, which he saw was coming, and when it broke out
  in 1898, went to Cuba as lieutenant colonel of a regiment of
  volunteer cavalry, which he himself had raised among the hunters
  and cowboys of the West. He won great fame as leader of these
  &laquo;Rough-Riders&raquo;, whose story he told in one of his most
  popular books.<br>
  <br>
  Elected governor of the state of New York in 1898, he invested
  his two-year administration with the vigorous and businesslike
  characteristics which were his hallmark. He would have sought
  reelection in 1900, since much of his work was only half done,
  had the Republicans not chosen him as their candidate for the
  second office of the Union. He held the vice-presidency for less
  than a year, succeeding to the presidency after the assassination
  of President McKinley on September 14, 1901. In 1904 Roosevelt
  was elected to a full term as president.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 President Roosevelt took the initiative in opening the
  international Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which, though
  founded in 1899, had not been called upon by any power in its
  first three years of existence. The United States and Mexico
  agreed to lay an old difference of theirs, concerning the Pious
  Foundations of California, before the Hague Tribunal. When this
  example was followed by other powers, the arbitration machinery
  created in 1899 was finally called into operation. Roosevelt also
  played a prominent part in extending the use of arbitration to
  international problems in the Western Hemisphere, concluding
  several arbitration treaties with European powers too, although
  the Senate refused to ratify them.<br>
  <br>
  In 1904 the Interparliamentary Union, meeting in St. Louis,
  Missouri, requested Roosevelt to call another international
  conference to continue the work begun at The Hague in 1899.
  Roosevelt responded immediately, and in the autumn of 1904
  Secretary of State John Hay invited the powers to meet at The
  Hague. Russia, however, refused to participate in a conference
  while engaged in hostilities with Japan. After the peace of 1905,
  the matter was placed in the hands of the Russian government,
  which had taken the initiative in convening the first Hague
  Conference.<br>
  <br>
  In June, 1905, President Roosevelt offered his good offices as
  mediator between Russia and Japan, asking the belligerents to
  nominate plenipotentiaries to negotiate on the conditions of
  peace. In August they met at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and after
  some weeks of difficult negotiations concluded a peace treaty in
  September, 1905.<br>
  <br>
  Roosevelt's candidate for president, William Howard Taft, took office in 1909.
  Dissatisfied with Taft's performance, Roosevelt bolted the
  regular Republican Party in 1912 and accepted the presidential
  nomination by the Progressive Party. He outpolled Taft, but
  <a href="../1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson</a> outpolled each of
  them. In 1917 Wilson refused his offer to raise and command a
  division to fight in World War I.<br>
  <br>
  Roosevelt was an historian, a biographer, a statesman, a hunter,
  a naturalist, an orator. His prodigious literary output includes
  twenty-six books, over a thousand magazine articles, thousands of
  speeches and letters.<br>
  <br>
  In 1919, at the age of sixty, he died in his sleep.</p>
