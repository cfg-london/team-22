  <h1>Maria Goeppert Mayer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mayer.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Maria Goeppert Mayer</b> was born on
  June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz, Upper Silesia, then Germany, the
  only child of Friedrich Goeppert and his wife Maria, nee Wolff.
  On her father's side, she is the seventh straight generation of
  university professors.<br>
  <br>
  In 1910 her father went as Professor of Pediatrics to
  G&ouml;ttingen where she spent most of her life until marriage.
  She went to private and public schools in G&ouml;ttingen and had
  the great fortune to have very good teachers. It somehow was
  never discussed, but taken for granted by her parents as well as
  by herself that she would go to the University. Yet, at that time
  it was not trivially easy for a woman to do so. In G&ouml;ttingen
  there was only a privately endowed school which prepared girls
  for the "abitur", the entrance examination for the university.
  This school closed its doors during the inflation, but the
  teachers continued to give instructions to the pupils. Maria
  Goeppert finally took the abitur examination in Hannover, in
  1924, being examined by teachers she had never seen in her
  life.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1924 she enrolled at the University at
  G&ouml;ttingen, with the intention of becoming a mathematician.
  But soon she found herself more attracted to physics. This was
  the time when quantum mechanics was young and exciting.<br>
  <br>
  Except for one term which she spent in Cambridge, England, where
  her greatest profit was to learn English, her entire university
  career took place in G&ouml;ttingen. She is deeply indebted to
  <a href="../1954/index.html">Max Born</a>, for his kind guidance
  of her scientific education. She took her doctorate in 1930 in
  theoretical physics. There were three Nobel Prize winners on the
  doctoral committee, Born, <a href="../1925/index.html">Franck</a>
  and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/index.html">Windaus</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Shortly before she had met Joseph Edward Mayer, an American
  Rockefeller fellow working with James Franck. In 1930 she went
  with him to the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. This was the
  time of the depression, and no university would think of employing
  the wife of a professor. But she kept working, just for the fun
  of doing physics.<br>
  <br>
  Karl F. Herzfeld took an interest in her work, and under his
  influence and that of her husband, she slowly developed into a
  chemical physicist. She wrote various papers with Herzfeld and
  with her husband, and she started to work on the color of organic
  molecules.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 they went to Columbia. Dr. Goeppert Mayer taught at Sarah Lawrence College between 1941 and 1945, but she worked mainly at the S. A. M. Laboratory, on
  the separation of isotopes of uranium, with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1934/index.html">Harold Urey</a> as
  director. Urey usually assigned her not to the main line of
  research of the laboratory, but to side issues, for instance, to
  the investigation of the possibility of separating isotopes by
  photochemical reactions. This was nice, clean physics although it
  did not help in the separation of isotopes.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 they went to Chicago. This was the first place where she was not
  considered a nuisance, but greeted with open arms. She was
  suddenly a Professor in the Physics
  Department and in the Institute for Nuclear Studies. She was also
  employed by the Argonne National Laboratory with very little
  knowledge of Nuclear Physics! It took her some time to find her
  way in this, for her, new field. But in the atmosphere of
  Chicago, it was rather easy to learn nuclear physics. She owes a
  great deal to very many discussions with Edward Teller, and in
  particular with <a href="../1938/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a>,
  who was always patient and helpful.<br>
  <br>
  In 1948 she started to work on the magic numbers, but it took her
  another year to find their explanation, and several years to work
  out most of the consequences. The fact that Haxel, <a href=
  "index.html">Jensen</a> and Suess, whom she had never met, gave
  the same explanation at the same time helped to convince her that
  it was right. She met Jensen in 1950. A few years later the
  competitors from both sides of the Atlantic decided to write a
  book together.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960 they came to La Jolla where Maria Goeppert Mayer is a
  professor of physics. She is a member of the National Academy of
  Sciences and a corresponding member of the Akademie der
  Wissenschaften in Heidelberg. She has received honorary degrees
  of Doctor of Science from Russel Sage College, Mount Holyoke
  College and Smith College.<br>
  <br>
  They have two children, both born in Baltimore, Maria Ann
  Wentzel, now in Ann Arbor, and a son, Peter Conrad, a graduate
  student of economics in Berkeley.</p>
