  <h1>Martinus J.G. Veltman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="veltman.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on Saturday June 27, 1931, in a
  town called Waalwijk in the south of the Netherlands. My father
  was the head of the local primary school. One brother and two
  sisters of my father were primary school teachers as well, and in
  my family learning was held in high regard. My mother came from
  more practically oriented people: her father was a contractor and
  also ran a caf&eacute;. I have a bit from both sides. I was the
  fourth child in what became a six child family.</p>

  <p>The town of Waalwijk had approximately 20
  000 inhabitants. It was dominated by the shoe industry. For many
  life was not easy in the depression years but a head teacher was
  relatively well off. Consequently the life of my family was quiet
  and relatively uneventful.</p>

  <p>In 1940 the Netherlands were overrun by the
  German army. I saw them marching in, and I heard people speak of
  the difficult times coming. In this part of the Netherlands things
  were not as bad as in the big cities, and the main thing I
  remember is that my father's school was requisitioned by the
  Germans and troops were lodged therein. In the fall of 1944 we
  were liberated, contrary to the part of the Netherlands "above
  the rivers" that would have to endure till the capitulation in
  May 1945. This was due to the failure of the operation Market
  Garden; the last bridge near Arnhem was not taken. Thus we
  escaped what is called the hunger winter of 1944-1945, in which
  many Dutch people died of hunger.</p>

  <p>The period of the war in which we were
  liberated, while the north was still occupied, was characterized
  by lots of artillery fire from our side, as Waalwijk was very
  near the front line. The allied troops were not very careful with
  their ammunition, and as a young boy of 14, I was very interested
  in playing with that. I remember how we would extract the powder
  from a failed tank grenade found in a ditch near where tanks had
  been firing. We would take the grenade by the point and then beat
  the lower end on the ground till the point came loose and we
  could then shake out the powder. I do not know how I survived
  this, but I did. We also survived the VI flying bombs that came
  over on their way to Antwerp. Two of them actually fell on houses
  in Waalwijk, one of them at about 100 m of our house. With me is
  still the memory of dead bodies being extracted from the
  ruins.</p>

  <p>In 1943, I went to high school (the Dutch
  HBS). The war period was marked by irregularities and at one
  point our class was in a horse stable. While I had been a very
  good student at the elementary school, I was quite mediocre at
  the HBS. Much of that was due to my bad aptitude for languages,
  which is a real handicap when they require you to learn three
  foreign languages. So it happened that I narrowly passed the
  final exam in 1948, at the age of 17.</p>

  <p>In those years I had (and still have)
  electronics as a hobby. This is a somewhat exaggerated
  qualification, because there was practically no electronics
  material around. The Germans had confiscated all radios, and
  there was a great scarcity of anything that could catch a radio
  signal. I remember spending a whole day walking around in the
  nearby larger town of 's Hertogenbosch, trying to get a radio
  tube. Finally some kind person, having pity on me, gave me
  one.</p>

  <p>I acquired my knowledge of electronics from
  the local plumber. I used to spend many evenings in his house,
  and during the holidays I would work for him. I thus also learned
  plumbing. When I started to understand radio's a bit better I
  became the local radio repairman. My only measuring instrument
  was my right index finger. If I touched a sensitive connection
  the radio would produce a hum. If a connection had the correct
  high voltage (about 200 V) I would get a shock. Commercially I
  was a failure, as I would usually not dare to ask money for my
  services.</p>

  <p>When I passed the final high school exam
  the big question was: what now? Traditionally somebody like me
  would go to a medium level technical school in 's Hertogenbosch
  called MTS. However, given my low grades this did not go
  smoothly. At this point my physics high school teacher came to my
  home and suggested to my parents to send me to the University.
  This was a big thing, practically nobody did that in Waalwijk in
  those days. Universities were still very exclusive, and the south
  of the Netherlands was quite backwards in this respect. As the
  money situation was very tight the main point was to find a
  University where I could go to by train. This was possible with
  the University of
  Utrecht. For three years I commuted back and forth from
  Waalwijk to Utrecht, a 90 minute trip each way. I am still
  grateful to this high school teacher, Mr Beunes, as he did the
  extra thing, going to my parents house. Since then I have found
  out that many physicists owe their career to a good high school
  teacher.</p>

  <p>Worse however was the state of the
  education at the University. The war had left the Netherlands
  ravaged, many good physicists had left the country or were
  killed. In retrospect, it is really a pity that Abraham Pais left
  Utrecht to go to the US. The teaching in Utrecht was uninspiring,
  and failed to awake much physics interest in me. After three
  quite mediocre years I left home and started to live in Utrecht.
  At that time I had no income as my father could not support that,
  and I was forced to work on the side. My main activity was typing
  lecture notes. Sometimes it was even difficult to get decent
  meals. But by and large I lived a happy life, mainly bumming
  around.</p>

  <p>I also got involved in another job, trying
  to sell some rather silly tools to the unsuspecting citizens. In
  this I was a complete failure. I cannot sell anything to anybody.
  In some sense that has remained true in my scientific life.</p>

  <p>After five years (2 years longer than
  normal) I passed what was called the candidaats exam. Then I
  happened to stumble on a popular book on the theory of
  relativity. Mind you, up to then no teacher had ever mentioned
  this. This booklet really excited me, and I went to the Institute
  of Theoretical Physics to get a real book on the subject. After
  some nagging they gave me <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein's</a> book "The
  Meaning of Relativity". Since then I was hooked. Also my
  financial situation improved slightly: given the very big
  shortage of high school teachers in the Netherlands it was not
  difficult to get a job as part-time teacher. Actually, I started
  as a teacher at a lower technical school, teaching plumbers about
  physics. None of that was helpful in speeding up my studies.</p>

  <p>After my candidaats exam I started
  initially as an experimentalist. I worked for some time studying
  medical physics, in particular the physical aspects of percussion
  sound (the sound that is produced when a doctor pounds your
  chest). Later I worked on a mass-spectrometer, mainly doing the
  electronics. I found out that this was not my real destiny, and
  switched to theoretical physics. However, I still have a
  considerable fondness for experimental physics.</p>

  <p>In 1955, I landed a job as assistant to
  Prof. Michels, of the Van Der
  Waals laboratory in Amsterdam. Michels was an experimental
  physicist, involved in high pressure physics. My task was the
  upkeep of the library, remarkably well stocked, and occasionally
  preparing a talk for Michels. I remember that as a good period,
  and it brought me also into contact with the members of the
  theory institute in Amsterdam. Mostly they were interested in
  statistical mechanics, a subject that has never evoked the
  slightest enthusiasm in me. Sneeringly I used to say: you guys
  average out anything of interest.</p>

  <p>Science wise my life improved greatly with
  the coming to Utrecht of Leon Van Hove, I believe in 1955. He was
  an excellent lecturer, and I volunteered to make official notes
  of his lectures. I finished my graduate studies in 1956, after
  which I had to go into military service for two years, coming out
  of that in February 1959. Van Hove was so kind to take me as a
  PhD student despite my relatively advanced age (27 years). Thus I
  started doing real theory.</p>

  <p>As Van Hove did statistical mechanics like
  all other theorists in Utrecht there was some problem, because I
  wanted to do particle physics. At that time many European
  Universities did not have anybody doing research in that field,
  and the way to learn that was via physics schools. Typically,
  such schools would run over a period of two weeks, with
  internationally known speakers. In the spring of 1959, I went to
  such a school in Naples, where among others Kurt Symanzik and
  Bruno Zumino lectured. In August 1960, I went to yet another
  school, in Edinburgh, and that school has been of quite some
  importance to me. I met <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/index.html">Shelly Glashow</a>, at that
  time a student there, who was working on the subject for which he
  was to get the Nobel Prize. If someone had told him that, he
  would have been quite surprised. At these schools I became
  friends with several other students, among them Nicola Cabibbo
  and Derek Robinson (who went astray into statistical and
  mathematical directions). They have remained friends to this day.
  From the Edinburgh school I do remember fondly the lectures of
  Dave Jackson, now in Berkeley.</p>

  <p>In 1960, Van Hove became director of the
  theory division at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, the European High
  Energy laboratory. I followed him in 1961. Meanwhile, in 1960, I
  was married to my present wife Anneke, and before joining me in
  Geneva she delivered our daughter H&eacute;l&egrave;ne in the
  Netherlands, living in the house of my parents. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
  followed in my footsteps and in due time completed her particle
  physics thesis with Mary Gaillard at Berkeley. She now works in
  the banking world in London. She is the one member of our family
  that understands what I have been doing.</p>

  <p>At first I felt a bit lost at CERN, since
  my elementary particle physics knowledge was quite sketchy. For
  some time I had been working on a rather field theoretical
  problem, namely unstable particles. When that was finished I
  wanted to go into something closer to the experiments. This
  happened thanks to Sam Berman, an erstwhile student of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a>. He was aware of
  the situation at the CERN theory division at the time, and he did
  put up an advertisement: If you have nothing else to do and wish
  to be kept off the street please knock my door". So I did, and I
  am still very grateful to him. He suggested a calculation:
  Coulomb corrections to the production of vector bosons in the
  CERN neutrino experiment. This, after consultation with Van Hove,
  was then to be the second part of my thesis.</p>

  <p>The problem consisted of two parts. One, a
  part very analogous to a previous calculation of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Bethe</a> and collaborators
  (Coulomb corrections to pair production), and secondly a part
  that was not solved by Bethe. I remember sitting in my office for
  several months, staring at a single differential equation, trying
  to solve it using confluent hypergeometric functions. These are
  very disgusting functions, and after a while I felt that perhaps
  I should consult the world expert on that matter, Eyvind
  Wichmann. He happened to be in Copenhagen at the time, and I made
  a pilgrimage. Seldom have I made such a useless trip. Wichman
  tried to understand what I wanted, but he did not get it. He
  looked at me as if I was some strange animal.</p>

  <p>Well, at some point I solved that problem,
  and that then completed my thesis. In due time (April 22, 1963)
  Van Hove and I went back to Utrecht for the ceremonies, in tails
  and white tie. I now understand that this is a preparation for
  the Nobel Prize. The thesis contained my work on unstable
  particles as well as the treatment of Coulomb corrections for
  vector boson production by neutrinos. Title of the thesis:
  Intermediate particles in S-matrix theory and calculation of
  higher order effects in the production of intermediate vector
  bosons.</p>

  <p>At CERN, meanwhile, the experimentalists
  were gearing up for the CERN neutrino experiment. I was asked to
  speak at one of their meetings on vector boson production. I
  became almost instantly very good friends with Bernardini, the
  leader of the group. They then wanted me to do extensive
  calculations for them concerning vector boson production, as that
  would be needed for analysis of the data. Computer calculations
  of that type had been done already by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/index.html">Lee</a>, Markstein and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/index.html">Yang</a>, and when
  Lee came to CERN I took the occasion to ask for those programs,
  which he curtly refused. I then asked him if he could give me
  some advice, to which he answered: "don't make mistakes". I
  thought this funny, and started to laugh, but that was not
  appreciated by Lee, who took some moments to teach me the
  seriousness of this enterprise. Well, even if in the making of
  computer programs the not making of errors is usually the main
  problem, I still feel that I did not really need that advice!</p>

  <p>The CERN neutrino experiment was a very big
  happening in my life. When they started I was more or less
  permanently around, looking at the pictures as they came out.
  When no spectacular events came out the enthusiasm of the
  experimentalists waned, and after a while the only ones to look
  at the pictures were Bernardini and myself. And so it came to
  pass that I became the spokesman for the group at the Brookhaven
  Conference in 1963. Somewhere in that period I acquired two
  lifelong friends, the experimentalists <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1988/index.html">Mel Schwartz</a> (Nobel
  Laureate 1988) and Val Telegdi.</p>

  <p>The 1963 CERN neutrino experiment left me
  with an interest for experiments that never went away. I am a
  deep believer in the importance of experiments for the progress
  of physics. Also, the experiment left me with a feeling for these
  things, to recognize what is important and who are the good guys.
  All theorists ought to go through some such experience. These
  days, however, that is not really practical any more. The
  experiments have become gigantic enterprises, involving hundreds
  of physicists and a large number of engineers. The modern
  experimentalist is often more manager than physicist.</p>

  <p>In 1963, I went to SLAC at
  Stanford, where Pief Panofsky was building a Iinear electron
  accelerator. Also Sam Berman was there, in fact he was much of
  the reason for going there. Meanwhile, at CERN, I had become good
  friends with John Bell who was one of the very few theorists that
  had any interest in the neutrino experiment. He also came to
  SLAC, and in fact we wrote a paper together that we however never
  published. He became quite involved with what is now known as the
  Bell inequalities, while I started constructing my symbolic
  computer program Schoonschip. That also had its origin in the
  neutrino experiment: in doing the necessary algebra for vector
  boson production I was often exasperated by the effort that it
  took to get an error free result, even if the work was quite
  mechanical. In a discussion on the CERN terrace, including among
  others Mike Levine, we concluded that somebody ought to write a
  program to do that type of work. I started doing that at SLAC, in
  the autumn of 1963. Many good things have been invented at the
  CERN terrace. Mike Levine later successfully completed the first
  QED sixth order calculation.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1964, I went back to CERN
  and worked there till my departure for Brookhaven in 1966. There
  I had the pleasure of getting to know Maurice Goldhaber, then the
  very successful director of Brookhaven National Laboratory. A man that impresses
  me to this day. He liked me as well, and in fact tried to get me
  to that laboratory, which I did not. I do remember getting a
  phone call from Brookhaven while sitting with my parents in law
  in the Dutch town of Leeuwarden. How they ever found me there is
  still a mystery to me.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, just prior to going to the
  US, our son Hugo was born. He now runs a restaurant called
  Solstice in Los Angeles. If I want a really good dinner that is
  where I go. I hope the reader gets the hint.</p>

  <p>September 1966, I went back to Utrecht, as
  successor of Van Hove, i.e. professor of theoretical physics.
  There was still nobody doing particle physics there, so I started
  to build that up. That took some time; it was really a big change
  after the rather hectic CERN life. I made a mistake: I thought
  that being relatively isolated in Utrecht it would be a good idea
  to become editor of Physics Letters. Indeed, it is a way to keep
  in touch with the action in the field; however, I received on the
  average 1 article a day, and I rejected about 90% straight away.
  In other words, the big majority was junk, just cluttering up my
  mind. As far as I can see it has become worse, not better. Many a
  physicist has come to hate my "high handedness", as one of the
  victims called it. I was happy to get out of that job by the
  summer of 1968.</p>

  <p>A turning point in my scientific life
  occurred during a one month visit (April 1968) to Rockefeller
  University. In the quietness of that institution I embarked
  on the scientific venture that has now been honoured with the
  Nobel Prize. I am still indebted to Bram Pais who got me there
  and counseled me in that period. Too bad that he left the
  Netherlands in 1945; I am sure that he would have kept Dutch
  particle physics on a high level. One man can make a big
  difference.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1968, I went to Orsay,
  near Paris, on the invitation of the French physicists Claude
  Bouchiat and Philippe Meyer. The stay lasted till September 1969,
  it was a sabbatical year (after two years in Utrecht&#8230;). As
  Utrecht partly paid me during that period, I told the French
  people that I did not need much in the way of a salary, and
  subsequently they did put me in some low job. This had an
  unpleasant consequence; Christmas 1968, I was fired, as de Gaulle
  had decided on some cost saving operation. Luckily they succeeded
  in patching it up, in some mysterious French way. Some well known
  French physicist told me: luckily that it happened to you and not
  to T.D. Lee. That made me aware of my place on the totem
  pole.</p>

  <p>Back in Utrecht I continued my work, and
  had several students under my supervision. Among them Peter van
  Nieuwenhuizen, now director of the C.N. Yang
  Institute at Stony Brook, Bernard de Wit , now holding my
  former position in Utrecht and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/index.html">Gerard 't Hooft</a>, my
  co-laureate. Our group became known, especially so after the work
  of 't Hooft and myself that is cited in connection with this
  years prize. Besides my own research I was very busy in that
  period: reforming the physics educational system in Utrecht (see
  my complaints above), and trying to get a good computer system.
  The latter required endless meetings, mainly caused by some
  mathematician who insisted that the machine could run Algol, a by
  now largely forgotten computer language. I had literally to learn
  some 6 or 7 computers inside out to get to the final result: a
  CDC 6800 computer. During one of these meetings (January 1971) I
  received a phone call telling me that my wife was about to
  deliver another child; I went out of the meeting to the hospital
  and came back after about one hour. I gave everybody a cigar,
  celebrating the birth of my son Martijn and continued with the
  meeting. Martijn is now working in Hollywood, in the movie
  industry.</p>

  <p>'t Hooft and I worked together for a few
  more years, after which we drifted apart. I went my way doing
  calculations of radiative corrections, something that he was not
  interested in. The fame of Utrecht had spread, and two young
  Italian physicists came to work with me: Giam-Piero Passarino and
  Maurizio Consoli. Some Dutch students at that time were Jochum
  van der Bij, now professor at Freiburg, Germany and Michel
  Lemoine, now a free lance Senior Petroleum Engineer. The latter
  has convinced me that theoretical physics is a good science to be
  educated in, it prepares for no job in particular but the
  scientific methods learned are of use in many positions in modern
  society. So never worry too much what kind of job you will get
  after finishing a theoretical physics education. For example, the
  first Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel went
  to <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1969/index.html">Tinbergen</a>,
  a former theoretical physicist. And nowadays the banking world is
  full of particle theorists.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1979, I received an
  invitation from Ed Yao from the University of Michigan to spend a sabbatical
  year there. I knew Yao from his scientific work, and I
  immediately called my wife, asking if she was interested in a
  year in Michigan. For reasons that I have now forgotten we left
  in March 1980, to stay till December of that year. In Michigan we
  were asked to stay, but initially we answered rather firmly that
  I was not interested. In November we started wavering, and in
  fact Fermi lab
  (under the directorship of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1988/index.html">Leon Lederman</a>, another
  experimental friend of mine) started to express interest as well.
  In December a nice house was auctioned near were we lived in Ann
  Arbor, and my wife told me: if you buy that house I will stay. I
  did not get the house, some richer medical person got it, but
  this somehow made us decide to stay in Ann Arbor. Part of it was
  a certain unhappiness with the situation in the Netherlands, and
  another part was the happiness of our sons with the American
  school system. My Utrecht colleagues were quite upset when I told
  them and they did sent me a telegram asking me to remain in
  Utrecht. But we decided to accept the offer of Ann Arbor, and
  when we came back in Utrecht I started preparations to leave,
  which we did in September of 1981.</p>

  <p>I did my part in the scientific life in the
  United States, serving among others on the various committees
  that decide on experiments at the big laboratories, Fermilab near
  Chicago, SLAC at Stanford and Brookhaven National Laboratory,
  Long Island.</p>

  <p>Shortly after we arrived I was offered a
  named chair, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur chair.
  Europeans think that this means an extra income, but that is not
  true. There are other things however. Apart from the prestige of
  this chair it had a really nice feature going with it: a yearly
  amount of $ 35000 that I could spend for scientific purposes.
  While it may seem a small amount, it nonetheless made quite a
  difference. I could pay certain deserving students during the
  summer, buy computer stuff, help the group with little things,
  visit conferences, invite colleagues etc. It is wonderful that
  you can buy a new computer almost immediately if there is a need
  for it. In Europe that took often a long time, you had to put it
  on a budget and wait for approval etc. This is one aspect of the
  greater flexibility of the American system. If you want something
  done you either use discretionary funds at your disposal or you
  go around and try to find money (discretionary funds) from people
  or groups that feel it is also to their advantage to support the
  purpose. For example I remember supporting a Russian scientist
  partly from my MacArthur fund, partly from a fund from the
  astro-physics group.</p>

  <p>In hindsight we do not regret this move to
  the USA, but it would take me too far to explain that. Too many
  strictly personal considerations are involved here. The
  University of Michigan has been good to me, and I feel loyal to
  that institution. Also the life in Ann Arbor was quite nice, and
  Anneke felt very much at home there, enjoying membership of a
  great many clubs. Among others she learned to make beautiful
  stained glass windows. Nonetheless, it was quite a step for a 50
  year old man and his family to emigrate. Dutch people abroad have
  a saying: rather nostalgia than Holland. I would not go that far,
  we had certainly many friends in the Netherlands, and also most
  of our families (from my wife and me) live there.</p>

  <p>My main tie with Europe during the US
  period (1981-1996) was with the University of Madrid (the Autonoma), Spain.
  There was a particle theory group headed by F.J. Yndurain. I
  would go there up to two months during the summer time, and
  conversely he would often come to Ann Arbor. This type of
  collaboration is usually very fruitful, not only for doing
  science, but also because it fosters the exchange of graduate
  students.</p>

  <p>It was just in this period that Spain
  decided seriously to catch up with the rest of Europe, and that
  was an interesting and exciting thing to watch. While not
  everything went perfect, I would say that Spain made enormous
  strides forward in a relatively short time. Up to this day I have
  very good relations with Spanish physicists, both in Spain and at
  CERN. I should perhaps add that to them CERN is of crucial
  importance, as it has been to me.</p>

  <p>On retirement we decided to return to the
  town of Bilthoven in the Netherlands that we had left in 1981, to
  find still many of our old friends there. That is where we now
  live happily. Our children however did not go back, they would
  really not fit anymore in the Dutch society. It rains too
  much.</p>
