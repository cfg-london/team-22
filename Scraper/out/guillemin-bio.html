  <h1>Roger Guillemin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="guillemin.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was
  born in France on January 11, 1924 in the small town of Dijon,
  the capital of Burgundy. I was educated there in the public
  schools and the lyc&eacute;e. I entered medical school in Dijon in
  1943 and received the M.D. degree from the Facult&eacute; de
  M&eacute;decine of Lyon in 1949, - the two schools were then
  administratively connected, with the larger school of Lyon
  granting the degrees. All my medical studies and training were
  totally clinically oriented, with three years of what we could
  call rotating internship. There was no laboratory facility of any
  sort in Dijon, except for gross anatomy. Dark years of no fun
  youth these were; France had fallen to the Germans in 1940; Dijon
  was from then on occupied by the German army until liberation
  days in 1944.<br>
  <br>
  During these five years of medical studies, I had always been
  interested in endocrinology, probably because two of my best
  teachers of clinical medicine, P. Etienne-Martin and J. Charpy
  were themselves interested in what were in those days the early
  concepts of endocrinology and the beginning logical therapy it
  appeared to offer. I always hoped that somehow I could one day
  work in a laboratory. In France you had terminated your medical
  studies after 5 years of curriculum; you could then practice
  medicine - which I did for some time. To obtain the degree of
  Doctor in Medicine you had to write and defend a dissertation, a
  thesis; that was usually <i>pro forma</i>. I decided, however, to
  write a dissertation for the M.D. degree that I would enjoy,
  hopefully on some work I could perform in a laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  One day, I learned that Hans Selye would lecture in Paris on his
  alarm reaction and the endocrinology of the general adaptation
  syndrome. I went to hear him. The magnetism of the man was
  extraordinary. I went to talk to him after one of his lectures. A
  few months later I was in Selye's newly created Institute of
  Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the University of
  Montreal, with a modest fellowship from Selye's funds. In one
  year I completed some experimental work on
  desoxycorticosterone-induced hypertension in bilaterally
  nephrectomized rats kept alive for several weeks by peritoneal
  dialysis; that constituted the material for the thesis necessary
  in the French system to obtain the M.D. degree, which I obtained
  in Lyon upon the defense of that dissertation, in 1949. Not much
  interested in the academism and formalism of a research career
  within the French system that was then open to me, I returned to
  Selye's Institute, and three years later eventually obtained a
  Ph.D. degree in physiology in 1953. In these four years I had
  learned experimental endocrinology in a remarkable program
  jointly conducted between McGill University and the University of Montreal. In
  1953, I joined the staff of the Department of Physiology at the
  Baylor
  University College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, as a young
  assistant professor. I taught physiology at Baylor College of
  Medicine for 18 years, until 1970. While in Selye's department, I
  had become interested in the problem of the physiological control
  of the secretion of the pituitary gland as it was involved in the
  acute response to stress. This was due particularly to friendly
  contacts with Claude Fortier and to a long visit by Geoffrey W.
  Harris from London.<br>
  <br>
  I have recounted in some details in a chapter of Volume 2, of
  <i>Pioneers in Neuroendocrinology</i>, J. Meites (ed.), Plenum
  Press Publ., 1978, how I became more and more involved in the
  search for the chemical mediators of hypothalamic origin,
  suspected to control the functions of the pituitary gland; how
  <a href="index.html">Schally</a> came to me at Baylor from the
  laboratory of Murray Saffran at McGill immediately after he had
  obtained there his Ph.D. degree in biochemistry - as we both
  thought that we would solve in no time the problem of the nature
  of CRF (the corticotropin releasing factor); how I went back to
  France in 1960, - on academic promises that did not materialize,
  thus returned to Houston in 1963, and later, in 1970, went to the
  Salk Institute
  to establish our present Laboratories for Neuroendocrinology.
  That chapter written in a light anecdotal manner, along with two
  reviews, one concerning the isolation and characterization of the
  first of the hypothalamic releasing factor, TRF (in <i>Vitamins
  and Hormones, 29,</i> 1-39, 1971), the other concerning the
  isolation of the luteinizing hormone releasing factor (in <i>Am.
  J. Obs. and Gynecol., 129,</i> 214-218, 1977) will give the
  interested reader a good historical description of these early
  years of, indeed, true pioneering in neuroendocrinology.<br>
  <br>
  I served for 11 years on several advisory groups (Study Sections)
  of the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH) - an experience that was as
  rewarding as it was exhausting - as a member of the Council of
  the American Endocrine Society from 1969-1973.<br>
  <br>
  I was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, in 1974, a
  member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. I
  have been honored by several national and international
  scientific recognitions: among which The Gairdner International
  Award, Toronto, Canada, 1974; The Dickson Prize in Medicine, The
  University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1976; the Passano Award
  in the Medical Sciences, Baltimore, Maryland, 1976; the Lasker
  Award in Basic Sciences, New York, 1975; and recently the
  National Medal of Science presented by the President of the
  USA.<br>
  <br>
  I have received honorary degrees, from the University of
  Rochester (D.Sc.), 1976; the University of Chicago (D.Sc.), 1977;
  and the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur from the French government in
  1973.<br>
  <br>
  I consider as major honors to have been asked to deliver numerous
  memorial lectures, in particular the Harvey Lecture, The
  Rockefeller University, New York, 1974; the Jane Russell Wilhelmi
  Memorial Lecture, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 1976; the
  Geoffrey W. Harris Memorial Lecture, International Congress of
  Endocrinology, Hamburg, Germany, 1976; The Gregory Pincus
  Memorial Lecture, The Laurentian Hormone Conference, 1976; The
  Herbert M. Evans, Memorial Lecture, University of California in
  San Francisco, 1977.<br>
  <br>
  In Houston, in Paris, in La Jolla, where I set up shop - sometime
  simultaneously as in the days of commuting between Paris and
  Houston - I have had the extraordinary privilege to work with
  wonderful collaborators some so much more knowledgeable in their
  own field than I was (or still am), all full of enthusiasm and
  sharing common ethics of science. The work recognized in this
  Nobel Prize was a group effort and achievement. I started writing
  the list of these colleagues, collaborators, students who worked
  with me, starting in 1953; I stopped when I realized more than
  one hundred names were involved. Of unique roles and significance
  in the saga of the hypothalamic hormones in which I was involved,
  I must call to the lime light Edvart Sakiz, now in Paris, Roger
  Burgus, now in La Jolla, Wylie Vale who came to me as a graduate
  student, now in La Jolla, Nicholas Ling and Jean Rivier, both now
  in La Jolla. They, and their own students, are and will be the
  future of this expanding field or research.<br>
  <br>
  My wife is a musician of talent and, so far, five of our six
  children are already in artistic careers or show a definite
  preference for artistic endeavors; one only, may be a biologist
  some day. And all that is fine with me. Since 1970 when we came
  to the Salk Institute, we have lived in La Jolla, a suburb of San
  Diego, in a Mediterranean house which we have filled, if not
  overfilled, with many contemporary paintings French and American,
  sculptures and potteries mostly from pre-Columbian Mexico and
  also from New Guinea. Several keyboards and string instruments
  are also part of the enjoyable living environment of that happy
  house.</p>
