  <h1>Robert Hofstadter - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hofstadter.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Robert Hofstadter</b>,
  Professor of Physics at Stanford University, was born in New York, N.Y., of
  parents Louis Hofstadter and Henrietta Koenigsberg, on February
  5, 1915.<br>
  <br>
  Hofstadter attended elementary and high schools in New York City,
  and was graduated in 1935 from the College of the City of New
  York with the B.S. degree, <i>magna cum laude</i>.<br>
  <br>
  On graduation from college Hofstadter received the Kenyon Prize
  in Mathematics and Physics, and a little later the Coffin
  Fellowship, awarded by the General Electric Company. He went to
  graduate school at Princeton University where he studied physics from
  1935 - 1938, and received both the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 1938
  from that institution. His Ph.D. work was concerned with infrared
  spectra of simple organic molecules, and in particular, with the
  partial elucidation of the structure of the now well-known
  "hydrogen bond". In 1938 - 1939 he was awarded a Procter
  Fellowship at Princeton University for postdoctoral work, at
  which time he began a study of photoconductivity in willemite
  crystals. This work led to the discovery, with R. Herman, of the
  warm-up dark currents which demonstrated the existence of
  trapping states in crystals. In 1939 Hofstadter received the
  Harrison Fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania where he helped to
  construct a large Van de Graaff machine for nuclear research. At
  Pennsylvania he first met L. I. Schiff, who has been a friend and
  colleague for many years.<br>
  <br>
  During the war years Hofstadter worked first at the National
  Bureau of Standards and later at the Norden Laboratory
  Corporation. He left industry at the end of the war to become
  Assistant Professor of Physics at Princeton University. At
  Princeton he carried out research on crystal conduction counters,
  on the Compton effect, and on scintillation counters. In 1948 he
  discovered that sodium iodide, activated by thallium, made an
  excellent scintillation counter. In 1950, with J. A. McIntyre, he
  found that well-formed crystals of this material provided
  remarkable energy-measuring devices for gamma rays and energetic
  particles and thus could be used as spectrometers in addition to
  gamma-ray and particle counters of high efficiency.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950 Hofstadter left Princeton to become Associate Professor
  of Physics at Stanford University where he initiated a program on
  the scattering of energetic electrons from the linear
  accelerator, invented by W. W. Hansen, which was then under
  construction. While building equipment for the
  electron-scattering experiments, he continued working on
  scintillation counters and developed new detectors for neutrons
  and X-rays. High-speed inorganic (CsF) and useful Cerenkov (TlCl)
  counters were discovered at Stanford. Other studies carried out
  in the early years at Stanford were concerned with cosmic rays
  and with cascade showers generated by high-speed electrons.<br>
  <br>
  After 1953 electron-scattering measurements became Hofstadter's
  principal interest. With students and colleagues he investigated
  the charge distribution in atomic nuclei and afterwards the
  charge and magnetic moment distributions in the proton and
  neutron. The electron-scattering method was used to find the size
  and surface thickness parameters of nuclei. Many of the principal
  results on the proton and neutron were obtained in the years
  1954-1957. Since 1957 emphasis in the research program has been
  placed on making more precise studies of the nucleon form
  factors. This work is still in progress.<br>
  <br>
  Hofstadter was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.) in 1958
  and was named California Scientist of the Year in 1959. He has
  also been a Guggenheim Fellow (1958 - 1959) and spent one year at
  CERN in Geneva,
  Switzerland, on sabbatical leave.<br>
  <br>
  In 1942 he married Nancy Givan of Baltimore, Maryland, and they
  have a son, Douglas, and two daughters, Laura and Mary.</p>
