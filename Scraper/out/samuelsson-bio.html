  <h1>Bengt I. Samuelsson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="samuelsson.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was
  born in Halmstad, Sweden, on May 21, 1934 to Anders and Kristina
  Samuelsson. After attending public schools I studied medicine at
  the University of Lund where I met my wife Karin (Bergstein). We
  have one son (Bo) and two daughters (Elisabet and Astrid).<br>
  <br>
  After a few years in Lund I moved to <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/samuelsson-autobio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Karolinska Institutet</a> in Stockholm in order
  to do graduate work in biochemistry in parallel with medical
  studies. In 1960 I finished my dissertation and became docent in
  medical chemistry. A year later I also obtained my MD degree from
  Karolinska Institutet. After a year as research fellow in the
  Department of Chemistry at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.,
  I returned to Karolinska Institutet. In 1967 I was appointed
  professor of medical chemistry at the Royal Veterinary College in
  Stockholm, and after a few years I moved back to Karolinska
  Institutet to become professor and chairman of the department of
  physiological chemistry. Concurrently with my research positions
  I have also held administrative posts. I was dean of the medical
  faculty from 1978 to 1983, and is presently rector of Karolinska
  Institutet.<br>
  <br>
  My research interests were originally in cholesterol metabolism
  with emphasis on reaction mechanisms. After the structural work
  on prostaglandins with <a href="index.html">Sune
  Bergstr&ouml;m</a> in 1959-1962 I have mainly been interested in
  transformation products of arachidonic acid. This has led to the
  discovery of endoperoxides, thromboxanes and the leukotrienes,
  and my group has mainly been involved in studying the chemistry,
  biochemistry and biology of these compounds and their role in
  biological control system. The research has implications in
  several clinical areas, particularly in thrombosis, inflammation
  and allergy.</p>
