  <h1>Walther Nernst - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nernst.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Walther Hermann Nernst</b> was born
  in Briesen, West Prussia, on June 25, 1864. His father, Gustav
  Nernst, was a district judge. He spent his early school years at
  Graudentz, and subsequently went to the Universities of
  Zurich, Berlin and Graz (Ludwig Boltzmann and
  Albert von Ettinghausen), studying physics and mathematics,
  before proceeding to Wurzburg (Friedrich Kohlrausch), where he
  graduated in 1887 with a thesis on electromotive forces produced
  by magnetism in heated metal plates. He joined <a href=
  "../1909/index.html">Wilhelm Ostwald</a> at Leipzig
  University, where <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/index.html">van 't Hoff</a> and
  <a href="../1903/index.html">Arrhenius</a> were already
  established, and it was in this distinguished company of physical
  chemists that Nernst began his important researches.<br>
  <br>
  In 1894 he received invitations to the Physics Chairs in Munich
  and in Berlin, as well as to the Physical Chemistry Chair in
  G&ouml;ttingen. He accepted this latter invitation, and in
  G&ouml;ttingen founded the Institute for Physical Chemistry and
  Electrochemistry and became its Director. In 1905 he was
  appointed Professor of Chemistry, later of Physics, in the
  University of Berlin, becoming Director of the newly-founded
  "Physikalisch-Chemisches Institut" in 1924. He remained in this
  position until his retirement in 1933.<br>
  <br>
  Nernst's early studies in electrochemistry were inspired by
  Arrhenius' dissociation theory which first recognized the
  importance of ions in solution. In 1889 he elucidated the theory
  of galvanic cells by assuming an "electrolytic pressure of
  dissolution" which forces ions from electrodes into solution and
  which was opposed to the osmotic pressure of the dissolved ions.
  In the same year he derived equations which defined the
  conditions by which solids precipitate from saturated solutions.
  His heat theorem, known as the Third Law of Thermodynamics, was
  developed in 1906. It demonstrated that the maximum work
  obtainable from a process could be calculated from the heat
  evolved at temperatures close to absolute zero - earlier ideas
  had not considered the effects of temperature - and conditions of
  equilibrium in many chemical reactions could now be precisely
  worked out. In addition to its theoretical implications, the
  theorem was soon applied to industrial problems, induding
  calculations in ammonia synthesis.<br>
  <br>
  Nernst and his students in Berlin proceeded to make many
  important physico-chemical measurements, particularly
  determinations of specific heats of solids at very low
  temperatures and of vapour densities at high temperatures. All
  these were considered from the point of view of quantum
  theory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1918 his studies of photochemistry led him to his atom chain
  reaction theory. This assumed that once the energy of a quantum
  has initiated a reaction in which free atoms are formed, these
  formed atoms can themselves decompose other molecules with the
  liberation of more free atoms and so on. The reaction can thus
  continue for long periods without further outside
  initiations.<br>
  <br>
  Nernst was mechanically minded and he was always to the forefront
  in considering ways of applying the results of scientific
  research to industry. His improved electric light, the Nernst
  Lamp, used a ceramic body and it might have assumed importance
  had not tantalum and tungsten filaments been developed. His
  electrical piano, which replaced the sounding board with radio
  amplifiers, did not gain acceptance among musicians. In later
  years, he occupied himself with astrophysical theories, a field
  in which the heat theorem had important applications.<br>
  <br>
  For his work in thermochemistry he received the Nobel Prize in
  Chemistry for 1920. Many other distinctions and awards were
  bestowed upon him for his contributions to science.<br>
  <br>
  Walther Nernst's fundamental contributions to electrochemistry,
  the theory of solutions, thermodynamics, solid state chemistry
  and photochemistry are recorded in a series of monographs, and in
  his many papers to learned societies, etc. His book
  <i>Theoretische Chemie vom Standpunkte der Avogadro'schen Regel
  und der Thermodynamik</i> (Theoretical chemistry from the
  standpoint of Avogadro's rule and thermodynamics) was first
  published in 1893 and the tenth edition appeared in 1921 (the
  fifth English edition in 1923). Together with A. Schonflies he
  wrote a textbook <i>Einf&uuml;hrung in die mathematische
  Behandlung der Naturwissenschaften</i> (Introduction to the
  mathematical study of the natural sciences), which reached its
  tenth edition in 1923. Of his other books, his monograph <i>Die
  theoretischen und experimentellen Grundlagen des neuen
  W&auml;rmesatzes</i> (1918, second edition 1923) was also
  published in English (The New Heat Theorem, 1926).<br>

  Nernst married Emma Lohmeyer in 1892. They had two sons, who were
  both killed in the First World War, and three daughters. His
  favourite pastimes were hunting and fishing. He died in Berlin on
  November 18, 1941.</p>
