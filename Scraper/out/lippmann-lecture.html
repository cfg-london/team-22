  <h2>Colour Photography</h2>

  <p>The problem of direct colour photography
  has been facing us since the turn of the last century. Edmond
  Becquerel, as is known, gave a first solution though only an
  imperfect one. Becquerel showed that the colours of the image of
  the dark room print on a layer of violet silver chloride. Zenker
  explained Becquerel's finding by a phenomenon of interference.
  Experiment shows that this explanation is not true and that
  Zenker's theory does not hold good for silver chloride.
  Becquerel's prints remained, however, what they were: not fixed,
  and fading in light. Then Otto Wiener fixed by photography a shot
  of interference fringes that are found in the neighbourhood of a
  silver mirror. That physicist did not, however, envisage
  obtaining colours by an interference method. I will not lay any
  further stress on the background of experiments and ideas which
  preceded the method on which I am to have the honour of
  addressing you, and which furnishes the coloured image of
  objects.</p>

  <p>The method is very simple. A plate is
  covered with a sensitive transparent layer that is even and
  grainless. This is placed in a holder containing mercury. During
  the take, the mercury touches the sensitive layer and forms a
  mirror. After exposure, the plate is developed by ordinary
  processes. After drying the colours appear, visible by reflection
  and now fixed.</p>

  <p>This result is due to a phenomenon of
  interference which occurs within the sensitive layer. During
  exposure, interference takes place between the incident rays and
  those reflected by the mirror, with the formation of interference
  fringes half a wavelength distant from each other. The fringes
  imprint photographically through the whole thickness of the film
  and form a casting for the light rays. When the shot is
  afterwards subjected to white light, colour appears because of
  selective reflection. The plate at each point only sends back to
  the eye the simple colour imprinted. The other colours are
  destroyed by interference. The eye thus perceives at each point
  the constituent colour of the image. This is no more than a
  phenomenon of selective reflection as in the case of the soap
  bubble or mother-of-pearl. The print in itself is formed of
  colourless matter like that of mother-of-pearl or soap film.</p>

  <p>This explanation can be checked by an
  experiment we are going to carry out in front of you. Here first
  is a print of the spectrum projected on to the screen. As you
  see, the colours are bright. We wet the plate and project it on
  to the screen again. There is no colour there. The gelatine has
  swollen and the intervals between the images of the interference
  fringes (Zenker's laminae) have become two or three times too
  large. Wait one minute while the water dries off. We see the
  colours re-appear in accordance with and at the speed of the
  drying process. They re-appear according to an order which can be
  predicted. Red, which corresponds to the greatest wavelengths,
  reappears first, followed by orange, green, blue, and violet.</p>

  <p>The reproduction of the simple colours of
  the spectrum was the easiest to carry out. The photography of
  composite colours that exterior objects present posed a harder
  problem. At first sight it might have been held impossible. In
  effect, in the case of simple light, the interference maxima are
  equidistant planes separated by intervals equal to half a
  wavelength. In the case of composite colour, an infinity of
  systems must be obtained for maxima infinitely slight and with an
  infinity of interval values separating them - that is to say, the
  whole thickness of the sensitive layer is occupied in continuous
  manner by these maxima. The spaces that exist in the instance of
  simple light and which allow to assimilate the photographic plate
  with a series of fine laminae have disappeared. It was thus
  necessary to reshape the theory of the phenomenon in wider terms.
  First it must be noted that the amplitude resulting from the
  interference varies according to a function that is continuous
  even in the case of simple light. The general case is derived by
  an analysis based on one of Fourier's chapters. It can thus be
  demonstrated that photography of composite colours is
  possible.</p>

  <p>Once all theoretic reserve was gone, the
  technical difficulties appertaining to the isochromatism of the
  films remained to be overcome. I got quite good results from
  protein plates. Later, Valenta in Vienna and the Lumi&egrave;res at
  Lyons found means of coating the plates in grainless gelatine,
  sufficiently isochromatic and very much better than the protein
  plate. Dr. Neuhauss in Berlin carried isochromatism to
  perfection. Thanks to the work of Messrs. Miethe, Krone, H.
  Lehmann, and others whom I will not detain you by mentioning, the
  technique of colour photography has been perfected. Allow me to
  show you projections of results obtained.</p>

  vases with flowers, views of Fontainebleau, Lake Annecy,
  Biarritz, Zermatt, Venice, and child portrait from life.)</p>

  <p>The photographs that you are seeing needed
  approximately one minute of exposure to sunlight. The series of
  photographic operations, developing, washing, final drying, takes
  about quarter of an hour. Most of these pictures, taken while
  travelling, were developed on the mantelpiece of a hotel room,
  which proves that the method is easy enough to carry out.</p>

  <p>It nevertheless still remains to be
  perfected in some points. The length of exposure (one minute in
  sunlight) is still too long for the portrait. It was fifteen
  minutes when I first began my work. Progress may continue. Life
  is short and progress is slow.</p>
