  <h2>Anaphylaxis</h2>

  <p>It is not without emotion that I address
  this assembly on the experiments that have brought me, through
  the most gracious favour of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1913/richet-lecture.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se" target="_blank">Caroline Institute</a>, the highest reward that a
  scientist has the right to hope for. I ask your indulgence in
  speaking of my own research, as I must do, and in setting out the
  findings that have given anaphylaxis a leading place in general
  pathology over the last decade.</p>

  <p>First I feel I must explain and indeed
  justify the use of the word itself, for it may seem somewhat
  barbarous at first glance. This neologism I invented twelve years
  ago on the assumption, which I think is still valid, that a new
  idea calls for a new word in the name of scientific precision of
  language.</p>

  <p><i>Phylaxis</i>, a word seldom used, stands
  in the Greek for protection. <i>Anaphylaxis</i> will thus stand
  for the opposite. Anaphylaxis, from its Greek etymological
  source, therefore means that state of an organism in which it is
  rendered hypersensitive, instead of being protected.</p>

  <p>To make this plain, we will consider the
  example of a subject that has received a poison.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose the dosage to be moderate
  and that after a few days the subject is, or at least appears to
  be, normal. If, at this point, a further injection is given of
  the same dosage of the same poison, what will happen?</p>

  <p>There are three possibilities.</p>

  <p>The first and simplest is that there has
  been no change in the organism and that in receiving the same
  dosage as one month previously, exactly the same phenomena will
  result, in exactly the same conditions. Naturally this is what
  happens most of the time. Specialists and doctors work on this
  assumption when they repeat the intoxication at one month
  intervals.</p>

  <p>The second possibility is that the subject
  has become less sensitive. In other words, the preceding
  intoxication has produced a certain condition of tolerance or
  non-sensitivity. This will mean that a stronger dose is necessary
  at the second injection to give the same results. This is the
  case of (relative) immunization or, as it is sometimes called, of
  <i>mithridatism</i>. The most remarkable case of this tolerance
  is to be seen when opium or morphine are used. People who take
  morphine injections need stronger and stronger doses for the
  morphine to take effect. Some unhappy morphine addicts get to the
  point of standing a dose of 20 grams, whereas one decigram is
  dangerous in a normal subject. It has been known for persons to
  drink one litre of laudanum per day, while one drop of laudanum
  produces already some effect.</p>

  <p>These two cases, of unchanged sensitivity
  or <i>stability</i>, and of diminished sensitivity or
  <i>habituation</i>, have been known since long. Now I have shown
  that there is a third possibility, frequently to be observed in
  certain conditions which I have specified: this is of heightened
  sensitivity. The first injection, instead of protecting the
  organism, renders it more fragile and more susceptible. This is
  anaphylaxis.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>These are the circumstances under which I
  first observed this phenomenon. You will allow me to go into some
  details on the origins. You will find that it is by no means the
  result of profound thought but a simple observation, almost a
  fortuitous one; so that my merit has only been in letting myself
  see the facts which were plain before me.</p>

  <p>In tropical waters, Coelenterata are to be
  found floating on the surface, also known as Physalia (Portuguese
  galleys). The basic structure of these creatures is a pocket
  filled with air so that they can float like a bladder. A
  bucco-anal cavity is subjoined to this pocket, with very long
  tentacles which hang in the water. These feelers sometimes run to
  two or three meters long and are equipped with small devices
  which adhere like sucking cups to objects encountered. Within
  each of these innumerable suction-cups is a pin-point which
  drives into the foreign body that is being touched. At the same
  time, this pin-point causes penetration of a subtle but strong
  poison, which is contained in the tentacles, so that contact with
  a feeler of the Physalia is tantamount to a multiple injection of
  poison. On touching a Physalia an acute sensation of pain is felt
  immediately, due to the penetration of this liquid venom. This is
  similar in relative intensity to a swimmer's mishap when he bumps
  into a jelly-fish in the water.</p>

  <p>During a cruise on the yacht of Prince
  Albert of Monaco, the Prince advised me to study Physalia poison,
  together with our friends Georges Richard and Paul Portier. We
  found that it is easily dissolved in glycerol and that by
  injecting this glycerol solution, the symptoms of Physalia
  poisoning are reproduced.</p>

  <p>When I came back to France and had no more
  Physalia to study, I hit upon the idea of making a comparative
  study of the tentacles of the Actinia (<i>Actinia eqnina</i>,
  <i>Anemone sulcata</i>) which can be obtained in large
  quantities, for Actinia abound on all the rocky shores of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>Now Actinia tentacles, treated with
  glycerol, give off their poison into the glycerol and the extract
  is toxic. I therefore set about finding how toxic it was, with
  Portier. This was quite difficult to do, as it is a slowly acting
  poison and three or four days must elapse before it can be known
  if the dose be fatal or not. I was using a solution of one kilo
  of glycerol to one kilo of tentacles. The lethal dose was of the
  order of 0.1 liquid per kilo live weight of subject.</p>

  <p>But certain of the dogs survived, either
  because the dose was not strong enough or for some other reason.
  At the end of two, three or four weeks, as they seemed normal, I
  made use of them for a new experiment.</p>

  <p>An unexpected phenomenon arose, which we
  thought extraordinary. A dog when injected previously even with
  the smallest dose, say of 0.005 liquid per kilo, immediately
  showed serious symptoms : vomiting, blood diarrhoea, syncope,
  unconsciousness, asphyxia and death. This basic experiment was
  repeated at various times and by 1902 we were able to state three
  main factors which are the corner-stone of the history of
  anaphylaxis: (1) a subject that had a previous injection is far
  more sensitive than a new subject; (2) that the symptoms
  characteristic of the second injection, namely swift and total
  depression of the nervous system, do not in any way resemble the
  symptoms characterizing the first injection; (3) a three or four
  week period must elapse before the anaphylactic state results.
  This is the period of incubation.</p>

  <p>Once these first factors in anaphylaxis
  were well grounded, the field opened right up, thanks to the
  skilled and fruitful research of many investigators.</p>

  <p>In 1903 Arthus, in Lausanne, showed that a
  first intravenous injection of serum on a rabbit causes
  anaphylaxis, i.e. three weeks after the first injection the
  rabbit is hypersensitive to the second injection. The phenomenon
  of anaphylaxis was becoming of general application. Instead of
  applying only to toxins and toxalbumins, it held good for all
  proteins, whether toxic at the first injection or not.</p>

  <p>Two years later Rosenau and Anderson, two
  American physiologists, demonstrated in a noteworthy piece of
  work that the phenomenon of anaphylaxis occurs after every
  injection of serum, even when the injection is minute, for
  example of 0.00001 ml which is an infinitely small amount but
  nevertheless sufficient to anaphylactize an animal. They quoted
  examples of anaphylaxis from all organic liquids: milk, serum,
  egg, muscle extract. They specified the reaction and clearly
  showed that of all the subjects, the guinea-pig appeared the most
  sensitive in anaphylactic terms.</p>

  <p>In 1907 I conducted an experiment which
  shed much light on the pathogeny of anaphylaxis. An anaphylactic
  state is produced by taking the blood of an anaphylactized animal
  and injecting it into a normal animal subject. The anaphylactogen
  poison is therefore a chemical substance contained in the
  blood.</p>

  <p>Such are, I think, the main stages through
  which our knowledge has passed. I pass now to particular points I
  wish to stress.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The incubation period varies according to
  the poison used rather than according to the type of animal
  subject. There is however a minimum period of one week (in the
  guineapig, following the injection of milk). With mytilin
  extracted from the common mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>), the
  incubation period is a fortnight. With the dog, using crepitin
  extract from <i>Hura crepitans</i>, the period is longer, of some
  four weeks. With the guinea-pig, following the injection of serum
  - on an exhaustive series of experiments - the incubation period
  is of some eleven days and the reaction symptoms reach their peak
  at the fourteenth day, always allowing for considerable variation
  according to subject.</p>

  <p>But it is a much harder task to state when
  the anaphylactic period has actually passed. Most writers incline
  to the view (and I myself would think them correct in their view)
  that the anaphylactic state never passes. In other words, once a
  subject has been anaphylactized and consequently modified in his
  chemical constitution, then the subject can never go back to his
  former state. Return to normal is not possible. Subjects have
  been known who even after four years from the date of the first
  serum injection, were still sensitive to the unleashing
  reaction.</p>

  <p>Let me add in passing that it is an
  extraordinary phenomenon that so insignificant a quantity of
  poison can modify the organism to the extent that the succeeding
  days down long years can not eradicate this indelible
  modification. Unfortunately minute researches on just this point
  are still lacking. But it certainly looks as though considerable
  differences will be found in the duration of
  anaphylactization.</p>

  <p>Anaphylactic symptoms also vary to a great
  extent, although the differences are marked rather according to
  the nature of the experimental animal than according to the
  nature of the poison used. It is indeed worthy of note to find
  that the phenomena are constant, whatever the poison used.</p>

  <p>I have made especial study of anaphylaxis
  in dogs, which permits of greater accuracy in specifying symptoms
  than in experiments with the guinea-pig. In the dog, four degrees
  of anaphylaxis may be distinguished, according to intensity.</p>

  <p>In the lightest form, the main symptom is
  prurience or itching. The animal, let loose, sneezes and gives
  various shakes of the head as if there was something inconvenient
  in his ears. The dog scratches his head and sides with his paws,
  sometimes frantically. Sometimes he rubs his muzzle against the
  ground and rolls over.</p>

  <p>The next stage in anaphylactic intensity is
  characterized by itching again, but this time more violent. This
  is followed almost immediately by various symptoms; more rapid
  breathing, lowered arterial pressure, faster heart-beat,
  vomiting, blood diarrhoea and rectal tenesmus.</p>

  <p>At the third degree, depression of the
  nervous system is such that the itching has gone or almost gone.
  The animal has no strength to vomit, diarrhoea is marked while
  the fluid passed from the rectum is often almost wholly blood.
  The nervous symptoms often develop so suddenly and violently that
  there is no time for colic and diarrhoea. Ataxia follows at once.
  The animal reels as if drunk, the pupils are dilated, the eyes
  haggard and after heart-rending cries, the animal falls to the
  ground, urinating and defecating underneath himself, unconscious,
  no longer reacting to the excitations and in complete
  mind-blindness. Breathing is laboured and agonized. The heart
  beats are so faint as to be barely perceptible: blood pressure
  hardly reaches the one or two centimetre mercury level. To sum
  up, all the symptoms point to the central nervous system being
  the seat of severe and sudden intoxication. This brutal assault
  of the poison on the nervous system has been called
  <i>anaphylactic shock</i>.</p>

  <p>There is a fourth degree of anaphylaxis, it
  may be said, which is more serious still: when all the symptoms,
  instead of passing off, worsen so that within a quarter or a half
  hour the subject is dead.</p>

  <p>In the dog such death at the onset is rare.
  In most instances, following the anaphylactic shock, the dog
  revives. After fifteen or thirty minutes, he gets to his feet,
  staggering a bit, regains feeling and consciousness and is left
  with only blood diarrhoea still persisting from the anaphylaxis.
  Often death takes place during the night following the injection;
  but constantly after a period of apparent recovery.</p>

  <p>In the rabbit, according to Arthus,
  respiration becomes polypneuic. The animal falls on its side,
  throws its head back, makes running movements with the legs and
  then suddenly breathing stops. Heart failure is systolic and
  death ensues within a couple of minutes.</p>

  <p>Arthus also observed some interesting local
  effects of anaphylaxis in the rabbit. The second injection being
  given in the same ear as the initial injection, ulcers and
  gangrene appear, although there are almost no general symptoms.
  This local effect of anaphylaxis is often called the "Arthus
  phenomenon".</p>

  <p>The guinea-pig is extremely sensitive to
  anaphylaxis. If the anaphylaxis is slight, only symptoms of
  itching, excitation and heightened breathing appear. Often the
  animal falls on its side, sometimes in violent convulsions,
  sometimes on the contrary paralysed and powerless. In both of
  these cases, death takes place fast and it is almost a matter of
  seconds between the injection and the final failure of the
  heart.</p>

  <p>Anaphylaxis has been observed in all
  animals: the horse, the goat, the ox, the rat, the pigeon, the
  duck and even recently in frogs.</p>

  <p>Anaphylaxis takes place also in human
  subjects and has caused death in certain instances. It is indeed
  probable that sudden death following the bursting of a hydatid
  cyst is an anaphylactic phenomenon. Some years back I was in
  Brazil and I heard the story of a doctor who had given himself a
  preventive injection of anti-plague serum. The next year a new
  outbreak of plague was feared so he persuaded his students to
  have a preventive injection of the same serum. He set the example
  by giving himself another one. This was however an unleashing
  injection and his body had been affected by the first. The second
  injection was fatal and within two hours he was dead.</p>

  <p>Now however the effects of anaphylaxis in
  mankind are very well known. Two doctors from Vienna, Pirquet and
  Schick, have studied the matter with the greatest care. They have
  described serum-sickness ("Serum-Krankheit") in children
  subjected to injections of diphtheria serum and they saw that it
  was in most cases an anaphylactic phenomenon. It is only in the
  rarest cases that the first injection is productive of immediate
  reaction. When it comes to the second injection, an immediate
  reaction follows for 90% of the cases, that is to say when the
  period between the first and second injection is from ten to
  thirty days.</p>

  <p>The symptoms to be observed are very close
  to symptoms observed in animal subjects: urticaria, erythema,
  pangs of pain, itching and in the worst cases demi-syncope, with
  nausea, vomiting, hyperthermia, edema over the whole skin area
  and general urticaria.</p>

  <p>Thus by comparison of anaphylactic effects
  in man and the animals, it will be seen that they are akin. It is
  as if poison had been produced, which reacts upon the nervous
  system, especially on the vaso-motor nerves or the trophic nerves
  of the skin.</p>

  <p>It is now opportune to examine the
  substances apt to develop the anaphylactic state. They can be
  defined very simply, by using a fairly arbitrary system of
  classification, which groups substances in <i>colloids</i> on the
  one hand and <i>crystalloids</i> on the other.</p>

  <p>Crystalloids are on the whole non-active. I
  am not aware of any successful attempt to induce anaphylaxis by
  one crystallizable salt or by any alkaloid. On the other hand all
  the proteins without exception produce anaphylaxis: one has seen
  this with all sera, milks, organic extracts whatsoever, all
  vegetable extracts, microbial proteinotoxins, yeast cells, dead
  microbial bodies. It would be of more interest now to find a
  protein which does not produce anaphylaxis than to find one that
  does.</p>

  <p>But what is above all important is to know
  the degree of specificity of these injections.</p>

  <p>At first sight it looks as if the
  specificity is pushed very far. For example if the preparatory
  injection is of goat's milk, then the unleashing injection will
  be much stronger and will have more intensive effects if made
  from goat's milk than if made from cow's or sheep's. Again, for
  the unleashing injection of horse serum to take maximum effect,
  the first injection should also be of horse serum. It is obvious
  that the animal in this case is still somewhat sensitive to a
  second injection with serum from a dog or rabbit, but the effect
  is far less. It is thus permitted to conclude that there is
  specificity, that is to say necessary identity between the
  preparatory and the unleashing injection.</p>

  <p>I will be coming back to the meaning of
  this term, specificity. First, I will mention a curious use to
  which anaphylaxis has been put in forensic medicine, on this
  principle that there is specificity.</p>

  <p>Suppose for the sake of example some blood
  drops of unknown provenance, which however must be discovered in
  the name of medical jurisprudence. Let us say, it has to be
  established whether the blood is human or of a dog or a pig or an
  ox. Guinea-pigs are used; one is injected with human serum,
  another with dog serum, another with ox serum, and another with
  pig serum. Then one month later, the blood of unknown provenance
  is made into a water solution. The same small quantity of the
  unknown blood is then injected into each of the guinea-pigs in
  turn. If one of them shows morbid symptoms and dies, for example
  the guinea-pig that had the human-blood serum injection, then we
  will conclude that the blood in question was in fact human
  blood.</p>

  <p>I will recount at this point another
  experiment which was out of the ordinary. Flesh was taken from
  the mummified form of a man, three or four thousand years old.
  Muscle extract was made from this. The injection of this fluid
  into guinea-pigs made them sensitive to muscle serum and to human
  muscle serum only. This would show, were it necessary, that the
  chemical components of the human body have undergone no great
  variation in the course of the last four thousand years.</p>

  <p>This series of evidence gives good reason
  for recognizing the specificity of anaphylaxis. However there
  must be no overstatement. Let us note that guinea-pigs sensitive
  to cow-milk serum are not altogether non-sensitive to goat- or
  sheep-milk serum, although their preparatory injection was only
  of cow-milk serum.</p>

  <p>Two further series of observations I have
  made quite recently do lead me to question the hard and fast
  rules for specificity in anaphylaxis one is tempted to lay down.
  First, when I gave a preparatory injection of crepitin and I
  determined one month later the emetic dose (that means the dose
  causing vomiting) of apomorphine, I saw that with normal dogs a
  dose of apomorphine hydrochloride equal to 0.00275 of the salt
  per kilogram caused vomiting in 21% of the dogs, whereas with
  dogs initially injected with crepitin, for the same dose of
  apomorphine hydrochloride, vomiting ensued in 63% of them.</p>

  <p>Anaphylactic dogs are thus more sensitive
  to apomorphine than normal dogs, and it follows that there exists
  <i>general</i> anaphylaxis, as apomorphine in no way resembles
  crepitin.</p>

  <p>Further, the second experiment to be
  adduced against the specificity of anaphylaxis I conducted with
  two kinds of toxalbumin, extracted from the Actinia, a substance
  which I named <i>congestin</i>, as its property is to bring on
  grave congestion of the circulatory system in the intestines and
  stomach. Two congestins may be prepared at some pains: yellow
  congestin, soluble in a fluid containing 50% alcohol, and black
  congestin, completely insoluble in a fluid containing 25%
  alcohol. Now I was able to show that black congestin is not
  unleashing, but is better as the preparatory injection than the
  yellow congestin. This gives us authority for thinking that the
  sensitizing (or preparatory) property and the unleashing property
  belong to allied protein groups, but not identical ones.
  Biological chemistry will no doubt unravel these two substances.
  In practice the two substances, preparatory and unleashing, are
  almost always lined up together, so that we have a near right to
  pronounce on strict specificity.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Another experiment of prime importance is
  this, for it shows the very nature of the anaphylactic process.
  In April 1907 I showed that the injection of serum from an
  anaphylactized dog induced an anaphylactic state in untreated
  dogs, as if this serum contained the toxic substance which
  activates the unleashing injection.</p>

  <p>With actino-congestin, the experiment is
  clear-cut. Almost harmless doses cause death within a matter of
  hours in dogs that had not been anaphylactized, but had had
  injections of serum from anaphylactized animals. This is what is
  known as <i>passive anaphylaxis</i>.</p>

  <p>At about the same time, in May and June
  1907, Gay and Southard in America, and Otto in Germany, also
  showed quite clearly that passive anaphylaxis exists. It has
  become one of the classic tenets of anaphylaxis.</p>

  <p>Another finding, that I call anaphylaxis in
  vitro, allowed me as it were to synthesize the poison that is
  released during the unleashing injection.</p>

  <p>The experiment worked best with crepitin.
  The immediate toxic effect of a certain dosage of crepitin was
  first determined, say of 0.004 g. Then serum is taken from an
  animal anaphylactized by crepitin, and in this serum is dissolved
  0.004 g of crepitin. This injection is harmless, providing the
  crepitin had been diluted with water. It is however very
  offensive when the crepitin is dissolved in serum from a dog that
  has been anaphylactized. It must thus be admitted that by some
  chemical combination the crepitin in conjunction with the unknown
  substance in the anaphylactic serum has given rise to a veritable
  poison.</p>

  <p>The effects of this new poison are
  extremely strong, as the following experiment will show. It was
  carried out on a bitch that had been given an active dose of
  crepitin mixed with the anaphylactic serum. "Severe vomiting,
  diarrhoea, rectal tenesmus: unable to keep standing, she urinates
  under herself; the pupils are dilated, the eyes haggard; complete
  mind-blindness, near-total failure of reflexes, deep
  unconsciousness, breathing dyspneic, heart-beat faint and very
  fast, pulse barely perceptible; dead in thirty-six hours."</p>

  <p>Thus, the mixture of the antigen with the
  blood of an animal anaphylactized by this same antigen, produces
  a strong violent poison which is different from the antigen
  itself.</p>

  <p>To evaluate this reaction, we must mention
  a valuable experiment of Claude Bernard carried out long ago.
  Bitter almonds contain two substances: amygdalin which is
  harmless and emulsin which is harmless too. Animal subjects
  survive an injection of either amygdalin or emulsin. But emulsin
  is a diastase and has the property of breaking up amygdalin,
  liberating hydrocyanic acid, which is one of the most virulent
  toxic gases known. Thus if an animal that has been given
  amygdalin is then injected with emulsin, hydrocyanic acid will be
  formed in the blood stream and death will take place at once. Yet
  injected separately, neither the amygdalin nor the emulsin has
  any effect.</p>

  <p>It is just the same with anaphylactic serum
  and the antigen. Separate, they are harmless. Together, they are
  fatal.</p>

  <p>A simple hypothesis suggests itself, even
  though Wolf-Eissner has not yet been able to accept it. Let us
  assume the existence of a substance in the anaphylactized blood,
  which we will call <i>toxogenin</i>. It is in itself harmless as
  animals have it in the blood and seem to enjoy good health. It
  may moreover be injected into other animal subjects without harm.
  But if toxogenin is mixed with antigen, then a new poison is
  produced, which has immediate and serious consequences. This
  poison, derived as it is from the antigen, I propose to call
  <i>apotoxin</i>. The chemical reaction is straightforward:
  toxogenin + antigen = apotoxin.</p>

  <p>This appears to be a general law of
  biological chemistry: that bodies that are non-active and
  harmless in themselves become harmful and activated when in
  reaction one to the other. Trypsin is non-active when it has not
  been in contact with enterokinase. The sperm must perforce
  contact the ovum in order for fertilization to take place,
  Hydrochloric acid must contact pepsin, for digestion, etc. All
  workers on anaphylaxis have had to assume the existence of this
  sensitizing substance that I called toxogenin. Besredka later
  called it sensibilisin, while Friedberger called it
  <i>anaphylatoxin</i>. The name matters little. The fact is that
  there exists in anaphylactized blood a substance harmless in
  itself but which releases a strong poison when mixed with the
  antigen.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I omit the details of the successful
  experiments undertaken by Besredka on antianaphylaxis, together
  with the painstaking work of Friedberger and his pupils on
  deviation of the complement. I will only mention the course of my
  own original research, for I have no hope in this lecture of
  covering the whole field of anaphylaxis research.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is relevant here to indicate the
  relationship I have been able to establish between leucocytosis
  and anaphylaxis, a relationship that is hard to grasp without
  elaborate techniques and prolonged observations. All my
  experiments have been conducted on dogs, with the help of my
  friend P. Lassabli&egrave;re who did the calculations.</p>

  <p>The number of white corpuscles or
  leucocytes in the normal dog is 100 per hundredth of a millimeter
  cubic on average, varying from 70 to 130. In animals, now, that
  have been anaphylactized, even after a considerable time-lag of
  say six months, when they appear to be completely normal and in
  perfect health, the number of leucocytes reaches and often
  exceeds 200.</p>

  <p>An initial injection which makes the body
  anaphylactic, therefore, induces a marked leucocytosis and this
  is the only symptom that can be observed.</p>

  <p>With weaker doses of antigen and with
  antigens that are harmless or practically so, such as peptone,
  the anaphylactic leucocytosis does not last as long but is
  nevertheless pronounced. A quantity of peptone equal to 0.005 per
  kilo live weight will still give leucocytosis and bring about
  either immunity or anaphylaxis. There is no reaction more
  sensitive than that of leucocytosis. By systematic analysis of
  this subtle phenomenon it seems clear to me that certain
  conclusions may be made which would have been utterly out of the
  question otherwise.</p>

  <p>I will cite as illustration some
  experiments which I am still making on the action of chloroform
  on dogs. On a dog chloroformed for the first time, the number of
  leucocytes in the blood undergoes no modification either under
  the anasthaetic or after, whether on the second or the tenth or
  the twentieth day. If however a second chloroformization is
  carried out a month or so after the first, in conditions as
  nearly identical with the first as may be permissible, then on
  the third or the fourth or the fifth day in particular, severe
  leucocytosis will appear, reaching 220 or 250 leucocytes.</p>

  <p>What is the explanation of this curious
  phenomenon? There can be no question of real anaphylaxis, for
  anaphylaxis is always severe, immediate and terrible, whereas in
  this instance, the leucocytosis only appeared on the third or the
  fourth day.</p>

  <p>I have necessarily arrived at the following
  hypothesis. Namely, that the chloroform works on the hepatic
  cells and causes the break-up of certain protein substances in
  them, which pass thence to the blood stream. If it is the first
  time that these proteins have been released to reach the blood,
  then there is no leucocytic reaction. If, after an interval of
  three weeks, a new break-up takes place in the liver as a result
  of the second chloroformization, then this behaves like a second
  protein injection, the unleashing injection on an anaphylactized
  animal.</p>

  <p>There does exist then, besides
  <i>direct</i> anaphylaxis, an <i>indirect</i> anaphylaxis. about
  which little is so far known. But it seems that indirect
  anaphylaxis greatly widens the scope of anaphylactic action.
  Anaphylactic phenomena have been the subject of much medical
  research. It would take too long even to list. As I have not
  myself undertaken work in this respect, I forbear to dwell on
  it</p>

  <p>I cannot however pass over the possible
  relationship between anaphylaxis and tuberculin reactions. This
  topic is highly controversial and undoubtedly worthy of further
  studies.</p>

  <p>From the start of our research on
  anaphylaxis, we noticed the analogy existing between anaphylaxis
  and sensitivity of tuberculous animals to tuberculin. The
  admirable contributions of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/index.html">R. Koch</a>, which has
  since been borne out by numberless experiments undertaken by
  others, showed that a normal animal does not react to tuberculin,
  whereas tuberculous animals do react to doses a thousand times
  weaker. What is this heightened sensitivity, if not
  anaphylaxis?</p>

  <p>When it came to questions of detail,
  considerable differences were found to appear. In fact a first
  injection of tuberculin does not make normal animals sensitive to
  a second injection. The blood of tuberculous animals does not
  induce passive anaphylaxis. Lastly, the anaphylactic reaction is
  on the whole one of hypothermy, while the tuberculin injection on
  tuberculous subjects always causes hyperthermy.</p>

  <p>However, I do not believe that these are
  fundamental objections. At most they prove that the growth of the
  Koch bacillus produces preparatory substances which are not to be
  found in tuberculin. Tuberculin contains unleashing substances,
  but the preparatory substances are lacking, probably because the
  numerous chemical changes that must take place before the
  tuberculin can be extracted from tuberculous cultures have
  themselves caused change in the preparatory substance. I am of
  the firm belief that in the animal organism infected by the
  tubercle bacillus, the infection creates substances that act as
  preparatory, but which are not found in tuberculin as we use it.
  This is not paradoxical, at all.</p>

  <p>It may be thought that general application
  can be made of this anaphylactic method of diagnosis. Two methods
  lie open. One, the patient may be given a subcutaneous injection
  of specific serum to see if he is sensitive to the reaction. The
  other is to take the patient's serum and inject it into
  guinea-pigs, seeing after the passage of two or three days if the
  guinea-pigs are sensitive to such and such bacterial toxin.</p>

  <p>I considered whether this method of
  diagnosis by anaphylaxis might not be made use of in cancer.
  Taking cancer tumours and precipitating by alcohol the aqueous
  extract of such tumours, a precipitate results which admits of
  purification by being dissolved and precipitated in successive
  steps. This dry product can then be dissolved in water and
  injected into patients suffering from cancer. If
  anaphylacto-diagnosis of cancer did really exist, this injection
  would produce a certain reaction. This was not the case. Some of
  my colleagues made the injection of this product into patients
  with cancer. The effects of the injection were absolutely
  nil.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>While on the subject of negative
  experiments, I wish to say a word on what I call <i>homogenic</i>
  anaphylaxis. The aim was to discover if the injection into an
  animal of blood from another subject of the same species,
  provokes a stronger reaction at the second injection than at the
  first, always given the same source for the transfusion in both
  cases.</p>

  <p>Here again the results were absolutely nil.
  A dog A was injected with 70 gram per kilo of the blood of
  another dog B. Not much happened. A month later, the same dog A
  that had been treated was given a further injection of 70 gram
  per kilo of blood from the same transfusion source dog B. No
  symptom was observed. It seems thus there is no such thing as
  homogenic anaphylaxis, and the blood of one species of animal
  injected into an animal of the same kind is harmless both at the
  first and at the second injection.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To date, all experiments mentioned above
  have been carried out by parenteral injections, that is to say
  that the substance introduced into the blood was introduced by
  other means than the digestion, and namely by means of
  subcutaneous, intravenous, intraspinal and peritoneal injections.
  But there is also anaphylaxis which comes after ingestion by way
  of the digestive system. This is <i>alimentary</i> anaphylaxis
  and it follows ingestion by the digestive duct.</p>

  <p>It was for the first time demonstrated by
  Rosenau and Anderson in 1906 that guinea-pigs were sensitive to
  horse serum after first ingesting horse serum by way of the
  digestive tract.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It should be understood that the term
  alimentary anaphylaxis does not signify anaphylaxis by alimentary
  substances but anaphylaxis by the introduction of the
  anaphylactizing substance by way of the digestive channels.
  Alimentary anaphylaxis is characterized by the antigen, whether
  alimentary or not, being introduced into the organism by means of
  the digestive tube. Introduction by the rectal duct is not
  included, as the essential feature of alimentary ingestion is
  absent, which is the modification of the antigen by the digestive
  juices.</p>

  <p>Alimentary anaphylaxis has been studied on
  various hands since Rosenau and Anderson, but the results are not
  so far constant nor uniform. I have tried to tackle the problem
  from another angle, that is to see under what conditions
  substances introduced into the stomach can pass into the blood. I
  used a reagent that is extremely sensitive, namely
  leucocytosis.</p>

  <p>A dog is given cooked meat: no leucocytosis
  results. A dog is given raw meat, even one fifth in quantity
  compared with the cooked meat, then in three or four hours time,
  leucocytosis results. The most likely and simplest explanation is
  that when cooked meat is ingested, all the proteins have become
  non-soluble and can not be made soluble except by the action of
  digestive juices: pepsin, trypsin and erepsin. The products of
  the break-up of the protein that are formed are non-toxic and do
  not induce the leucocytic reaction. It is therefore not
  surprising that cooked meat should be ingested without affecting
  the leucocytes, for no soluble protein has been introduced into
  the stomach, and the only proteins which can pass it are those
  that have been modified, transformed and homogenized by the
  digestive juices.</p>

  <p>Now if muscle serum or raw meat is
  ingested, then soluble proteins are introduced into the stomach.
  The digestive juices have powerful action, but it is probable
  that part of the protein escapes and certain particles pass into
  the circulation, thus effecting a true antigen injection, which
  can thus set off the leucocyte reaction.</p>

  <p>It follows that each time soluble protein
  is introduced by the digestive channels, anaphylactic reaction
  may result, as it is equivalent to an antigen injection.</p>

  <p>This may explain away the divergences of
  opinion among physiologists in respect of alimentary anaphylaxis,
  for following the introduction of a protein, depending on whether
  it is soluble or not, whether it is absorbed or not, whether it
  is resistant to the action of the ferments or not, it will or
  will not penetrate into the blood system.</p>

  <p>In fact I have been able with crepitin to
  cause a clear instance of alimentary anaphylaxis.</p>

  <p>I have indicated that there are three
  methods of alimentary anaphylaxis. Let us call the alimentary
  ingestion <i>A</i>, and the parenteral injection <i>P</i>. The
  following combinations are possible: (I) <i>A</i> preparatory,
  <i>A</i> releasing; (2) <i>A</i> preparatory, <i>P</i> releasing
  ; (3) <i>P</i> preparatory, <i>A</i> releasing. Even in the first
  of these three cases (<i>A</i> + <i>A</i>) where the anaphylaxis
  is strictly alimentary, for the initial ingestion as well as the
  subsequent ingestion, there is no doubt about anaphylaxis having
  taken place. When a dog ingests crepitin for the first time, he
  never vomits. When he ingests it for the second time, some three
  weeks later, he always vomits. This is the anaphylactic
  protective vomit. In the second case (<i>A</i> + <i>P</i>), the
  preparatory ingestion being alimentary and the releasing
  injection parenteral, the results are clearer still. In effect
  the anaphylactic shock is violent and plainly proves that a small
  quantity of crepitin must have escaped the digestive juices at
  the first ingestion and passed to the blood, as the lasting
  leucocytosis to be found in animals that have ingested crepitin
  also shows.</p>

  <p>I have observed in this connection a
  remarkable fact: a period of one year between the initial
  ingestion and the subsequent parenteral injection. A dog ingested
  in June 1911 a strong dose of crepitin and survived. (Whatever
  the ose, it is not possible to poison dogs by ingesting
  crepitin.) After one year had passed, in June 1912, this dog had
  a harmless crepitin injection and died within an hour and a half
  as if struck by lightning. The death of a dog at this speed from
  anaphylactic shock is very rare indeed.</p>

  <p>To these experiments, I must add the work
  of Gideon Wells and Thomas Osborne. In January 1911, they made a
  close study of the anaphylactizing and immunizing action of
  vegetable proteins.</p>

  <p>The general conclusion is as expected but
  nevertheless necessary to be shown: (1) through the digestive
  mucous membranes never passes more than tiny amounts of colloids,
  but sometimes it does pass them; (2) these minute amounts are
  enough on occasion to cause the anaphylactic state either
  preparatory or unleashing; (3) the amounts of colloids that pass
  into the digestive juices are weak enough to give immunity rather
  than anaphylaxis, especially if it be remembered that most are
  cases of ingestion repeated and increased at various intervals:
  all which conditions favour antianaphylaxis immunity rather than
  true anaphylaxis.</p>

  <p>These findings in the field of alimentary
  anaphylaxis are perhaps not without importance to clinical
  medicine. It may be that many cases of dyspepsia are nothing more
  than light attacks of anaphylaxis. Doctors have long found that
  regular diet on strictly uniform lines was to be preferred to all
  other regimens. It is as if by the repeated ingestion of one some
  protein substance the organism had accustomed itself to it and
  had immunized itself against this usual antigen.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>No need to go over the more extraordinary
  aspects of alimentary anaphylaxis that had hitherto remained
  unexplained. It has long been known that some people are
  sensitive to cheese or to strawberries or to fish or to shellfish
  or to eggs or even to milk. Now the symptoms to be seen in such
  individuals on ingesting such and such foods are analogous to the
  effects of anaphylaxis: acute stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhoea,
  colic, erythema, urticaria, severe itching and sometimes cardiac
  troubles and fever. We know now that these are anaphylactic
  phenomena; this has become a pathological commonplace.</p>

  <p>We shall conclude by reiterating the
  various phenomena and attempting to establish their import in
  general terms.</p>

  <p>In the first place anaphylaxis, like
  immunization, creates humoral differentiations between different
  individuals.</p>

  <p>A guinea-pig that is anaphylactized by
  horse serum will not be identical to untreated guinea-pigs nor to
  guinea-pigs anaphylactized by ox or dog serum. This means that
  over and above the individual differences due to diverse means of
  immunization, there are individual differences due to diverse
  anaphylactizations. One has only to think of the innumerable
  quantity of substances that are anaphylactizing and the
  substances that can immunize, and one will conclude that the
  chemical or humoral diversity is so to say unlimited with the
  different individuals.</p>

  <p>To be different from other members of the
  same species, an animal has only to receive into his blood a
  small quantity of alien protein which anaphylactizes him in a
  special way, or for a microbe to evolve in his blood which gives
  him immunity in a special way. In the course of some years' life
  span, the same organism that is unique will accumulate immunities
  or anaphylaxia that appertain to it, diversely grouped in diverse
  subjects until each one of these persons will differ from all
  others.</p>

  <p>Each one of us, by our chemical make-up,
  above all by our blood and probably also by the protoplasm of
  each cell, is himself and no one else. In other words, he has a
  <i>humoral personality</i>. We all know very well what the
  personality of the psyche is. The multiplicity and the variety of
  our memories make each one of us different from all other human
  beings. We all have a body of stored impressions which preclude
  our being confused with any other specimen of our kind. Nothing
  could be clearer than this idea of the personality in terms of
  psyche which stands to reason and is valid in all human
  conscience.</p>

  <p>Now, in the light of notions of immunity
  and of anaphylaxis, we can conceive of another personality in
  juxtaposition to the moral personality and that is the <i>humoral
  personality</i>, which makes us different from other men by the
  chemical make-up of our humours.</p>

  <p>This is an entirely new idea. It was
  thought up to now, perhaps from lack of after-thought, that with
  individuals of the same age, race and sex the humors would no
  doubt be chemically identical. Well, it is not like that at all.
  Every living being, though presenting the strongest resemblances
  to others of his species, has his own characteristics so that he
  is himself and not somebody else. This means that henceforth
  study of the physiology of the species is no longer enough.
  Another physiology must be taken up, which is very difficult and
  barely broached, namely that of the individual.</p>

  <p>It may be asked how anaphylaxis fits in to
  that general law, which admits of no exceptions, that living
  organisms exist in an optimum state of protection.</p>

  <p>It does indeed seem absurd that an organic
  disposition should make beings more fragile, more susceptible to
  poisons, for in most cases everything in living beings seems
  disposed to assure them a greater power of resistance.</p>

  <p>But some reflection on the final aim of
  anaphylaxis will give the answer.</p>

  <p>It is in fact important that animal species
  are of determined chemical entity. If, following the hazard of
  ingestion or injection, alien proteins were found in the cellular
  juices as part of our humours, then the chemical make-up of
  beings would be modified and consequently perverted. Crystalloids
  dialyse through membranes and are speedily eliminated. In a few
  days, even in a few hours, they are completely gone. Colloids
  however, that no dialysis can eliminate, do not disappear once
  they have penetrated to the blood. They fix on cellules and end
  up by being integral to them.</p>

  <p>Grave danger would thus face the animal
  species, were they not nicely balanced in their hereditary
  chemical make-up. If heterogenous substances got fixed into our
  cellules and definitely intermingled with our humours, that would
  be the end of the chemical constitution of each animal species,
  which is the fruit of slow evolution down the generations, and
  all the progress that has been achieved through selection and
  heredity would be lost.</p>

  <p>It does not matter much that the individual
  becomes more vulnerable in this regard. There is something more
  important than the salvation of the person and that is integral
  preservation of the race.</p>

  <p>In other words, to formulate the hypothesis
  in somewhat abstract terms but clear ones all the same: <i>the
  life of the individual is less important than the stability of
  the species</i>.</p>

  <p>Anaphylaxis, perhaps a sorry matter for the
  individual, is necessary to the species, often to the detriment
  of the individual. The individual may perish, it does not matter.
  The species must at any time keep its organic integrity intact.
  Anaphylaxis defends the species against the peril of
  adulteration.</p>

  <p>We are so constituted that we can never
  receive other proteins into the blood than those that have been
  modified by digestive juices. Every time alien protein penetrates
  by effraction, the organism suffers and becomes resistant. This
  resistance lies in increased sensitivity, a sort of revolt
  against the second parenteral injection which would be fatal. At
  the first injection, the organism was taken by surprise and did
  not resist. At the second injection, the organism mans its
  defences and answers by the anaphylactic shock.</p>

  <p>Seen in these terms, anaphylaxis is an
  universal defence mechanism against the penetration of
  heterogenous substances in the blood, whence they can not be
  eliminated.</p>
