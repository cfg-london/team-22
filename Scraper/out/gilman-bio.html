  <h1>Alfred G. Gilman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gilman.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Alfred Gilman, could play almost
  any musical instrument and frequently did so at neighborhood
  parties; his father owned a music store in Bridgeport,
  Connecticut. My mother, Mabel Schmidt Gilman, was an excellent
  pianist and gave lessons; her father was a professional
  trombonist, also in Bridgeport. Despite this heritage, my musical
  career ended after a few years of mediocre performance with the
  Yale University Concert Band during my days in college.<br>
  <br>
  There were more substantial influences. My father had turned to
  science, receiving his Ph.D. in Physiological Chemistry from Yale
  in 1931 for "Chemical and Physiological Investigations on Canine
  Gastric Secretion". He then joined the faculty of the Department
  of Pharmacology at the Yale Medical School, where he and Louis S.
  Goodman, a young M.D., became colleagues and close friends. A
  major new textbook of Pharmacology <i>The Pharmacological Basis
  of Therapeutics</i>, was the fruit of the Goodman and Gilman
  collaboration, first published in 1941. I too was born in 1941
  (in New Haven, Connecticut) and named Alfred Goodman Gilman.
  Perhaps my fate was sealed from that day; as my friend <a href=
  "../1985/index.html">Michael Brown</a> once said, I am probably
  the only person who was ever named after a textboook.<br>
  <br>
  The bulk of my childhood was spent in a suburb of New York City,
  White Plains, while my father was first on the faculty of The
  College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and
  then the founding Chairman of Pharmacology at the new Albert
  Einstein College of Medicine. I remember exciting trips to the
  city with my parents and elder sister Joanna to visit museums
  and, particularly, the Hayden Planetarium. In the early 1950's I
  made a reservation for a trip to the moon and was quite positive
  that I wanted to be an astronomer. Alas, I eventually learned
  that astronomers do little star gazing, and biology began to look
  more appealing. These feelings were clearly nurtured by trips to
  my father's laboratory, where I was able to watch experiments on
  canine renal function. There were also elaborate pharmacological
  demonstrations prepared for the medical students. All of these
  experiences were very visual. It is perhaps surprising that I
  eventually turned to biochemical approaches to pharmacology; it
  is not much fun to watch someone pipette.<br>
  <br>
  My parents were less than enthusiastic about the local high
  school, and I was "sent away" in 1955, not smiling, to The Taft
  School in Watertown, Connecticut for grades 10 - 12. New England
  boys' "prep" schools were not much fun in the 1950's. There was
  much I did not enjoy, from compulsory rising bells to compulsory
  religion and compulsory athletics. I was surely the worst
  120-pound lineman on the intramural tackle football team. But the
  education was superb, and I learned how to learn. Chemistry,
  physics, and math were extraordinary, and I was even forced to
  write - an essay every week. My final victory was from my English
  teacher. "Not bad, Gilman," he said, "it still sounds like a lab
  report, but not bad."<br>
  <br>
  After Taft, college (at Yale University) was relatively easy and
  a lot more fun. I majored in Biochemistry and was inspired by the
  best series of lectures ever delivered - by Henry A. Harbury, who
  taught half the course. The room was always overflowing, in part
  because the medical interns and residents arrived to hear protein
  chemistry and thermodynamics come to life; I swear it's the
  truth. I also had my first real opportunity to work on my own in
  a lab - that of Melvin Simpson. My project was wildly
  overambitious, to test <a href="../1962/index.html">Francis
  Crick</a>'s adapter hypothesis, but the experience was an
  enormous treat because of Simpson's warmth and strong
  encouragement. I met my eventual wife at this time, and she spent
  many late nights in the lab with me as I manually fed planchettes
  into the radioactivity counter. Perhaps she should have smelled
  the competition.<br>
  <br>
  The summer after college (1962) I worked in Allan Conney's lab at
  Burroughs Wellcome in New York and, thanks to Conney's
  generosity, I published my first two papers. There was no
  question in my mind that research was for me as I headed to
  Case Western
  Reserve University in Cleveland in the fall of 1962,
  following the lure of cyclic AMP and a novel M.D.-Ph.D. program.
  My initial interactions with <a href="../1971/index.html">Earl
  Sutherland</a> are described in my Nobel lecture and need not be
  repeated here. My experience in Cleveland was most notable,
  socially, for my marriage to Kathryn Hedlund and the births of
  our first two children and, scientifically, for interactions with
  Ted Rall, my thesis advisor and now close friend. His commitment
  was epitomized by the excuse, usually necessary, when I arrived
  home for dinner at nine: "I just went into Ted's office at five
  o'clock for a few minutes to talk about an experiment."<br>
  <br>
  Rall was working on cyclic AMP in the brain, while I toiled with
  the thyroid gland. The brain looked a bit more interesting, and I
  was particularly struck by the molecular biologists who had
  "solved" their field and were defecting to the nervous system
  <i>en mass</i>. Clonal cell lines and genetic approaches seemed
  to be the answer, and I asked to work with <a href=
  "../1968/index.html">Marshall Nirenberg</a> via the Pharmacology
  Research Associate Training Program of the National Institute of
  General Medical Sciences. My experience with Marshall (1969 1971)
  was enormously broadening, despite the fact that I was "forced"
  (for a while) to work on cyclic AMP. I also met friends who were
  to have a great influence later, particularly <a href=
  "../1985/index.html">Joseph Goldstein</a>, who had not seen the
  neural light and was working in the residual protein synthesis
  section of the Nirenberg laboratory. I had the fortune to develop
  a simple and sensitive assay for cyclic AMP while in Bethesda. It
  helped make second messengers accessible to everyone, and it
  surely made my name visible as I looked for a job.<br>
  <br>
  Continuing what was to become a habit - when moving, always move
  south - I became an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at the
  University of
  Virginia in Charlottesville in 1971. The position was a
  particularly attractive opportunity to join old friends from
  Cleveland, including Joseph Lamer (the Chairman), Robert Haynes,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1998/index.html">Ferid Murad</a>,
  and Bob Berne. The environment was intellectually supportive and,
  slowly but surely, good things began to happen. Crucial were the
  advent of ligand binding assays for receptors, the development by
  Gordon Tomkins and associates of S49 cells (which were killed by
  cyclic AMP), and the arrival in 1975 of a superb new postdoctoral
  fellow, Elliott Ross. Elliott's hope was to get help from
  genetics while unraveling the biochemistry of a complex piece of
  membrane biology. The cyclic AMP system interested him, and he
  had planned to join Tomkins. Gordon's untimely death forced Ross
  to a second choice, and I was the beneficiary. Ross's
  contributions were enormous, as described in the Nobel lecture,
  and his success inspired others to join the group, particularly
  including his friend from Cornell, Paul Sternweis, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/index.html">John Northrop</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1985/index.html">Joe Goldstein</a>
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1985/index.html">Mike Brown</a>
  approached me to move to Dallas in 1979, but I was totally
  immersed in research and my other major preoccupation, editing
  the sixth edition of <i>Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological
  Basis of Therapeutics</i>. Amusingly, <a href="index.html">Martin
  Rodbell</a> almost took the job, but, when he eventually
  declined, the Dallas crowd came calling again - this time with a
  <i>real</i> talker in the lead, Donald Seldin. Very few say no to
  Dr. Seldin, and I arrived in Dallas to chair the Department of
  Pharmacology in 1981. I have been extraordinarily happy in Dallas
  and have benefitted greatly from close interactions with
  colleagues like Brown and Goldstein and from the opportunity to
  recruit those whom I knew to be superb - Ross and Sternweis. I
  have derived great satisfaction from building what I consider to
  be an excellent department, and I hope that our faculty feel as
  encouraged as I did in Charlottesville. It is easy to be a
  successful Chair in Dallas; our administration, particularly
  President Kern Wildenthal and Dean William Neaves, and local
  philanthropists ensure it.<br>
  <br>
  My wife and three children, Amy, Anne, and Ted, have always been
  strongly supportive and wonderfully understanding of the intense
  competition from my affair with science. My children have not
  benefitted from the lavish fatherly attention that I did. Despite
  me, they are well on their way to happy and productive lives. I
  am very proud of them and of their super mother, who has made up
  for my deficiencies.</p>
