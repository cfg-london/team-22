  <h1>Edward V. Appleton - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="appleton.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Edward Victor Appleton</b> was
  born in Bradford, England, on 6th September, 1892, the son of
  Peter and Mary Appleton. He received his early education at
  Hanson Grammar School. Bradford then took his B.A. degree in
  Natural Science at St. John's College, Cambridge,, in 1913 and 1914,
  with physics for Part II. He won the Wiltshire Prize in 1913 and
  the Hutchinson Research Studentship in 1914, studying under
  <a href="../1906/index.html">Sir J.J. Thomson</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Lord Rutherford</a>.
  During the First World War he joined the West Riding Regiment,
  transferring later to the Royal Engineers. At the conclusion of
  hostilities he returned to Cambridge and took up research on
  radio waves.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1919 Appleton has devoted himself to scientific problems in
  atmospheric physics, using mainly radio techniques. In 1920 he
  was appointed assistant demonstrator in experimental physics at
  the Cavendish
  Laboratory. Two years later he became sub-rector at Trinity
  College.<br>
  <br>
  In 1924 Appleton was appointed Professor of Physics at London University and
  served there for twelve years, returning to Cambridge in 1936 to
  take the Chair of Natural Philosophy.<br>
  <br>
  In the latter part of 1924 Appleton began a series of experiments
  which proved the existence of that layer in the upper atmosphere
  now called the ionosphere. With the co-operation of the British
  Broadcasting Corporation the Bournemouth transmitter shot waves
  up to the layer to see if they were reflected by it and came
  back. The experiment was entirely successful, for the reflection
  was proved. Moreover, by a slight change of wavelength it was
  possible to measure the time taken by the waves to travel to the
  upper atmosphere and back. The position of the reflecting layer
  was thus identified and its height (60 miles above ground)
  determined. The method used was what is now called
  "frequency-modulation radar". The ionosphere was thus the first
  "object" detected by radiolocation, and this led to a great
  development of radio research and to a military invention of the
  greatest importance in World War IL<br>
  <br>
  Further experiments which led to the possibility of
  round-the-world broadcasting were carried out and in 1926 he
  discovered a further atmospheric layer 150 miles above ground,
  higher than the Heaviside Layer and electrically stronger. This
  layer, named the Appleton Layer after him, reflects short waves
  round the earth. Three years later Appleton made an expedition to
  Northern Norway for radio research, studying the Aurora
  Borealis and in 1931 he published the results of further
  research on determining the height of reflecting layers of the
  ionosphere, including the use of a transmitter that sent out
  "spurts" of radio energy, and the photography of the received
  echo-signals by cathode ray oscillography. In 1932 he was elected
  Vice-President of the American Institute of Radio
  Engineers.<br>
  <br>
  When hostilities broke out in 1939 Appleton was appointed
  Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
  - the senior British Government post concerned with physical
  science.<br>
  <br>
  Researches into the atmospheric layers and cathode ray
  oscillography were developed for aircraft detection when Sir
  Robert Watson-Watt and his group of scientists, working on
  Appleton's findings, brought Britain's secret weapon to
  perfection. Commonwealth researchers working with Appleton in
  Britain all became leaders in the development of radiolocation in
  their home countries and Sir Robert Watson-Watt has stated that,
  but for Appleton's scientific work, radar would have come too
  late to have been of decisive use in the Battle of Britain.
  Appleton was knighted in 1941, being created K.C.B., and he was a
  member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the War Cabinet
  which, in 1941, advised the Government that the manufacture of an
  atomic bomb was feasible. Later, under Sir John Anderson, and as
  technical head of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
  Research, he assumed administrative control of all British work
  on the subject. He paid a visit to the United States and Canada
  in 1943 to arrange details of collaboration between American and
  British scientists. He continued research work even during this
  arduous period and has demonstrated that ionospheric reflecting
  power varies with sunspot activities. Also, working with Dr. J.S.
  Hey of the Ministry of Supply, he discovered that sunspots are
  powerful emitters of short radio waves. An important result of
  Appleton's work has been the establishment of a system of
  ionospheric forecasts, in which more than 40 stations all over
  the world co-operate, enabling the production of the most
  suitable wavelengths for communication over any particular radio
  circuit.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947, the year in which he received the Nobel Prize for
  Physics, he was also awarded the highest civilian decoration of
  the United States - the Medal of Merit - and was made an Officer
  of the French Legion of Honour. He was also awarded the Norwegian
  Cross of Freedom for his war work. Appleton's work has been
  recognized by India, Norway and Denmark, and in 1948 he was
  appointed by the Pope to the Pontificial Academy of Science. He
  received the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, in 1950,
  for outstanding services to science and industrial research and
  was elected President of the British Association for the
  Advancement of Science for the Liverpoo1 meeting in 1953. He has
  been Chairman of the British National Committee for
  Radio-Telegraphy and Honorary President of the International
  Scientific Radio Union. During the International Geophysical Year
  1957-1958 he played an active part in the world planning of radio
  experiments as Chairman of the International Geophysical Year
  Committee of the Internationa1 Scientific Radio Union, and
  continues to remain a scientific research worker. He is now
  engaged on the interpretation of l.G.V. ionospheric measurements
  on a global basis.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956 Sir Edward gave the Reith Lectures of the B.B.C. on
  "Science and the Nation". Recent awards made to him have been the
  Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize of the Royal Society, Edinburgh,
  in 1960, and the Medal of Honour of the Institute of Radio
  Engineers of America in 1962.<br>
  <br>
  In 1915 Appleton married Jessie, daughter of the Rev. J. Longson,
  and they have two daughters.</p>
