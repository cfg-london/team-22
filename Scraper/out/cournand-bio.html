  Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Cournand</b> was born in Paris on 24th
  September, 1895, the second of the four children of Jules
  Cournand, a stomatologist, and his wife Margu&eacute;rite
  Weber.<br>
  <br>
  He received his early education to secondary school level at the
  Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet, and obtained his bachelor's degree at the
  Facult&eacute; des Lettres of the Sorbonne in 1913, taking the
  Diploma of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology of the Facult&eacute;
  des Sciences, the following year.<br>
  <br>
  The medical studies, begun in 1914, were interrupted by his
  volunteering for service in the French Army. From 1915 to 1918 he
  was successively a private in an infantry regiment, a corpsman,
  and a battalion surgeon, and he was awarded the Croix de Guerre
  with three bronze stars.<br>
  <br>
  On leaving the Army at the end of the First World War, he resumed
  his medical studies and became Interne des H&ocirc;pitaux de Paris
  in 1925. During the next few years he gained much clinical
  experience: in internal medicine under de Massary and Professor
  Achard; in chest diseases under Rist; in pediatrics under
  Professor Debr&eacute;, and in neurology under Professor Guillain.
  He published a thesis submitted on Acute Disseminated Sclerosis,
  and was awarded the M.D. degree of the Facult&eacute; de

  Alexander Miller and J. Burns Amberson. Offered the opportunity
  to become Chief Resident of this service and to conduct, under
  the guidance of <a href="index.html">D. W. Richards</a>, research
  on the physiology and physiopathology of respiration, he decided
  to settle in the United States, and became an American citizen in
  1941. His work in collaboration with Richards, which earned them
  Nobel Prizes, has extended over a quarter of a century.<br>
