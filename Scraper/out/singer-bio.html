  <h1>Isaac Bashevis Singer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="singer.jpg" class="bio-img">In one of his more light-hearted books,
  <b>Isaac Bashevis Singer</b> depicts his childhood in one of the
  over-populated poor quarters of Warsaw, a Jewish quarter, just
  before and during the First World War. The book, called <i>In My
  Father's Court</i> (1966), is sustained by a redeeming,
  melancholy sense of humour and a clear-sightedness free of
  illusion. This world has gone forever, destroyed by the most
  terrible of all scourges that have afflicted the Jews and other
  people in Poland. But it comes to life in Singer's memories and
  writing in general. Its mental and physical environment and its
  centuries-old traditions have set their stamp on Singer as a man
  and a writer, and provide the ever-vivid subject matter for his
  inspiration and imagination. It is the world and life of East
  European Jewry, such as it was lived in cities and villages, in
  poverty and persecution, and imbued with sincere piety and rites
  combined with blind faith and superstition. Its language was
  Yiddish - the language of the simple people and of the women, the
  language of the mothers which preserved fairytales and anecdotes,
  legends and memories for hundreds of years past, through a
  history which seems to have left nothing untried in the way of
  agony, passions, aberrations, cruelty and bestiality, but also of
  heroism, love and self-sacrifice.<br>
  <br>
  Singer's father was a rabbi, a spiritual mentor and confessor, of
  the Hasid school of piety. His mother also came from a family of
  rabbis. The East European Jewish-mystical Hasidism combined
  Talmud doctrine and a fidelity to scripture and rites - which
  often merged into prudery and strict adherence to the law - with
  a lively and sensually candid earthiness that seemed familiar
  with all human experience. Its world, which the reader encounters
  in Singer's stories, is a very Jewish but also a very human
  world. It appears to include everything - pleasure and suffering,
  coarseness and subtlety. We find obstrusive carnality, spicy,
  colourful, fragrant or smelly, lewd or violent. But there is also
  room for sagacity, worldly wisdom and shrewd speculation. The
  range extends from the saintly to the demoniacal, from quiet
  contemplation and sublimity, to ruthless obsession and infernal
  confusion or destruction. It is typical that among the authors
  Singer read at an early age who have influenced him and
  accompanied him through life were Spinoza, Gogol and Dostoievsky,
  in addition to Talmud, Kabbala and kindred writings.<br>
  <br>
  Singer began his writing career as a journalist in Warsaw in the
  years between the wars. He was influenced by his elder brother,
  now dead, who was already an author and who contributed to the
  younger brother's spiritual liberation and contact with the new
  currents of seething political, social and cultural upheaval. The
  clash between tradition and renewal, between other-worldliness
  and faith and mysticism on the one hand, and free thought,
  secularization, doubt and nihilism on the other, is an essential
  theme in Singer's short stories and novels. The theme is Jewish,
  made topical by the barbarous conflicts of our age, a painful
  drama between contentious loyalties. But it is also of concern to
  mankind, to us all, Jew or non-Jew, actualized by modern western
  culture's struggles between preservation and renewal. Among many
  other themes, it is dealt with in Singer's big family chronicles
  - the novels, <i>The Family Moskat</i> (1950), <i>The Manor</i>
  (1967), and <i>The Estate</i> (1969). These extensive epic works
  have been compared with <a href="../1929/index.html">Thomas
  Mann</a>'s novel, <i>Buddenbrooks.</i> Like Mann, Singer
  describes how old families are broken up by the new age and its
  demands, from the middle of the 19th century up to the Second
  World War, and how they are split, financially, socially and
  humanly. But Singer's chronicles are greater in scope than Mann's
  novel and more richly orchestrated in their characterization. The
  author's apparently inexhaustible psychological fantasy has
  created a microcosm, or rather, a well-populated microchaos, out
  of independent and graphically convincing figures. They bring to
  mind another writer whom Singer read when young - Leo
  Tolstoy.<br>
  <br>
  Singer's earliest fictional works, however, were not big novels
  but short stories and novellas, a genre in which he has perhaps
  given his very best as a consummate storyteller and stylist. The
  novel, <i>Satan in Goray</i>, written originally in Yiddish, like
  practically all Singer books, appeared in 1935 when the Nazi
  catastrophe was threatening and just before the author emigrated
  to the USA, where he has lived and worked ever since. It treats
  of a theme to which Singer has often returned in different ways
  and with variations in time, place and personages - the false
  Messiah, his seductive arts and successes, the mass hysteria
  around him, his fall and the breaking up of illusions in
  destitution and new illusion, or in penance and purity. <i>Satan
  in Goray</i> takes place in the 17th century, in the confusion
  and the sufferings after the cruel ravages of the Cossacks, with
  outrages and mass murder of Jews and other wretched peasants and
  artisans. The people in this novel, as elsewhere with Singer, are
  often at the mercy of the capricious infliction of circumstance,
  but even more so, their own passions. The passions are frequently
  of a sexual nature but also of another kind - manias and
  superstitions, fanatical hopes and dreams, the figments of
  terror, the lure of lust or power, the nightmares of anguish, and
  so on. Even boredom can become a restless passion, as with the
  main character in the tragi-comic picaresque novel, <i>The
  Magician of Lublin</i> (1961), a most eccentric anti-hero, a kind
  of Jewish Don Juan and rogue, who ends up as an ascetic or
  saint.<br>
  <br>
  This is one of the most characteristic themes with Singer - the
  tyranny of the passions, the power and fickle inventiveness of
  obsession, the grotesque wealth of variation, and the
  destructive, but also inflaming and paradoxically creative
  potential of the emotions. We encounter this tumultuous and
  colourful world particularly in Singer's numerous and fantastic
  short stories, available in English translation in about a dozen
  collections, from the early <i>Gimpel The Fool</i> (translated
  1953), to the later work, <i>A Crown of Feathers</i> (1973), with
  notable masterpieces in between, such as, <i>The Spinoza of
  Market Street</i> (1961), or, <i>A Friend of Kafka</i> (1970).
  The passions and crazes are personified in Singer as demons,
  spectres, ghosts and all kinds of infernal or supernatural powers
  from the rich storehouse of Jewish popular imagination. These
  demons are not only graphic literary symbols, but also real,
  tangible beings - Singer, in fact, says he believes in their
  physical presence. The middle ages rise up in his work and
  permeate the present. Everyday life is interwoven with wonders,
  reality spun from dreams, the blood of the past with the moment
  in which we are living. This is where Singer's narrative art
  celebrates its greatest triumphs and bestows a reading experience
  of a deeply original kind, harrowing, but also stimulating and
  edifying. Many of his characters step with unquestioned authority
  into the Pantheon of literature, where the eternal companions and
  mythical figures live, tragic and grotesque, comic and touching,
  weird and wonderful people of dream and torment, baseness and
  grandeur.</p>
