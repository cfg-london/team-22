  <h1>D. Carleton Gajdusek - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gajdusek.jpg" class="bio-img"> My scientific
  interests started before my school years, when as a boy of five
  years I wandered through gardens, fields and woods with my
  mother's entomologist-sister, Tante Irene, as we overturned rocks
  and sought to find how many different plant and animal species of
  previously hidden life lay before us. We cut open galls to find
  the insects responsible for the tumors, and collected strange
  hardening gummy masses on twigs which hatched indoors to fill the
  curtains with tiny praying mantises, and discovered wasps with
  long ovipositors laying their eggs into the larvae of wood-boring
  beetles. In petri dishes we watched some leaf-eating insects
  succumb to insecticide poison while others survived, and on
  exciting excursions visited the laboratories and experimental
  greenhouses of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in my
  hometown of Yonkers, New York, where my aunt, Irene Dobroscky,
  worked, studying in the 1920's virus inclusions in the cells of
  leaf-hoppers.<br>
  <br>
  In my first years at school I had problems with my teachers for
  carrying to school insect-killing jars, correctly labeled
  "Poison: potassium cyanide". As a grade schoolboy, I met at the
  Boyce Thompson Institute laboratories the quiet, amused, watchful
  and guiding eyes of the mathematician and physical chemist, Dr.
  William J. Youden, who enjoyed letting me play with his hand
  cranked desk calculator, with his circular or cylindrical slide
  rules, and with models of crystal lattice structure, and on his
  laboratory bench where he taught me to prepare colloidal gold
  solution time color reactions and to manufacture mercuric
  thiocyanate snake-generating tablets. Before I was ten years old
  I knew that I wanted to be a scientist like my aunt and my quiet
  mathematician tutor. I rejected completely, as did my younger
  brother, Robert, who is now a poet and critic, the interests of
  our father and maternal grandfather in business, which had made
  our life style possible.<br>
  <br>
  My life and outlook were greatly influenced by the polyglot
  immigrant Eastern European communities, adjacent and unwillingly
  interlaced, living in the carpet, elevator and copper wire
  manufacturing and sugar refining city of Yonkers, just upstream
  on the Hudson River from the New York megalopolis and possessing
  a schoolbook history of a Seventeenth Century Royal Dutch land
  grant of Indian land to Johng Heer (hence Yonkers) Adrian van der
  Donck. The cimbalon in our living room, beside the piano,
  Romanian and Hungarian gypsies who fiddled the <i>czardas</i> and
  <i>halgatos</i> at our family festivities and camped in the empty
  store adjacent to my father's butcher shop, an uninterrupted flow
  of loud conversation in many tongues, rarely English, and kitchen
  odors of many Habsburg cuisines filling our crowded
  expanded-family-filled home, gave me an orthodox and optimistic
  view of America as a land of change and possibility which I never
  lost. Below our almost rural hilltop home - our family had
  "risen" - clustered the factories, churches, shops and two to
  four family houses of immigrant factory workers and tradesmen in
  the valleys of the almost obliterated Nepperhan and Tuckahoe
  Indian-named creeks. In this hollow stood Hungarian, Slovak and
  Polish Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches and a Presbyterian
  mission to the factory workers. (This exciting conglomeration of
  Eastern Europeans has been later displaced by Mediterranean and
  Caribbean and, still later, Black Americans, all similarly
  "melting". )<br>
  <br>
  My father, Karl Gajdusek, was a Slovak farm boy from a small
  village near Senica, who had left home as an adolescent youth to
  emigrate to America before World War I, alone and without
  speaking English, to become a butcher in the immigrant
  communities of Yonkers, where he met and married my mother,
  Ottilia Dobroczki. Her parents had also come, each alone, as
  youthful immigrants from Debrecen, Hungary to America. On my
  father's side we were a family of farmers and tradesmen,
  vocations which never interested my brother or myself, but my
  father's temperament for laughter and ribald fun, lust for life
  in work and play, music, song, dance and food, and above all,
  conversation; affected us strongly. On my mother's side were the
  more somber academic and aesthetic aspirations of four university
  educated first generation American siblings and a heroic interest
  in fantasy and inquiry, in the classics and culture, nature,
  nurture and process. Because of my mother's unquenchable interest
  in literature and folklore, my brother and I were reared
  listening to Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Plutarch and Virgil long
  before we learned to read.<br>
  <br>
  I was born on September 9, 1923 in the family home we still own,
  while my maternal grandparents and my mother's youngest sister
  shared the home. My brother arrived nineteen months later. He and
  I grew up closely together; for every move I made further into
  mathematics and the sciences, he moved further into poetry, music
  and the other arts. In 1930 we traveled to Europe to visit our
  relatives, mostly those of my father's large family, which he had
  abandoned twenty years earlier. My brother and I were left for
  months in my father's birthplace with his old father and the huge
  remaining family (the squire had sired some twenty five
  children), while our parents toured European capitals.<br>
  <br>
  Back in America, my early school years were those of great
  happiness: I liked school and the enchanting family excursions up
  the Hudson valley were frequent. My Tante Irene was working on
  problems of economic entomology in the Philippines and South East
  Asia, and exotic artifacts and natural history specimens,
  particularly the beautiful giant leafhoppers clad in batiklike
  patterns, arrived to fascinate me. On her return from the Orient
  she took me on ever broader excursions to collect insects, to
  watch the emergence of the seventeen-year cicadas and to attend
  scientific meetings in the American Museum of Natural History. I became an
  early habitu&eacute; of New York city's museums, attending courses
  on Egyptology at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on schoolday afternoons
  after my fifth grade classes and at weekend and evening lectures
  on entomology, geology and botany at the Museum of Natural
  History.<br>
  <br>
  Today, I and my large family of adopted sons from New Guinea and
  Micronesia still occupy, on our frequent visits to New York city,
  our family home in which I was born fifty-three years ago. Here,
  the boys recently discovered, while installing new attic
  insulation, daguerreotypes and tintypes of the family taken in
  towns east of the Danube and in turn-of-the-century New York city
  and also school notebooks which once belonged to my mother, her
  siblings, my brother, and myself. From this home, too, we buried
  both of my maternal grandparents, and my father and mother. On
  the occasion of my pagan mother's death, the unavoidably close
  proximity of Slovak Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, both
  named Holy Trinity, led to the confusion which resulted in
  burying her with ministrations of the wrong denomination, which
  she would have enjoyed, when I attempted to assuage, by asking the
  funeral director to call in the priest, the pious Roman Catholic
  relatives of my irreverent father, at whose earlier funeral the
  Slovak priest had declined to officiate.<br>
  <br>
  I started to read seriously before puberty. Books by Scandinavian
  authors, Henrik Ibsen and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1928/index.html">Sigrid Undset</a>, were
  among the earlier works I read myself. I devoured
  enthusiastically three biographical works which must have had a
  profound effect on me: Ren&eacute; Vallery-Radot's biography of his
  father-in-law, Louis Pasteur; Eve Curie's biography of her
  mother, <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1911/index.html">Marie
  Curie</a>; and Paul de Kruif's "Microbe Hunters." I then
  stenciled the twelve names of microbiologists whom de Kruif had
  selected on the steps leading to my attic chemistry laboratory,
  where they remain today. At about this time, when I was about ten
  years old, I wrote an essay on why I planned to concentrate on
  chemistry, physics, and mathematics, rather than classical
  biology, in preparation for a career in medicine. Dr. Youden had
  succeeded in making it clear to me that education in mathematics,
  physics and chemistry was the basis for the biology of the
  future.<br>
  <br>
  During the summers of my thirteenth to sixteenth years, I was
  often working at the Boyce Thompson Laboratories. Under Dr. John
  Arthur's tutelage, I synthesized and characterized a large series
  of halogenated aryloxyacetic acids, many previously
  unsynthesized. The series of new compounds I derived from these
  failed to yield the fly-killing potency anticipated, but when
  they were tested several years later for their phytocidal
  capacity one of my new compounds, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid,
  became the weed killer of commerce; and the Institute based its
  patent rights to royalties on my boyhood laboratory notebooks -
  the only venture I have had which involved commerce.<br>
  <br>
  My experiences at the Boyce Thompson, especially with Youden,
  directed me towards physics at the University of
  Rochester, where I hoped to fulfill my plan, formulated in
  boyhood from my readings and teachings of my aunt and Youden, of
  studying mathematics, physics, and chemistry in preparation for a
  career in medical research.<br>
  <br>
  From 1940 to 1943 I studied at the University of Rochester under
  Victor Weisskopf in physics; Curt Stern, Don Charles, David
  Goddard, Jim Goodwin, in biology; Vladimir Seidel in mathematics;
  and Ralph Helmkamp in chemistry. In the summer of 1941 I was
  inspired by the marine embryology course of Viktor Hamburger's at
  Woods Hole Marine Biology Laboratories. In those years of my
  teens I learned to love mountaineering, hiking, canoeing and
  camping with a passion as great as that for science.<br>
  <br>
  At nineteen to twenty-two years of age while at Harvard Medical
  School, I worked with John T. Edsall in the laboratory of
  protein physical chemistry, and with James L. Gamble in his
  laboratory of electrolyte balance at Boston Children's
  Hospital. Thereafter, at ages of twenty-five and twenty-six,
  I worked at Caltech with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">Linus Pauling</a> and John
  Kirkwood, where I was also greatly influenced by <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Max Delbr&uuml;ck</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/index.html">George Beadle</a>, Walter
  Zechmeister and James Bonner. It was at Caltech that my peers -
  fellow postdoctoral students and young investigators (Gunther
  Stent, Jack Dunitz, Elie Wollman, Benoit Mandelbrot, David
  Shoemaker, John Cann, Harvey Itano, Aage Bohr, Ole Maaloe, Ted
  Harold, John Fincham, Reinhart Ruge, Arnold Mazur, Al Rich, and
  others) - had a profound effect on my intellectual development,
  goals and appreciation of quality in creative life, and on my
  career. This was the "Golden Age" at Caltech and the many close
  friends working in several different disciplines, as well as our
  mentors, have remained mutually stimulating coworkers in science
  and, above all, lasting personal friends for the past thirty
  years. With the group of students about Linus Pauling, John
  Kirkwood, Max Delbr&uuml;ck and George Beadle, I spent many days
  and evenings in wideranging discussions in the laboratories and
  at the Atheneum, and in even more protracted exchanges on camping
  and hiking trips to the deserts and mountains of the West, of
  Mexico and Canada. Max and Mannie Delbr&uuml;ck were often the
  hosts for our group at their home, and the prime organizers of
  many of our expeditions. This period of less than two years at
  Caltech has given me a group of friends who are interested
  critics of my work, who together with my major teachers in
  clinical and laboratory investigation, comprise, perhaps
  unwittingly, the jury whose judgements I most respect.<br>
  <br>
  I had not counted on my captivation with clinical pediatrics.
  Children fascinated me, and their medical problems (complicated
  by the effect of variables of varying immaturity, growth, and
  maturation upon every clinical entity that beset them) seemed to
  offer more challenge than adult medicine. I lived and worked
  within the walls of Boston Children's Hospital through much of
  medical school. Thereafter, I started my postgraduate specialty
  training in clinical pediatrics which I carried through to
  Specialty Board qualification, while also working in the
  laboratory of Michael Heidelberger at Columbia
  University College of Physicians and Surgeons, while at
  Caltech, and while with <a href="../1954/index.html">John
  Enders</a> on postgraduate work at Harvard. I have never
  abandoned my clinical interests, particularly in pediatrics and
  neurology, which were nurtured by a group of inspiring bedside
  teachers: Mark Altschuler, Louis K. Diamond, William Ladd, Frank
  Ingraham, Sidney Gellis, and Canon Ely at Harvard; Rustin
  McIntosh, Hattie Alexander, Dorothy Anderson, and Richard Day at
  Babies Hospital, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New
  York; Katie Dodd, Ashley Weech, Joe Warkany, and Sam Rappaport at
  Cincinnati Children's Hospital, and Ted Woodward of
  Baltimore.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951 I was drafted to complete my military service from John
  Enders' laboratory at Harvard to Walter Reed Army Medical Service
  Graduate School as a young research virologist, to where I was
  called by Dr. Joseph Smadel. I found that he responded to my
  over-ambitious projects and outlandish schemes with severity and
  metered encouragement, teaching me more about the methods of
  pursuing laboratory and field research, and presenting scientific
  results, than any further theoretical superstructure, which he
  assumed I already possessed.<br>
  <br>
  From him and from Marcel Baltazard of the Institut Pasteur of
  Teheran, where I worked in 1952 and 1953 on rabies, plague,
  arbovirus infections, scurvy and other epidemic disease in Iran,
  Afghanistan and Turkey, I learned of the excitement and challenge
  offered by urgent opportunistic investigations of epidemiological
  problems in exotic and isolated populations. My quest for medical
  problems in primitive population isolates took me to valleys of
  the Hindu Kush, the jungles of South America, the coast and
  inland ranges of New Britain, and the swamps and high valleys of
  Papua New Guinea and Malaysia, but always with a base for quiet
  contemplation and exciting laboratory studies with John Enders in
  Boston, Joe Smadel in Washington, and <a href=
  "../1960/index.html">Frank Burnet</a> in Melbourne. To these
  teachers I am indebted for guidance and inspiration and for years
  of encouragement and friendship.<br>
  <br>
  To Joe Smadel I also owe the debt of further sponsorship and
  encouragement, and recognition of my scientific potential for
  productive research which led him to create for me several years
  later a then unique position as an American visiting scientist at
  the National
  Institutes of Health, in the National Institute of
  Neurological Diseases and Blindness, under Dr. Richard Masland,
  wherein I could nurture my diverse interests in a selfstyled
  Study of Child Growth and Development and Disease Patterns in
  Primitive Cultures. Our Laboratory of Slow, Latent and Temperate
  Virus Infections grew out of the elucidation of one of our
  "disease patterns", kuru, and blossomed into a new field of
  medicine. For about two decades I have enjoyed at the National
  Institutes of Health the base and haven for our diverse studies
  in remote parts of the world together with a small group of
  students and coworkers and many visiting colleagues who have
  formed the strong team of our endeavor. Here, Marion Poms, Joe
  Gibbs, Paul Brown, Vin Zigas, Michael Alpers, David Asher and
  Nancy Rogers have shared these adventures with me through almost
  two decades.<br>
  <br>
  My boyhood reading, first in Homer, Virgil, and Plutarch, on
  which we were nurtured by our Classicist-Romanticist Hungarian
  mother, led, upon the instigation of my poet brother, to my more
  thorough return to the classics as a young, too-ardent
  scientist-cum-physician, and to the modern literature of European
  authors and philosophers, which I had missed in my university
  days devoted too exclusively to mathematics and the sciences.
  This reading changed greatly my way of thinking. Particularly, I
  would have to credit Dostoevsky, Chekhov and Tolstoy; Montaigne,
  Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Valery and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/index.html">Gide</a>; Shakespeare,
  Wordsworth, Yeats and Lawrence; Poe, Whitman and Melville; Ibsen;
  Goethe, Schiller, Kant, Nietzsche, Kafka and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1929/index.html">Mann</a>; Saadi and
  Hafiz.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 I took off for Australia to work as a visiting
  investigator with Frank Burnet at the Walter and Eliza Hall
  Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne from where,
  between periods of bench work in immunology and virology, I
  launched studies on child development and disease patterns with
  Australian aboriginal and New Guinean populations.<br>
  <br>
  In eighteen volumes of some five thousand pages of published
  personal journals on my explorations and expeditions to primitive
  cultures, I have told far more about myself and my work since
  1957, when I first saw kuru, under the guidance of Vincent Zigas,
  than one should in a lifetime ... I do not see how I can
  pr&eacute;cis that here.</p>
