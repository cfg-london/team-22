  <h1>Hartmut Michel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="michel.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Ludwigsburg,
  W&uuml;rttemberg, in the southwestern part of the Federal
  Republic of Germany on July 18, 1948, as the elder son of Karl
  and Frieda Michel. My ancestors lived in that area for
  generations, mainly as farmers. There the inherited land is
  equally divided among sisters and brothers, and not enough land
  was left for one family's living during my grandparents'
  generation. During the day my father worked in a factory as a
  joiner, my mother at home as a dressmaker, in the evenings and on
  Saturdays care had to be taken of the huge gardens.<br>
  <br>
  As a child I liked to play outside, to stroll through the fields,
  and I was an active member of the local children's gang,
  frequently being chased by field guards and building supervisors.
  Nevertheless, my performance at school was very good, and mainly
  due to the influence of my mother I was allowed to attend high
  school. At age eleven I became a member of the circulating
  library of my home town. From there on I was rarely seen outside,
  but was reading two to four books per week, the subjects ranging
  from archaeology over ethnology and geography to zoology.
  Needless to say that I did not do much homework. At school my
  favorite subjects were history, biology, chemistry and physics.
  Especially the teaching in physics was excellent. Most of my
  understanding of it I got at high school, not at the
  university.<br>
  <br>
  In parallel, my interest in molecular biology rose. In 1969 -
  after the obligatory military service - I applied to study
  biochemistry at the University of T&uuml;bingen. At that time
  T&uuml;bingen was the only place in Germany, where one could
  study biochemistry from the first year, and I was happy to be
  accepted. Studying biochemistry meant that one had to take part
  in nearly the same amount of lectures and courses as chemistry
  students in addition to numerous lectures and courses in biology.
  The atmosphere between senior teachers and students was
  impersonal, and the only time I talked to the full professor of
  biochemistry was during the final examination. However, the
  possibility existed to work for one year in the various
  biochemistry labs at the University of Munich and the
  Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Biochemie instead of attending lab
  courses in T&uuml;bingen. I took that chance in 1972/1973, and at
  the end I was convinced that academic research was what I wanted
  to do.<br>
  <br>
  After the examination in T&uuml;bingen in 1974 I did the
  experimental part of my biochemistry diploma in Dieter
  Oesterhelt's lab at the Friedrich Miescher-Laboratorium of the
  Max-Planck-Gesellschaft in T&uuml;bingen. In cooperation with
  Walter Stockenius, Dieter Oesterhelt had discovered
  bacteriorhodopsin in halobacteria and later proposed that it acts
  as a lightdriven proton pump in the framework of Peter Mitchell's
  chemiosmotic theory. During my diploma work I characterized the
  ATPase-activity of halobacteria. In 1975, Dieter Oesterhelt moved
  to W&uuml;rzburg. I joined him, and as a thesis I correlated the
  intracellular levels of adenosine di- and triphosphate with the
  electrochemical proton gradient across the halobacterial cell
  membrane. Having received the doctorate in June 1977 I tried to
  fuse delipidated bacteriorhodopsin with bacterial vesicles in
  order to achieve light-driven amino acid uptake. Upon storage in
  the freezer the delipidated bacteriorhodopsin yielded solid,
  glass-like aggregates. On the basis of this observation I was
  convinced that it should be possible to crystallize membrane
  proteins like bacteriorhodopsin, which was considered to be
  impossible at that time. With Oesterhelt's help I started the
  experiments, and already four weeks later we obtained a new
  two-dimensional membrane crystal of bacteriorhodopsin. It was not
  the three-dimensional crystal we wanted, but allowed me to travel
  to the MRC at Cambridge, England, and to do electron
  microscopical studies together with Richard Henderson. Back in
  W&uuml;rzburg, we observed the first real three-dimensional
  crystals of bacteriorhodopsin in April 1979. The success led me
  to cancel my plans to do post-doctoral studies with Susumu Ohno,
  Duarte, California, on sexual differentiation in mammals. Instead
  of this, I moved with Dieter Oesterhelt again, this time to the
  Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Biochemie at Martinsried near
  Munich, where he became a department head and director. Before
  moving to Munich, Ilona Leger became my wife. Her understanding
  and patience helped me a lot.<br>
  <br>
  A promising aspect of the move to Martinsried was the possibility
  of a cooperation with Robert Huber and colleagues, who at the
  Max-PlanckInstitut had established a very productive department
  for X-ray crystallographic protein structure analysis. Our
  bacteriorhodopsin crystals were found to diffract X-rays, but to
  be too small and too disordered for a structural analysis. We
  tried to improve size and quality of the crystals. Since all the
  X-ray crystallographers had beautifully diffracting crystals of
  soluble proteins, I, understandably, had very limited access to
  the X-ray equipment at Martinsried. As a consequence, I spent
  four months at the MRC in Cambridge, England, together with
  Richard Henderson in 1980, in order to perform X-ray experiments.
  This period was essential for improving the crystallization
  method. After my return Dieter Oesterhelt decided to buy an X-ray
  generator for the ongoing work with bacteriorhodopsin. The
  generator was installed in Robert Huber's department and
  guaranteed us continued access to the equipment, and the know
  how, of the X-ray crystallographers. Later on, I used this
  generator for the work with the reaction centres.<br>
  <br>
  Frustrated from the lack of the final success with
  bacteriorhodopsin, I tried to crystallize several other membrane
  proteins, mainly photosynthetic ones. After developing a new
  isolation procedure I obtained the first crystals of the
  photosynthetic reaction centre from the purple bacterium
  Rhodopseudomonas viridis at the end of July 1981. One week later
  our daughter Andrea was born. During September 1981 the first
  reaction centre crystal was X-rayed by Wolfram Bode and myself,
  and turned out to be of excellent quality. Therefore 1981 was the
  happiest and most successful year of my life.<br>
  <br>
  Dieter Oesterhelt immediately agreed that the reaction centre
  should be a project of the young people. In February 1982, I
  started the data collection for the X-ray structure analysis. In
  April or May I gave a seminar in Robert Huber's department and
  asked officially for collaboration. After some internal
  discussions Robert Huber agreed that Johann ("Hans") Deisenhofer,
  who was the partner of my choice, should take part in the
  reaction centre project. During the work Hans and I became the
  best friends. In August 1982, Hans and Kunio Miki, a Japanese
  post-doctoral research associate in Robert Huber's department,
  started to evaluate the pile of X-ray films. I continued with the
  experimental work, occasionally helped by Robert Huber, who
  showed me how the diffraction pattern of a promising derivative
  should look like. Not only the X-ray work, but also the entire
  biochemical characterization and sequence determination had to be
  done. After the preliminary tracing of the peptide chains by
  Johann Deisenhofer, the sequence determination, which was
  performed by Karl A. Weyer, Heidi Gruenberg and myself with
  Dieter Oesterhelt's support and help, turned out to be the bottle
  neck for our progress. During that period of heavy work our son
  Robert Joachim was born in 1984.<br>
  <br>
  As one of the results of the success I received many offers. I
  accepted the one to become a department head and director at the
  Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Biophysik in Frankfurt/Main, West
  Germany, where I am since October 1987.<br>
  <br>
  For the success with the crystallization of membrane proteins and
  the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the
  photosynthetic reaction centre from the purple bacterium
  <i>Rhodopseudomonas viridis</i> I received various prizes and
  awards. Among these are the Biophysics Prize of the American
  Physical Society (together with d. Deisenhofer), the
  "Chemiedozentenstipendium" of the "Fonds der Chemischen
  Industrie", the "Otto Klung-Preis" for chemistry, the
  Leibniz-Preis of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the
  "Otto-Bayer-Preis" (together with J. Deisenhofer) and now the
  Nobel Prize (together with J. Deisenhofer and R. Huber).</p>
