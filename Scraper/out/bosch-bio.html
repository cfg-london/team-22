  <h1>Carl Bosch - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bosch.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Carl Bosch</b> was born at Cologne on
  August 27, 1874, and grew up there. From 1894 to 1896 he studied
  metallurgy and mechanical engineering at the Technische
  Hochschule in Charlottenburg, but started reading chemistry at
  Leipzig University in 1896. He graduated under
  Professor Wislicenus with a paper on organic chemistry in 1898.
  He entered the employ of the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik,
  Ludwigshafen, Rhine as a chemist in April 1899 and participated
  actively in the development of the then new industry of synthetic
  indigo under the guidance of Dr. Rudolf Knietsch.<br>
  <br>
  At the turn of the century Bosch became interested in the problem
  of the fixing of nitrogen and his first experiments in this field
  were done with metal cyanides and nitrides; in 1907 he started a
  pilot plant for the production of barium cyanide.<br>
  <br>
  Bosch's opportunity for really large-scale work came when in 1908
  the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik acquired the process of
  high-pressure synthesis of ammonia, which had been developed by
  <a href="../1918/index.html">Fritz Haber</a> at the Technische
  Hochschule in Karlsruhe. Bosch was given the task of developing
  this process on a large industrial scale. This task involved the
  construction of plant and apparatus which would stand up to
  working at high gas pressure and high reaction temperatures.
  Haber's catalysts, osmium and uranium had to be replaced by a
  contact substance which would be both cheaper and more easily
  available. Bosch and his collaborators found the solution by
  using pure iron with certain additives. Further problems which
  had to be solved were the construction of safe high-pressurized
  blast furnaces, a cheap way of producing and cleaning the gases
  necessary for the synthesis of ammonia. Step by step Bosch went
  on to using increasingly larger manufacturing units and thus
  created the industry which deals with the production of synthetic
  ammonia according to the high-pressure process.<br>
  <br>
  From this work resulted the second task of making the thus won
  ammonia available for use in industry and agriculture. Bosch
  succeeded in working out methods for the industrial production of
  nitrogen fertilizers, thus providing practically every country in
  the world with sufficient fertilizers for agricultural purposes.
  The Stickstoffwerke (Nitrogen works) in Oppau were opened in
  1913, followed by the even larger Leunawerke near Merseburg in
  1917, where the synthesis of methanol and the hydrogenation of
  oil were added to the production programme. Bosch was appointed
  Managing Director of the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik in 1919
  and in 1925 was made Principal of the I.G. Farbenindustrie
  Aktiengesellschaft, which was created by the merger of the German
  coal-tar dye works. In 1935 Bosch was appointed Chairman of the
  Board of Directors of the I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.<br>
  <br>
  Bosch was honoured in many ways and not only for his achievements
  and inventions in the field of industry, but also for his
  research in pure science, which he considered to be his duty. He
  received the honorary doctorate of the Technische Hochschule in
  Karlsruhe (1918), of the Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule
  (Agriculture College), Berlin (1921), the Technische Hochschule in Munich (1922), of Halle
  University (1927), the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt (1928).
  The distinctions of Honorary Senator of the Universities of
  Heidelberg (1922) and Leipzig (1939), and of Honorary Citizen of
  Frankfurt (1939) were conferred upon him.<br>
  <br>
  He received the Liebig Memorial Medal of the Association of
  German Chemists, the Bunsen Medal of the German Bunsen Society,
  the Siemens Ring, the Golden Grashof Memorial Medal of the VDI
  (Association of German Engineers), the Exner Medal from the
  Austrian Trade Association, and the Carl Lueg Memorial Medal from
  the Association of German Metallurgists. In 1931 he was awarded
  the highest international honour, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry,
  jointly with Friedrich Bergius, for their contributions to the
  invention and development of chemical high pressure
  methods.<br>
  <br>
  Bosch particularly enjoyed his membership of various German and
  foreign scientific academies, and his chairmanship of the Kaiser
  Wilhelm Society of which he became its President in 1937.<br>
  <br>
  He died after a prolonged illness on April 26, 1940.</p>
