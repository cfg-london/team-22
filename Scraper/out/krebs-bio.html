  <h1>Edwin G. Krebs - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="krebs.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Lansing, Iowa on June 6,
  1918, the third of the four children of William Carl Krebs and
  Louise Helen (Stegeman) Krebs. My maternal grandmother, Bertha
  Stegeman, lived with us for most of her life. My father was a
  Presbyterian minister, who had started his ministry in the
  Moravian Church in Wisconsin. My mother taught school until she
  was married. (She must have been an excellent student because she
  could still help me with problems during my second course of
  algebra.) As was common in ministers' families, we moved several
  times, first to Newton, Illinois and later, when I was age 6, to
  Greenville, Illinois. The family stayed in Greenville, which I
  always think of as my "home town", until I was fifteen.
  Greenville is a small college town, has good schools, and is
  surrounded by pleasant countryside where I loved to go on walks
  with my older brothers - as soon as I became old enough that they
  didn't mind having me tag along. In addition to hiking, other
  recreational pursuits included sand-lot sports, fishing, stamp
  collecting, and eventually ham radio. The last hobby was picked
  up not so much because of any strong scientific interests on my
  part in radio theory but rather from a desire to be able to talk
  to a grade school playmate who had moved to Chicago. I loved to
  read - mostly historical novels about the Civil War, the settling
  of the West, and related adventure stories. I worked hard at
  school in order to succeed, but I cannot claim to have been a
  highly intellectual child. I liked to make gun powder using
  materials purchased from the local drug store or taken from my
  older brother's chemistry set, but I had no childhood aspirations
  of becoming a chemist. The closest that I came to expressing an
  interest in biology was the maintaining of a balanced
  aquarium.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of my first year in high school my father died
  suddenly. I was fifteen and was strongly influenced by this
  unexpected event. Although I had never aspired to follow in his
  footsteps and become a minister, I had great affection for him
  and admired the skill that he had in some of his avocations such
  as carpentry and gardening. My mother was deeply affected by
  Dad's death, but after recovering from the initial shock began
  making major decisions mostly centered around providing advanced
  educational opportunities for her children. It was determined
  that the family, which had very limited income (It was 1933.),
  would move to Urbana, Illinois, where my two older brothers were
  already enrolled at the University of Illinois. There we rented a
  large enough house so that we could rent out a room to help with
  expenses. Everyone got some kind of part-time job. The planning
  for these changes involved the entire family and without doubt
  had a maturing influence on both of my brothers and certainly had
  one on me.<br>
  <br>
              In the period from 1933 to 1940 in Urbana I completed the last three 
              years of high school and carried out undergraduate work at the University 
              of Illinois. Urbana 
              High School was an excellent institution with highly dedicated 
              teachers and a broad range of extracurricular activities that were 
              useful in helping me make up my mind as to what I wanted to do in 
              life. This problem was one that was occupying my mind increasingly 
              at this time. Because these were depression years, my thinking about 
              various professions was colored by the question of whether or not 
              a given choice of work was one in which I could earn a livelihood. 
              I gravitated toward a scientific career, not because of deep interest 
              in the challenges of the unknown, but because I felt that there 
              was security in becoming a scientist. Science courses, more than 
              the others, provided subject matter that I felt could actually be 
              used. These feelings were strongly reinforced by the success of 
              my older brother in obtaining an excellent position after obtaining 
              a Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the mid 1930s. Medicine, as an 
              applied science, was also appealing and offered the advantage of 
              being directly concerned with people.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936, I entered the University of Illinois with the idea of
  majoring in some branch of science related to chemistry, but I
  did not have a very clear idea of where I was headed. Taking
  advantage of an "individual curriculum" program that was
  available to those with reasonably good scholastic records - and
  for this reason presumably knew where they were going - I was
  relieved of the necessity of meeting many specific requirements
  and could pick and choose courses that I wanted. In this way I
  was able to take enough biology to meet premedical requirements
  but could also take the math, chemistry, and physics courses
  designed for professionals in these fields. By the beginning of
  my fourth year in college, I had narrowed my choices either to
  getting an advanced degree in organic chemistry or going to
  medical school. For the latter financial help would be required.
  This became available in the form of a scholarship to attend
  Washington
  University School of Medicine in St. Louis. At this point I
  assumed that the agony of indecision was over and my future was
  now defined. I would become a physician.<br>
  <br>
  During my fourth year at the University of Illinois I carried out
  undergraduate research in organic chemistry and found it to be a
  fascinating experience. This was probably the first time that I
  had ever taken a "course" that seemed like fun. Because I was
  ahead in my credits, I was able to spend virtually unlimited time
  in the laboratory. My mentors were Harold Snyder and Charles
  Price, and to them I will always be grateful for having
  introduced me to research. Another influential teacher during
  this period was Carl S. Marvel. Had this research experience come
  earlier in my college career, I might well have opted for a Ph.D.
  in organic chemistry rather than going to medical school. But as
  it turned out, this introduction to research influenced my
  medical training and without doubt was a strong factor in my
  eventually becoming a research biochemist rather than a
  clinician.<br>
  <br>
  Washington University School of Medicine proved to be an
  excellent choice as a place where I could receive classical
  medical training but at the same time learn to appreciate
  "medical research." The basic science courses were the equivalent
  of graduate courses and there was no attempt to water down the
  curriculum based on the idea that physicians only need "core"
  knowledge in the various sciences. In addition to basic course
  work that took us to the fringes of knowledge in the various
  disciplines, students were encouraged to participate in
  laboratory projects. I personally undertook several projects,
  first under Dean Philip A. Schafer, who was also chairman of the
  Department of Biochemistry, and later under Arda A. Green, a
  faculty member associated with Dr. <a href=
  "../1947/index.html">Carl and Gerty Cori</a>. Ethel Ronzoni also
  offered me help and advice in some of the work that I carried
  out. During this period I first heard about the enzyme,
  phosphorylase, which was crystallized by Arda Green and the Coris
  and was found to exist in two interconvertible forms that they
  referred to as phosphorylase <i>b</i> and phosphorylase <i>a</i>.
  Phosphorylase <i>b</i> required 5'-AMP for enzymic activity
  whereas phosphorylase <i>a</i> was active without this
  nucleotide. This enzyme was later to play an important part in my
  life.<br>
  <br>
  The medical school years, 1940-1943, were war years, and although
  I did some research as a medical student, my main preoccupation
  was with becoming a physician who could serve in the armed
  forces. Nobody knew how long the war would last and our immediate
  concerns were with being a part of the war effort. After
  graduation from medical school I had eighteen months of residency
  training in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis,
  and then went on active duty as a medical office in the navy. The
  war ended and so did the period of my life in which I actively
  used my medical training in any practical sense. I believe I
  would have been happy practicing medicine but this was not to
  be.<br>
  <br>
  After being discharged from the Navy in 1946, I returned to St.
  Louis with the idea of continuing residency and becoming an
  academic internist. However, it immediately became apparent that
  I would have to wait my turn to get back into hospital work, and
  I was advised by my professor of medicine, Dr. W. B. Wood, to
  study in a basic science department during the interim. Because
  of my background in chemistry, I chose biochemistry for this and
  was fortunate in being accepted by Dr. Carl and Gerty Cori as a
  postdoctoral fellow. After two years in their laboratory, during
  which time I studied the interaction of protamine with rabbit
  muscle phosphorylase, I became so enamored with biochemistry that
  I decided to remain in that field rather than returning to
  internal medicine. Again, I had found laboratory experience to be
  very satisfying just as it had been when I was a senior in
  college.<br>
  <br>
  While I was on active duty in the navy, my ship had put into
  Seattle, and I had been impressed by the beauty of the city. So
  in 1948, when I had an opportunity to go there as an assistant
  professor of biochemistry, I jumped at the chance. Because I was
  quite uncertain of my ability to succeed in biochemistry,
  however, I made certain that I was duly licensed and registered
  in the State of Washington, so that if worse came to worse I
  could always "hang out my shingle." Happily, things seemed to go
  along reasonably well, and I did not find it necessary to use
  this insurance policy.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950, Hans Neurath became the first permanent chairman of the
  Department of Biochemistry at the University of
  Washington and began to build what was to become one of the
  major departments in the country. The emphasis in the department
  was on protein chemistry and enzymology, and this provided an
  excellent environment in which to develop and pursue a research
  field. I had been in Seattle for five years when <a href=
  "index.html">Ed Fischer</a> joined the Department. Ed had had
  experience with potato phosphorylase during his graduate student
  days and, as indicated earlier, I had become acquainted with
  mammalian skeletal muscle phosphorylase in St. Louis. Together we
  decided to see whether or not we could determine the mechanism by
  which 5'-AMP served as an activator of phosphorylase <i>b</i>. We
  didn't solve that problem, but in the course of trying we
  discovered the molecular mechanism by which interconversion of
  the two forms of phosphorylase takes place; namely, reversible
  protein phosphorylation. Similar work was being carried out on
  liver phosphorylase at approximately the same time in the
  laboratory of <a href="../1971/index.html">Earl Sutherland</a>
  who discovered cyclic AMP, the second messenger of hormone
  action, which he showed was involved in phosphorylase <i>a</i>
  formation. A number of years were to elapse before it became
  apparent that reversible protein phosphorylation is a general
  process affecting countless cellular proteins.<br>
  <br>
  During the early years of our work on protein phosphorylation, Ed
  Fischer and I worked together very closely even to the point that
  if one had to leave to give a lecture the other could carry on
  the experiment of the day. Later, as the field developed we each
  concentrated on our own specific areas related to the central
  problem. One of my own projects was concerned with the molecular
  mechanism of action of cyclic AMP in promoting the phosphorylase
  <i>b</i> to <i>a</i> reaction. This was eventually solved with
  the finding of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by one of
  my postdoctoral fellows, Donal A. Walsh. This discovery occurred
  just prior to my leaving the University of Washington in
  1968.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the motivation provided by my research, I was also
  motivated by interests in teaching and various aspects of
  administration. These interests led to a desire on my part to
  become a departmental chairman, and I was attracted by the
  opportunity that presented itself at the University of
  California in Davis where a new medical school was taking
  shape in the late 1960's. I went there in 1968 as the founding
  chairman of the Department of Biological Chemistry and stayed for
  a period of eight years. In 1977, however, I returned to the
  University of Washington as Chairman of the Department of
  Pharmacology. In each place, I viewed the principal role of the
  chairman to be the selection of good faculty members, and I feel
  proud of the results of my efforts in each place. Other aspects
  of these chairmanships were also rewarding, particularly the
  opportunity to interact with colleagues in the development of the
  respective institutions.<br>
  <br>
  An important part of this autobiographical sketch, which I have
  saved for the end, concerns my family. During my residency years
  at Barnes Hospital I met my wife, Deedy, who was a student nurse
  at Washington University. We were married in 1945 shortly before
  I left to serve in the Navy. We had three children, Sally,
  Robert, and Martha and now have five grandchildren. After
  completing her degree in nursing my wife gave up her own career,
  but she has been a constant and important source of support for
  me in my own. We shared in the major decisions of our lives, and
  I feel that I owe her very much, not only for her constant help
  in my career but also in keeping me aware that there are other
  important aspects of life.</p>
