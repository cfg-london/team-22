  <h1>Herbert Kroemer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kroemer.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on August 25, 1928 in Weimar,
  Germany. My father was a civil servant working for the city
  administration of my home town; my mother was a classical German
  "Hausfrau." Both came from simple skilled-craftsmen families.
  Neither had a high-school education, but there was never any
  doubt that they wanted to have their children obtain the best
  education they could afford. My mother, in particular, pushed
  relentlessly for top performance in school: simply doing well was
  not enough. Fortunately, I breezed through 12 years of school
  almost effortlessly, not once requiring help with homework from
  my parents.</p>

  <p>Despite their insistence on excellence, my
  parents never pushed me in any particular academic direction; I
  was completely free to follow my inclinations, which ran towards
  math, physics, and chemistry. When I finally told my parents that
  I wanted to study physics, my father merely wondered what that
  is, and whether I could make a living with it. I certainly could
  become a physics teacher at a High School, or "Gymnasium," a
  thoroughly respectable profession.</p>

  <p>I did have one major problem in school,
  though: Discipline! I was often bored, and entertained myself in
  various disruptive ways. A frequent punishment was an entry into
  the "Klassenbuch," the daily class ledger. These entries were
  considered a very serious matter, and if I had not been excellent
  academically, I would have risked being expelled. Once, after I
  had again been entered as having disturbed the class, the teacher
  who had overall responsibility for the class - Dr. Edith Richter,
  whom I adored - asked me in great exasperation: "Why again?" I
  told her that I had been bored, whereupon she exploded: "Mr.
  Kroemer, one of the purposes of a higher education is that you
  learn to be bored gracefully." I will never forget that outburst
  - nor have I ever really learned to be bored gracefully.</p>

  <p>Another teacher - Willibald Wimmer - had
  his own clever way of handling me. Before the end of the war, he
  had been an instructor at a local engineering college, ending up
  teaching math and physics at our high school. He was used to
  dealing with more mature students, and he treated us as adults. I
  was way ahead of the curriculum in math, and kept showing off.
  Worse, I taught some of my classmates math "thricks," that were
  not part of the curriculum. So, Mr. Wimmer made a "treaty" with
  me: While he could not excuse me from attending class, I was
  guaranteed a top grade without being required to turn in the
  homework assignments, and was permitted to do whatever I wanted
  to do during the hour, <i>provided</i> I kept absolutely quiet -
  except when explicitly asked to speak up. Both of us kept that
  treaty.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wimmer also became our physics teacher,
  a subject about which he clearly knew little more than what was
  in the textbook. Realizing that I was deeply into physics, he
  simply enlisted me and one other student to help him in lecture
  preparations, like setting up what apparatus had survived the
  war. Once I even was asked to present the lecture myself, with
  him sitting in the front row and enjoying the show. It was a
  wonderful experience.</p>

  <p>Having graduated from the gymnasium in
  1947, 1 was accepted as a physics student at the University of
  Jena, where I fell under the spell of the great Friedrich Hund,
  the most brilliant lecturer I ever encountered. The joy did not
  last long. In early 1948 the political suppression in East
  Germany became very severe, especially at rebellious universities
  like Jena. Every week, some of my fellow students had suddenly
  disappeared, and you never knew whether they had fled to the
  West, or had ended up in the German branch of Stalin's Gulag,
  like the uranium mines near the Czech border. During the Berlin
  airlift, I was in Berlin as a summer student at the Siemens
  company, and I decided to go West via one of the empty airlift
  return flights.</p>

  <p>From Berlin, I had written to several west
  German universities for admission, including G&ouml;ttingen, but did not receive a reply before
  leaving Berlin (they had turned me down). I followed the advice
  of one of my Jena professors "why don't you give my greetings to
  Professor K&ouml;nig in G&ouml;ttingen." K&ouml;nig told me that
  physics admissions were closed, but he passed me on for what was
  ostensibly just a friendly chat to Professor Richard Becker and
  his alter-ego assistant, Dr. G&uuml;nther Leibfried. They in turn
  passed me on to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/index.html">Wolfgang Paul</a> (Nobel
  1989), and I think also to Robert Pohl. It soon dawned on me that
  this was not just a friendly social chat with people who had
  nothing better to do, but a thorough examination. I remember one
  of the questions Paul asked me: "You know that a mirror
  interchanges left and right? -Then why doesn't it interchange top
  and bottom?" In the end, I was returned to Becker, who told me
  that two of the students who had been admitted were not coming,
  and a meeting was scheduled for the next day to select who would
  get the two openings. A few days later I received a postcard that
  I had been accepted.</p>

  <p>Post-war G&ouml;ttingen. was -
  intellectually - a wonderfully stimulating place. I was attracted
  to one of the younger instructors - "Privatdozent" Dr. Hellwege -
  who offered a so-called Proseminar, where pre-research students
  would present papers assigned to them, and I participated in this
  for several semesters in a row. Once, the famous Fritz Houtermans
  visited Hellwege, and sat in on several of the presentations,
  including mine. I presented someone's data that yielded a
  reasonable straight line on a double-log plot, and proudly
  claimed a power law for the data. Houtermans was not impressed:
  "On a double-log plot, my grandmother fits on a straight line." I
  keep quoting Houtermans' grandmother to my own students.
  Eventually, I signed up with Hellwege for a Diploma Thesis, which
  would probably have led to an experimental study of the optical
  spectra of some rare-earth salts. But Hellwege had a long waiting
  list, and in the meantime, Professor Fritz Sauter - a refugee who
  had found a temporary home as a guest in Becker's Institute for
  Theoretical Physics - offered me a theoretical Diploma Thesis,
  based on a talk that I had given in one of his seminars. Hellwege
  suggested that I accept Sauter's offer: "You will be finished
  with him before you can start with me." So I became a
  theorist.</p>

  <p>The diploma thesis was an extension of a
  1939 paper by Shockley on the nature of surface states in
  one-dimensional potentials. As one of the elaborations, I looked
  at the interface between two different periodic potentials, which
  confronted me for the first time with what we would today call
  the band offsets at heterojunctions.</p>

  <p>There was another early encounter with
  heterojunctions while working under Sauter. We made a field trip
  to the AEG research laboratories in Belecke, a small town in
  Westphalia. There, a Dr. Poganski gave a beautiful demonstration
  that the selenium rectifier was not a Schottky barrier, but a p-n
  junction between p-type selenium and n-type CdSe, a true
  heterojunction - although that term did not exist yet. This must
  have had an at least sub-conscious influence on me: when I later
  started thinking about heterojunctions in earnest, the question
  whether such things could actually exist as real devices had an
  obvious answer: Of course!</p>

  <p>While working on my diploma, I gave another
  colloquium talk under Sauter, reporting on the famous
  Bardeen/Brattain paper "Physical Principles Involved in
  Transistor Action" (or some title like that). At the end I made
  some suggestion about some open questions raised by the authors.
  Sauter was intrigued and suggested that as a possible Ph.D.
  topic. Sometime later, he came into my office and told me to stop
  further work on my Diploma thesis, and to simply write up what I
  had done so far. When I protested, he insisted that it was time
  to move on to the real thing, the Ph.D. dissertation.</p>

  <p>I had thus come into contact with one of
  Sauter's strong beliefs, apparently dating back to the tradition
  of the 20s: that degrees should not be awarded on the basis of
  having "served time," but were basically certificates that the
  recipient had proven capable of executing creative work
  independently, and no longer required supervision. In fact, he
  clearly preferred quick dissertations. As a result, I received my
  Ph.D. before my 24th birthday, fast even for a theorist:
  Wonderful!</p>

  <p>The Ph.D. dissertation involved what we
  would today call <i>hot-electron effects</i>, in the collector
  space-charge layer of the then-new transistor. The idea was
  simple. Almost nothing was known about the energy band structure
  of Ge, but someone's theoretical estimates suggested - quite
  incorrectly - very narrow bands, especially for the valence band.
  In this case, if the field was strong enough, any holes in the
  valence might undergo what we now call Bloch oscillations. A few
  lines of algebra suggested that, for a given current density, the
  traveling hole concentration would increase with increasing field
  ("Staueffekt"), leading to strong space charge effects. The
  influence of these space charges on the current-voltage
  characteristics of point contact diodes and transistors formed
  the main body of the dissertation.</p>

  <p>My algebra also implied a decrease of
  electron drift velocity with increasing field, implying a
  negative differential conductivity. Knowing nothing about
  electrical circuit theory, I was unaware how useful such a
  phenomenon could be, until <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html">Shockley</a> pointed it out
  to me in a personal discussion two years later.</p>

  <p>But it became clear soon that my
  dissertation was unrelated to reality. My assumptions about the
  band structure and about an energy-independent mean free path had
  been invalid, and after the discovery of avalanche breakdown it
  became obvious that the huge fields required for Bloch
  oscillations in a bulk semiconductor could never be reached.
  Twenty years later, after the pathbreaking work of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/index.html">Esaki</a> and Tsu on
  negative differential conductivity in superlattices, I realized
  that I had in fact anticipated their basic physics, albeit in a
  more primitive form: What was not possible in bulk
  semiconductors, appeared to become possible in superlattices with
  their much longer period.</p>

  <p>Back to Sauter. He was not interested in
  closely supervising his students; he simply watched what they
  were doing on their own initiative. Still, he had a tremendous
  influence on me in matters of methodology. Whenever I came to him
  with a pure physics idea, he would invariably say, with slight
  sarcasm: "But Mr. Kroemer, you ought to be able to formulate this
  mathematically! " If I came to him with a math formulation, I
  would get, in a similar tone: "But Mr. Kroemer, that is just
  math, what is the physics?" After a few encounters of this kind,
  you got the idea: You had to be able to go back and forth with
  ease. Yet, in the last analysis, concepts took priority over
  formalism, the latter was simply an (indispensable) means to an
  end.</p>

  <p>This set of priorities clearly showed, and
  it had a profound influence on me. As a student of Sommerfeld,
  Sauter was a superb mathematician himself. But he detested it
  when people were showing off their math skills by using math that
  was more advanced than necessary for the problem at hand. To the
  contrary: You were expected to show how simple you could make it.
  Because he was a great expert on Bessel functions, I once felt
  compelled to put, into the draft of my dissertation, an ad-hoc
  problem that required Bessel functions. He was not amused: "This
  has no business here; you just put it in to impress me. Take it
  out!"</p>

  <p>Richard Becker had exactly the same
  attitude (the two were close friends), and I later encountered it
  again in Shockley. Under influences such as these, I never
  developed into a "hard-core Theorist with a capital T," but
  became basically a conceptualist who remained acutely aware of
  his limitations as a formalist, and whose personal role model was
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a> more
  than anybody else amongst the Greats of Physics.</p>

  <p>The German 1952 job market for theoretical
  physicists was all but nonexistent. New university positions were
  not created, and there were plenty of more senior people waiting
  to occupy any vacancies that might open up. So I never even
  considered a university career. The situation in industry was
  hardly any better. As luck would have it, the small semiconductor
  research group at the Central Telecommunications Laboratory (FTZ)
  of the German postal service was looking for a "house theorist"
  who knew semiconductor theory, and I got the job. My duties were
  simple. I had to be available for whatever theoretical questions
  anybody had, and also take an active role by poking my nose into
  the work of my experimentalist and technologist colleagues, to
  look on my own for topics to which I could contribute - provided
  I would never touch any equipment. Every week or two, I had to
  give a talk of 1 to 2 hours to the group, on any subject of my
  choosing of which I thought that the group should be taught about
  it. Other than that, I was left completely free to pick whatever
  problems I felt were worth tackling. So I had become a
  "professor" of sorts after all, teaching a small but highly
  motivated "class." From day-l I was forced to learn to
  communicate, not with other theorists, but with experimentalists
  and technologists. It was a fascinating challenge, with a range
  of topics far beyond what I myself had learned in G&ouml;ttingen,
  very often going beyond physics, into metallurgy, chemistry, and
  electrical engineering.</p>

  <p>Of course I ceased to be a "real"
  theoretical physicist - if I ever was one. Call me an Applied
  Theorist if you want. However, the awareness of doing something
  truly useful helped overcome the uneasy feelings over ending a
  theorist career as soon as it had begun. By hindsight, maybe it
  wasn't such a bad career move after all!</p>

  <p>As my research topic at the FTZ, I picked
  the problem of the severe frequency limitations of the new
  transistors - and what one might be able to do about them. It was
  this problem that led directly to heterostructure ideas. In a
  1954 publication of mine there are a couple of paragraphs
  outlining in a rudimentary form the first ideas for what was
  later to be called the heterostructure bipolar transistor, or
  HBT. I proposed both a transistor with a graded gap throughout
  the base, and the simpler form of just a wide-gap emitter. The
  rest is history. This history is described in some detail in my
  Nobel Lecture, so I will give here only the highlights.</p>

  <p>Some time afterjoining RCA Laboratories in
  Princeton, NJ, in 1954, I returned to heterojunctions. I actually
  tried - unsuccessfully - to build some HBTs with a Ge/Si alloy
  emitter on a Ge base. But my principal contributions to the field
  were two theoretical papers. One of these, in the <i>RCA
  Review</i>, is essentially unknown to this day, but it clearly
  spelled out the concept of <i>quasielectric fields</i>, which I
  considered the fundamental design principle for all
  heterostructures.</p>

  <p>The final step came in 1963, while I worked at
  Varian Associates in Palo Alto, CA. A colleague - Dr. Sol Miller
  - gave a research colloquium on the new semiconductor diode
  laser. He reported that experts had concluded that it was
  fundamentally impossible to achieve a steady-state population
  inversion at room temperature, because the injected carriers
  would diffuse out at the opposite side of the junction too
  rapidly. I immediately protested: "But that's a pile of ... ; all
  you have to do is give the outer regions a wider energy gap." I
  wrote up the idea and submitted the paper to <i>Applied Physics
  Letters</i>, where it was rejected. I was talked into not
  fighting the rejection, but to submit it to the <i>Proceedings of
  the IEEE</i>, where it was published, but ignored. I also wrote a
  patent, which is probably a better paper than the one in <i>Proc.
  IEEE</i>.</p>

  <p>Then came the final irony: I was refused
  resources to work on the new kind of laser, on the grounds that
  there could not possibly be any applications for it. By a
  coincidence, the Gunn effect had just been discovered, and having
  a long-standing interest in hot-electron negative-resistance
  effects, I worked on the Gunn effect for the next ten years, and
  did not participate in the final technological realization of the
  laser.</p>

  <p>I left Varian in 1966, and in 1968 joined
  the University of Colorado. There I eventually returned to
  heterostructures, and in the early-70s tackled the theory of band
  offsets together with my student Bill Frensley - now at UT Dallas
  - who worked out the first ab-initio theory of the band offsets.
  Shortly afterwards - now at UCSB - I developed a powerful method
  to determine band offsets experimentally, by capacitance-voltage
  profiling <i>through</i> the hetero-interface.</p>

  <p>In the late-70s, I returned to the device
  that had started it all, the HBT. The technology developments
  that had made possible the DH laser offered great promise also
  for the HBT, and I became a strong advocate of developing the
  full potential of that device.</p>

  <p>In addition to heterostructures, I have
  worked on numerous other semiconductor topics, be it in physics,
  materials, devices, or technology. Second only to
  heterostructures has been a continuing interest in hot-electron
  negative-resistance effects, dating back to my Ph.D.
  dissertation. I already mentioned the work on the Gunn effect,
  but there was more. During my RCA years, I had come up with a
  crazy scheme to obtain a negative resistance perpendicular to a
  strong bias field, by drawing on the fact that some of the heavy
  holes in Ge have negative transverse effective masses - that is,
  <i>perpendicular</i> to their velocity. Experimentally, it was
  another failure, but conceptually, I found it extraordinarily
  stimulating. So did others, and it earned me a great deal of
  early notoriety. Today, I am back to one of the sins of my youth:
  to the superlattice Bloch oscillator, an exciting combination of
  heterostructures and hot electron physics.</p>

  <p>At the opposite end from hot electrons has
  been recent work on superconducting weak links in which a
  degenerately modulation-doped InAs/AlSb quantum well acts as a
  ballistic coupling medium between superconducting Nb electrodes.
  They exhibit some utterly delightful large discrepancies between
  experiment and accepted theory.</p>

  <p>There are numerous additional topics
  scattered throughout my career. I have basically been an
  opportunist - and not at all ashamed of it.</p>
