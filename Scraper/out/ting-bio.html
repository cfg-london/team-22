  <h1>Samuel C.C. Ting - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ting.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on 27 January 1936 in Ann
  Arbor, Michigan, the first of three children of Kuan Hai Ting, a
  professor of engineering, and Tsun-Ying Wang, a professor of
  psychology. My parents had hoped that I would be born in China,
  but as I was born prematurely while they were visiting the United
  States, by accident of birth I became an American citizen. Two
  months after my birth we returned to China. Owing to wartime
  conditions I did not have a traditional education until I was
  twelve. Nevertheless, my parents were always associated with
  universities, and I thus had the opportunity of meeting the many
  accomplished scholars who often visited us. Perhaps because of
  this early influence I have always had the desire to be
  associated with university life.<br>
  <br>
  Since both my parents were working, I was brought up by my
  maternal grandmother. My maternal grandfather lost his life
  during the first Chinese Revolution. After that, at the age of
  thirty-three, my grandmother decided to go to school, became a
  teacher, and brought my mother up alone. When I was young I often
  heard stories from my mother and grandmother recalling the
  difficult lives they had during that turbulent period and the
  efforts they made to provide my mother with a good education.
  Both of them were daring, original, and determined people, and
  they have left an indelible impression on me.<br>
  <br>
  When I was twenty years old I decided to return to the United
  States for a better education. My parents' friend, G.G. Brown,
  Dean of the School of Engineering, University of
  Michigan, told my parents I would be welcome to stay with him
  and his family. At that time I knew very little English and had
  no idea of the cost of living in the United States. In China, I
  had read that many American students go through college on their
  own resources. I informed my parents that I would do likewise. I
  arrived at the Detroit airport on 6 September 1956 with $100,
  which at the time seemed more than adequate. I was somewhat
  frightened, did not know anyone, and communication was
  difficult.<br>
  <br>
  Since I depended on scholarships for my education, I had to work
  very hard to keep them. Somehow, I managed to obtain degrees in
  both mathematics and physics from the University of Michigan in
  three years, and completed my Ph.D. degree in physics under Drs.
  L.W. Jones and M.L. Perl in 1962.<br>
  <br>
  I went to the European Organization for Nuclear Research
  (CERN) as a Ford
  Foundation Fellow. There I had the good fortune to work with
  Giuseppe Cocconi at the Proton Synchrotron, and I learned a lot
  of physics from him. He always had a simple way of viewing a
  complicated problem, did experiments with great care, and
  impressed me deeply.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1965 I returned to the United States to teach at
  Columbia
  University. In those years the Columbia Physics Department
  was a very stimulating place, and I had the opportunity of
  watching people such as <a href="../1988/index.html">L.
  Lederman</a>, <a href="../1957/index.html">T.D. Lee</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a>, <a href=
  "../1988/index.html">M. Schwarts</a>, <a href=
  "../1988/index.html">J. Steinberger</a>, C.S. Wu, and others.
  They all had their own individual style and extremely good taste
  in physics. I benefitted greatly from my short stay at
  Columbia.<br>
  <br>
  In my second year at Columbia there was an experiment done at the
  Cambridge Electron Accelerator on electron-positron pair
  production by photon collision with a nuclear target. It seemed
  to show a violation of quantum electrodynamics. I studied this
  experiment in detail and decided to duplicate it. I contacted G.
  Weber and W. Jentschke of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) about
  the possibility of doing a pair production experiment at Hamburg.
  They were very enthusiastic and encouraged me to begin right
  away. In March 1966 I took leave from Columbia University to
  perform this experiment in Hamburg. Since that time I have
  devoted all my efforts to the physics of electron or muon pairs,
  investigating quantum electrodynamics, production and decay of
  photon-like particles, and searching for new particles which
  decay to electron or muon pairs. These types of experiments are
  characterized by the need for a high-intensity incident flux, for
  high rejection against a large number of unwanted background
  events, and at the same time the need for a detector with good
  mass resolution.<br>
  <br>
  In order to search for new particles at a higher mass, I brought
  my group back to the United States in 1971 and started an
  experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In the fall of 1974
  we found evidence of a new, totally unpredicted, heavy particle -
  the J particle. Since then a whole family of new particles has
  been found.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969 I joined the Physics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology (MIT). In 1977, I was appointed as the first
  Thomas Dudley Cabot Institute Professor of Physics at MIT. In
  recent years it has been my privilege to be associated with M.
  Deutsch, A.G. Hill, H. Feshbach, W. Jentschke, H. Schopper and G.
  Weber. All have strongly supported me. In addition, I have
  enjoyed working with many very outstanding young physicists such
  as U. Becker, J. Burger, M. Chen, R. Marshall and A.J.S.
  Smith.<br>
  <br>
  I married Dr. Susan Marks in 1985. We have one son, Christopher,
  born in 1986 and I have two daughters, Jeanne and Amy, from an
  earlier marriage.<br>
  <br>
  I have been awarded the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award from the US
  government in 1976 and the DeGasperi Award in Science from the
  Italian government in 1988. I have also received the Eringen
  Medal awarded by the Society of Engineering Science in 1977, the
  Golden Leopard Award for Excellence from the town of Taormina,
  Italy in 1988 and the Gold Medal for Science and Peace from the
  city of Brescia, Italy in 1988. I am a member of the National Academy of
  Sciences (US) and the American Physical Society, the Italian
  Physical Society and the European Physical Society. I have also
  been elected as a foreign member in Academia Sinica, the Pakistan
  Academy of Science and the Academy of Science of the USSR (now
  Russian Academy of Science). I also hold Doctor Honoris Causa
  degrees from the University of Michigan, The Chinese University
  of Hong Kong, Columbia University, the University of Bologna,
  Moscow State
  University and the University of Science and Technology in
  China and am an honorary professor at Jiatong University in
  Shanghai, China.</p>
