  <h1>Adolf Windaus - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="windaus.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Adolf Windaus</b> was born in Berlin
  on December 25, 1876, the son of Adolf Windaus and Margarete
  Elster. His ancestors had for generations mostly been artisans
  (from his father's side, drapery manufacturers).<br>
  <br>
  After attending the renowned "Franz&ouml;sisches Gymnasium"
  (French grammar school) in Berlin, where his interests were
  mainly focussed on literature, he took up medicine in 1895 (in
  Freiburg i.Br. and in Berlin), passing his preliminary medical
  examinations ("Physikum") in 1897.<br>
  <br>
  He had been particularly fascinated by <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer</a>'s lectures during his stay
  in Berlin and in consequence he began studying chemistry at
  Freiburg i.Br. under Kiliani, at the same time
  continuing his medical studies. In the winter of 1899-1900 he
  obtained his Dr. phil. degree, the subject of his thesis dealing
  with the cardiac poisons of the Digitalis plant.<br>
  <br>
  Windaus chose zoology as his subsidiary subject on account of the
  deep impression which Weismann's lectures had made on him in
  Freiburg. After graduating Windaus moved to Berlin to work with
  Emil Fischer. It was there that he met <a href=
  "../1950/index.html">Otto Diels</a>, with whom he formed a
  life-long friendship. He returned to Freiburg i.Br. in 1901 and
  on Kiliani's suggestion began his work on cholesterol and related
  sterols. Windaus's decision to study these substances was based
  on the fact that nothing was known about the structure of
  cholesterol at the time and he expected that investigations in
  this field would yield new and unexpected results. From the very
  start he correctly believed that sterols, which occur in every
  cell, must be considered as the parent substance of other groups
  of natural substances. Based on this work, briefly entitled <i>On
  Cholesterol</i>, Windaus "habilitated" as lecturer in 1903. In
  1919 he succeeded in transforming cholesterol into cholanic acid,
  which had previously been isolated from the bile acids by
  <a href="../1927/index.html">Wieland</a> - another close friend
  of his who received the Nobel Prize for 1927 for his studies of
  the constitution of the bile acids and related substances -
  Windaus thus demonstrated that the bile acids are closely related
  to the sterols.<br>
  <br>
  Another rich field of investigation from biological viewpoint was
  that of imidazole derivatives. This work, carried out in
  collaboration with Knoop, resulted from his attempt to prepare
  natural amino acids through the action of ammonia on sugar, and
  thus to establish conversion of sugar into proteins. The
  production of imidazole derivatives as a result of this reaction
  induced him to demonstrate the presence of a prototype of the
  imidazole ring in proteins. This in turn led to his demonstration
  that histidine, a building-stone of proteins, is an imidazole
  alanine, and to his discovery of histamine
  (imidazole-ethylalanine), a hormone of great importance in
  physiology and pharmacology, which was the reason for the
  interest shown by German chemical industry in his work.<br>
  <br>
  As the foremost expert on sterols he was in 1925 invited by the
  American physiologist Alfred Hess to come to New York to
  cooperate in the study of the antirachitic vitamin.<br>
  <br>
  It was also his interest in the imidazole derivatives that
  prompted him to examine the structure of the antineuritic
  vitamin. Cooperating with the I.G. Farbenindustry, which supplied
  the precious raw material for the work, he was able to prove that
  not an imidazole-ring (as suggested by Jansen and Donath), but a
  thiazole- and a pyrimidine-ring are present in vitamin
  B<sub>1</sub>.<br>
  <br>
  Other research taken up by Windaus was into the stereochemical
  problems of the <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>linking of
  hydrogenated ring systems. In all these investigations his
  starting-point was always that of experimental observation, and
  not of theoretical deduction; the inductive method was the most
  suitable for his talents. During the last years of his life he
  also investigated the possibility of chemotherapy in cancer
  research.<br>
  <br>
  Windaus was appointed Assistant Professor (1906), and Professor
  of Applied Medical Chemistry at Innsbruck University (1913), where he
  remained for two years. He moved to G&ouml;ttingen in 1915 as
  Professor of Chemistry, succeeding Otto Wallach, where he stayed
  until his retirement in 1944 as Director of the Laboratory for
  General Chemistry, formerly the W&ouml;hler Institute. Among his
  pupils may be mentioned <a href="../1939/index.html">Adolf
  Butenandt</a>, Nobel Prize winner 1939 for his work on sex
  hormones - which are closely related to the sterols - and Hans
  Brockmann.<br>
  <br>
  Windaus received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928, on account
  of his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection
  with vitamins. Among the many honours he was awarded were the
  Pasteur Medal (1938), the Goethe Medal (1941), also the "Groszes
  Verdienstireuz" (Grand Order of Merit) in 1951, and the "Groszes
  Verdienstkreuz mit Stern" (Grand Order of Merit with Star) in
  1956. In addition he was recipient of the Order pour le Merite,
  Peace Class, in 1952. He was also honorary doctor of the
  Universities of G&ouml;ttingen, Munich, Freiburg, and Hanover.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Windaus married Elisabeth Resau in 1915. There were
  three children by his marriage: G&uuml;nter (b. 1916), Gustav (b.
  1918), and Margarete (b. 1921)<br>
  <br>
  He died on June 9, 1959.</p>
