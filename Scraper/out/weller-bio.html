  <h1>Thomas H. Weller - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="weller.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Thomas
  Huckle Weller</b> was born at Ann Arbor, Michigan, on June 15th,
  1915. He was educated at the public schools there, and later at
  the University of
  Michigan, where his father, Carl Vernon Weller had an
  appointment in the Pathology Department of the Medical School.
  Entering this University in 1932, T. H. Weller graduated in 1936,
  taking the A.B. degree. Early in life he had shown an interest in
  natural history, and this no doubt influenced him during his
  University life in the direction of medical zoology. He was also
  influenced in this direction by Professors G. R. LaRue, and A. E.
  Woodhead and, after his graduation, he worked for two summers at
  the University of Michigan Biological Station under Professors L.
  J. Thomas and W. W. Cort on the parasites of fish. In 1937 he was
  awarded the M.S. degree for this work.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936, however, he had entered the Harvard Medical
  School in Boston and there he was given, by Drs. E. E. Tyzzer
  and Donald L. Augustine, facilities for research in the
  Department of Comparative Pathology and Tropical Medicine. His
  experiences under the direction of these two distinguished
  parasitologists, whose outstanding discoveries in protozoology
  and helminthology are well-known, must have been very
  valuable.<br>
  <br>
  The course of much of Weller's later work was, nevertheless,
  influenced by the fact that he was accepted, in 1939, as a
  tutorial student by Dr. <a href="index.html">J. F. Enders</a>,
  who introduced him to the field of virus research and to the
  study of tissue-culture techniques as a means of studying the
  causes of infectious disease. In 1940 he took his M.D. degree and
  began his clinical training at the Children's
  Hospital in Boston. His work here was, however, interrupted
  by military service in the Second World War, for he joined, in
  1942, the Army Medical Corps and was stationed at the Antilles
  Medical Laboratory in Puerto Rico for 32 months. There he was
  Head of the Departments of Bacteriology, Virology and
  Parasitology and attained the rank of Major. He then returned to
  the Children's Hospital, Boston, for a further year of clinical
  training and, in 1947, he joined Dr. Enders in the organization
  of the new, Research Division of Infectious Diseases at the
  Children's Medical Centre.<br>
  <br>
  In 1949 he was appointed Assistant Director of this Division and
  subsequently was appointed Instructor, Assistant Professor, and then Associate
  Professor in the Department of Comparative Pathology and Tropical Medicine
  of Harvard Medical School. The department was renamed and transferred to the
  Harvard School of Public Health. In July 1954, he was appointed Richard Pearson
  Strong Professor of Tropical Public Health and head of the Department at the
  Harvard School of Public Health.<br>
  <br>
  In his researches, Weller was interested, partly in the helminth
  parasites of man, and partly in virology. In helminthology he
  contributed to the literature on the nematode <i>Trichirella
  spiralis</i> and also to that on the schistosome trematodes which
  cause schistosomiasis of man, his contributions including methods
  of cultivating the schistosomes <i>in vitro</i> and modifications
  of methods for the recovery and counting of the eggs of these
  parasites.<br>
  <br>
  In virology his studies of varicella and herpes zoster resulted
  in his isolation for the first time of the viruses responsible
  for these diseases, and also in the development of diagnostic
  tests and in the demonstration that the same virus apparently
  causes both these diseases. In 1955 he also isolated the virus
  which causes cytomegalic inclusion disease in infants and, after
  working for five years on these diseases, he was able to show
  that the human foetus, while it is in the uterus, is particularly
  susceptible to attack by these viruses and that, if the foetus
  survives attack by them, the infant is often born with severe
  damage to its brain which causes mental retardation and cerebral
  palsy. Weller's subsequent work has included studies of the
  Coxsackie viruses as causes of epidemic pleurodynia and on the
  behaviour of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in tissue culture. He is
  also studying the propagation <i>in vitro</i> of the viruses that
  cause varicella and herpes zoster.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the appointments already mentioned, Weller served,
  from 1953 till 1959, as Director of the Commission on Parasitic
  Diseases of the American Armed Forces Epidemiological
  Board.<br>
  <br>
  In 1945 he married Kathleen Fahey and they have two sons, Peter
  Fahey and Robert Andrew, and two daughters, Janet Louise and
  Nancy Kathleen.</p>
