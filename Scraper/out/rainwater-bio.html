  <h1>James Rainwater - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rainwater.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born December 9, 1917 in a
  small town in Idaho (Council) where my parents had moved to from
  California to operate a general store. My father, who had
  previously been a civil engineer, died in the great influenza
  epidemic of 1918. My mother then moved with me and her mother to
  Hanford, Calif. in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where
  she was re-married to George Fowler a few years later. In my
  schooling through high school, I excelled mainly in chemistry,
  physics and mathematics. Due mainly to my record on an open
  chemistry competition given by Cal Tech, I was admitted, graduating in 1939
  as a physics major. <a href="../1936/index.html">Carl David
  Anderson</a> was my physics group recitation instructor when he
  received his Nobel Prize and Milliken was the President of the
  Institute. I had a short biology course taught by Thomas Hunt
  Morgan. In 1939 I began graduate study in physics as a teaching
  assistant at Columbia University where I have remained. During
  the first two years, I had courses under <a href=
  "../1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a>, Edward
  Teller and J.R. Dunning. Fermi was working on neutron moderator
  assemblies which led to the first working nuclear "pile" after
  his group was moved to Chicago. Dunning, Booth, Slack, and Von
  Grosse held the basic patent on the gaseous diffusion process for
  <sup>235</sup>U enrichment and were working on its development.
  This evolved into the Oak Ridge enrichment plants and the present
  U.S. technology for <sup>235</sup>U enrichment.<br>
  <br>
  In March 1942, I married Emma Louise Smith. We have three sons,
  James, Robert and William who are all now adults. We also had a
  daughter, Elizabeth Ann, who died while young.<br>
  <br>
  During W.W. II, I worked with W.W. Havens, Jr. and C.S. Wu under
  Dr. Dunning (Manhattan Project) mainly doing pulsed neutron
  spectroscopy using the small Columbia cyclotron. I received my
  Ph.D after my thesis was de-classified in 1946. I continued at
  Columbia,
  first as an instructor, reaching the rank of full professor in
  1952. About 1946 funding was obtained from the Office of Naval
  Research to build a synchrocyclotron which became operational in
  early 1950. I was involved with the facility development from the
  beginning and my research has used that facility ever since. The
  research included neutron resonance spectroscopy, the angular
  distribution of pion elastic and inelastic scattering on nuclei
  with optical model fitting. Best known are the muanic-atom-x-ray
  studies starting with the pioneering 1953 paper with <a href=
  "../1980/index.html">Val Fitch</a> which first established the
  smaller proton charge radii of nuclei.<br>
  <br>
  Starting in 1948, I taught an advanced nuclear physics graduate
  course. The Maria Mayer shell model suggestion in 1949 was a
  great triumph and fitted my belief that a nuclear shell model
  should represent a proper approach to understanding nuclear
  structure. Combined with developments of Weizsaker's
  semi-empirical explanation of nuclear binding, and the
  Bohr-Wheeler 1939 paper on nuclear fission, emphasizing distorted
  nuclear shapes, I was prepared to see an explanation of large
  nuclear quadrupole moments. The full concept came to me in late
  1949 when attending a colloquium by Prof. C.H. Townes who
  described the experimental situation for nuclear quadrupole
  moments. It was a fortuitous situation made even more so by the
  fact that I was sharing an office with Aage Bohr that year. We
  had many discussions of the implications, subsequently very
  successfully exploited by Bohr, Mottelson, and others of the
  Copenhagen Institute.<br>

  Since I joined the Columbia Physics Dept., in 1939, it has been
  my privilege to have as teachers and/or colleagues many previous
  Nobel Laureates in Physics: E. Fermi, I.I. Rabi, <a href=
  "../1967/index.html">H. Bethe</a> (Visiting Prof.), <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1955/index.html">P. Kusch, W. Lamb</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/index.html">C.H. Townes</a>,
  <a href="../1957/index.html">T.D. Lee</a> and <a href=

  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/index.html">R.A. Milliken</a>,
