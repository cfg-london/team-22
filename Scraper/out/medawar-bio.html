  <h1>Peter Medawar - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="medawar.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Peter Brian Medawar</b> was born on
  February 28, 1915, in Rio de Janeiro. He is the son of a business
  man who is a naturalized British subject, born in the
  Lebanon.<br>
  <br>
  Medawar was educated at Marlborough College, England, where he
  went in 1928. Leaving this College in 1932, he went to Magdalen College,
  Oxford, to study zoology under Professor J. Z. Young. After
  taking his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Medawar worked for a time
  at Sir <a href="../1945/index.html">Howard Florey</a>'s School of
  Pathology at Oxford and there became interested in research in
  fields of biology that are related to medicine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1935 he was appointed Christopher Welch Scholar and Senior
  Demonstrator at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1938 he became,
  by examination, a Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1942 he was
  Rolleston Prizeman and in 1944 he became Senior Research Fellow
  of St John's
  College, Oxford, and University Demonstrator in zoology and
  comparative anatomy. In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen
  College, Oxford, and in 1947 he was appointed Mason Professor of
  Zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1951 he moved to London
  as Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College,
  London. Here he remained until 1962, when he was appointed
  Director of the National Institute for Medical Research,
  London.<br>
  <br>
  Medawar's earlier research, done at Oxford, was on tissue
  culture, the regeneration of peripheral nerves and the
  mathematical analysis of the changes of shape of organisms that
  occur during this development. During the early stages of the
  Second World War he was asked by the Medical Research
  Council to investigate why it is that skin taken from one
  human being will not form a permanent graft on the skin of
  another person, and this work enabled him to establish theorems
  of transplantation immunity which formed the basis of his further
  work on this subject. When he moved to Birmingham in 1947 he
  continued to work on it, in collaboration with R. Billingham, and
  together they studied there problems of pigmentation and skin
  grafting in cattle, and the use of skin grafting to distinguish
  between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. In this work
  they took into consideration the work of R. D. Owen and concluded
  that the phenomenon that they called &laquo;actively acquired
  tolerance&raquo; of homografts could be artificially reproduced.
  For this earlier work on transplantation and growth, Medawar was
  elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. When he moved to
  London in 1951, Medawar continued to work with R. Billingham and
  L. Brent, on this phenomenon of tolerance, and his detailed
  analysis of it occupied him for several years. He also carried
  out other researches into transplantation immunity.<br>
  <br>
  The Royal Society of London, where he was the Croonian Lecturer
  in 1958, awarded him the Royal Medal in 1959. In the same year,
  he was Reith Lecturer for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
  He has been elected a Foreign Member of the New York Academy of
  Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the
  American Philosophical Society.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937 Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor, daughter of a
  Cambridge physician. They have two sons, Charles and Alexander,
  and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.</p>
