  <h2>The Coming Age of the Cell</h2>

  <h3>Inventory of living mechanisms by cell fractionation,
  biochemistry and electron microscopy, and a view of the impact of
  the findings on our status and thinking.</h3>

  <p>Fifty years of cell research can hardly be
  summarized in the twenty to thirty minutes of a lecture; to
  expose only part of it might be unrepresentative, unfair, and
  altogether unnecessary, since by now you have already been
  informed of the essential facts and discoveries that have
  accumulated in the course of these years.</p>

  <p>What I would like to do instead, is to
  discuss with you the impact of these discoveries on our daily
  life, and their significance for the present and the future. At
  the same time I will try to recall, first hand, what has been my
  own experience in this century's endeavor to uncover what were,
  not so long ago, the mysteries of life itself.</p>

  <p>Until 1930 or thereabout biologists, in the
  situation of Astronomers and Astrophysicists, were permitted to
  see the objects of their interest, but not to touch them; the
  cell was as distant from us, as the stars and galaxies were from
  them. More dramatic and frustrating was that we knew that the
  instrument at our disposal, the microscope - so efficient in the
  19th century - had ceased to be of any use, having reached,
  irremediably, the theoretical limits of its resolving power.</p>

  <p>I remember vividly my student days,
  spending hours at the light microscope, turning endlessly the
  micrometric screw, and gazing at the blurred boundary which
  concealed the mysterious ground substance where the secret
  mechanisms of cell life might be found. Until I remembered an old
  saying, inherited from the Greeks - that the same causes, always
  produce the same effects. And I realized that I should stop that
  futile game, and should try something else. In the meantime, I
  had fallen in love with the shape and the color of the
  eosinophilic granules of leucocytes and attempted to isolate
  them. I failed - and consoled myself later on in thinking that
  this attempt was technically premature, especially for a
  premedical student, and that the eosinophilic granules were not
  pink, anyway. It was only postponed. That Friday, the 13th of
  September 1929, when I sailed from Antwerp on the fast liner
  "Arabic" for an eleven-day voyage to the United States, I knew
  exactly what I was going to do. I had mailed beforehand to Dr.
  Simon Flexner, Director of the Rockefeller Institute, my own
  research program, hand-written, in poor English, and it had been
  accepted. My proposition had been to isolate, and determine by
  chemical and biochemical means the constitution of the Rous,
  chicken Tumor I "Agent", at that time still controversial in its
  nature and not yet recognized as a bonafide Virus. This task
  occupied me for about five years. Two short years later the
  microsomes, basophilic components of the cell ground substance,
  had settled in one of my test tubes, still a structureless jelly,
  but now captive in our hands.</p>

  <p>In the following ten years, the general
  method of cell fractionation by differential centrifugation was
  tested and improved, and the basic principles codified in two
  papers in 1946. This attempt to isolate cell constituents might
  have been a failure if they had been destroyed by the relative
  brutality of the technique employed. But this did not happen. The
  subcellular fragments obtained by rubbing cells in a mortar, and
  further subjected to the multiple cycles of sedimentations,
  washings and resuspensions in an appropriate fluid medium:
  continued to function in our test tubes, as they would in their
  original, cellular environment. The strict application of the
  balance sheet-quantitative analysis method permitted to trace
  their respective distribution among the various cellular
  compartments and thus, determine the specific role they performed
  in the life of the Cell.</p>

  <p>Small bodies, about half a micron in
  diameter, and later referred to under the name of "mitochondria"
  were detected under the light microscope as early as 1894.
  Although they continued to be extensively investigated by
  microscopy in the course of the following 50 years, leaving
  behind an enormous and controversial literature, no progress was
  achieved, and the chemical constitution and biochemical functions
  of mitochondria remained unknown, to the end of that period.</p>

  <p>In the early 1940's, I began to make plans
  for an investigation on the distribution of respiratory pigments
  in cells. Considering the complexity of the problem, I realized
  that it should be a collaborative undertaking. A year or so
  before, I had collaborated with Dean Burk and Winsler in
  providing them a material of interest to them, Chicken Tumor No
  10, which they used in their studies of the respiratory function
  in tumor cells. We started experimenting, although they were but
  mildly impressed by the scientific value of my project, as they
  told me years later. Their laboratory was conveniently located at
  the corner of York and 68th, at street level with the Cornell
  University Department of Vincent du Vignaud. I remember turning
  across the street, handing them, through the window, each
  fraction as it was isolated, my share being the determination of
  the chemical constitution of the fractions, and their respective
  distribution within the Cell. One day, Rollin D. Hotchkiss
  appeared, returning from a one-year fellowship spent in
  Cambridge, England, who was delighted to find on arrival, quote,
  "the golden fruits on my doorstep". We were soon rejoined by
  Hogeboom, and later by W. C. Schneider as regards the
  distribution of cytochrome c in the Cell, and its participation
  in respiratory processes. Together, the observations provided
  conclusive evidence to support the view that most, if not all, of
  cytochrome oxidase, succinoxidase and cytochrome c, three
  important members of the respiratory system responsible for most
  of the oxygen uptake, were segregated in mitochondria. In
  parallel with these biochemical studies, evidence was also
  obtained, by tests carried out with characteristic dyes, both
  under the microscope and in vitro, showing that the respiratory
  organelles and the mitochondria seen under the microscope were
  one and the same, a morphological information which would have
  remained meaningless, however, if we had not secured beforehand,
  the knowledge of their biochemical functions.</p>

  <p>Altogether, these observations demonstrated
  that the power of respiration exists in a discrete state in the
  cytoplasm, a fact which led me to suggest, in my Harvey Lecture,
  that the mitochondria may be considered "as the real power plants
  of the Cell". At about the same time, with the help of electron
  microscopy, the microsomes became the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

  <p>Looking back 25 years later, what I may say
  is that the facts have been far better than the dreams. In the
  long course of cell life on this earth it remained, for our age
  for our generation, to receive the full ownership of our
  inheritance. We have entered the cell, the Mansion of our birth,
  and started the inventory of our acquired wealth.</p>

  <p>For over two billion years, through the
  apparent fancy of her endless differentiations and metamorphosis
  the Cell, as regards its basic physiological mechanisms, has
  remained one and the same. It is life itself, and our true and
  distant ancestor.</p>

  <p>It is hardly more than a century since we
  first learned of the existence of the cell: this autonomous and
  all-contained unit of living matter, which has acquired the
  knowledge and the power to reproduce; the capacity to store,
  transform and utilize energy, and the capacity to accomplish
  physical works and to manufacture practically unlimited kinds of
  products. We know that the cell has possessed these attributes
  and biological devices and has continued to use them for billions
  of cell generations and years.</p>

  <p>In the course of the past 30 or 40 years,
  we have learned to appreciate the complexity and perfection of
  the cellular mechanisms, miniaturized to the utmost at the
  molecular level, which reveal within the cell an unparalleled
  knowledge of the laws of physics and chemistry. If we examine the
  accomplishments of man in his most advanced endeavors, in theory
  and in practice, we find that the cell has done all this long
  before him, with greater resourcefulness and much greater
  efficiency.</p>

  <p>In addition, we also know that the cell has
  a memory of its past, certainly in the case of the egg cell, and
  foresight of the future, together with precise and detailed
  patterns for differentiations and growth, a knowledge which is
  materialized in the process of reproduction and the development
  of all beings from bacteria to plants, beasts, or men. It is this
  cell which plans and composes all organisms, and which transmits
  to them its defects and potentialities. Man, like other
  organisms, is so perfectly coordinated that he may easily forget,
  whether awake or asleep, that he is a colony of cells in action,
  and that it is the cells which achieve, through him, what he has
  the illusion of accomplishing himself. It is the cells which
  create and maintain in us, during the span of our lives, our will
  to live and survive, to search and experiment, and to
  struggle.</p>

  <p>The cell, over the billions of years of her
  life, has covered the earth many times with her substance, found
  ways to control herself and her environment, and insure her
  survival. Man has now become an adjunct to perfect and carry
  forward these conquests. Is it absurd to imagine that our social
  behavior, from amoeba to man, is also planned and dictated, from
  stored information, by the cells? And that the time has come for
  men to be entrusted with the task, through heroic efforts, of
  bringing life to other worlds?</p>

  <p>I am afraid that in this description of the
  cell, based on experimental facts, I may be accused of
  reintroducing a vitalistic and teleological concept which the
  rationalism and the scientific materialism of the 19th and early
  20th centuries had banished from our literature and from our
  scientific thinking.</p>

  <p>Of course, we know the laws of trial and
  error, of large numbers and probabilities. We know that these
  laws are part of the mathematical and mechanical fabric of the
  universe, and that they are also at play in biological processes.
  But, in the name of the experimental method and out of our poor
  knowledge, are we really entitled to claim that everything
  happens by chance, to the exclusion of all other
  possibilities?</p>

  <p>About a year ago, I was invited to an
  official party by the Governor of a State. As the guests were
  beginning to leave, the Governor took me aside in a room nearby.
  He looked concerned and somewhat embarrassed. "Dr. Claude," he
  asked, "you seem to know much about life. Please tell me: what do
  you think about the existence of God." The question was
  unexpected, but I was not unprepared. I told him that for a
  modern scientist, practicing experimental research, the least
  that could be said, is that we do not know. But I felt that such
  a negative answer was only part of the truth. I told him that in
  this universe in which we live, unbounded in space, infinite in
  stored energy and, who knows, unlimited in time, the adequate and
  positive answer, according to my belief, is that this universe
  may, also, possess infinite potentialities. The wife of the
  Governor had joined us in the meantime. Hearing this, she seized
  her husband by the arm and said, "You see, I always told you
  so."</p>

  <p>Life, this anti-entropy, ceaselessly
  reloaded with energy, is a climbing force, toward order amidst
  chaos, toward light, among the darkness of the indefinite, toward
  the mystic dream of Love, between the fire which devours itself
  and the silence of the Cold. Such a Nature does not accept
  abdication, nor skepticism.</p>

  <p>No doubt, man will continue to weigh and to
  measure, watch himself grow, and his Universe around him and with
  him, according to the ever growing powers of his tools. For the
  resolving powers of our scientific instruments decide, at a given
  moment, of the size and the vision of our Universe, and of the
  image we then make of ourselves. Once Ptolemy and Plato,
  yesterday Newton, today Einstein, and tomorrow new faiths, new
  beliefs, and new dimensions.</p>

  <p>As a result of the scientific revolution of
  the present century we are finding ourselves living in a magic
  world, unbelievable less than hundred years ago-magic our
  telephone, radio, television by multichannel satellites, magic
  our conversations with the moon, with Mars and Venus, with
  Jupiter-magic these means which transform our former solitude
  into a permanent simultaneity of presence, among the members of
  the Solar System.</p>

  <p>And here, at home, thanks to these new
  media, and the ever increasing speed of transports, we are
  witnessing a vast mutation taking place, no longer local, but at
  the dimensions of the Globe: the birth of a new biological
  organism, in which all Continents, and all the human races
  participate.</p>

  <p>For this equilibrium now in sight, let us
  trust that mankind, as it has occurred in the greatest periods of
  its past, will find for itself a new code of ethics, common to
  all, made of tolerance, of courage, and of faith in the Spirit of
