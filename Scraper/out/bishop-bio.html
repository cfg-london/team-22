  <p><img src="bishop.jpg" class="bio-img">My youth held little forecast of a career
  in biomedical research. I was born on February 22, 1936, in York,
  Pennsylvania, and spent my childhood in a rural area on the west
  bank of the Susquehanna River. Those years were pastoral in two
  regards: I saw little of metropolitan life until I was past the
  age of twenty-one; and my youth was permeated with the concerns
  of my father's occupation as a Lutheran minister, tending to two
  small parishes. My most tangible legacy from then is a passion
  for music, sired by the liturgy of the church, fostered by my
  parents through piano, organ and vocal lessons. I am deeply
  grateful for the legacy, albeit apostate from the church.<br>
  <br>
  I obtained eight years of elementary education in a two-room
  school, where I encountered a stern but engaging teacher who
  awakened my intellect with instruction that would seem rigorous
  today in many colleges. History figured large in the curriculum,
  exciting for me what was to become an enduring interest. But I
  heard little of science, and what I did hear was exemplified by
  the collection and pressing of wild flowers. My high school was
  also small: eighty students graduated with me, few of whom
  eventually completed college. Tests conducted before I graduated
  predicted a future for me in journalism, forestry or the teaching
  of music; persons who know me well could recognize some truth in
  those seemingly errant prognoses.<br>
  <br>
  I had taken naturally to school and was an excellent student from
  the beginning. But my aspirations for the future were formed
  outside the classroom. During the summer months of my high-school
  years, I befriended Dr. Robert Kough, a physician who cared for
  members of my family. Although he was practicing general medicine
  in a rural community when I met him, he was well equipped to
  arouse in me an interest not only in the life of a physician but
  in the fundaments of human biology. His influence was to have a
  lasting impact.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Gettysburg College intent on preparing for medical
  school. But my ambition was far from resolute. Every new subject
  that I encountered in college proved a siren song. I imagined
  myself an historian, a philosopher, a novelist, rarely a
  scientist. But I stayed the course, completing my major in
  chemistry with diffidence but academic laurels. I met the woman
  who was to become my only wife. I have never been happier before
  or since.<br>
  <br>
  I graduated from college still knowing nothing of original
  research in science. I knew that I would be going to medical
  school, but I had little interest in practicing medicine.
  Instead, under the influence of my college faculty, I had formed
  a vague hope of becoming an educator - by what means and in what
  subject, I knew not. Learning of this hope, an associate dean at
  the University of Pennsylvania recommended that I decline my
  admission to medical school there and, instead, accept an offer
  from Harvard
  Medical School. I followed the advice. My pastoral years were
  at an end.<br>
  <br>
  Boston was a revelation and a revel. I could for the first time
  sate my burgeoning appetite for the fine arts. Harvard, on the
  other hand, was a revelation and a trial. I discovered that the
  path to an academic career in the biomedical sciences lay through
  research, not through teaching, and that I was probably least
  among my peers at Harvard in my preparation to travel that path.
  During my first two years of medical school, I acquired a respect
  for research from new-found friends among my classmates,
  particularly John Menninger (now at the University of Iowa) and
  Howard Berg (now at Harvard University). I sought summer work in
  a neurobiology laboratory at Harvard but was rebuffed because of
  my inexperience. I became ambivalent about continuing in medical
  school, yet at a loss for an alternative.<br>
  <br>
  Two pathologists rescued me. Benjamin Castleman offered me a year
  of independent study in his department at the Massachusetts
  General Hospital, and Edgar Taft of that department took me
  into his research laboratory. There was little hope that I could
  do any investigation of substance during that year, and I did
  not. But I became a practiced pathologist, which gave me an
  immense academic advantage in the ensuing years of medical
  school. I found the leisure to marry. And I was riotously free to
  read and think, which led me to a new passion: molecular biology.
  The passion was to remain an abstraction for another four years,
  but my course was now set.<br>
  <br>
  I was slowly becoming shrewd. I recognized that the inner sanctum
  of molecular biology was not accessible to me, that I would have
  to find an outer chamber in which to pursue my passion. I found
  animal virology, in the form of an elective course taken when I
  returned to my third year of medical school, and in the person of
  Elmer Pfefferkorn. From the course, I learned that the viruses of
  animal cells were ripe for study with the tools of molecular
  biology, yet still accessible to the likes of me. From Elmer, I
  learned the inebriation of research, the practice of rigor, and
  the art of disappointment.<br>
  <br>
  I began my work with Elmer in odd hours snatched from the days
  and nights of my formal curriculum. But an enlightened dean gave
  me a larger opportunity when he approved my outrageous proposal
  to ignore the curriculum of my final year in medical school, to
  spend most of my time in the research laboratory. In the end, I
  completed only one of the courses normally required of fourth
  year students. Flexibility of this sort in the affaires of a
  medical school is rare, even now, in this allegedly more liberal
  age.<br>
  <br>
  My work with Elmer was sheer joy, but it produced nothing of
  substance. I remained uncredentialed for postdoctoral work in
  research. So on graduation from medical school, I entered an
  essential interregnum of two years as a house physician at the
  Massachusetts General Hospital. That magnificent hospital
  admitted me to its prestigious training despite my woeful
  inexperience at the bedside, and despite my admission to the
  chief of service that I had no intention of ever practicing
  medicine. I have no evidence that they ever regretted their
  decision. Indeed, years later, I was privileged to receive their
  Warren Triennial Prize, one of my most treasured recognitions. I
  cherish the memories of my time there: I learned much of
  medicine, society and myself.<br>
  <br>
  Clinical training behind me, I began research in earnest as a
  postdoctoral fellow in the Research Associate Training Program at
  the National
  Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, a program
  designed to train mere physicians like myself in fundamental
  research. In its prime, the Program was a unique resource,
  providing U.S. medical schools with many of the most accomplished
  faculty. Without the Program, it is unlikely that I could have
  found my way into the community of science.<br>
  <br>
  My mentor at N.I.H. was Leon Levintow, who has continued as my
  friend and alter ego throughout the ensuing years. My subject was
  the replication of poliovirus, which had a test case for the view
  that the study of animal viruses could tease out the secrets of
  the vertebrate cell. I managed my first publishable research: my
  feet were now thoroughly wet; I had become confident of a future
  in research.<br>
  <br>
  Midway through my postdoctoral training, Levintow departed for
  the faculty at the University of California, San Francisco (known to
  its devotees as UCSF). In his stead came Gebhard Koch, who soon
  lured me to his home base in Hamburg, Germany, for a year. And
  again, I had an enlightened benefactor: Karl Habel, who agreed to
  have N.I.H. pay my salary in Germany, even though I would be in
  only the first year of a permanent appointment. I repaid the
  benefaction by never returning to Bethesda.<br>
  <br>
  My year in Germany saw little success in the laboratory, but I
  learned the joys of Romanesque architecture and German
  Expressionism. As my year in Germany drew to a close, I had two
  offers of faculty positions in hand: one at a prestigious
  university on the East coast of the United States, the other from
  Levintow and his departmental chairman, Ernest Jawetz, at UCSF. I
  chose the latter, easily, because the opportunities seemed so
  much greater: I would have been a mere embellishment on the East
  Coast; I was genuinely needed in San Francisco. In February of
  1968, my wife and I moved from Hamburg to San Francisco, where we
  remain ensconced to this day.<br>
  <br>
  I continued my work on poliovirus. But new departures were also
  in the offing. In the laboratory adjoining mine, I found Warren
  Levinson, who had set up a program to study Rous Sarcoma Virus,
  an archetype for what we now know as retroviruses. At the time,
  the replication of retroviruses was one of the great puzzles of
  animal virology. Levinson, Levintow and I joined forces in the
  hope of solving that puzzle. We were hardly begun before <a href=
  "../1975/index.html">Howard Temin and David Baltimore</a>
  announced that they had solved the puzzle with the discovery of
  reverse transcriptase.<br>
  <br>
  The discovery of reverse transcriptase was sobering for me: a
  momentous secret of nature, mine for the taking, had eluded me.
  But I was also exhilarated because reverse transcriptase offered
  new handles on the replication of retroviruses, handles that I
  seized and deployed with a vengeance. I was joined in this work
  by a growing force of talented postdoctoral fellows and graduate
  students. Among our early achievements were a description of the
  mechanisms by which reverse transcriptase copies RNA into DNA,
  the characterization of viral RNA in infected cells, and the
  identification and description of viral DNA in both normal and
  infected cells.<br>
  <br>
  The work on viral DNA was particularly notable because it was the
  handicraft of <a href="index.html">Harold Varmus</a>, who had
  joined me as a postdoctoral fellow in late 1970. Harold's arrival
  changed my life and career. Our relationship evolved rapidly to
  one of coequals, and the result was surely greater than the sum
  of the two parts. Together we decided to extend our interests
  beyond the problems of retroviral replication, to address the
  mystery of how Rous Sarcoma Virus transforms cells to neoplastic
  growth.<br>
  <br>
  Others had shown that transformation by Rous Sarcoma Virus could
  be attributed to a single gene (eventually dubbed <i>src</i>)
  located near the 3' end of the viral genome. Two problems engaged
  us: what was the origin of <i>src</i>; and what was the protein
  product of the gene? It was not our lot to find an answer for the
  second question, although we later played a part in discerning
  the biochemical function of the <i>src</i> protein. But with
  experiments performed mainly by Dominique Stehelin and Deborah
  Spector, we found the answer to the first question: <i>src</i> is
  a wayward version of a normal cellular gene (which we would now
  call a proto-oncogene), pirated into the retroviral genome by
  recombination (in a sequence of events known as transduction),
  and converted to a cancer gene by mutation.<br>
  <br>
  In the years that followed, we consolidated our evidence for
  retroviral transduction, generalized the finding to retroviral
  oncogenes other than <i>src</i>, helped elucidate the sorts of
  genetic damage that convert normal cellular genes into cancer
  genes, explored the contributions of proto-oncogenes to the
  genesis of human cancer, added to the repertoire of
  proto-oncogenes by several experimental strategies, pursued the
  physiological functions of proto-oncogenes in normal organisms,
  and shared in the discovery of the protein kinase encoded by
  <i>src</i>.<br>
  <br>
  I began my career at UCSF as an Assistant Professor of
  Microbiology and Immunology. I am now a Professor in the same
  department and in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics.
  I serve as Director of the G. W. Hooper Research Foundation and
  of the Program in Biological Sciences - the latter, an effort to
  unify graduate education at UCSF. I am as devoted to teaching as
  to research: I find the two vocations equally gratifying.<br>
  <br>
  I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A; the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences; the American Association for the
  Advancement of Science (elected an Honorary Fellow); the American
  Society for Biological Chemistry and Molecular Biology; the
  American Society for Microbiology; the American Society for Cell
  Biology; the American Society for Virology; the Federation of
  American Scientists; Alpha Omega Alpha; and Phi Beta Kappa.<br>
  <br>
  My honors include several awards for teaching from the students
  and faculty of UCSF; a Doctor of Science Honoris Causa from
  Gettysburg College; the American Association of Medical Colleges
  Award for Distinguished Research; the California Scientist of the
  Year; the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research; the
  Passano Foundation Award; the Warren Triennial Prize from the
  Massachusetts General Hospital; the Armand Hammer Cancer Prize;
  the Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize from the General Motors Cancer
  Foundation; the Gairdner Foundation International Award; the
  American Cancer Society National Medal of Honor; the Lila Gruber
  Cancer Research Award from the American Academy of Dermatology;
  the Dickson Prize in Medicine from the University of Pittsburgh;
  the American College of Physicians Award for Basic Medical
  Research; and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1989.
  Most of these have been shared with Harold Varmus.<br>
  <br>
  I am married to Kathryn Ione Putman and have two sons with her,
  Dylan Michael Dwight and Eliot John Putman. These three have
  given me a gift of affection and forebearance that I cannot hope
  to repay. My mother and father have reached their eighth and
  ninth decades, respectively, and were able to join us for a
  joyful time at the Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm. My brother,
  Stephen, is a distinguished solid-state physicist and now
  Professor at the University of Illinois; my sister, Catharine, is
  arguably the finest elementary school teacher in Virginia.<br>
  <br>
  If offered reincarnation, I would choose the career of a
  performing musician with exceptional talent, preferably, in a
  string quartet. One life-time as a scientist is enough - great
  fun, but enough. I am a self-confessed book addict, an inveterate
  reader of virtually anything that comes to hand (with the notable
  exceptions of science fiction and crime novels). I enjoy writing
  and abhor the dreadful prose that afflicts much of the
  contemporary scientific literature.</p>
