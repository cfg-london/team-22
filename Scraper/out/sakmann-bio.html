  <h1>Bert Sakmann - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="sakmann.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born during the second world war in
  Stuttgart, the capital of Swebia, as the first of two children.
  My father, Bertold Sakmann, was the director of a theatre, the
  third son of a physician whose family had lived in southern
  Germany for several generations. My mother, Annemarie Sakmann,
  was a physiotherapist and was born in Bangkok, the second child
  of a Prussian physician who served as doctor to the King of Siam
  and was the founder of the first hospital in Siam.<br>
  <br>
  During the first half of my childhood I grew up in Lindau, on
  Lake Constance, in a completely rural environment. There I went
  to elementary school, before returning to Stuttgart where I
  completed my Abitur at the Wagenburg Gymnasium. My only real
  interests at school were the physics lessons. At home I spent
  most of my time designing and building model motor and sailing
  ships as well as remote control aeroplanes. It was generally
  assumed that I would become an engineer. In the final year of
  school however I learned about cybernetics and its possible
  application to biology. Cybernetics fascinated me, because it
  seemed to me that living organisms could be understood in
  engineering terms.<br>
  <br>
  Since I could not make up my mind between physics and biology I
  enrolled at the medical faculty of T&uuml;bingen
  University. The first two years in medicine offered a broad
  spectrum in biochemistry and physiology and I decided to do my
  doctoral thesis in electrophysiology which seemed to be closest
  to engineering. At the time it was common practice to study at
  several different medical schools and I attended schools in
  Freiburg, Berlin and Paris. My decision to finish medical studies
  in Munich was largely dictated by a beautiful young lady whose
  attention I was desperate to catch in T&uuml;bingen, though
  without initial success. Today Christiane is my wife and we have
  two sons and a daughter. Christiane is a highly successful
  ophthalmologist specializing in pediatric ophthalmology. For most
  of the time since we have been married I have been known in
  G&ouml;ttingen and Heidelberg as the "eye doctor's
  husband".<br>
  <br>
  At that time 'biological cybernetics' was a field that fascinated
  many students of biology and physics. Werner Reichardt's and
  Bernhard Hassenstein's quantitative behavioural analysis of a
  beetle's optomotor response promised to make brain functions
  understandable in terms of information theory. Otto Creutzfeldt
  in the Kraepelin Institute in Munich accepted me as a doctoral
  student to work on the electrophysiological basis of pattern
  recognition. Although small by today's standards, the Kraepelin
  Institute encompassed almost all aspects of neurobiology at the
  time, ranging from voltage clamp current recordings from snail
  neurones in Dieter Lux's department to quantitative analysis of
  monkey behaviour in Detlev Ploog's department. In Otto
  Creutzfeldt's department, great enthusiasm and optimism prevailed
  in trying to understand and build models of pattern recognition
  by the visual system, and there was close collaboration with
  electrical engineers and computer scientists from the Munich Technical University. After three years of
  experimental work on the neurophysiological basis of light
  adaptation in the cat's visual system I realized that the central
  nervous system (CNS) was too difficult to comprehend without
  understanding the synaptic connections more clearly. I went to a
  course on basic mechanisms of vision in a summer school and I
  attended a lecture given by <a href="../1970/index.html">Bernard
  Katz</a> on nerve, muscle and synapse, which convinced me that
  cellular physiology would be very helpful in trying to understand
  the functions of the central nervous system. To gain experience
  in voltage clamping I joined Dieter Lux's laboratory and learned
  from <a href="index.html">Erwin Neher</a> how to voltage clamp
  synaptic currents in snail neurones before moving to Bernard
  Katz's department at University College, London.<br>
  <br>
  There I worked with Bill Betz for one year, learning the basics
  of synaptic transmission and taking apart the neuromuscular
  synapse into its pre- and postsynaptic elements. During the
  following two years I learned, with Dale Purves, that the
  neuromuscular synapse is also a good model for studying long-term
  changes in chemical and electrical excitability. During this time
  Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi discovered 'membrane noise' and
  'elementary events', and Linc Potter and Ricardo Miledi in the
  same department made the first attempts to count and isolate
  acetylcholine receptors. I was very lucky to be at University
  College at this particular time, when both the electrophysiology
  and the biochemistry of synaptic transmission became molecular.
  It seemed that a molecular understanding of the end-plate
  currents was within reach, and it became clear to me that I
  wanted to work on the molecular aspects of synaptic transmission,
  and on the development of synapses, which is what I have been
  doing since. The major experimental challenges were the direct
  recording of the elementary events that had been postulated from
  Katz and Miledi's experiments, the biochemical and structural
  characterisation of the acetylcholine receptor molecule, and the
  relation between structure and function of ion channels and
  receptors.<br>
  <br>
  When Otto Creutzfeldt offered me the opportunity to run a
  laboratory of my own in his department at the
  Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G&ouml;ttingen,
  I gladly accepted because other physicochemical and biochemically
  orientated departments there seemed to provide the right
  background for molecular physiology. Erwin Neher had moved to
  G&ouml;ttingen as well, and we agreed to characterize different
  subtypes of acetylcholine activated channels with biophysical
  methods. This project went rather well, and it suggested to us
  that ion channels in denervated muscle fibres might be a good
  choice to try out extracellular pipettes for the recording of
  elementary events. Some initial success was followed by many
  frustrations in attempts to improve the seal resistance by choice
  of different preparations and treatments of pipette tips.
  Finally, with the help of a group of very dedicated
  collaborators, Owen Hamill, Alain Marty and Fred Sigworth, we
  succeeded in establishing patch clamp recording configurations
  which allowed us to investigate almost any type of channel in
  almost every cell type. A practical course, and the book that
  resulted from this course, marked the end of our primary focus on
  methodological problems, and allowed me to concentrate my efforts
  on understanding the role of ion channels in synaptic signalling
  at the molecular level. The resulting work was carried out with
  David Colquhoun and Joachim Bormann in the following years.<br>
  <br>
  The next methodological step was to apply molecular biology
  techniques to problems of ion channel physiology. It seemed that
  proper use of recombinant channels in Xenopus oocytes could only
  be made in combination with single channel conductance
  measurements. Together with Veit Witzemann we found a simple way
  to free mRNA-injected oocytes from their covering layers to
  perform the first single channel conductance measurements from
  heterogeneously-expressed acetylcholine receptors. Later, Shosaku
  Numa suggested we collaborate combining patch clamp and
  recombinant DNA techniques to establish structure-function
  relations of the acetylcholine receptor. This fruitful
  collaboration identified the structural basis of channel subtypes
  and localized domains important for ion transport. It also
  provided me with a strong incentive to learn recombinant DNA
  techniques myself. When I later established my own department, I
  made sure that the techniques of cellular biophysics and
  molecular biology were well represented. As a result, I was well
  equipped to follow my strong interest in structure-function
  relations of ion channels and in the synaptogenesis of the
  neuromuscular junction.<br>
  <br>
  Another technical challenge, to develop new methods for recording
  postsynaptic currents from neurones in brain slices, was prompted
  by my ongoing interest in CNS synaptic physiology. Together with
  Tomoyuki Takahashi we developed a method to expose neurones in
  brain slices, so that patch clamp techniques could be applied to
  measure quantal synaptic currents and elementary events in the
  CNS. Understanding synaptic transmission in the CNS requires a
  close collaboration with molecular biologists, so I moved my
  laboratory from G&ouml;ttingen, where I had been collaborating
  with Erwin Neher for sixteen years, to Heidelberg, one of the
  molecular biology centers in Germany. Here I am collaborating
  with Peter Seeburg to elucidate the functions and dysfunctions of
  CNS synapses at a molecular level, using an approach which
  combines the techniques of biophysics and molecular
  biology.<br>
  <br>
  Looking back, I feel very fortunate that I began my career in two
  laboratories that guided me to important scientific issues that
  interested me for over twenty years. The scientists that
  influenced me most were Otto Creutzfeld, who made me decide to
  take up a scientific career in neurophysiology, and Bernard Katz,
  in whose department at University College, London I was trained
  in cellular biophysics, and who still remains my mentor. Later, I
  was fortunate to meet fellow scientists with whom I shared
  interests and who became good friends. With Erwin Neher I shared
  an exciting and wonderful sixteen years of scientific adventures
  and 'basteln' on new methods in the Max-Planck-Institute in
  G&ouml;ttingen. In our collaboration it has always proven
  important to spend a good part of our time developing methods and
  instruments, and to share newly developed methods with fellow
  scientists.<br>
  <br>
  I began my scientific career in the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft in 1966 and, with the
  exception of three postdoctoral years (1970-1973) at University
  College, London, I have remained affiliated with this
  organisation ever since. The ideal working conditions provided by
  this organisation have been invaluable. I am currently the
  Director of the Department of Cell Physiology at the
  Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg as well
  as, at present, the Acting Director of this Institute. Most of
  the major awards were given to me jointly with Erwin Neher, with
  whom I share also the Nobel Prize. These earlier awards were the
  Bunsen Prize, the Feldberg Prize, the Spencer Prize, the Leibniz
  Prize, the Gross-Horwitz Prize, the Louis Jeantet Prize and the
  Gairdner Prize. For me the most important awards, before I shared
  the Nobel Prize, were the Magnes Award of the Hebrew University
  (1982) and Harvey Prize of the Technion (1991). I am glad to be
  the first German scientist to receive these awards.</p>
