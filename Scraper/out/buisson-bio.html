  <h1>Ferdinand Buisson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="buisson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ferdinand
  &Eacute;douard Buisson</b> (December 20, 1841-February 16, 1932),
  &laquo;the world's most persistent pacifist&raquo;, was born in
  Paris, the son of a Protestant judge of the St.-&Eacute;tienne
  Tribunal. For his ardent partisanship of pacifist,
  Radical-Socialist, anticlerical views he was vilified by
  journalists, attacked by clerics and conservative scholars,
  forced from public office by political slander, and even, at the
  age of eighty-seven, severely caned by a group of student
  protesters who disrupted a pacifist meeting at which he was
  speaking. A progressive educator, he played a vital role in the
  modernization of French primary education.<br>
  <br>
  Buisson attended the Coll&egrave;ge d'Argentan and the Lyc&eacute;e
  St.-&Eacute;tienne but left school at the age of sixteen to help
  support the family when his father died. He completed his
  secondary education at the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet and his
  undergraduate degree at the University of Paris, obtained an
  advanced degree and certification to teach philosophy, and much
  later, at the age of fifty-one, took his doctorate in
  literature.<br>
  <br>
  In 1866, unwilling to swear allegiance to the Emperor and
  consequently unable to find a teaching post, he became an
  expatriate in Switzerland where he taught at the Acad&eacute;mie de
  Neuch&acirc;tel. The following year he participated in the Geneva
  peace congress which founded the Ligue internationale de la paix
  et de la libert&eacute;. Among his writings during this period of
  exile are <i>L'Abolition de la guerre par l'instruction</i>
  [Abolishing War through Education], published in
  <i>&Eacute;tats-Unis de l'Europe</i>, and revisions of his
  <i>Christianisme lib&eacute;ral</i> [Liberal Christianity], which
  develops the concept of a liberal faith in which organized
  religion is supplanted by a personal morality independently
  arrived at.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to France after the defeat of Napoleon III in the
  Franco-Prussian War, Buisson began his career as an educational
  administrator. He was named an inspector of primary education in
  Paris by Jules Simon, the minister for education in the Third
  Republic, but because of his speeches and pamphlets pleading for
  a system of secular education, he was accused in the National
  Assembly of disrespect for the Bible and in the general outcry
  that ensued felt called upon to resign. Later he became secretary
  of the Statistical Commission on Primary Education, attended the
  Vienna and the Philadelphia Expositions as a delegate of the
  Ministry of Public Instruction, and prepared extensive reports on
  education in Austria and the United States. In August of 1878,
  Jules Ferry, who had been appointed minister for education, gave
  Buisson the post of inspector general of primary education in
  France and, in the following year, that of director of primary
  education, a position he held for the next seventeen years.
  During the 1880's he collaborated with Ferry in drafting laws
  establishing free, compulsory, secular primary education in
  France, defended them in hard-fought legislative battles in the
  Chamber of Deputies, and finally participated in their
  implementation.<br>
  <br>
  Buisson was scholar as well as administrator. In 1878 he edited
  and saw through publication the first volume of the four-volume
  work <i>Dictionnaire de p&eacute;dagogie et d'instruction
  primaire</i>. In 1896 he became editor-in-chief of an influential
  journal of education, <i>Manuel g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'instruction
  primaire</i>. From 1896 to 1902 he was professor of education at
  the Sorbonne.<br>
  <br>
  The Dreyfus Affair ignited Buisson's desire to enter politics.
  Among the first of the ardent Dreyfusards when that affair
  exploded, he undertook a vehement writing and speaking campaign
  to reverse the Dreyfus decision and helped to found the League of
  the Rights of Man (1898) which grew out of the Dreyfus case and
  of which he became president in 1913. From 1902 to 1914 he was
  the elected deputy for the Seine. A Radical-Socialist, he
  supported compulsory, secular schooling; served as chairman of a
  commission on the issue of separation of church and state and as
  vice-chairman of a commission on proposals for social welfare
  legislation; sat on the Commission for Universal Suffrage where
  he upheld the vote for women and supported the principle of
  proportional representation.<br>
  <br>
  Buisson returned to the Chamber in 1919. He criticized the Treaty
  of Versailles in an open letter dated May 23, 1919, but in other
  publications and in speeches endorsed the League of Nations as a
  practical instrument in the effort to achieve international
  peace. Hoping to unite leftist groups, rejuvenate the radical
  party, and win support for his educational policies, he formed
  the League of the Republic in 1921. The new organization did not
  prevent his defeat in the election of 1924, however, and Buisson,
  now eighty-three, retired to Thieuloy-Saint-Antoine in Oise.
  There he became a municipal councillor and even tried,
  unsuccessfully, to obtain Radical-Socialist backing for the
  regional Senate seat.<br>
  <br>
  Nor did he allow his work for peace to languish. A partisan of a
  peaceful <i>d&eacute;tente</i> between France and Germany, he made
  a speaking tour of Germany to encourage reconciliation between
  the two countries. And the proceeds of the Nobel Peace Prize he
  donated to various pacifist programs.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of ninety-one, Buisson died of heart disease at his
  home in Thieuloy-Saint-Antone, survived by two sons and a
  daughter.</p>
