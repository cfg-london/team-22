  <h1>Hans Bethe - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bethe.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Hans Albrecht Bethe</b> was born in
  Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine, on July 2 1906. He attended the
  Gymnasium in Frankfurt from 1915 to 1924. He then studied at the
  University
  of Frankfurt for two years, and at Munich for two and one
  half years, taking his Ph. D. in theoretical physics with
  Professor Arnold Sommerfeld in July 1928.<br>
  <br>
  He then was an Instructor in physics at Frankfurt and at
  Stuttgart for one semester each. From fall 1929 to fall 1933 his
  headquarters were the University of Munich where he became
  Privatdozent in May 1930. During this time he had a travel
  fellowship of the International Education Board to go to
  Cambridge, England, in the fall of 1930, and to Rome in the
  spring terms of 1931 and 1932. In the winter semester of
  1932-1933,he held a position as Acting Assistant Professor at the
  University
  of Tubingen which he lost due to the advent of the Nazi
  regime in Germany.<br>
  <br>
  Bethe emigrated to England in October 1933 where he held a
  temporary position as Lecturer at the University of Manchester
  for the year 1933-1934, and a fellowship at the University of
  Bristol in the fall of 1934. In February 1935 he was appointed
  Assistant Professor at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. U.S.A., then
  promoted to Professor in the summer of 1937. He has stayed there
  ever since, except for sabbatical leaves and for an absence
  during World War II. His war work took him first to the Radiation
  Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working
  on microwave radar, and then to the Los Alamos Scientific
  Laboratory which was engaged in assembling the first atomic bomb.
  He returned to Los Alamos for half a year in 1952. Two of his
  sabbatical leaves were spent at Columbia University, one at the University of
  Cambridge, and one at CERN and Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
  Bethe's main work is concerned with the theory of atomic nuclei.
  Together with Peierls, he developed a theory of the deuteron in
  1934 which he extended in 1949. He resolved some contradictions
  in the nuclear mass scale in 1935. He studied the theory of
  nuclear reactions in 1935-1938, predicting many reaction cross
  sections. In connection with this work, he developed Bohr's
  theory of the compound nucleus in a more quantitative fashion.
  This work and also the existing knowledge on nuclear theory and
  experimental results, was summarized in three articles in the
  <i>Reviews of Modern Physics</i> which for many years served as a
  textbook for nuclear physicists.<br>
  <br>
  His work on nuclear reactions led Bethe to the discovery of the
  reactions which supply the energy in the stars. The most
  important nuclear reaction in the brilliant stars is the
  carbon-nitrogen cycle, while the sun and fainter stars use mostly
  the proton-proton reaction. Bethe's main achievement in this
  connection was the exclusion of other possible nuclear reactions.
  The Nobel Prize was given for this work, as well as his work on
  nuclear reactions in general.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955 Bethe returned to the theory of nuclei, emphasizing a
  different phase. He has worked since then on the theory of
  nuclear matter whose aim it is to explain the properties of
  atomic nuclei in terms of the forces acting between
  nucleons.<br>
  <br>
  Before his work on nuclear physics, Bethe's main attention was
  given to atomic physics and collision theory. On the former
  subject, he wrote a review article in <i>Handbuch der Physik</i>
  in which he filled in the gaps of the existing knowledge, and
  which is still up-to-date. In collision theory, he developed a
  simple and powerful theory of inelastic collisions between fast
  particles and atoms which he has used to determine the stopping
  power of matter for fast charged particles, thus providing a tool
  to nuclear physicists. Turning to more energetic collisions, he
  calculated with Heitler the bremsstrahlung emitted by
  relativistic electrons, and the production of electron pairs by
  high energy gamma rays.<br>
  <br>
  Bethe also did some work on solid-state theory. He discussed the
  splitting of atomic energy levels when an atom is inserted into a
  crystal, he did some work on the theory of metals, and especially
  he developed a theory of the order and disorder in alloys.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947, Bethe was the first to explain the Lamb-shift in the
  hydrogen spectrum, and he thus laid the foundation for the modern
  development of quantum electrodynamics. Later on, he worked with
  a large number of collaborators on the scattering of pi mesons
  and on their production by electromagnetic radiation.<br>
  <br>
  Bethe is married to the daughter of P.P. Ewald, the well-known
  X-ray physicist. They have two children, Henry and Monica.</p>
