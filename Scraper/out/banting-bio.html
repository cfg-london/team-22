  <h1>Frederick G. Banting - Biographical</h1>          
<p><img src="banting.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Frederick
                 Grant Banting</b> was born on November 14, 1891, at Alliston,
                 Ont.,  Canada. He was the youngest of five children of William
                 Thompson  Banting and Margaret Grant. Educated at the Public
                 and High Schools  at Alliston, he later went to the University
                 of Toronto  to study divinity, but soon transferred to the study
                 of medicine.  In 1916 he took his M.B. degree and at once joined
                 the Canadian  Army Medical Corps, and served, during the First
                 World War, in France.  In 1918 he was wounded at the battle
                 of Cambrai and in 1919 he was  awarded the Military Cross for
                 heroism under fire.<br>
              <br>
              When the war ended in 1919, Banting returned to Canada and was for 
              a short time a medical practitioner at London, Ontario. He studied 
              orthopaedic medicine and was, during the year 1919-1920, Resident 
              Surgeon at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. From 1920 until 1921 
              he did part-time teaching in orthopaedics at the University 
              of Western Ontario at London, Canada, besides his general practice, 
              and from 1921 until 1922 he was Lecturer in Pharmacology at the 
              University of Toronto. In 1922 he was awarded his M.D. degree, together 
              with a gold medal.<br>
              <br>
              Earlier, however, Banting had become deeply interested in diabetes. 
              The work of Naunyn, Minkowski, Opie, Schafer, and others had indicated 
              that diabetes was caused by lack of a protein hormone secreted by 
              the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. To this hormone Schafer 
              had given the name insulin, and it was supposed that insulin controls 
              the metabolism of sugar, so that lack of it results in the accumulation 
              of sugar in the blood and the excretion of the excess of sugar in 
              the urine. Attempts to supply the missing insulin by feeding patients 
              with fresh pancreas, or extracts of it, had failed, presumably because 
              the protein insulin in these had been destroyed by the proteolytic 
              enzyme of the pancreas. The problem, therefore, was how to extract 
              insulin from the pancreas before it had been thus destroyed.<br>
              <br>
              While he was considering this problem, Banting read in a medical 
              journal an article by Moses Baron, which pointed out that, when 
              the pancreatic duct was experimentally closed by ligatures, the 
              cells of the pancreas which secrete trypsin degenerate, but that 
              the islets of Langerhans remain intact. This suggested to Banting 
              the idea that ligation of the pancreatic duct would, by destroying 
              the cells which secrete trypsin, avoid the destruction of the insulin, 
              so that, after sufficient time had been allowed for the degeneration 
              of the trypsin-secreting cells, insulin might be extracted from 
              the intact islets of Langerhans.<br>
              <br>
              Determined to investigate this possibility, Banting discussed it 
              with various people, among whom was <a href="index.html">J.J.R. 
              Macleod</a>, Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, 
              and Macleod gave him facilities for experimental work upon it. Dr. 
              Charles Best, then a medical student, was appointed as Banting's 
              assistant, and together, Banting and Best started the work which 
              was to lead to the discovery of insulin.<br>
              <br>
              In 1922 Banting had been appointed Senior Demonstrator in Medicine 
              at the University of Toronto, and in 1923 he was elected to the 
              Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research, which had been endowed 
              by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. He was also appointed 
              Honorary Consulting Physician to the Toronto General Hospital, the 
              Hospital for Sick Children, and the Toronto Western Hospital. In 
              the Banting and Best Institute, Banting dealt with the problems 
              of silicosis, cancer, the mechanism of drowning and how to counteract 
              it. During the Second World War he became greatly interested in 
              problems connected with flying (such as blackout).<br>
              <br>
              In addition to his medical degree, Banting also obtained, in 1923, 
              the LL.D. degree (Queens) and the D.Sc. degree (Toronto). Prior 
              to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1923, 
              which he shared with Macleod, he received the Reeve Prize of the 
              University of Toronto (1922). In 1923, the Canadian Parliament granted 
              him a Life Annuity of $7,500. In 1928 Banting gave the Cameron Lecture 
              in Edinburgh. He was appointed member of numerous medical academies 
              and societies in his country and abroad, including the British and 
              American Physiological Societies, and the American Pharmacological 
              Society. He was knighted in 1934.<br>
              <br>
              As a keen painter, Banting once took part of a painting expedition 
              above the Arctic Circle, sponsored by the Government.<br>
              <br>
              Banting married Marion Robertson in 1924; they had one child, William 
              (b. 1928). This marriage ended in a divorce in 1932, and in 1937 
              Banting married Henrietta Ball.<br>
              <br>
              When the Second World War broke out, he served as a liaison officer 
              between the British and North American medical services and, while 
              thus engaged, he was, in February 1941, killed in an air disaster 
              in Newfoundland.</p>
