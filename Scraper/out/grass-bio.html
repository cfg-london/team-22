  <h1>G&uuml;nter Grass - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="grass.jpg" class="bio-img">G&uuml;nter Grass
  was born in 1927 in Danzig-Langfuhr of Polish-German parents.
  After military service and captivity by American forces 1944-46,
  he worked as a farm labourer and miner and studied art in
  D&uuml;sseldorf and Berlin. 1956-59 he made his living as a
  sculptor, graphic artist and writer in Paris, and subsequently
  Berlin. In 1955 Grass became a member of the socially critical
  Gruppe 47 (later described with great warmth in <i>The Meeting at
  Telgte</i>), his first poetry was published in 1956 and his first
  play produced in 1957. His major international breakthrough came
  in 1959 with his allegorical and wide-ranging picaresque novel
  <i>The Tin Drum</i> (filmed by Schl&ouml;ndorff), a satirical
  panorama of German reality during the first half of this century,
  which, with <i>Cat and Mouse</i> and <i>Dog Years</i>, was to
  form what is called the Danzig Trilogy.</p>

  <p>In the 1960s Grass became active in
  politics, participating in election campaigns on behalf of the
  Social Democrat party and Willy Brandt. He dealt with the
  responsibility of intellectuals in <i>Local Anaesthetic</i>,
  <i>From the Diary of a Snail</i> and in his "German tragedy"
  <i>The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising</i>, and published
  political speeches and essays in which he advocated a Germany
  free from fanaticism and totalitarian ideologies. His childhood
  home, Danzig, and his broad and suggestive fabulations were to
  reappear in two successful novels criticising civilisation,
  <i>The Flounder</i> and <i>The Rat</i>, which reflect Grass's
  commitment to the peace movement and the environmental movement.
  Vehement debate and criticism were aroused by his mammoth novel
  <i>Ein weites Feld</i> which is set in the DDR in the years of
  the collapse of communism and the fall of the Berlin wall. In
  <i>My Century</i> he presents the history of the past century
  from a personal point of view, year by year. As a graphic artist,
  Grass has often been responsible for the covers and illustrations
  for his own works.</p>

  <p>Grass was President of the Akademie der
  K&uuml;nste in Berlin 1983-86, active within the German Authors'
  Publishing Company and PEN. He has been awarded a large number of
  prizes, among them Preis der Gruppe 47 1958, "Le meilleur livre
  &eacute;tranger" 1962, the B&uuml;chner Prize 1965, the Fontane
  Prize 1968, Premio Internazionale Mondello 1977, the
  Alexander-Majakowski Medal, Gdansk 1979, the Antonio Feltrinelli
  Prize 1982, Gro&szlig;er Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie
  1994. He has honorary doctorates from Kenyon College and the
  Universities of Harvard, Poznan and Gdansk.</p>
