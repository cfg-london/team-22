  <h1>Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cajal.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Santiago
  Ram&oacute;n y Cajal</b> was born on May 1, 1852, at Petilla de Arag&oacute;n, Spain. As a boy he was apprenticed first to a barber and
  then to a cobbler. He himself wished to be an artist - his gift
  for draughtsmanship is evident in his published works. His
  father, however, who was Professor of Applied Anatomy in the
  University of Saragossa, persuaded him to study medicine, which
  he did, chiefly under the direction of his father. (Later, he
  made drawings for an atlas of anatomy which his father was
  preparing, but which was never published.)</p>

  <p>In 1873 he took his Licentiate in Medicine
  at Saragossa and served, after a competitive examination, as an
  army doctor. He took part in an expedition to Cuba in 1874-75,
  where he contracted malaria and tuberculosis. On his return he
  became an assistant in the School of Anatomy in the Faculty of
  Medicine at Saragossa (1875) and then, at his own request,
  Director of the Saragossa Museum (1879). In 1877 he obtained the
  degree of Doctor of Medicine at Madrid and in 1883 he was
  appointed Professor of Descriptive and General Anatomy at
  Valencia. In 1887 he was appointed Professor of Histology and
  Pathological Anatomy at Barcelona and in 1892 he was appointed to
  the same Chair at Madrid. In 1900-1901 he was appointed Director
  of the &laquo;Instituto Nacional de Higiene&raquo; and of the
  &laquo;Investigaciones Biol&oacute;gicas&raquo;.</p>

  <p>In 1880 he began to publish scientific
  works, of which the following are the most important: <i>Manual
  de Histolog&iacute;a normal y T&eacute;cnica microgr&aacute;fica</i>
  (Manual of normal histology and micrographic technique), 1889
  (2nd ed., 1893). A summary of this manual recast with additions,
  appeared under the title <i>Elementos de Histolog&iacute;a,
  etc</i>. (Elements of histology, etc.), 1897; <i>Manual de</i>
  <i>Anatom&iacute;a patol&oacute;gica general</i> (Manual of general
  pathological anatomy), 1890 (3rd ed., 1900). In addition may be
  cited: <i>Les nouvelles id&eacute;es sur la fine anatomie des
  centres nerveux</i> (New ideas on the fine anatomy of the nerve
  centres), 1894; <i>Textura del sistema nervioso del hombre y de
  los vertebrados</i> (Textbook on the nervous system of man and
  the vertebrates), 1897-1899; <i>Die Retina</i> <i>der
  Wirbelthiere</i> (The retina of vertebrates), 1894.</p>

  <p>Apart from these works Cajal has published
  more than 100 articles in French and Spanish scientific
  periodicals, especially on the fine structure of the nervous
  system and especially of the brain and spinal cord, but including
  also that of muscles and other tissues, and various subjects in
  the field of general pathology. These articles are dispersed in
  numerous Spanish journals and various specialized journals of
  other countries (especially French ones). Some articles in
  Spanish by Cajal and his pupils appear in the <i>Revista
  Trimestral de Histolog&iacute;a normal y patol&oacute;gica</i>
  (Quarterly review of normal and pathological histology) (1888
  onwards), continuation of them appeared under the title
  <i>Trabajos del Laboratorio de Investigaciones biologicas de la
  Universidad de Madrid</i> (Communications of the Laboratory for
  Biological Research, Madrid University).</p>

  <p>Cajal's studies on the structure of the
  cortex of the brain have been partly grouped together and
  translated into German by J. Bresler, 1900-1901.</p>

  <p>Cajal is also the author of <i>Reglas y
  Consejos sobre Investigacion Cientifica</i> (Rules and advices on
  scientific investigation), which appeared in six Spanish editions
  and was translated into German (1933).</p>

  <p>Among the distinctions won by Cajal are the
  following: Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Madrid
  (1895); of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Madrid (1897); of the
  Spanish Society of Natural History and of the Academy of Sciences
  of Lisbon (1897); Honorary Member of the Spanish Medical and
  Surgical Academy and also of several other Spanish societies.</p>

  <p>He was also made honorary Doctor of
  Medicine of the Universities of Cambridge (1894) and
  W&uuml;rzburg (1896) and Doctor of Philosophy of the Clark
  University (Worcester, U.S.A., 1899).</p>

  <p>Cajal was a corresponding member of several
  societies: the Physical-Medical Society of W&uuml;rzburg (1895);
  the Medical Society of Berlin (1895); the Society of Medical
  Sciences of Lisbon (1896); the Vienna Society for Psychiatry and
  Neurology (1896); the Society of Biology of Paris (1887); the
  National Medical Academy of Lima (1897); Conimbricensis Instituti
  Societas (Coimbra, 1898); and Member of Honour of the Italian
  Psychiatric Society (1896) as well as of the Medical Society of
  Ghent (Belgium, 1900). In 1906 he was elected an Associate Member
  of the Academy of Medicine, Paris; in 1916 he became a member of
  the Swedish Academy of Sciences. Caj&agrave;l has been awarded
  several prizes, for example the Rubio Prize of 1,000 pesetas for
  his previously mentioned <i>Elementos de Histolog&iacute;a,
  etc</i>., the Fauvelle Prize of 1,500 francs of the Society of
  Biology of Paris (1896); the Moscow Prize of 5,000 francs,
  established by the Congress of Moscow (1897) to reward medical
  works which, published during the latter three years, have
  rendered the greatest services to science and humanity was
  awarded to Ramon y Caj&agrave;l by the International Congress of
  Medicine in Paris (1900). In 1905, the Royal Academy of Sciences
  of Berlin awarded him the Helmholtz Medal. He shared the Nobel
  Prize for 1906 with <a href="index.html">Camillo Golgi</a> for
  their work on the structure of the nervous system.</p>

  <p>Cajal was summoned to London to give there,
  in March 1904, the Croonian Lecture of the Royal Society and to
  the Clark University (Worcester, Mass., U.S.A.) in 1899 to give
  there three lectures on the structure of the human brain and on
  the latest researches on this subject. In 1952 a volume of 651
  pages was published &laquo;In honour of S. Ram&oacute;n y Cajal on
  the centenary of his birth 1852 by members of a research group in
  neurophysiology&raquo; at the Caroline Institute (<i>Acta Physiol.
  Scand</i>., Vol. 29, Suppl. 106).</p>
