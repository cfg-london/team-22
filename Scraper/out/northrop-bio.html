  <h1>John H. Northrop - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="northrop.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John Howard Northrop</b> was
  born in Yonkers, New York, on July 5th, 1891. He is a direct
  descendant of Joseph Northrop who settled in New Milford,
  Connecticut in 1639, of Jonathan Edwards, President of Princeton
  University, 1758, and of Frederick C. Havemeyer, whose family
  presented Havemeyer Hall, the Chemical Laboratory, to Columbia
  University. His father, John I. Northrop, an instructor at
  Columbia, was fatally injured in a laboratory accident shortly
  before his birth. His mother, Alice R. Northrop, who formerly
  taught botany at Hunter College, New York City, returned to teaching
  and was responsible for the introduction of nature study into the
  curriculum of New York public schools. Her former country home in
  Massachusetts is maintained by the "Northrop Memorial" as a
  school of nature study for New York schoolchildren.<br>
  <br>
  After public school education, Northrop entered Columbia
  University in 1908 to study zoology and chemistry under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1933/index.html">T.H. Morgan</a> and J.M.
  Nelson. He graduated Bachelor of Science in 1912, Master of Arts
  in 1913 and received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1915. He was
  appointed W.B. Cutting Travelling Fellow and spent the next year
  in Jacques Loeb's laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute. The
  following year, he was appointed to the staff of the Institute
  and with the exception of his war service as a Captain in the
  Chemical Warfare Service (1917-1918), he has remained with the
  Institute ever since, becoming an Associate in 1917, Associate
  Member in 1920, and Member in 1924. In 1949 he was appointed
  Professor of Bacteriology, University of California, and later,
  Professor of Biophysics.<br>
  <br>
  Northrop's researches at Columbia were chiefly concerned with
  carbohydrates and his early work at the Rockefeller Institute was
  connected with theories of duration of life. Whilst in the
  service, he discovered a fermentation process for acetone, which
  he developed to the pilot-plant stage, and on demobilization and
  return to the Institute, he worked with Loeb on a kinetical study
  of enzymes essential to life processes. In 1929 he isolated
  pepsin in pure crystalline form by techniques which were later
  used by himself and other workers to crystallize trypsin,
  chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and pepsinogen. He studied the
  proteins of viruses and antibodies, and succeeded in isolating a
  nucleoprotein which had bacteriophage activity: his suggestion
  that the activity was due to nucleic acid was later proved to be
  correct. During World War II, he was consultant to the National
  Defense Research Committee and he studied the mode of action of
  war gases and methods of detection, developing an apparatus for
  their automatic detection and analysis. His more recent
  researches have included work on the origin and relationship of
  viruses and the transforming principle.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Northrop is the author of <i>Crystalline Enzymes</i>,
  published in 1939. He edited the <i>Journal of General
  Physiology</i> (Rockefeller Institute) for some years and he has
  written numerous papers on the physical chemistry of proteins,
  agglutination of bacteria, kinetics of enzyme reaction, and the
  chemical nature of enzymes.<br>
  <br>
  He was awarded the Stevens Prize (Columbia) in 1931; Chandler
  Medal, 1936; Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal, 1939; the Certificate of
  Merit (U.S. Government), 1948; Alex. Hamilton Medal, 1961. He has
  received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the Universities
  of Harvard,
  Columbia,
  Yale, Princeton, and Rutgers; and honorary Doctor of Law from the
  University of California. He is Honorary Fellow of the Chemical
  Society (London) and a member of many other scientific
  societies.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Northrop married Louise Walker in 1917. Their only son,
  John, is an oceanographer and their only daughter, Alice, married
  Professor <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/index.html">Frederick
  C. Robbins</a>, Nobel Laureate in Medicine, 1954. He is fond of
  riding and sailing, plays golf and tennis, but his chief hobbies
  are field shooting and salmon fishing.</p>
