  <h1>Alfred Fried - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fried.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Alfred
  Hermann Fried</b> (November 11, 1864-May 5, 1921) was born in
  Vienna, but pursued most of his active journalistic career in
  Germany. Leaving school at the age of fifteen, he worked in his
  native city as a bookseller, then a few years later went to
  Berlin where he opened his own press in 1887.<br>
  <br>
  Influenced by <a href="../1905/index.html">Bertha von
  Suttner</a>, Fried became interested in the peace movement,
  founded the Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft [German Peace Society],
  and edited its major publication, <i>Monatliche
  Friedenskorrespondenz</i> [Monthly Peace Correspondence], from
  1894 to 1899. Having persuaded Baroness von Suttner to serve as
  editor, he started a peace journal, naming it <i>Die Waffen
  Nieder!</i> [Lay Down Your Arms], the title of the Baroness'
  famous antiwar novel<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In 1899
  this was replaced by <i>Die Friedenswarte</i> [The Peace Watch],
  which he edited and which <a href="../1933/index.html">Norman
  Angell</a> called &laquo;the most efficient periodical of the
  Pacifist movement in the world&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This publication, which was addressed
  to an audience of intellectuals, has had a continuous history to
  the present time; edited by Fried until his death in 1921, then
  by Hans Wehberg, it was moved to Z&uuml;rich in 1933. In 1905
  Fried founded another journal, <i>Annuaire de la vie
  internationale</i>, which reflected his growing interest in
  international cooperation, particularly as exemplified by the
  Pan-American movement and the work of the Hague
  Conferences.<br>
  <br>
  The peace literature which flowed from his pen - reports,
  editorials, essays, pamphlets, books - was extensive, but he also
  contributed to the cause his capacity as an organizer. He was a
  member of the Bern Peace Bureau, secretary of the International
  Conciliation for Central Europe, and secretary-general of the
  Union internationale de la presse pour la paix.<br>
  <br>
  The Hague Peace Conference of 1899 was a turning point in the
  development of Fried's philosophy of pacifism. Thereafter, in his
  appeals to the German intellectual community he placed more
  reliance on economic cooperation and political organization among
  nations as bases for peace, and less upon limitation of armaments
  and schemes for international justice<a href=
  "#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. &laquo;War is not in itself a condition
  so much as the symptom of a condition, that of international
  anarchy&raquo;, he said. &laquo;If we wish to substitute for war
  the settlement of disputes by justice, we must first substitute
  for the condition of international anarchy a condition of
  international order.&raquo;<a href="#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  Fried's efforts were partly responsible for the founding of the
  Verband f&uuml;r internationale Verst&auml;ndigung [Society for
  International Understanding] in 1911. His theory of
  internationalism did not preclude nationalism. In the
  Pan-American movement he perceived a model for the preservation
  of national identity within international organization<a href=
  "#not_5"><sup>5</sup></a>. In keeping with this position, Fried
  defended Germany before World War I by chronicling Wilhelm II's
  positive attitude toward world peace and during the war by
  refuting what he considered to be unreasonable criticism of
  Germany in the French, British, and American press.<br>
  <br>
  Fried was in Vienna when war broke out in 1914. Since pacifist
  activities there were curtailed by government censorship and
  intolerant public opinion, Fried shifted his organizational and
  journalistic work to Switzerland. He was active in efforts to
  ameliorate the conditions of prisoners of war and continued to
  publish <i>Die Friedenswarte</i> as a rallying point for
  international peace efforts. Accused of treason by the Austrian
  government, he was unable to return to Vienna until the war's
  end.<br>
  <br>
  The war over, Fried published <i>Mein Kriegstagebuch</i> [My War
  Journal], a &laquo;diary&raquo; which he kept during the war years
  to record his sentiments and his activities, along with those of
  his colleagues in the peace movement; he expressed
  dissatisfaction with the peace settlement and organized a
  journalistic campaign against the Versailles Treaty; he
  tirelessly pressed the point in his propaganda for peace that the
  war was proof of the validity of the pacifistic analysis of world
  politics.<br>
  <br>
  Fried lost what wealth he possessed in the collapse of
  Austria-Hungary and died in poverty of a lung infection in Vienna
  at the age of fifty-seven.</p>
