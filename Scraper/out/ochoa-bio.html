  <h1>Severo Ochoa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ochoa.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Severo
  Ochoa</b> was born at Luarca, Spain, on September 24th, 1905. He
  is the son of Severo Ochoa, a lawyer and business man, and Carmen
  de Albornoz.<br>
  <br>
  Ochoa was educated at M&aacute;laga College, where he took his B.A.
  degree in 1921.<a href="#footnote">*</a> His interest in biology
  was greatly stimulated by the publications of the great Spanish
  neurologist, <a href="../1906/index.html">Ram&oacute;n y Cajal</a>,
  and he went to the Medical School of the University of Madrid,
  where he obtained his M.D. degree (with honours) in 1929. While
  he was at the University he was Assistant to Professor Juan
  Negrin and he paid, during the summer of 1927, a visit to the
  University of
  Glasgow to work under Professor D. Noel Paton.<br>
  <br>
  After graduating in 1929 Ochoa went, with the aid of the Spanish
  Council of Scientific Research, to work under <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a> at the Kaiser Wilhelm
  Institut f&uuml;r Medizinische Forschung at Heidelberg. During
  this period he worked on the biochemistry and physiology of
  muscle, and his outlook and training were decisively influenced
  by Meyerhof.<br>
  <br>
  In 1931, Ochoa was appointed Lecturer in Physiology at the
  University of Madrid, a post he held until 1935. In 1932 he went
  to the National Institute for Medical Research, London,
  where he worked with Dr. H. W. Dudley on his first problem in
  enzymology.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to Madrid in 1934, he was appointed Lecturer in
  Physiology and Biochemistry there and later became Head of the
  Physiology Division of the Institute for Medical Research,
  Madrid. In 1936 he was appointed Guest Research Assistant in
  Meyerhof's Laboratory at Heidelberg, where he worked on some of
  the enzymatic steps of glycolysis and fermentation. In 1937 he
  held a Ray Lankester Investigatorship at the Plymouth Marine
  Biological Laboratory and from 1938 until 1941 he worked on
  the biological function of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> with Professor
  R. A. Peters at Oxford University, where he was appointed
  Demonstrator and Nuffield Research Assistant.<br>
  <br>
  While he was at Oxford he became interested in the enzymatic
  mechanisms of oxidative metabolism and in 1941 he went to America
  and worked, until 1942, at the Washington
  University School of Medicine, St. Louis, where he was
  appointed Instructor and Research Associate in Pharmacology and
  worked with <a href="../1947/index.html">Carl and Gerty Cori</a>
  on problems of enzymology. In 1942 he was appointed Research
  Associate in Medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and
  there subsequently became Assistant Professor of Biochemistry
  (1945), Professor of Pharmacology (1946), Professor of
  Biochemistry (1954), and Chairman of the Department of
  Biochemistry. In 1956 he became an American citizen.<br>
  <br>
  Ochoa's research has dealt mainly with enzymatic processes in
  biological oxidation and synthesis and the transfer of energy. It
  has contributed much to the knowledge of the basic steps in the
  metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids, the utilization of
  carbon dioxide, and the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. It has
  included the biological functions of vitamin B<sub>1</sub>,
  oxidative phosphorylation, the reductive carboxylation of
  ketoglutaric and pyruvic acids, the photochemical reduction of
  pyridine nucleotides in photosynthesis, condensing enzyme - which
  is the key enzyme of the Krebs citric acid cycle, polynucleotide
  phosphorylase and the genetic code.<br>
  <br>
  Ochoa holds honorary degrees of the Universities of St. Louis (Washington
  University), Glasgow, Oxford, Salamanca, Brazil, and the Wesleyan
  University. He is Honorary Professor of the University of San
  Marcos, Lima, Peru. He was awarded the Neuberg Medal in
  Biochemistry in 1951, the Medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de
  Chimie Biologique in 1959, and the Medal of New York University
  in the same year. He is a member of several learned societies in
  the U.S.A., Germany, Japan, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, and
  President of the International Union of Biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In 1931 Ochoa married Carmen Garcia Cobian.</p>
