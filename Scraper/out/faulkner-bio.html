  <h1>William Faulkner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="faulkner.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>William Faulkner</b> (1897-1962), who
  came from an old southern family, grew up in Oxford, Mississippi.
  He joined the Canadian, and later the British,
  Royal Air Force during the First World War, studied for a
  while at the
  University of Mississippi, and temporarily worked for a New
  York bookstore and a New Orleans newspaper. Except for some trips
  to Europe and Asia, and a few brief stays in Hollywood as a
  scriptwriter, he worked on his novels and short stories on a farm
  in Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  In an attempt to create a saga of his own, Faulkner has invented
  a host of characters typical of the historical growth and
  subsequent decadence of the South. The human drama in Faulkner's
  novels is then built on the model of the actual, historical drama
  extending over almost a century and a half Each story and each
  novel contributes to the construction of a whole, which is the
  imaginary Yoknapatawpha County and its inhabitants. Their theme
  is the decay of the old South, as represented by the Sartoris and
  Compson families, and the emergence of ruthless and brash
  newcomers, the Snopeses. Theme and technique - the distortion of
  time through the use of the inner monologue are fused
  particularly successfully in <i>The Sound and the Fury</i>
  (1929), the downfall of the Compson family seen through the minds
  of several characters. The novel <i>Sanctuary</i> (1931) is about
  the degeneration of Temple Drake, a young girl from a
  distinguished southern family. Its sequel, <i>Requiem For A
  Nun</i> (1951), written partly as a drama, centered on the
  courtroom trial of a Negro woman who had once been a party to
  Temple Drake's debauchery. In <i>Light in August</i> (1932),
  prejudice is shown to be most destructive when it is
  internalized, as in Joe Christmas, who believes, though there is
  no proof of it, that one of his parents was a Negro. The theme of
  racial prejudice is brought up again in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>
  (1936), in which a young man is rejected by his father and
  brother because of his mixed blood. Faulkner's most outspoken
  moral evaluation of the relationship and the problems between
  Negroes and whites is to be found in <i>Intruder In the Dust</i>
  (1948).<br>
  <br>
  In 1940, Faulkner published the first volume of the Snopes
  trilogy, <i>The Hamlet</i>, to be followed by two volumes, <i>The
  Town</i> (1957) and <i>The Mansion</i> (1959), all of them
  tracing the rise of the insidious Snopes family to positions of
  power and wealth in the community. <i>The reivers</i>, his last -
  and most humorous - work, with great many similarities to Mark
  Twain's <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, appeared in 1962, the year of
  Faulkner's death.</p>
