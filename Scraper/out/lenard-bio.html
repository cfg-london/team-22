  <h1>Philipp Lenard - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lenard.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Philipp von Lenard</b> was born at
  Pozsony<a href="#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (Pressburg) in
  Austria-Hungary on June 7, 1862. His family had originally come
  from the Tyrol. He studied physics successively at Budapest,
  Vienna, Berlin and Heidelberg under Bunsen, Helmholtz,
  K&ouml;nigsberger and Quincke and in 1886 took his Ph.D. at
  Heidelberg.<br>
  <br>
              From 1892 he worked as a Privatdozent and assistant to Professor 
              Hertz at the University of Bonn and in 1894 
              was appointed Professor Extraordinary at the University of Breslau. 
              In 1895 he became Professor of Physics at Aix-la-Chapelle and in 1896 Professor of Theoretical Physics at 
              the University of Heidelberg. In 1898 he was appointed Professor Ordinarius 
              at the University of Kiel.<br>
  <br>
  Lenard's first work was done in the field of mechanics, when he
  published a paper on the oscillation of precipitated water drops
  and allied problems and in 1894 he published the <i>Principles of
  Mechanics</i> left behind by Hertz.<br>
  <br>
  Soon he became interested in the phenomena of phosphorescence and
  luminescence. This was a development of the mysterious attraction
  which weak light appearing in darkness had had for him since his
  boyhood, when he had, with his school fellows, warmed fluorine
  crystals to make them luminescent; and now he took up, with the
  astronomer W. Wolf, the study of the luminosity of pyrogallic
  acid when it is mixed with alkali and bisulphite for developing
  photographs. He found that its luminosity depended on the
  oxidation of the pyrogallic acid. At this time he also carried
  out studies of magnetism with bismuth and, in collaboration with
  V. Klatt, who had been his first teacher of physics in his native
  town, he studied, at the Modern College at Pressburg, the
  so-called self-luminous substances such as calcium sulphide on
  which Klatt had been working for some years. Together they found
  that calcium sulphide, after previous illumination, exerts light
  in the dark, but only if it contains at least some traces of
  heavy metals, such as copper and bismuth, which form crystals on
  which the colour and the intensity and durations of the
  luminosity depend; if it is quite pure, it is not luminous. This
  work with Klatt was the beginning of work in a field which
  occupied Lenard for the next 18 years.<br>
  <br>
  In 1888, when he was working at Heidelberg under Quincke, Lenard
  had done his first work with cathode rays. He investigated the
  view then held by Hertz that these rays were analogous to
  ultraviolet light and he did an experiment to find out whether
  cathode rays would, like ultraviolet light, pass through a quartz
  window in the wall of a discharge tube. He found that they would
  not do this; but later, in 1892, when he was working as an
  assistant to Hertz at the University of Bonn, Hertz called him to
  see the discovery he had made that a piece of uranium glass
  covered with aluminium foil and put inside the discharge tube
  became luminous beneath the aluminium foil when the cathode rays
  struck it. Hertz then suggested that it would be possible to
  separate, by means of a thin plate of aluminium, two spaces, one
  in which the cathode rays were produced in the ordinary way and
  the other in which one could observe them in a pure state, which
  had never been done. Hertz was too busy to do this and gave
  Lenard permission to do it and it was then that he made the great
  discovery of the "Lenard window".<br>
  <br>
  After many experiments with aluminium foil of various thicknesses
  he was able to publish, in 1894, his great discovery that the
  plate of quartz that had, until then, been used to close the
  discharge tube, could be replaced by a thin plate of aluminium
  foil just thick enough to maintain the vacuum inside the tube,
  but yet thin enough to allow the cathode rays to pass out. It
  thus became possible to study the cathode rays, and also the
  fluorescence they caused, outside the discharge tube and Lenard
  concluded from the experiments that he then did that the cathode
  rays were propagated through the air for distances of the order
  of a decimetre and that they travel in a vacuum for several
  metres without being weakened. Although Lenard at first followed
  Hertz in believing that the cathode rays were propagated in the
  ether, he later abandoned this view as a result of the work of
  <a href="../1926/index.html">Jean Perrin</a> in 1895, <a href=
  "../1906/index.html">Sir J.J. Thomson</a> in 1897 and <a href=
  "../1911/index.html">W. Wien</a> in 1897, which proved the
  corpuscular nature of the cathode rays.<br>
  <br>
  Later Lenard extended the work of Hertz on the photoelectric
  effect. Working in a high vacuum, he analysed the nature of this
  effect, showing that when ultraviolet light falls on a metal it
  takes from the metal electrons which are then propagated in the
  vacuum, in which they can be accelerated or retarded by an
  electric field, or their paths can be curved by a magnetic field.
  By exact measurements he showed that the number of electrons
  projected is proportional to the energy carried by the incident
  light, whilst their speed, that is to say, their kinetic energy,
  is quite independent of this number and varies only with the
  wavelength and increases when this diminishes.<br>
  <br>
  These facts conflicted with current theory and were not explained
  until 1905, when <a href="../1921/index.html">Einstein</a>
  produced his quantitative law and developed the theory of quanta
  of light or photons, which was verified much later by <a href=
  "../1923/index.html">Millikan</a>. But Lenard never forgave
  Einstein for discovering and attaching his own name to this
  law.<br>
  <br>
  In the course of his work Lenard had, for the purpose of
  accelerating the speed of the electrons and measuring their
  energy, invented a photoelectric cell which was the first model
  of the "3-electrode lamp" which is so important today in
  radioelectric technique. The only difference between these two
  cells was that in Lenard's cell the electrons were taken from the
  cathode by light, whereas on the "3-electrode lamp" the cathode
  is a white-hot filament capable of sending into the vacuum
  currents of much higher intensity.<br>
  <br>
  In 1902 Lenard showed that an electron must have a certain
  minimum energy before it could produce ionisation when it passed
  through a gas.<br>
  <br>
  In 1903 he published his conception of the atom as an assemblage
  of what he called "dynamides", which were very small and were
  separated by wide spaces; they had mass and were imagined as
  electric dipoles connected by two equal charges of contrary sign
  and their number was equal to the atomic mass. The solid matter
  in the atom was, he thought, about one thousand millionth of the
  whole atom. This work contributed much to <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Lorentz</a>' theory of electrons.<br>
  <br>
  In his later years Lenard studied the nature and origin of the
  lines of the spectrum. Developing the work of Rydberg, Kayser and
  Runge, who had shown that the lines of the spectrum of a metal
  can be arranged in two or more different series and that there is
  a marked mathematical relationship between the wavelengths of
  these series, Lenard showed that in each series a definite
  modification of the atom has occurred and that these
  modifications determine the series and are differentiated by the
  number of electrons lost.<br>
  <br>
  Lenard was an experimentalist of genius, but more doubtful as a
  theorist. Some of his discoveries were great ones and others were
  very important, but he claimed for them more than their true
  value. Although he was given many honours (for instance, he
  received Honorary Doctorates of the Universities of Christiania,
  now Oslo, in
  1911, Dresden in 1922 and Pressburg in 1942, the Franklin
  Medal in 1905, the Eagle Shield of the German Reich in 1933, and
  was elected Freeman of Heidelberg in the same year), he believed
  that he was disregarded and this probably explains why he
  attacked other physicists in many countries. He became a
  convinced member of Hitler's National Socialist Party and
  maintained unreserved adherence to it. The party responded by
  making him the Chief of Aryan or German Physics. Among his
  publications are several books: <i>Ueber Aether und Materie</i>
  (second edition 1911), <i>Quantitatives &uuml;ber
  Kathodenstrahlen</i> (1918), <i>Ueber das
  Relativit&auml;tsprinzip</i> (1918) and <i>Grosse
  Naturforscher</i> (second edition 1930).</p>

  <p>Von Lenard, who was married to Katharina
  Schlehner, died on May 20, 1947 at Messelhausen.</p>
