  <h1>Gustav Hertz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hertz.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Gustav Ludwig Hertz</b> was born in
  Hamburg on July 22nd, 1887, the son of a lawyer, Dr. Gustav
  Hertz, and his wife Auguste, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arning. He attended
  the Johanneum School in Hamburg before commencing his university
  education at G&ouml;ttingen in 1906; he subsequently studied at
  the Universities of Munich and Berlin, graduating in 1911. He was
  appointed Research Assistant at the Physics Institute of Berlin
  University in 1913 but, with the onset of World War I, he was
  mobilized in 1914 and severely wounded in action in 1915. Hertz
  returned to Berlin as Privatdozent in 1917. From 1920 to 1925 he
  worked in the physics laboratory of the Philips Incandescent Lamp
  Factory at Eindhoven.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925, he was elected Resident Professor and Director of the
  Physics Institute of the University of Halle, and in 1928 he returned
  to Berlin as Director of the Physics Institute in the
  Charlottenburg Technological University. Hertz resigned from this
  post for political reasons in 1935 to return to industry as
  director of a research laboratory of the Siemens Company. From
  1945 tot 1954 he worked as the head of a research laboratory in
  the Soviet Union, when he was appointed Professor and Director of
  the Physics Institute at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig. He was made
  emeritus in 1961, and since then he has lived in retirement,
  first in Leipzig and later in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  Hertz's early researches, for his thesis, involved studies on the
  infrared absorption of carbon dioxide in relation to pressure and
  partial pressure. Together with J. Franck he began his studies on
  electron impact in 1913 and before his mobilization, he spent
  much patient work on the study and measurement of ionization
  potentials in various gases. He later demonstrated the
  quantitative relations between the series of spectral lines and
  the energy losses of electrons in collision with atoms
  corresponding to the stationary energy states of the atoms. His
  results were in perfect agreement with <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Bohr's</a> theory of atomic structure, which
  included the application of <a href=
  "../1918/index.html">Planck's</a> quantum theory.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to Berlin in 1928, it was his first task to rebuild
  the Physics Institute and re-establish the School, and he worked
  tirelessly towards this end. There he was responsible for a
  method of separating the isotopes of neon by means of a diffusion
  cascade.<br>
  <br>
  Hertz has published many papers, alone, with Franck, and with
  Kloppers, on the quantitative exchange of energy between
  electrons and atoms, and on the measurement of ionization
  potentials. He also is the author of some papers concerning the
  separation of isotopes.<br>
  <br>
  Gustav Hertz is Member of the German Academy of Sciences in
  Berlin, and Corresponding Member of the G&ouml;ttingen Academy of
  Sciences; he is also Honorary Member of the Hungarian Academy of
  Sciences, Member of the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences, and
  Foreign Member of the Academy of Sciences U.S.S.R. He is
  recipient of the Max Planck Medal of the German Physical
  Society.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Hertz was married in 1919, with Ellen <i>n&eacute;e</i>
  Dihlmann, who died in 1941. They had two sons, both physicists:
  Dr. Hellmuth Hertz, Professor at the Technical College in Lund,
  and Dr. Johannes Hertz, working at the Institute for Optics and
  Spectroscopy of the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1943, Professor Hertz is married with Charlotte,
  <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jollasse.</p>
