  <h1>Pablo Neruda - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="neruda.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Pablo Neruda</b> (1904-1973), whose real
  name is Neftal&iacute; Ricardo Reyes Basoalto, was born on 12 July,
  1904, in the town of Parral in Chile. His father was a railway
  employee and his mother, who died shortly after his birth, a
  teacher. Some years later his father, who had then moved to the
  town of Temuco, remarried do&ntilde;a Trinidad Candia Malverde. The
  poet spent his childhood and youth in Temuco, where he also got
  to know <a href="../1945/index.html">Gabriela Mistral</a>, head
  of the girls' secondary school, who took a liking to him. At the
  early age of thirteen he began to contribute some articles to the
  daily "La Ma&ntilde;ana", among them, <i>Entusiasmo y
  Perseverancia</i> - his first publication - and his first poem.
  In 1920, he became a contributor to the literary journal "Selva
  Austral" under the pen name of Pablo Neruda, which he adopted in
  memory of the Czechoslovak poet Jan Neruda (1834-1891). Some of
  the poems Neruda wrote at that time are to be found in his first
  published book: <i>Crepusculario</i> (1923). The following year
  saw the publication of <i>Veinte poemas de amor y una cancion
  desesperada</i>, one of his best-known and most translated works.
  Alongside his literary activities, Neruda studied French and
  pedagogy at the University of Chile in Santiago.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1927 and 1935, the government put him in charge of a
  number of honorary consulships, which took him to Burma, Ceylon,
  Java, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Madrid. His poetic
  production during that difficult period included, among other
  works, the collection of esoteric surrealistic poems,
  <i>Residencia en la tierra</i> (1933), which marked his literary
  breakthrough.<br>
  <br>
  The Spanish Civil War and the murder of
  Garc&iacute;a Lorca, whom Neruda knew, affected him strongly and
  made him join the Republican movement, first in Spain, and later
  in France, where he started working on his collection of poems
  <i>Espa&ntilde;a en el Coraz&oacute;n</i> (1937). The same year he
  returned to his native country, to which he had been recalled,
  and his poetry during the following period was characterised by
  an orientation towards political and social matters.
  <i>Espa&ntilde;a en el Coraz&oacute;n</i> had a great impact by
  virtue of its being printed in the middle of the front during the
  civil war.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939, Neruda was appointed consul for the Spanish emigration,
  residing in Paris, and, shortly afterwards, Consul General in
  Mexico, where he rewrote his <i>Canto General de Chile</i>,
  transforming it into an epic poem about the whole South American
  continent, its nature, its people and its historical destiny.
  This work, entitled <i>Canto General</i>, was published in Mexico
  1950, and also underground in Chile. It consists of approximately
  250 poems brought together into fifteen literary cycles and
  constitutes the central part of Neruda's production. Shortly
  after its publication, <i>Canto General</i> was translated into
  some ten languages. Nearly all these poems were created in a
  difficult situation, when Neruda was living abroad.<br>
  <br>
  In 1943, Neruda returned to Chile, and in 1945 he was elected
  senator of the Republic, also joining the Communist Party of
  Chile. Due to his protests against President Gonz&aacute;lez
  Videla's repressive policy against striking miners in 1947, he
  had to live underground in his own country for two years until he
  managed to leave in 1949. After living in different European
  countries he returned home in 1952. A great deal of what he
  published during that period bears the stamp of his political
  activities; one example is <i>Las Uvas y el Viento</i> (1954),
  which can be regarded as the diary of Neruda's exile. In <i>Odas
  elementales</i> (1954- 1959) his message is expanded into a more
  extensive description of the world, where the objects of the
  hymns - things, events and relations - are duly presented in
  alphabetic form.<br>
  <br>
  Neruda's production is exceptionally extensive. For example, his
  <i>Obras Completas</i>, constantly republished, comprised 459
  pages in 1951; in 1962 the number of pages was 1,925, and in 1968
  it amounted to 3,237, in two volumes. Among his works of the last
  few years can be mentioned <i>Cien sonetos de amor</i> (1959),
  which includes poems dedicated to his wife Matilde Urrutia,
  <i>Memorial de Isla Negra</i>, a poetic work of an autobiographic
  character in five volumes, published on the occasion of his
  sixtieth birthday, <i>Arte de paj&aacute;ros</i> (1966), <i>La
  Barcarola</i> (1967), the play <i>Fulgor y muerte de Joaqu&iacute;n
  Murieta</i> (1967), <i>Las manos del d&iacute;a</i> (1968), <i>Fin
  del mundo</i> (1969), <i>Las piedras del cielo</i> (1970), and
  <i>La espada encendida</i>.</p>
