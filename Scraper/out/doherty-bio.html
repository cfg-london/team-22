  <h1>Peter C. Doherty - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="doherty.jpg" class="bio-img">My childhood was spent on the outskirts of
  the sub-tropical city of Brisbane. I have a younger brother, Ian,
  and we grew up as part of a traditional, extended family that was
  very much influenced by the values of our two grandmothers. The
  one was a devout Methodist, the other a lapsed Quaker who was
  born in England and embraced the informal Australian life style
  with great enthusiasm. My parents (Linda and Eric) were first and
  second generation Australians, the various elements of the family
  coming from County Louth (in the 1840's), Lancashire and Essex.
  Eric Doherty, a clever and entertaining man, trained initially as
  a telephone mechanic and was an administrator involved in the
  planning of telephone services. His mother had been left in
  straitened financial circumstances when my grandfather succumbed
  to pneumonia during the 1919 influenza epidemic. My father
  communicated his frustration at not having received an adequate
  formal education and, with his strong encouragement, the desire
  to learn and understand became the major focus of my life. Linda
  Byford was a piano teacher who, with her two brothers, spent much
  of her youth on the tennis court. After marriage she cared for
  her family, played Chopin, Debussy, and Beethoven and grew roses.
  She gave me an appreciation, and emotional need for, classical
  music, but did not pass on the genes for tennis. The Byfords were
  devastated by the death of the eldest son, who was captured at
  the fall of Singapore and lost in a Japanese transport torpedoed
  by an American submarine. I remember my other Byford uncle
  shivering with recurrent malaria that he contracted during the
  fighting in New Guinea. I share Alfred Nobel's conviction that
  war is the greatest of all human disasters. Infectious disease
  runs a good second.<br>
  <br>
  My Irish genetic heritage gave me a very fair skin, making me
  totally unsuited for life in a city that is known as the melanoma
  capital of the world. This limited my participation in the
  outdoor-oriented Australian way of life, and caused me to spend a
  great deal of time reading anything and everything. Even so, the
  Australian landscape was at our back door, there were adventures
  with home made canoes, I played tennis and Australian Rules
  football, and the extended family went to the beach for at least
  three weeks each year. The two things that I miss most when
  living out of Australia are the bush and the Pacific coast,
  especially fishing in the surf at night! My father had a workshop
  and I learned to be a carpenter, a skill that has resulted in the
  manufacture of some very substantial coffee tables and a fair
  amount of time working on houses. My most ambitious project as a
  teenager was the construction of a photographic enlarger and
  darkroom, but all the photographs that I took at that time seem
  to have been lost after my father's early death (in 1961) and the
  selling of the family house.<br>
  <br>
  I went to the local public schools and Methodist church. The
  commute to the high school involved daily trips on a steam train.
  I played basketball, and was a sergeant in the army cadet corps.
  Physics and chemistry came easily, but my natural inclinations
  were towards literature and history. Growing up without much
  money, however, also left me with the conviction that I needed to
  get some sort of reasonable job. An older cousin, Ralph Doherty
  was a brilliant scholar who was in the process of establishing
  himself as a leading viral epidemiologist. What he was doing
  seemed fascinating, but my contacts with the local general
  practitioners left me with no great enthusiasm for the idea of
  following his path to medical school. A visit to an "open day" at
  the University Veterinary School was my first real contact with
  biology in the formal sense: the subject could only be studied by
  girls in the Queensland public schools of that era. Another major
  influence at the time of my matriculation, was that I was reading
  Aldous Huxley, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1964/index.html">Jean Paul Sartre</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html">Ernest
  Hemingway</a> simultaneously. I decided to be the man of action
  rather than the philosopher, and resolved to graduate in
  veterinary science and pursue a research career. At this stage I
  was just 17 years old, and would probably have made a very
  different decision if I had been more mature.<br>
  <br>
  The then vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland pursued
  a policy of open admission, from the conviction that
  matriculation results bore little relationship to later academic
  performance. As a consequence, the veterinary school had a number
  of mature students who had worked in the bush, while more than
  50% (mostly school leavers) did not make it past the examinations
  at the end of the first year. This was one of two veterinary
  schools in Australia, and the survivors were joined by a spectrum
  of students from other states, New Zealand and south-east Asia
  (under the Colombo plan) at the beginning of year two of the five
  year program. Being exposed in this milieu, together with
  spending the long vacations employed on sheep and cattle
  properties and seeing practice with rural veterinarians, caused
  me to grow up quickly. I soon discovered that I had little
  interest in small animal medicine or surgery, but retain a sense
  of nostalgia for the satisfaction and physical challenge of
  working with large domestic animals.<br>
  <br>
  The veterinary school was staffed by a fairly young group of
  teachers, many of whom had strong research backgrounds. Courses
  in the physical sciences, zoology, botany and biochemistry were
  taught from the science faculty, and physiology in the medical
  school. I was introduced to the principles of ecology in first
  year zoology, with the commitment of my professor to marine
  biology almost causing me to switch to that discipline.
  Infectious disease was taught by John Francis, who communicated
  great enthusiasm for research, and immunology by the
  parasitologist, J. F. A. Sprent. Another course that influenced
  me strongly was population genetics given by Glenorchy MacBride.
  I also read F. M. Burnet and R. M. Stanley's books on viruses,
  some of Burnet's writings on immunology and cancer and wrote a
  final year thesis on the UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma
  (cancer eye) of Hereford cattle. Burnet's teleological Darwinism,
  the idea that the body is a set of ecosystems and the realisation
  that good science involves quantitation have stayed with me from
  those early days.<br>
  <br>
  When I graduated, I was contracted (under the terms of a "bonded"
  scholarship) to work for several years in the Queensland
  Department of Agriculture and Stock. I expressed enthusiasm for
  laboratory-based research, so the Department immediately sent me
  to the country as a rural veterinary officer. I spent some months
  driving large distances to post-mortem cattle and pigs that had
  died of unknown causes, and to survey cattle for various venereal
  diseases. This resulted in the diagnosis of Trichomoniasis in an
  area where it was thought that complete eradication had been
  achieved. Realizing that I was a danger to their regulatory
  effort, the Department quickly brought me back to the state
  veterinary laboratory, the Animal Research Institute (ARI),
  Yeerongpilly. My task was to conduct a large-scale,
  externally-funded experiment on the epidemiology of bovine
  leptospirosis. This project involved injecting several cows with
  <i>Leptospira pomona,</i> then watching the spread of the disease
  throughout the herd. I became adept at dark-field microscopic
  analysis of urine for spirochetes, the histology of the bovine
  kidney and the serological test for the organism. This work was
  submitted for a master's thesis and published in local journals.
  I was also involved in the diagnostic veterinary pathology
  service.<br>
  <br>
  The ARI was in the process of establishing a facility for
  diagnostic virology, and had employed a very attractive young
  microbiology graduate, Penny Stephens, to develop the laboratory.
  We married in 1965. Knowing of my interest in virology the ARI
  Director, Les Newton, sent me to Melbourne for six weeks to learn
  basic techniques. I worked with Toby St. George in the
  Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
  (CSIRO) laboratory of Dr. E. L. French, spent time in the
  virology group at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and (en
  route) visited F. J. Fenner's Department of Microbiology at
  the John Curtin
  School of Medical Research (JCSMR), Canberra The latter was
  motivated by the desire to meet C. A. Mims, whose work on viral
  pathogenesis had considerably influenced my thinking about
  disease processes. On returning to Brisbane, I realised fairly
  quickly that I am an experimentalist at heart. A career as a
  diagnostic virologist was not for me!<br>
  <br>
  I tried for a Ph.D. scholarship to work with Cedric Mims, but was
  told to apply again later because he already had a "scholar" and
  would take only one student at a time. At about the same time I
  got to know J. A. Roberts, who had done an excellent series of
  experiments with Mims on the ectromelia model and had recently
  returned from Cornell to a position as a research parasitologist
  in the CSIRO laboratories on the Yeerongpilly site. John Roberts
  told me that he had been very impressed by a visit that he had
  made to the Moredun Research Institute in Edinburgh, where there
  was a major research effort on scrapie, the then enigmatic "slow
  virus" disease. The Moredun also trained graduate students, who
  were affiliated with the University of Edinburgh. The following week a job in
  the Department of Experimental Pathology at the Moredun was
  advertized in <i>Nature.</i> We sailed for Britain in early 1967,
  on a very slow and cheap ship.<br>
  <br>
  The experimental pathology position at the Moredun required that
  I do research and help to run the diagnostic neuropathology
  program that the institute operated for the Scottish Veterinary
  Investigation Service. I learned neuropathology from the head of
  the department, R. M. Barlow, and from Hugh Fraser who was doing
  seminal studies with Alan Dickinson defining the genetics of the
  scrapie mouse model. Dick Barlow also taught me to write clear,
  concise English. My initial intention was to work on sheep
  scrapie, but I quickly realised that this was not a good project
  area for an experimentalist. My abiding interest in infectious
  disease caused me to focus on the tickborne flavivirus,
  louping-ill virus, which was then regarded as problematic because
  of concerns about the safety of the vaccine, first developed at
  the Moredun many years previously. I enroled as a part-time
  graduate student at the University of Edinburgh medical school
  and, after I had been working with the virus for some time,
  developed a collaboration with another young veterinary graduate,
  H.W. Reid. Hugh Reid did the virology and serology aspects of the
  ensuing sheep experiments, while I concentrated on light and
  ultrastructural pathology. Part of Hugh's role was to test my
  blood for the presence of virus and antibody when I injected
  myself in the finger, an inadvertent human experiment that I
  later wrote up for the <i>Lancet.</i><br>
  <br>
  We greatly enjoyed living in Edinburgh. Penny worked with E. C.
  R. Reeve at the Institute for Animal Genetics until the birth of
  our two sons, James and Michael. The Edinburgh Festival and the
  Traverse Theatre were high points and, for the first time in my
  life, I could spend the whole day outside without the penalty of
  sunburn. Our long vacations were used for camping holidays in
  Europe, including our first trip to Scandinavia and Stockholm
  with a young child in the back of a Volkswagen van. I went to
  veterinary research and neuropathology meetings, and we came very
  close to staying permanently in Britain.<br>
  <br>
  Eric French visited the Moredun, and raised the possibility of a
  permanent appointment in the veterinary virology group at the
  CSIRO laboratories in Melbourne. At about this time I heard a
  seminar by Mel Greaves at the Metchnikoff Club, an Edinburgh
  group organized by Spedding Micklem and Angus Stewart, that
  convinced me I had no real understanding of contemporary
  immunology. Cedric Mims also came through and talked about the
  work that he and R.V. Blanden had been doing on T cell responses
  in virus infections. Shortly afterwards a junior academic
  appointment was advertised in the Department of Microbiology at
  the JCSMR, with a job description that seemed to fit me
  reasonably well. Fenner's successor as head of the department, G.
  L. Ada, had actually written it for Bob Blanden, but offered me
  the only other position that he had available, a postdoctoral
  fellowship to work with Cedric Mims. I left my permanent research
  position, and turned down the offer of another, to take this
  opportunity to learn basic immunology. My long-term intention was
  to return to veterinary research. My only formal involvement in
  the veterinary world since then has been to serve (1987-1992) on
  the board of the International Laboratory for Research In Animal
  Diseases, Nairobi, Kenya. This was an enormously broadening
  experience, and I learned a great deal from (in particular) my
  African colleagues.<br>
  <br>
  We moved from Edinburgh to Canberra in December 1971. Cedric Mims
  had by then decided to take the Chair in Microbiology at Guy's
  Hospital Medical School so, though we overlapped by six months or
  so, we did not ever formally work together. At first I studied
  the pathogenesis of Semliki Forest virus infection in the mouse,
  then switched to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)
  model which was a much more powerful tool for immunological
  analysis. I first met <a href="index.html">Rolf Zinkernagel</a>
  when he arrived to work with Bob Blanden in 1973, and Gordon Ada
  (for space reasons) moved him into the laboratory with me. We
  also lived in the same university housing complex, and shared
  rides to the JCSMR with a physicist from Trondheim, a Japanese
  pharmacologist, and a biochemist (Bob Gerdes) who is now working
  at the Karolinska Institute. The story of our scientific
  interaction through that time is told in the accompanying
  articles, and in an account that we wrote jointly some time back
  that is yet to appear in "Immunology Today". We were then (and
  have remained) good friends, though we don't always agree on
  everything.<br>
  <br>
  The basis of the "single T cell receptor altered self" hypothesis
  was fairly much worked out by the time of the Second
  International Immunology Meeting in Brighton, England. I traveled
  through the United States and gave the same talk in about 20
  institutions. Among my hosts were Alan Rosenthal at NIH,
  Bethesda, and David Katz at Harvard. I also met Gene Shearer, who
  had results comparable to ours with haptenated cells. This was
  probably the first time that the immunology establishment became
  fully aware of what we were saying. Our ideas both contradicted
  the accepted North American model for the role of immune response
  genes, and turned the perception of the transplantation system on
  its head. Many people have told me years later that they heard
  this seminar, came away with the sense that the findings were
  significant, but did not fully grasp the import. Evidently some
  were also infuriated by what we were saying. Rolf traveled more
  extensively through Europe, and I also visited a number of
  institutions in England and traveled to Stockholm to speak to
  G&ouml;ran and Erna M&ouml;ller's group at the Wallenberg
  Laboratory in Lilla Frescati.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that we had made a major
  breakthrough, the rigidities imposed by the excessive use of
  tenured contracts through the earlier years at the JCSMR had made
  any prospects of long-term appointments there fairly remote. Rolf
  accepted a faculty position at the Scripps Institute, and Hilary
  Koprowski called on my 34th birthday to offer me an Associate
  Professorship at the Wistar Institute. I had visited Hilary, who was
  a good friend of Cedric Mims, during my publicity tour en route
  to Brighton earlier that year. We moved to Philadelphia in 1975,
  and I quickly became involved with the outstanding Immunology
  Graduate Group headed by Darcy Wilson and Norman Klinman at the
  University of
  Pennsylvania. The Wistar/Penn axis was a highly interactive,
  and very open, intellectual environment. I collaborated
  extensively with Walter Gerhard on the influenza model, did some
  experiments with the late Tad Wiktor in Hilary Koprowski's rabies
  program and was part of a large, campus-wide multiple sclerosis
  research effort. I talked a lot with John Sprent, the son of my
  parasitology professor in Brisbane, who taught me how to do lymph
  duct cannulation in mice. Penny went back to school, and
  developed a new career in the area of drug information. I wrote
  grants, was a member of the immunology circuit, worked with
  outstanding graduate students and became an established scientist
  and academic.<br>
  <br>
  My self confidence was such that I made the major mistake of
  accepting an offer to return to the JCSMR as Head of the
  Department of Experimental Pathology, intending to build a vital
  program comparable to that Gordon Ada had been able to create in
  the early 1970's. However, the era that this was possible had
  passed, and my decision was made on emotional grounds rather than
  on the basis of what was actually being offered. The less said
  about this time (1982-1988) the better, as I am still trying to
  get the overall experience in perspective. The most positive
  aspect was my interactions with some excellent colleagues,
  particularly Jane Allan and Rhodri Ceredig. With the passage of
  the years, the retirement of many of the tenured staff, the
  adoption of a more flexible appointment structure, and the return
  from Denver of Kevin Lafferty as Director, things at the JCSMR
  are now greatly improved. At the stage that I was there the
  situation looked hopeless. I decided to move back to a scientific
  world that I knew I could handle.<br>
  <br>
  The opportunity to rebuild my research career came with the
  resources offered to me by J. V. Simone, then the Director of
  St. Jude
  Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). I had first visited
  SJCRH during my swing through the USA in 1974. At that stage it
  was still a small institution, with a strong virology department
  headed by Alan Granoff. My contact was via Rob Webster, who had
  trained with Stephen Fazekas de St. Groth in Frank Fenner's
  program at the JCSMR and remains a close colleague of the JCSMR
  virologist, Graeme Laver. Alan and Rob engineered my move to
  Memphis, and Rob has been an outstanding friend and collaborator.
  This is a superb, open, research environment, that is extremely
  well funded. The two problems are that there is too much
  sunshine, and that we are too far from the Pacific Ocean. Such is
  life!<br>
  <br>
  My characteristics as a scientist stem from a non-conformist
  upbringing, a sense of being something of an outsider, and
  looking for different perceptions in everything from novels, to
  art to experimental results. I like complexity, and am delighted
  by the unexpected. Ideas interest me. I was influened early on by
  reading Arthur Koestler and Edward de Bono, and more recently by
  the writings of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. My research career
  has been highly unconventional, and I have not been a full-time
  student in the academic sense since I was 22 years old. I have
  never had a powerful mentor who saw me as the product (or
  continuation) of his program, a situation that probably helped to
  determine the outcome of my two attempts to return to Australia.
  Intellectually, I march to the beat of my own drum and have
  little interest in competing in "races". There are too few people
  working in the area of viral pathogenesis and immunity, too
  little funding, too many problems and too little time.</p>
