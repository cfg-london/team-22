  <h1>Shimon Peres - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesties,<br>
  Members of the Nobel Committee,<br>
  Prime Minister Brundtland,<br>
  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,<br>
  Chairman Arafat,<br>
  Members of the Norwegian Government,<br>
  Distinguished Guests,<br>
  <br>
  I thank the Nobel Prize Committee for its decision to name me
  among the laureates of the Peace Prize this year.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to be receiving this Prize
  together with <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Yitzhak
  Rabin</a>, with whom I have labored for long years for the
  defence of our country and with whom I now labor together in the
  cause of peace in our region.</p>

  <p>I believe it is fitting that the Prize has
  been awarded to <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/index.html">Yasser
  Arafat</a>. His abandonment of the path of confrontation in favor
  of the path of dialogue, has opened the way to peace between
  ourselves and the Palestinian people.</p>

  <p>We are leaving behind us the era of
  belligerency and are striding together toward peace. It all began
  here in Oslo under the wise auspices and goodwill of the
  Norwegian people.</p>

  <p>From my earliest youth, I have known that
  while one is obliged to plan with care the stages of one's
  journey, one is entitled to dream, and keep dreaming, of its
  destination. A man may feel as old as his years, yet as young as
  his dreams. The laws of biology do not apply to sanguine
  aspiration.</p>

  <p>I was born in a small Jewish town in White
  Russia. Nothing Jewish now remains of it. From my youngest
  childhood I related to my place of birth as a mere way station.
  My family's dream, and my own, was to live in Israel, and our
  eventual voyage to the port of Jaffa was like making a dream come
  true. Had it not been for this dream and this voyage, I would
  probably have perished in the flames, as did so many of my
  people, among them most of my own family.</p>

  <p>I went to school at an agricultural youth
  village in the heart of Israel. The village and its fields were
  enclosed by barbed wire which separated their greenness from the
  bleakness of the enmity all around. In the morning, we would go
  out to the fields with scythes on our backs to harvest the crop.
  In the evening, we went out with rifles on our shoulders to
  defend our village. On Sabbaths we would go out to visit our Arab
  neighbors. On Sabbaths, we would talk with them of peace, though
  the rest of the week we traded rifle fire across the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>From the Ben Shemen youth village, my
  comrades and I went to Kibbutz Alumot in the Lower Galilee. We
  had no houses, no electricity, no running water. But we had
  magnificent views and a lofty dream: to build a new, egalitarian
  society that would ennoble each of its members.</p>

  <p>Not all of it came true, but not all of it
  went to waste. The part that came true created a new landscape.
  The part that did not come true resides in our hearts.</p>

  <p>For two decades, at the Ministry of
  Defence, I was privileged to work closely with a man who was and
  remains, to my mind, the greatest Jew of our time. From him I
  learned that the vision of the future should shape the agenda for
  the present; that one can overcome obstacles by dint of faith;
  that one may feel disappointment - but never despair. And above
  all, I learned that the wisest consideration is the moral one.
  David Ben-Gurion has passed away, yet his vision continues to
  flourish: to be a singular people, to live at peace with our
  neighbors.</p>

  <p>The wars we fought were forced upon us.
  Thanks to the Israel Defence Forces, we won them all, but we did
  not win the greatest victory that we aspired to: release from the
  need to win victories.</p>

  <p>We proved that the aggressors do not
  necessarily emerge as the victors, but we learned that the
  victors do not necessarily win peace.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that war, as a means of
  conducting human affairs, is in its death throes and that the
  time has come to bury it.</p>

  <p>The sword, as the Bible teaches us,
  consumes flesh but it cannot provide sustenance. It is not rifles
  but people who triumph, and the conclusion from all the wars is
  that we need better people, not better rifles - to win wars, and
  mainly to avoid them.</p>

  <p>There was a time when war was fought for
  lack of choice. Today it is peace that is the "no-choice" option.
  The reasons of this are profound and incontrovertible. The
  sources of material wealth and political power have changed. No
  longer are they determined by the size of territory obtained by
  war. Today they are a consequence of intellectual potential,
  obtained principally by education.</p>

  <p>Israel, essentially a desert country, has
  achieved remarkable agricultural yields by applying science to
  its fields, without expanding its territory or its water
  resources.</p>

  <p>Science must be learned; it cannot be
  conquered. An army that can occupy knowledge has yet to be built.
  And that is why armies of occupation are a thing of the past.
  Indeed, even for defensive purposes, a country cannot rely on its
  army alone. Territorial frontiers are no obstacle to ballistic
  missiles, and no weapon can shield from a nuclear device. Today,
  therefore the battle for survival must be based on political
  wisdom and moral vision no less than on military might.</p>

  <p>Science, technology, and information are -
  for better or worse - universal. They are universally available.
  Their availability is not contingent on the color of skin or the
  place of birth. Past distinctions between West and East, North
  and South, have lost their importance in the face of a new
  distinction: between those who move ahead in pace with the new
  opportunities and those who lag behind.</p>

  <p>Countries used to divide the world into
  their friends and foes. No longer. The foes now are universal -
  poverty, famine, religious radicalization, desertification,
  drugs, profileration of nuclear weapons, ecological devastation.
  They threaten all nations, just as science and information are
  the potential friends of all nations.</p>

  <p>Classical diplomacy and strategy were aimed
  at identifying enemies and confronting them. Now they have to
  identify dangers, global or local, and tackle them before they
  become disasters.</p>

  <p>As we part a world of enemies, we enter a
  world of dangers. And if future wars break out, they will
  probably be wars of protest, of the weak against the strong, and
  not wars of occupation, of the strong against the weak.</p>

  <p>The Middle East must never lose pride in
  having been the cradle of civilization. But though living in the
  cradle, we cannot remain infants forever.</p>

  <p>Today as in my youth, I carry dreams. I
  would mention two: the future of the Jewish people and the future
  of the Middle East.</p>

  <p>In history, Judaism has been far more
  successful than the Jews themselves. The Jewish people remained
  small but the spirit of Jerusalem went from strength to strength.
  The Bible is to be found in hundreds of millions of homes. The
  moral majesty of the Book of Books has been undefeated by the
  vicissitudes of history.</p>

  <p>Moreover, time and again, history has
  succumbed to the Bible's immortal ideas. The message that the
  one, invisible God created Man in His image, and hence there are
  no higher and lower orders of man, has fused with the realization
  that morality is the highest form of wisdom and, perhaps, of
  beauty and courage too.</p>

  <p>Slings, arrows and gas chambers can
  annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and
  freedom.</p>

  <p>Jewish history presents an encouraging
  lesson for mankind. For nearly four thousand years, a small
  nation carried a great message. Initially, the nation dwelt in
  its own land; later, it wandered in exile. This small nation swam
  against the tide and was repeatedly persecuted, banished, and
  down-trodden. There is no other example in all of history,
  neither among the great empires nor among their colonies and
  dependencies - of a nation, after so long a saga of tragedy and
  misfortune, rising up again, shaking itself free, gathering
  together its dispersed remnants, and setting out anew on its
  national adventure. Defeating doubters within and enemies
  without. Reviving its land and its language. Rebuilding its
  identity, and reaching toward new heights of distinction and
  excellence.</p>

  <p>The message of the Jewish people to mankind
  is that faith and moral vision can triumph over all
  adversity.</p>

  <p>The conflicts shaping up as our century
  nears its close will be over the content of civilizations, not
  over territory. Jewish culture has lived over many centuries; now
  it has taken root again on its own soil. For the first time in
  our history, some five million people speak Hebrew as their
  native language. That is both a lot and a little: a lot, because
  there have never been so many Hebrew speakers; but a little,
  because a culture based on five million people can hardly
  withstand the pervasive, corrosive effect of the global
  television culture.</p>

  <p>In the five decades of Israel's existence,
  our efforts have focused on reestablishing our territorial
  center. In the future, we shall have to devote our main effort to
  strengthen our spiritual center. Judaism - or Jewishness - is a
  fusion of belief, history, land, and language. Being Jewish means
  belonging to a people that is both unique and universal. My
  greatest hope is that our children, like our forefathers, will
  not make do with the transient and the sham, but will continue to
  plow the historical Jewish furrow in the field of the human
  spirit; that Israel will become the center of our heritage, not
  merely a homeland for our people; that the Jewish people will be
  inspired by others but at the same be to them a source of
  inspiration.</p>

  <p>In the Middle East most adults are
  impoverished and wretched. A new scale of priorities is needed,
  with weapons on the bottom rung and a regional market economy at
  the top. Most inhabitants of the region - more than sixty percent
  - are under the age of eighteen. A new future can be offered to
  them. Israel has computerized its education and has achieved
  excellent results. Education can be computerized throughout the
  Middle East, allowing young people to progress not just from
  grade to grade, but from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>Israel's role in the Middle East should be
  to contribute to a great, sustained regional revival. A Middle
  East without wars, without enemies, without ballistic missiles,
  without nuclear warheads.</p>

  <p>A Middle East in which men, goods and
  services can move freely without the need for customs clearance
  and police licenses.</p>

  <p>A Middle East in which every believer will
  be free to pray in his own language - Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, or
  whatever language he chooses - and in which the prayers will
  reach their destination without censorship, without interference,
  and without offending anyone.</p>

  <p>A Middle East in which nations strive for
  economic equality and encourage cultural pluralism.</p>

  <p>A Middle East where every young woman and
  man can attain university education.</p>

  <p>A Middle East where living standards are in
  no way inferior to those in the world's most advanced
  countries.</p>

  <p>A Middle East where waters flow to slake
  thirst, to make crops grow and deserts bloom, in which no hostile
  borders bring death, hunger, and despair.</p>

  <p>A Middle East of competition, not of
  domination. A Middle East in which men are each other's hosts,
  not hostages.</p>

  <p>A Middle East that is not a killing field
  but a field of creativity and growth.</p>

  <p>A Middle East that honors its history so
  deeply that it strives to add to it new noble chapters.</p>

  <p>A Middle East which will serve as a
  spiritual and cultural focal point for the entire world.</p>

  <p>While thanking for the Prize, I remain
  committed to the process. We have reached the age where dialogue
  is the only option for our world.</p>
