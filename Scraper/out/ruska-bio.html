  <h1>Ernst Ruska - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ruska.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on 25 December 1906 in
  Heidelberg as the fifth of seven children of Professor Julius
  Ruska and his wife Elisbeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Merx). After
  graduating from grammar school in Heidelberg I studied
  electronics at the Technical College in Munich, studies which I
  began in the autumn of 1925 and continued two years later in
  Berlin. I received my practical training from Brown-Boveri &amp;
  Co in Mannheim and Siemens &amp; Halske Ltd in Berlin. Whilst
  still a student at the Technical College in Berlin I began my
  involvement with high voltage and vacuum technology at the
  Institute of High Voltage, whose director was Professor Adolf
  Matthias. Under the direct tutelage of Dr Max Knoll and together
  with other doctoral students I worked on the development of a
  high performance cathode ray oscilloscope. On the one hand my
  interest lay principally in the development of materials for the
  building of vacuum instruments according to the principles of
  construction; on the other it lay in continuing theoretical
  lectures and practical experiments in the optical behaviour of
  electron rays.<br>
  <br>
  My first completed scientific work (1928-9) was concerned with
  the mathematical and experimental proof of Busch's theory of the
  effect of the magnetic field of a coil of wire through which an
  electric current is passed and which is then used as an electron
  lens. During the course of this work I recognised that the focal
  length of the waves could be shortened by use of an iron cap.
  From this discovery the polschuh lens was developed, a lens which
  has been used since then in all magnetic high-resolution electron
  microscopes. Further work, conducted together with Dr Knoll, led
  to the first construction of an electron microscope in 1931. With
  this instrument two of the most important processes for image
  reproduction were introduced-the principles of emission and
  radiation. In 1933 I was able to put into use an electron
  microscope, built by myself, that for the first time gave better
  definition than a light microscope. In my Doctoral thesis of 1934
  and for my university teaching thesis (1944), both at the
  Technical College in Berlin, I investigated the properties of
  electron lenses with short focal lengths.<br>
  <br>
  Since the further technical development of electron microscopes
  could not be the task of a college institute - whose resources
  would have been far overstretched - I went to work in industry in
  the field of electron optics. From 1933 to 1937 I was with
  Fernseh Ltd in Berlin-Zehlendorf and was responsible for the
  development of television receivers and transmitters, as well as
  photoelectric cells with secondary amplification. Convinced of
  the great practical importance of electron microscopy for pure
  and applied research I attempted during this time to continue the
  development of high-resolution electron microscopes with larger
  materials, this time working with Dr Bodo von Borries. This work
  was made possible in 1936-7 by Siemens &amp; Halske. In
  Berlin-Spandau in 1937 we set up the Laboratory for Electron
  Optics and developed there until 1939 the first customised
  electron microscopes (the 'Siemens Super Microscope'). Parallel
  to the development of this instrument my brother, Dr Med. Helmut
  Ruska, and his colleagues worked on its application, particularly
  in the medical and biological fields. In order to promote its
  usage in different scientific areas as quickly as possible we
  suggested to Siemens that they set up a visiting institute for
  research work to be carried out using electron microscopy. This
  institute was founded in 1940. From this institute, in which we
  worked together with both German and foreign scientists, around
  200 scientific papers were published before the end of 1944. My
  task consisted in the development and production of the electron
  microscope, such that by the beginning of 1945 around 35
  institutions were equipped with one.<br>
  <br>
  In the years following 1945 I, together with a majority of new
  colleagues, reconstituted the Institute of Electron Optics in
  Berlin-Siemensstadt, which had been disbanded due to bombing, so
  that by 1949 electron microscopes were again being built. This
  new period of development led in 1954 to 'Elmiskop 1', which
  since then has been used in over 1200 institutions the world
  over. At the same time I sought the further physical development
  of the electron microscope by working at other scientific
  institutions. Thus from August 1947 to December 1948 I worked at
  the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Buch in the Faculty of
  Medicine and Biology, then from January 1949 as Head of
  Department at what is today the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max
  Planck Society in Berlin-Dahlem. Here on 27 June 1957 I was made
  Director of the Institute for Electron Microscopy, after I had
  given up my position with Siemens in 1955. I retired on 31
  December 1974.<br>
  <br>
  From 1949 until 1971 I held lectures on the basic principles of
  electron optics and electron microscopy at both the Free
  University and the Technical University of Berlin. My
  publications in the area of electron optics and electron
  microscopy include several contributions to books and over 100
  original scientific papers.</p>
