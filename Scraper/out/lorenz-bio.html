  <h1>Konrad Lorenz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lorenz.jpg" class="bio-img">I consider early childhood events as most
  essential to a man's scientific and philosophical development. I
  grew up in the large house and the larger garden of my parents in
  Altenberg. They were supremely tolerant of my inordinate love for
  animals. My nurse, Resi F&uuml;hringer, was the daughter of an
  old patrician peasant family. She possessed a "green thumb" for
  rearing animals. When my father brought me, from a walk in the
  Vienna Woods, a spotted salamander, with the injunction to
  liberate it after 5 days, my luck was in: the salamander gave
  birth to 44 larvae of which we, that is to say Resi, reared 12 to
  metamorphosis. This success alone might have sufficed to
  determine my further career; however, another important factor
  came in: <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/index.html">Selma
  Lagerl&ouml;f</a>'s Nils Holgersson was read to me - I could not
  yet read at that time. From then on, I yearned to become a wild
  goose and, on realizing that this was impossible, I desperately
  wanted to <i>have</i> one and, when this also proved impossible,
  I settled for having domestic ducks. In the process of getting
  some, I discovered imprinting and was imprinted myself. From a
  neighbour, I got a one day old duckling and found, to my intense
  joy, that it transferred its following response to my person. At
  the same time my interest became irreversibly fixated on water
  fowl, and I became an expert on their behaviour even as a
  child.<br>
  <br>
  When I was about ten, I discovered evolution by reading a book by
  Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche and seeing a picture of Archaeopteryx. Even
  before that I had struggled with the problem whether or not an
  earthworm was in insect. My father had explained that the word
  "insect" was derived from the notches, the "incisions" between
  the segments. The notches between the worm's metameres clearly
  were of the same nature. Was it, therefore, an insect? Evolution
  gave me the answer: if reptiles, via the Archaeopteryx, could
  become birds, annelid worms, so I deduced, could develop into
  insects. I then decided to become a paleontologist.<br>
  <br>
  At school, I met one important teacher, Philip Heberdey, and one
  important friend, Bernhard Hellmann. Heberdey, a Benedictine
  monk, freely taught us Darwin's theory of evolution and natural selection.
  Freedom of thought was, and to a certain extent still is,
  characteristic of Austria. Bernhard and I were first drawn
  together by both being aquarists. Fishing for Daphnia and other
  "live food" for our fishes, we discovered the richness of all
  that lives in a pond. We both were attracted by Crustacea,
  particularly by Cladocera. We concentrated on this group during
  the ontogenetic phase of collecting through which apparently
  every true zoologist must pass, repeating the history of his
  science. Later, studying the larval development of the brine
  shrimp, we discovered the ressemblance between the Euphyllopod
  larva and adult Cladocera, both in respect to movement and to
  structure. We concluded that this group was derived from
  Euphyllopod ancestors by becoming neotenic. At the time, this was
  not yet generally accepted by science. The most important
  discovery was made by Bernhard Hellmann while breeding the
  aggressive Cichlid Geophagus: a male that had been isolated for
  some time, would kill any conspecific at sight, irrespective of
  sex. However, after Bernhard had presented the fish with a mirror
  causing it to fight its image to exhaustion, the fish would,
  immediately afterwards, be ready to court a female. In other
  words, Bernhard discovered, at 17, that "action specific
  potentiality" can be "dammed up" as well as exhausted.<br>
  <br>
  On finishing high school, I was still obsessed with evolution and
  wanted to study zoology and paleontology. However, I obeyed my
  father who wanted me to study medicine. It proved to be my good
  luck to do so. The teacher of anatomy, Ferdinand Hochstetter, was
  a brilliant comparative anatomist and embryologist. He also was a
  dedicated teacher of the comparative method. I was quick to
  realize not only that comparative anatomy and embryology offered
  a better access to the problems of evolution than paleontology
  did, but also that the comparative method was as applicable to
  behaviour patterns as it was to anatomical structure. Even before
  I got my medical doctor's degree, I became first instructor and
  later assistant at Hochstetter's department. Also, I had begun to
  study zoology at the zoological institute of Prof. Jan Versluys.
  At the same time I participated in the psychological seminars of
  Prof. Karl B&uuml;hler who took a lively interest in my attempt
  to apply comparative methods to the study of behaviour. He drew
  my attention to the fact that my findings contradicted, with
  equal violence, the opinions held by the vitalistic or
  "instinctivistic" school of MacDougall and those of the
  mechanistic or behavioristic school of Watson. B&uuml;hler made
  me read the most important books of both schools, thereby
  inflicting upon me a shattering disillusionment: none of these
  people <i>knew</i> animals, none of them was an expert. I felt
  crushed by the amount of work still undone and obviously
  devolving on a new branch of science which, I felt, was my
  responsibility.<br>
  <br>
  Karl B&uuml;hler and his assistant Egon Brunswick made me realize
  that theory of knowledge was indispensable to the observer of
  living creatures, if he were to fulfill his task of scientific
  objectivation. My interest in the psychology of perception, which
  is so closely linked to epistemology, stems from the influence of
  these two men.<br>
  <br>
  Working as an assistant at the anatomical institute, I continued
  keeping birds and animals in Altenberg. Among them the jackdaws
  soon became most important. At the very moment when I got my
  first jackdaw, Bernhard Hellmann gave me Oskar Heinroth's book
  "Die V&ouml;gel Mitteleuropas". I realized in a flash that this
  man knew everything about animal behaviour that both, MacDougall
  and Watson, ignored and that I had believed to be the only one to
  know. Here, at last, was a scientist who also was an expert! It
  is hard to assess the influence which Heinroth exerted on the
  development of my ideas. His classical comparative paper on
  Anatidae encouraged me to regard the comparative study of
  behaviour as my chief task in life. Hochstetter generously
  considered my ethological work as being comparative anatomy of
  sorts and permitted me to work on it while on duty in his
  department. Otherwise the papers I produced between 1927 and 1936
  would never have been published.<br>
  <br>
  During that period I came to know Wallace Craig. The American
  Ornitologist Margaret Morse Nice knew about his work and mine and
  energetically put us into contact. I owe her undying gratitude.
  Next to Hochstetter and Heinroth, Wallace Craig became my most
  influential teacher. He criticized my firmly-held opinion that
  instinctive activities were based on chain reflexes. I myself had
  demonstrated that long absence of releasing stimuli tends to
  lower their threshold, even to the point of the activity's
  eruption in vacuo. Craig pointed out that in the same situation
  the organism began actively to seek for the releasing stimulus
  situation. It is obviously nonsense, wrote Craig, to speak of a
  re-action to a stimulus not yet received. The reason why in spite
  of the obvious spontaneity of instinctive behaviour, I still
  clung to the reflex theory, lay in my belief, that any deviation
  from Sherringtonian reflexology meant a concession to vitalism.
  So, in the lecture I gave in February 1936 in the Harnackhaus in
  Berlin, I still defended the reflex theory of instinct. It was
  the last time I did so.<br>
  <br>
  During that lecture, my wife was sitting behind a young man who
  obviously agreed with what I said about spontaneity, murmuring
  all the time: "It all fits in, it all fits in." When, at the end
  of my lecture, I said that I regarded instinctive motor patterns
  as chain reflexes after all, he hid his face in his hands and
  moaned: "Idiot, idiot". That man was Erich von Holst. After the
  lecture, in the commons of the Harnackhaus, it took him but a few
  minutes to convince me of the untenability of the reflex theory.
  The lowering thresholds, the eruption of vacuum activities, the
  independence of motor patterns of external stimulation, in short
  all the phenomena I was struggling with, not only could be
  explained, but actually were to be postulated on the assumption
  that they were based not on chains of reflexes but on the
  processes of endogenous generation of stimuli and of central
  coordination, which had been discovered and demonstrated by Erich
  von Holst. I regard as the most important break-through of all
  our attempts to understand animal and human behaviour the
  recognition of the following fact: the elemental neural
  organisation underlying behaviour does not consist of a receptor,
  an afferent neuron stimulating a motor cell and of an effector
  activated by the latter. Holst's hypothesis which we confidently
  can make our own, says that the basic central nervous
  organisation consists of a cell permanently producing endogenous
  stimulation, but prevented from activating its effector by
  another cell which, also producing endogenous stimulation, exerts
  an inhibiting effect. It is this inhibiting cell which is
  influenced by the receptor and ceases its inhibitory activity at
  the biologically "right" moment. This hypothesis appeared so
  promising that the Kaiser-Wilhelmsgesellschaft, now renamed
  Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, decided to found an
  institute for the physiology of behavior for Erich von Holst and
  myself. I am convinced that if he were still alive, he would be
  here in Stockholm now. At the time, the war interrupted our
  plans.<br>
  <br>
  When, in autumn 1936, Prof. van der Klaauw convoked a symposium
  called "Instinctus" in Leiden in Holland, I read a paper on
  instinct built up on the theories of Erich von Holst. At this
  symposium I met <a href="index.html">Niko Tinbergen</a> and this
  was certainly the event which, in the course of that meeting,
  brought the most important consequences to myself. Our views
  coincided to an amazing degree but I quickly realized that he was
  my superior in regard to analytical thought as well as to the
  faculty of devising simple and telling experiments. We discussed
  the relationship between spatially orienting responses (taxes in
  the sense of Alfred K&uuml;hn) and releasing mechanism on one
  hand, and the spontaneous endogenous motor patterns on the other.
  In these discussions some conceptualisations took form which
  later proved fruitful to ethological research. None of us knows
  who said what first, but it is highly probable that the
  conceptual separation of taxes, innate releasing mechanisms and
  fixed motor patterns was Tinbergen's contribution. He certainly
  was the driving force in a series of experiments which we
  conducted on the egg-rolling response of the Greylag goose when
  he stayed with us in Altenberg for several months in the summer
  of 1937.<br>
  <br>
  The same individual geese on which we conducted these
  experiments, first aroused my interest in the process of
  domestication. They were F<sub>1</sub> hybrids of wild Greylags
  and domestic geese and they showed surprising deviations from the
  normal social and sexual behaviour of the wild birds. I realised
  that an overpowering increase in the drives of feeding as well as
  of copulation and a waning of more differentiated social
  instincts is characteristic of very many domestic animals. I was
  frightened - as I still am - by the thought that analogous
  genetical processes of deterioration may be at work with
  civilized humanity. Moved by this fear, I did a very ill-advised
  thing soon after the Germans had invaded Austria: I wrote about
  the dangers of domestication and, in order to be understood, I
  couched my writing in the worst of nazi-terminology. I do not
  want to extenuate this action. I did, indeed, believe that some
  good might come of the new rulers. The precedent narrow-minded
  catholic regime in Austria induced better and more intelligent
  men than I was to cherish this naive hope. Practically all my
  friends and teachers did so, including my own father who
  certainly was a kindly and humane man. None of us as much as
  suspected that the word "selection", when used by these rulers,
  meant murder. I regret those writings not so much for the
  undeniable discredit they reflect on my person as for their
  effect of hampering the future recognition of the dangers of
  domestication.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 I was appointed to the Chair of Psychology in
  K&ouml;ningsberg and this appointment came about through the
  unlikely coincidence that Erich von Holst happened to play the
  viola in a quartette which met in G&ouml;ttingen and in which
  Eduard Baumgarten played the first violin. Baumgarten had been
  professor of philosophy in Madison, Wisconsin. Being a pupil of
  John Dewey and hence a representative of the pragmatist school of
  philosophy, Baumgarten had some doubts about accepting the chair
  of philosophy in K&ouml;ningsberg - Immanuel Kant's chair - which
  had just been offered to him. As he knew that the chair of
  psychology was also vacant in K&ouml;ningsberg, he casually asked
  Erich von Holst whether he knew a biologically oriented
  psychologist who was, at the same time, interested in theory of
  knowledge. Holst knew that I represented exactly this rather rare
  combination of interests and proposed me to Baumgarten who,
  together with the biologist Otto Koehler and the botanist Kurt
  Mothes - now president of the Academia
  Leopoldina in Halle - persuaded the philosophical faculty in
  K&ouml;ningsberg of putting me, a zoologist, in the psychological
  chair. I doubt whether perhaps the faculty later regretted this
  choice, I myself, at any rate, gained enormously by the
  discussions at the meetings of the Kant-Gesellschaft which
  regularly extended late into the night. My most brilliant and
  instructive opponents in my battle against idealism were the
  physiologist H. H. Weber, now of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, and
  Otto Koehler's late first wife Annemarie. It is to them that I
  really owe my understanding of Kantian philosophy - as far as it
  goes. The outcome of these discussions was my paper on Kant's
  theory of the &agrave; priori in the view of Darwinian biology.
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Max Planck</a>
  himself wrote a letter to me in which he stated that he
  thoroughly shared my views on the relationship between the
  phenomenonal and the real world. Reading that letter gave me the
  same sort of feeling as hearing that the Nobel Prize had been
  awarded to me. Years later that paper appeared in the Systems
  Year Book translated into English by my friend Donald
  Campbell.<br>
  <br>
  In autumn 1941 I was recruited into the German army as a medical
  man. I was lucky to find an appointment in the department of
  neurology and psychiatry of the hospital in Posen. Though I had
  never practised medicine, I knew enough about the anatomy of the
  nervous system and about psychiatry to fill my post. Again I was
  lucky in meeting with a good teacher, Dr. Herbert Weigel, one of
  the few psychiatrists of the time who took psychoanalysis
  seriously. I had the opportunity to get some first-hand knowledge
  about neurosis, particularly hysteria, and about psychosis,
  particularly schizophrenia.<br>
  <br>
  In spring 1942 I was sent to the front near Witebsk and two
  months later taken prisoner by the Russians. At first I worked in
  a hospital in Chalturin where I was put in charge of a department
  with 600 beds, occupied almost exclusively by cases of so-called
  field polyneuritis, a form of general inflammation of nervous
  tissues caused by the combined effects of stress, overexertion,
  cold and lack of vitamins. Surprisingly, the Russian physicians
  did not know this syndrome and believed in the effects of
  diphteria - an illness which also causes a failing of all
  reflexes. When this hospital was broken up I became a camp
  doctor, first in Oritschi and later in a number of successive
  camps in Armenia. I became tolerably fluent in Russian and got
  quite friendly with some Russians, mostly doctors. I had the
  occasion to observe the striking parallels between the
  psychological effects of nazi and of marxist education. It was
  then that I began to realize the nature of indoctrination as
  such.<br>
  <br>
  As a doctor in small camps in Armenia I had some time on my hand
  and I started to write a book on epistemology, since that was the
  only subject for which I needed no library. The manuscript was
  mainly written with potassium permanganate solution on cement
  sacking cut to pieces and ironed out. The Soviet authorities
  encouraged my writing, but, just when it was about finished,
  transferred me to a camp in Krasnogorsk near Moscow, with the
  injunction to type the manuscript and send a copy to the censor.
  They promised I should be permitted to take a copy home on being
  repatriated. The prospective date for repatriation of Austrians
  was approaching and I had cause to fear that I should be kept
  back because of my book. One day, however, the commander of the
  camp had me called to his office, asked me, on my word of honor,
  whether my manuscript really contained nothing but unpolitical
  science. When I assured him that this was indeed the case, he
  shook hands with me and forthwith wrote out a "propusk", an
  order, which said that I was allowed to take my manuscript and my
  tame starling home with me. By word of mouth he told the convoy
  officer to tell the next to tell the next and so on, that I
  should not be searched. So I arrived in Altenberg with manuscript
  and bird intact. I do not think that I ever experienced a
  comparable example of a man trusting another man's word. With a
  few additions and changes the book written in Russia was
  published under the title "Die R&uuml;ckseite des Spiegels". This
  title had been suggested by a fellow prisoner of war in Erivan,
  by name of Zimmer.<br>
  <br>
  On coming home to Austria in February 1948, I was out of a job
  and there was no promise of a chair becoming vacant. However,
  friends rallied from all sides. Otto Storch, professor of
  zoology, did his utmost and had done so for my wife even before I
  came back. Otto K&ouml;nig and his "Biologische Station
  Wilhelminenberg", received me like a longlost brother and Wilhelm
  Marinelli, the second zoologist, gave me the opportunity to
  lecture at his "Institut f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst".
  The Austrian Academy of Sciences financed a small
  research station in Altenberg with the money donated for that
  purpose by the English poet and writer J. B. Priestley. We had
  money to support our animals, no salaries but plenty of
  enthusiasm and enough to eat, as my wife had given up her medical
  practice and was running her farm near Tulln. Some remarkable
  young people were ready to join forces with us under these
  circumstances. The first was Wolfgang Schleidt, now professor at
  Garden University <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> near
  Washington. He built his first amplifier for supersonic
  utterances of rodents from radio-receivers found on refuse dumps
  and his first terrarium out of an old bedstead of the same
  provenance. I remember his carting it home on a wheel-barrow.
  Next came Ilse and Heinz Prechtl, now professor in Groningen,
  then Iren&auml;us and Eleonore Eibl-Eibesfeldt, both lady doctors of zoology
  and good scientists in their own right.<br>
  <br>
  Very soon the international contact of ethologists began to get
  re-established. In autumn 1948 we had the visit of Professor W.
  H. Thorpe of Cambridge who had demonstrated true imprinting in
  parasitic wasps and was interested in our work. He predicted, as
  Tinbergen did at that time, that I should find it impossible to
  get an appointment in Austria. He asked me in confidence whether
  I would consider taking on a lectureship in England. I said that
  I preferred, for the present, to stick in Austria. I changed my
  mind soon afterwards: <a href="index.html">Karl von Frisch</a>
  who left his chair in Graz, Austria, to go back to Munich,
  proposed me for his successor and the faculty of Graz unanimously
  concurred. When the Austrian Ministry of Education which was
  strictly Catholic again at this time, flatly refused Frisch's and
  the faculty's proposal, I wrote two letters to Tinbergen and to
  Thorpe, that I was now ready to leave home. Within an amazingly
  short time the University of Bristol asked me whether I would
  consider a lectureship there, with the additional task of doing
  ethological research on the water-fowl collection of the Severn
  Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge. So my friend Peter Scott also must
  have had a hand in this. I replied in the affirmative, but,
  before anything was settled, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft
  intervened offering me a research station adjunct to Erich von
  Holst's department. It was a hard decision to take; finally I was
  swayed by the consideration that, with Max Planck, I could take
  Schleidt, Prechtl and Eibl with me. Soon afterwards, my research
  station in Buldern in Westfalia was officially joined to Erich
  von Holst's department in a newly-founded " Max-Planck-Institut
  f&uuml;r Verhaltensphysiologie". Erich von Holst convoked the
  international meeting of ethologists in 1949. With the second of
  these symposia, Erich von Holst and I celebrated the coming-true
  of our dream in Buldern in autumn 1950.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to my research work, I at first confined myself to pure
  observation of waterfowl and of fish in order to get in touch
  again with real nature from which I had been separated so long.
  Gradually, I began to concentrate on the problems of
  aggressivity, of its survival function and on the mechanisms
  counteracting its dangerous effects. Fighting behaviour in fish
  and bonding behaviour in wild geese soon became the main objects
  of my research. Looking again at these things with a fresh eye, I
  realized how much more detailed a knowledge was necessary, just
  as my great co-laureate Karl von Frisch found new and interesting
  phenomena in his bees after knowing them for several decades, so,
  I felt, the observation of my animals should reveal new and
  interesting facts. I found good co-workers and we all are still
  busy with the same never-ending quest.<br>
  <br>
  A major advance in ethological theory was triggered in 1953 by a
  violent critique by Daniel D. Lehrmann who impugned the validity
  of the ethological concept of the innate. As Tinbergen described
  it, the community of ethologists was humming like a disturbed
  bee-hive. At a discussion arranged by Professor Grass&eacute; in
  Paris, I said that Lehrmann, in trying to avoid the assumption of
  innate knowledge, was inadvertently postulating the existence of
  an "innate school-marm". This was meant at a reduction to the
  absurd and shows my own error: it took me years to realize that
  this error was identical with that committed by Lehrmann and
  consisted in conceiving of the "innate" and of the "learned" as
  of disjunctive contradictory concepts. I came to realize that, of
  course, the problem why learning produces adaptive behaviour,
  rests exclusively with the "innate school-marm", in other words
  with the phylogenetically programmed teaching mechanism. Lehrmann
  came to realize the same and on this realisation we became
  friends. In 1961 I published a paper "Phylogenetische Anpassung
  und adaptive Modifikation des Verhaltens", which I later expanded
  into a book called "Evolution and Modification of Behaviour"
  (Harvard University Press, 1961).<br>
  <br>
  Until late in my life I was not interested in human behaviour and
  less in human culture. It was probably my medical background that
  aroused my awareness of the dangers threatening civilized
  humanity. It is sound strategy for the scientist not to talk
  about anything which one does not know with certainty. The
  medical man, however, is under the obligation to give warning
  whenever he sees a danger even if he only suspects its existence.
  Surprisingly late, I got involved with the danger of man's
  destruction of his natural environment and of the devastating
  vicious circle of commercial competition and economical growth.
  Regarding culture as a living system and considering its
  disturbances in the light of illnesses led me to the opinion that
  the main threat to humanity's further existence lies in that
  which may well be called mass neurosis. One might also say that
  the main problems with which humanity is faced, are moral and
  ethical problems.<br>
  <br>
  Todate I have just retired from my directorship at the
  Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Verhaltensphysiologie in Seewiesen,
  Germany, and am at work building up a department of animal
  sociology pertaining to the Institut f&uuml;r Vergleichende
  Verhaltensforschung of the Austrian Academy of Science.</p>
