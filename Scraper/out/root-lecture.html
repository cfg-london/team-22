  <h2>Towards Making Peace Permanent</h2>

  <p>The humanitarian purpose of Alfred Nobel in
  establishing the peace prize which bears his name was doubtless
  not merely to reward those who should promote peace among
  nations, but to stimulate thought upon the means and methods best
  adapted, under the changing conditions of future years, to
  approach and ultimately attain the end he so much desired.</p>

  <p>The apparent simplicity of the subject is
  misleading. Recognition of the horrors of war and the blessings
  of peace, acceptance of the dogma "War is wrong and to keep the
  peace a duty", are so universal that upon the surface it seems
  only necessary to state a few incontrovertible truths and to
  press them upon the attention of mankind, in order to have war
  end and peace reign perpetually.</p>

  <p>Yet the continual recurrence of war and the
  universally increasing preparations for war based upon
  expectation of it among nations all of whom declare themselves in
  favor of peace, indicate that intellectual acceptance of peace
  doctrine is not sufficient to control conduct, and that a general
  feeling in favor of peace, however sincere, does not furnish a
  strong enough motive to withstand the passions which lead to war
  when a cause of quarrel has arisen. The methods of peace
  propaganda which aim at establishing peace doctrine by argument
  and by creating a feeling favorable to peace in general seem to
  fall short of reaching the springs of human action and of dealing
  with the causes of the conduct which they seek to modify. It is
  much like treating the symptoms of disease instead of
  ascertaining and dealing with the cause of the symptoms. The mere
  assemblage of peace loving people to interchange convincing
  reasons for their common faith, mere exhortation and argument to
  the public in favor of peace in general fall short of the
  mark.</p>

  <p>They are useful, they serve to strengthen
  the faith of the participants, they tend very gradually to create
  a new standard of conduct, just as exhortations to be good and
  demonstrations that honesty is the best policy have a certain
  utility by way of suggestion. But they do not, as a rule, reach
  or extirpate or modify the causes of war.</p>

  <p>Occasionally some man with exceptional
  power of statement or of feeling and possessed by the true
  missionary spirit, will deliver a message to the world, putting
  old truths in such a way as to bite into the consciousness of
  civilized peoples and move mankind forward a little, with a gain
  never to be altogether lost. But the mere repetition of the
  obvious by good people of average intelligence, while not without
  utility and not by any means to be despised as an agency for
  peace, nevertheless is subject to the drawback that the
  unregenerate world grows weary of iteration and reacts in the
  wrong direction. The limitation upon this mode of promoting peace
  lies in the fact that it consists in an appeal to the civilized
  side of man, while war is the product of forces proceeding from
  man's original savage nature. To deal with the true causes of war
  one must begin by recognizing as of prime relevancy to the
  solution of the problem the familiar fact that civilization is a
  partial, incomplete, and, to a great extent, superficial
  modification of barbarism. The point of departure of the process
  to which we wish to contribute is the fact that war is the
  natural reaction of human nature in the savage state, while peace
  is the result of acquired characteristics. War was forced upon
  mankind in his original civil and social condition. The law of
  the survival of the fittest led inevitably to the survival and
  predominance of the men who were effective in war and who loved
  it because they were effective. War was the avenue to all that
  mankind desired. Food, wives, a place in the sun, freedom from
  restraint and oppression, wealth of comfort, wealth of luxury,
  respect, honor, power, control over others, were sought and
  attained by fighting. Nobody knows through how many thousands of
  years fighting men have made a place for themselves while the
  weak and peaceable have gone to the wall. Love of fighting was
  bred in the blood of the race because those who did not love
  fighting were not suited to their environment and perished.
  Grotius himself sets war first in the title of his great work,
  <i>De jure belli</i> <i>ac pacis</i><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, as if, in his mind, war was the
  general and usual condition with which he was to deal, and peace
  the occasional and incidental field of international relations.
  And indeed the work itself deals chiefly with war and only
  incidentally with peaceful relations.</p>

  <p>In attempting to bring mankind to a
  condition of permanent peace in which war will be regarded as
  criminal conduct, just as civilized communities have been brought
  to a condition of permanent order, broken only by criminals who
  war against society, we have to deal with innate ideas, impulses,
  and habits, which became a part of the caveman's nature by
  necessity from the conditions under which he lived; and these
  ideas and impulses still survive more or less dormant under the
  veneer of civilization, ready to be excited to action by events
  often of the most trifling character. As Lord Bacon says, "Nature
  is often hidden, sometimes overcome, seldom
  extinguished."<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> To eradicate
  or modify or curb the tendencies which thus survive among
  civilized men is not a matter of intellectual conviction or
  training. It is a matter primarily of development of character
  and the shifting of standards of conduct - a long, slow process
  in which advance is to be measured, not by days and years, but by
  generations and centuries in the life of nations.</p>

  <p>The attractive idea that we can now have a
  parliament of man with authority to control the conduct of
  nations by legislation or an international police force with
  power to enforce national conformity to rules of right conduct is
  a counsel of perfection. The world is not ready for any such
  thing, and it cannot be made ready except by the practical
  surrender of the independence of nations, which lies at the basis
  of the present social organization of the civilized world. Such a
  system would mean that each nation was liable to be lawfully
  controlled and coerced by a majority of alien powers. That
  majority alone could determine when and for what causes and to
  what ends the control and coercion should be exercised. Human
  nature must have come much nearer perfection than it is now, or
  will be in many generations, to exclude from such a control
  prejudice, selfishness, ambition, and injustice. An attempt to
  prevent war in this way would breed war, for it would destroy
  local self-government and drive nations to war for liberty. There
  is no nation in the world which would seriously consider a
  proposal so shocking to the national pride and patriotism of its
  people.</p>

  <p>To help in the most practical and efficient
  way towards making peace permanent, it is needful to inquire with
  some analysis what are the specific motives and impulses, the
  proximate causes which, under the present conditions of the
  civilized world, urge nations to the point where the war passion
  seizes upon them. And then we should inquire what are the
  influences which naturally tend or may be made to tend towards
  checking the impulse, destroying the motive, preventing the
  proximate cause, before passion has become supreme and it is too
  late.</p>

  <p>It is to be observed that every case of war
  averted is a gain in general, for it helps to form a habit of
  peace, and community habits long continued become standards of
  conduct. The life of the community conforms to an expectation of
  their continuance, and there comes to be an instinctive
  opposition to any departure from them.</p>

  <p>The first and most obvious cause for
  international controversy which suggests itself is in the field
  of international rights and obligations. Claims of right and
  insistence upon obligations may depend upon treaty stipulations,
  or upon the rules of international law, or upon the sense of
  natural justice applied to the circumstances of a particular
  case, or upon disputed facts. Upon all these there are
  continually arising controversies as to what are the true facts;
  what is the rule of international law applicable to the case;
  what is the true interpretation of the treaty; what is just and
  fair under the circumstances. This category does not by any means
  cover the entire field out of which causes of war arise, but no
  one should underestimate its importance. Small differences often
  grow into great quarrels, and honest differences of opinion
  frequently produce controversies in which national <i>amour
  propre</i> is involved and national honor, dignity, and prestige
  are supposed to be at stake. Rival claimants to an almost
  worthless strip of land along a disputed boundary, a few poor
  fishermen contesting each others' rights to set nets in disputed
  waters, may break into violence which will set whole nations
  aflame with partisanship upon either side. Reparation demanded
  for injury to a citizen or an insult to a flag in foreign
  territory may symbolize in the feeling of a great people their
  national right to independence, to respect, and to an equal place
  in the community of nations. The people of a country, wholly
  mistaken as to their national rights, honestly ignorant of their
  international obligations, may become possessed of a real sense
  of injustice, of deep resentment, and of a sincere belief that
  the supreme sacrifice of war is demanded by love of country, its
  liberty and independence, when in fact their belief has no just
  foundation whatever.</p>

  <p>In this field the greatest advance is being
  made towards reducing and preventing in a practical and effective
  way the causes of war, and this advance is proceeding along
  several different lines. First, by providing for the peaceable
  settlement of such controversies by submission to an impartial
  tribunal. Up to this time that provision has taken the form of
  arbitration, with which we are all familiar. There have been
  occasional international arbitrations from very early times, but
  arbitration as a system, a recognized and customary method of
  diplomatic procedure rather than an exceptional expedient, had
  its origin in the Hague Conference of 1899. It is interesting to
  recall the rather contemptuous reception accorded to the
  Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
  concluded at that conference, and to the Permanent Court at The
  Hague which it created<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The
  convention was not obligatory. No power was bound to comply with
  it. The cynicism with which the practical diplomatist naturally
  regards the idealist pronounced it a dead letter. But the
  convention expressed, and, by expressing, established a new
  standard of international conduct which practical idealism had
  long been gradually approaching, for which thoughtful men and
  women in all civilized lands had been vaguely groping, which the
  more advanced nations welcomed and the more backward nations were
  ashamed to reject. Let me quote the recitals with which the
  delegates prefaced their work:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"Animated by a strong desire to concert for
  the maintenance of the general peace;</p>

  <p>Resolved to second by their best efforts
  the friendly settlement of international disputes;</p>

  <p>Recognizing the solidarity which unites the
  members of the society of civilized nations;</p>

  <p>Desirous of extending the empire of law,
  and of strengthening the appreciation of international
  justice;</p>

  <p>Convinced that the permanent institution of
  a Court of Arbitration, accessible to all, in the midst of the
  independent Powers, will contribute effectively to this
  result;</p>

  <p>Having regard to the advantages attending
  the general and regular organization of arbitral procedure;</p>

  <p>Sharing the opinion of the august initiator
  of the International Conference that it is expedient to record in
  an international agreement the principles of equity and right, on
  which are based the security of states and the welfare of
  peoples..."<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>These declarations, although enforced by no
  binding stipulation, nevertheless have become principles of
  action in international affairs because, through the progress of
  civilization and the influence of many generations of devoted
  spirits in the cause of humanity, the world had become ready for
  the setting up of the standard. The convention would have been a
  dead letter if the world had not been made ready for it, and,
  because the world was ready, conformity to the standard year by
  year has become more universal and complete. Since this
  convention, which was binding upon no state, 113 obligatory
  general treaties of arbitration have been made between powers who
  have taken part in the Hague Conferences, and sixteen
  international controversies have been heard and decided, or are
  pending before that tribunal according to the last report of the
  Administrative Council of the Court.</p>

  <p>Quite apart from the statistics of cases
  actually heard or pending, it is impossible to estimate the
  effect produced by the existence of this court, for the fact that
  there is a court to which appeal may be made always leads to the
  settlement of far more controversies than are brought to
  judgment. Nor can we estimate the value of having this system a
  part of the common stock of knowledge of civilized men, so that,
  when an international controversy arises, the first reaction is
  not to consider war but to consider peaceful litigation.</p>

  <p>Plainly, the next advance to be urged along
  this line is to pass on from an arbitral tribunal, the members of
  which are specifically selected from the general list of the
  court for each case, and whose service is but an incident in the
  career of a diplomatist or a publicist, to a permanent court
  composed of judges who devote their entire time to the
  performance of judicial duties and proceed in accordance with a
  sense of judicial obligation, not to adjust or compromise
  differences, but to decide upon rights in accordance with the
  facts and the law.</p>

  <p>Long steps in this direction were made in
  the Second Hague Conference by the convention for the
  establishment of a permanent international prize court and by the
  formulation and adoption of a draft convention relative to the
  creation of a general judicial arbitration court. This draft
  convention lacked nothing of completion except an agreement upon
  the method by which the judges were to be selected. Towards the
  creation of such a court the best efforts of those who wish to
  promote peace should be directed.</p>

  <p>The second line of advance in this same
  field of international controversy is in pressing forward the
  development of international law and the agreement of nations
  upon its rules. Lord Mansfield<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> described the law of nations as
  "founded upon justice, equity, convenience, the reason of the
  thing, and confirmed by long usage". There are multitudes of
  events liable to occur frequently in the intercourse of nations,
  regarding which there has never been any agreement as to what is
  just, equitable, or convenient, and, as to many of the classes of
  controversy, different views are held by different nations, so
  that in a large part of the field with which an arbitral tribunal
  or international court should deal there is really no law to be
  applied. Where there is no law, a submission to arbitration or to
  judicial decision is an appeal, not to the rule of law, but to
  the unknown opinions or predilections of the men who happen to be
  selected to decide. The development of the peaceable settlement
  of international disputes by the decision of impartial tribunals
  waits therefore upon the further development of international law
  by a more complete establishment of known and accepted rules for
  the government of international conduct.</p>

  <p>In this direction also great progress has
  been made within recent years. The ordinary process of reaching
  rules of international law through the universal assent of
  nations, expressed as particular cases arise from time to time in
  the ordinary course of international affairs, is so slow that,
  instead of making progress towards a comprehensive law of nations
  by such a method, the progress of the law has been outstripped by
  the changes of condition in international affairs, so that the
  law has been growing less and less adequate to settle the
  questions continually arising. The Declaration of Paris, in 1856,
  by a few simple rules<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> a,
  dealing not with particular cases but looking to the future
  through an agreement of the powers signing the convention, was a
  new departure in the method of forming international law. That
  method has developed into the action of the two Hague Conferences
  of 1899 and 1907, which were really lawmaking bodies,
  establishing, by the unanimous vote of the powers, rules of
  conduct<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> for the future,
  covering extensive portions of the field of international
  conduct. The action of the Hague Conferences would have been
  impossible if it had not been for the long continued and devoted
  labors of the Institut de droit international<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, which, in its annual meetings for
  forty years, has brought together the leaders of thought in the
  science of the law of nations in all the countries of the
  civilized world to discuss unofficially, with a free and full
  expression of personal opinion, the unsettled problems as to what
  the law is and ought to be. The conclusions of that body
  furnished to the successive Hague Conferences the matured results
  of years of well-directed labor and bore the same relation to the
  deliberations of the conferences as the report of a committee of
  a legislative body in furnishing the basis for deliberation and
  action. Their work should be encouraged and their example should
  be followed.</p>

  <p>Further Hague Conferences should be
  insisted upon. They should be made to recur at regular periods
  without requiring the special initiative of any country. The
  process of formulating and securing agreement upon rules of
  international law should be pressed forward in every
  direction.</p>

  <p>There is a third line of progress, little,
  if any, less important than the two already mentioned, and that
  is the instruction of students and of the great bodies of the
  people of civilized countries in the knowledge of international
  law. Under the modern development of constitutional governments,
  with varying degrees of extension of suffrage, more and more the
  people who cast the ballots determine the issues of peace and
  war. No government now embarks in war without the assurance of
  popular support. It is not uncommon in modern times to see
  governments straining every nerve to keep the peace, and the
  people whom they represent, with patriotic enthusiasm and
  resentment over real or fancied wrongs, urging them forward to
  war. Nothing is more important in the preservation of peace than
  to secure among the great mass of the people living under
  constitutional government a just conception of the rights which
  their nation has against others and of the duties their nation
  owes to others. The popular tendency is to listen approvingly to
  the most extreme statements and claims of politicians and orators
  who seek popularity by declaring their own country right in
  everything and other countries wrong in everything. Honest
  people, mistakenly believing in the justice of their cause, are
  led to support injustice. To meet this tendency there should be
  not merely definite standards of law to be applied to
  international relations, but there should be general public
  understanding of what those standards are. Of course it is not
  possible that all the people of any country can become familiar
  with international law, but there may be such knowledge and
  leadership of opinion in every country on the part of the most
  intelligent and best educated men that in every community
  mistaken conceptions can be corrected and a true view of rights
  and obligations inculcated. To attain this end much has been done
  and much is in contemplation. Societies of international law have
  been formed in many countries for the discussion of international
  questions and the publication and distribution of the results.
  Many journals of international law have been established and are
  rapidly increasing their circulation and influence. More and more
  colleges and universities are establishing chairs and giving
  instruction in international law to their students. A further
  step is about to be taken at The Hague by the establishment there
  of an international school of international law<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> to which scholars from all over the
  civilized world will come and in which the great masters of the
  science have undertaken to give instruction. There can be no
  better augury for the success of the new institution than the
  fact that it found its origin in the general enthusiasm of Ludwig
  von Bar of G&ouml;ttingen, of Otfried Nippold of Frankfort, of
  Demetrius Sturdza of Roumania, and of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1911/index.html">T.M.C. Asser</a> of Holland;
  and that it has for its president <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1907/index.html">Louis Renault</a> of
  France<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. The distinctive
  feature of this new departure is that it will bring together
  teachers and students from many countries so that their
  intercourse and instruction will tend towards the unification of
  rules and the establishment of a general standard of law, instead
  of perpetuating the differing and often antagonistic conceptions
  which obtain within the limits of different nations.</p>

  <p>Along all these lines of practical effort
  for peace in the development of arbitration and judicial decision
  in the development of a definite system of law, determining the
  rights and obligations of nations, and in the enlightenment of
  the civilized nations as to what their rights and obligations
  are, the present generation has rendered a service in the cause
  of peace surpassing that of many centuries gone before, and in
  further development along these same lines the present generation
  has before it a golden opportunity for further service.</p>

  <p>There is, however, another class of
  substantive causes of war which the agencies I have described do
  not reach directly. This comprises acts done or demanded in
  pursuance of national policy, and ordinarily either for the
  enlargement or protection of territory or for trade or industrial
  advantage. The conduct of a nation under such a policy is often
  regarded by other nations as unwarranted aggression or as
  threatening their safety or their rights. Illustrations of this
  kind of question are to be found in the protean forms of the
  Eastern question and of the balance of power in Europe, in the
  assertion of the Monroe Doctrine by the United States; in the
  position of Germany regarding the settlement of Morocco before
  the Conference of Algeciras; in the attitude of Great Britain
  regarding Agadir after that conference. It is plain that, under
  the present organization of civilization in independent
  nationalities, questions of public policy supposed to be vital
  cannot be submitted to arbitration because that would be an
  abdication of independence and the placing of government <i>pro
  tanto</i> in the hands of others. The independence of a state
  involves that state's right to determine its own domestic policy
  and to decide what is essential to its own safety.</p>

  <p>It does not follow, however, that we are
  without opportunity to promote and strengthen specific influences
  tending to diminish or prevent causes of war of this description.
  In the first place, when there is a policy of intentional
  aggression, inspired by a desire to get possession of the
  territory or the trade of another country, right or wrong, a
  pretext is always sought. No nation now sets forth to despoil
  another upon the avowed ground that it desires the spoils. Some
  ground of justification is always alleged. The wolf always
  charges the lamb with muddying the stream. The frank and simple
  days of the Roman proconsul and of the robber baron have passed,
  and three things have happened: first, there has come to be a
  public opinion of the world; second, that opinion has set up a
  new standard of national conduct which condemns unjustified
  aggression; and third, the public opinion of the world punishes
  the violation of its standard. It has not been very long since
  the people of each country were concerned almost exclusively with
  their own affairs, and, with but few individual exceptions,
  neither knew nor cared what was going on outside their own
  boundaries. All that has changed. The spread of popular
  education; the enormous increase in the production and
  circulation of newspapers and periodicals and cheap books; the
  competition of the press, which ranges the world for news; the
  telegraph, which carries instantly knowledge of all important
  events everywhere to all parts of the world; the new mobility of
  mankind, which, availing itself of the new means of travel by
  steamship and railroad, with its new freedom under the recently
  recognized right of expatriation and the recently established
  right of free travel, moves to and fro by the million across the
  boundaries of the nations; the vast extension of international
  commerce; the recognition of interdependence of the peoples of
  different nations engendered by this commerce and this
  intercourse; their dependence upon each other for the supply of
  their needs and for the profitable disposal of their products,
  for the preservation of health, for the promotion of morals and
  for the increase of knowledge and the advance of thought - all
  these are creating an international community of knowledge and
  interest, of thought and feeling. In the hundreds of
  international associations reported by Senator La Fontaine's
  L'Office central at Brussels<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>, men of all nations are learning
  to think internationally about science and morals and hygiene and
  religion and society and business. Gradually, everything that
  happens in the world is coming to be of interest everywhere in
  the world, and, gradually, thoughtful men and women everywhere
  are sitting in judgment upon the conduct of all nations. Some
  very crass and indefensible things have been done by nations
  within the past few years, but no one can read the discussions
  about those national acts without seeing that the general
  judgment of mankind has sunk deep into the hearts of the people
  of the countries responsible; that a great new force is at work
  in international affairs; that the desire for approval and the
  fear of condemnation by the contemporary opinion of the civilized
  world is becoming a powerful influence to control national
  conduct. True, we are but at the beginning, but it is the
  beginning of a great new era in which the public opinion of
  mankind renders judgment, not upon peace and war, for a vast
  majority of mankind is in favor of war when that is necessary for
  the preservation of liberty and justice, but upon the just and
  unjust conduct of nations, as the public opinion of each
  community passes upon the just and unjust conduct of its
  individual members. The chief force which makes for peace and
  order in the community of individuals is not the police officer,
  with his club, but it is the praise and blame, the honor and
  shame, which follow observance or violation of the community's
  standards of right conduct. In the new era that is dawning of the
  world's public opinion we need not wait for the international
  policeman, with his artillery, for, when any people feels that
  its government has done a shameful thing and has brought them
  into disgrace in the opinion of the world, theirs will be the
  vengeance and they will inflict the punishment.</p>

  <p>Two conclusions from all these
  considerations are quite obvious. First, that the development and
  understanding of international law and the habit of submitting
  international controversies to judicial decision will continually
  tend to hinder wanton aggression because it will tend to make it
  more difficult to find pretexts, excuses, or justification.
  Second, that quite apart from argument and exhortation concerning
  war and peace, there is a specific line of effort along which
  those who seek to promote peace may most usefully proceed: by
  insisting upon a willingness to do justice among nations, and
  this, not justice according to the possibly excited and warped
  opinion of the particular nation, but according to the general
  public judgment of the civilized world; by condemning injustice
  on the part of nations as we condemn injustice on the part of
  individuals; by pressing upon the peoples of the earth a
  consciousness that if they are arrogant and grasping and
  overbearing and use their power to oppress and despoil the weak,
  they will be disgraced in the estimation of mankind. Such an
  effort is not a denial of the innate impulses of the race but is
  an appeal to them. It accords with the line of historic
  development. The taboo of savage tribes is nothing else. The
  social penalties of civilized communities are the same thing. The
  theoretical postulate of all diplomatic discussion between
  nations is the assumed willingness of every nation to do justice.
  The line of least resistance in the progress of civilization is
  to make that theoretical postulate real by the continually
  increasing force of the world's public opinion.</p>

  <p>Yet there are other influences tending in
  the same direction which may be usefully promoted. The
  self-interest which so often prompts nations to unjust aggression
  can no longer safely assume that its apparent profit is real; for
  a nation which has been built up by the industry and enterprise
  of its people, which depends upon its products and the marketing
  of them, upon its commerce and the peaceful intercourse of
  commerce for its prosperity, the prize of aggression must be rich
  indeed to counterbalance the injury sustained by the interference
  of war with both production and commerce. At the same time,
  freedom of trade regardless of political control is diminishing
  the comparative value of extension of territory. The old system
  of exploitation of colonies and the monopolization of their trade
  for the benefit of the mother country has practically
  disappeared. The best informed men are coming to understand that,
  under modern conditions, the prosperity of each nation is
  enhanced by the prosperity of all other nations; and that the
  government which acquires political control over new territory
  may gratify pride and minister to ambition but can have only a
  slight effect to advance the welfare of its people.</p>

  <p>The support of these statements rests upon
  the facts of economic science. If they are true, as I am sure we
  all believe them to be, they should be forced upon the attention
  of the peoples, not by mere assertion, which avails but little,
  but by proof drawn from the rich stores of evidence to be found
  in the history of mankind. For the accomplishment of this purpose
  a meeting of eminent economists and publicists was held three
  years ago at Bern. They came from Denmark, Holland, Belgium,
  Great Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy,
  Austria-Hungary, the United States, and Japan. For some weeks
  they devoted themselves to the preparation of a program for
  systematic, scientific investigation into the historical and
  economic causes and effects of war. For the three years which
  have ensued they have been engaged, with ample and competent
  assistance, in pursuing their investigations. The first
  installments of their work are ready for publication, and they
  reconvened last month to review what has been done and to lay
  down the lines of further work. The results of their labors, when
  made available, should be eagerly sought by every lover of peace
  who is competent by tongue or pen to be a teacher of his
  fellowmen, for we may be confident they will show that while the
  sacrifice of war may be demanded for justice, for liberty, for
  national life, yet war is always a sacrifice, and never is a
  rational mode of promoting material prosperity.</p>

  <p>There yet remain certain disposing causes,
  which, quite apart from real substantive questions in
  controversy, operate upon national feeling and give injurious
  effect to trifling or fancied occasions for offense. There is no
  international controversy so serious that it cannot be settled if
  both parties really wish to settle it. There are few
  controversies so trifling that they cannot be made the occasion
  for war if the parties really wish to fight. Among these
  disposing causes which create an atmosphere of belligerency
  are:<br>
  (a) Race and local prejudice, breeding dislike and hatred between
  the peoples of different countries.<br>
  (b) Exaggerated national <i>amour propre</i>, which causes
  excessive sensitiveness and excessive resentment of foreign
  criticism or opposition.<br>
  (c) With these go the popular assumption, often arrogant, often
  ignorant, that the extreme claims of one's country are always
  right and are to be rigidly insisted upon as a point of national
  honor. With them go intolerance of temperate discussion, of
  kindly consideration, and of reasonable concession.</p>

  <p>Under these feelings, insulting words and
  conduct towards foreign governments and people become popular,
  and braggart defiance is deemed patriotic. Under them the
  ambitious aspirants of domestic politics seek preferment through
  avenues of military success.</p>

  <p>And under them deep and real suspicions
  office sinister purpose of other nations readily take possession
  of a people, who become ready to believe that an attack by their
  own country is the only recourse to guard effectually against an
  attack upon their country by others, and that patriotism requires
  them to outstrip other countries in armament and preparation for
  war.</p>

  <p>Prejudice and passion and suspicion are
  more dangerous than the incitement of self-interest or the most
  stubborn adherence to real differences of opinion regarding
  rights. In private life more quarrels arise, more implacable
  resentment is caused, more lives are sacrificed, because of
  insult than because of substantial injury. And it is so with
  nations.</p>

  <p>The remedy is the same. When friends
  quarrel we try to dissipate their misunderstandings, to soften
  their mutual feelings, and to bring them together in such a way
  that their friendship may be renewed. Misunderstanding and
  prejudice and dislike are, as a rule, the fruits of isolation.
  There is so much of good in human nature that men grow to like
  each other upon better acquaintance, and this points to another
  way in which we may strive to promote the peace of the world.
  That is by international conciliation through intercourse, not
  the formal intercourse of the traveler or the merchant, but the
  intercourse of real acquaintance, of personal knowledge, of
  little courtesies and kindly consideration; by the exchange of
  professors between universities, by the exchange of students
  between countries; by the visits to other countries on the part
  of leaders of opinion, to be received in private hospitality and
  in public conference; by the spreading of correct information
  through the press; by circulating and attracting attention to
  expressions of praise and honor rather than the reverse; by
  giving public credit where credit is due and taking pains to
  expose and publish our good opinions of other peoples; by
  cooperation in the multitude of causes which are worldwide in
  their interest; by urging upon our countrymen the duty of
  international civility and kindly consideration; and by constant
  pressure in the right direction in a multitude of ways - a slow
  process, but one which counts little by little if persisted
  in.</p>

  <p>Each separate act will seem of no effect,
  but all together they will establish and maintain a tendency
  towards the goal of international knowledge and broad human
  sympathy. There is a homely English saying, "Leg over leg the dog
  went to Dover." That states the method of our true progress. We
  cannot arrive at our goal <i>per saltum</i><a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Not by invoking an immediate
  millennium, but by the accumulated effects of a multitude of
  efforts, each insignificant in itself but steadily and
  persistently continued, we must win our way along the road to
  better knowledge and kindliness among the peoples of the earth
  which the will of Alfred Nobel describes as "the fraternity of
  nations".</p>

  <p>There are many reasons to believe that
  progress toward the permanent prevalence of peace may be more
  rapid in the future than in the past.</p>

  <p>Standards of conduct are changing in many
  ways unfavorable to war.</p>

  <p>Civilized man is becoming less cruel.
  Cruelty to men and to the lower animals as well, which would have
  passed unnoticed a century ago, now shocks the sensibilities and
  is regarded as wicked and degrading. The severity of punishments
  for minor offenses which formerly prevailed now seems to us
  revolting. The torture of witnesses or of criminals has become
  unthinkable. Human life is held in much higher esteem, and the
  taking of it, whether in private quarrel or by judicial
  procedure, is looked upon much more seriously than it was
  formerly. The social reaction from the theories of the
  individualistic economists of the last century has brought with
  it a very widespread sense that men have some sort of
  responsibility to cause affairs to be so ordered in civilized
  communities that their fellowmen have a chance to live. The Hague
  Conventions to regulate the conduct of war and the Geneva
  Conventions<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> to ameliorate
  its horrors have a significance which goes beyond their
  professions. They mark the changing attitude of the world towards
  the subject to which they relate; and they introduce into the
  business of warfare obligatory considerations of humanity and
  respect for human rights which tend to destroy the spirit upon
  which alone the business itself can continue. No one can read
  those conventions closely without being struck by the similarity
  of the process of regulation and limitation which they exhibit
  with the historic process by which private war was ultimately
  regulated out of existence in the greater part of the civilized
  world. The growth of modern constitutional government compels for
  its successful practice the exercise of reason and considerate
  judgment by the individual citizens who constitute the
  electorate. The qualities thus evoked in the training schools of
  domestic affairs are the qualities which make for national
  self-restraint and peace in international affairs. History is
  being rewritten, and the progress of popular education is making
  men familiar with it; and as the world, which worships strength
  and has most applauded military glory, grows in knowledge, the
  great commanding figures rising far above the common mass of mere
  fighters, the men who win the most imperishable fame have come to
  be the strong, patient, greathearted ones like Washington, and
  Lincoln, and William the Silent, and Cavour<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>, whose genius, inspired by love
  of country and their kind, urges them to build up and not to
  destroy. The sweetest incense offered to the memory of the
  soldier is not to the brutal qualities of war but to the serene
  courage ennobled by sympathy and courtesy of a Bayard or a
  Sidney<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The
  hero-worshipper is gradually changing from the savage to the
  civilized conception of his divinities. Taken all in all, the
  clear and persistent tendencies of a slowly developing
  civilization justify cheerful hope.</p>

  <p>We may well turn from Tripoli and Mexico
  and the Balkans with the apocryphal exclamation of Galilei, "And
  still the world moves."</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote*"></a>* In 1913, Mr. Root
  was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 1912, the prize
  having been reserved in that year. Mr. Root agreed to speak in
  Oslo on September 8, 1914, but was prevented from doing so by the
  outbreak of World War I. This text is taken from Elihu Root's
  <i>Addresses on International Subjects</i>, edited by Robert
  Bacon and James B. Scott (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
  1916), pp. 153-174. Of this speech, the editors say: "The address
  prepared by Mr. Root for that occasion [acknowledging the prize
  in Oslo on September 8] is here printed exactly as it was
  prepared for delivery before the outbreak of the war, without the
  change of a word or syllable" (p. 154). The speech was not given
  a title; the title used here is a thematic phrase taken from the
  eighth paragraph.</p>
