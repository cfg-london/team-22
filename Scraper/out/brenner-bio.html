  <h1>Sydney Brenner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="brenner.jpg" class="bio-img">An autobiography
  published a few years ago<a href="#not">*</a> records many of the
  salient events in my life which led me to become a scientist and
  my Nobel Lecture covers the intellectual background and
  consequences of the research work for which the Prize has been
  awarded.</p>

  <p>In this somewhat compressed version, I
  start with my birth on the 13th January 1927 in a small town,
  Germiston, in South Africa. My parents were Jewish immigrants
  from Eastern Europe; my father came to South Africa from
  Lithuania in 1910, my mother, from Latvia, in 1922. My father was
  a shoe repairer and our first home was in some rooms at the back
  of his shop. He never learnt to read or write but, in addition to
  English, Yiddish and Russian, he learnt to speak Afrikaans and
  Zulu. I learnt to read at an early age, and a customer of my
  father, Miss Walkinshaw, persuaded my father to allow me to go at
  the age of five without charge to her kindergarten. I completed
  the first three years of primary school in one year and was
  admitted to the local school the age of six directly into the
  fourth year, some two years younger than all my contemporaries.
  After 4 years in primary school, I went to Germiston High School
  where I matriculated in December 1941, just before turning
  15.</p>

  <p>During this time I discovered the Public
  Library in Germiston, one of the many libraries set up all over
  the world with funding from Andrew Carnegie's endowment. It was
  here that I found a source of knowledge and the means to acquire
  it by reading, a habit of learning which I still follow to this
  day. I also became interested in chemistry and gradually
  accumulated enough test tubes and other glassware to do chemical
  experiments, using small quantities of chemicals purchased from a
  pharmacy supply house. I soon graduated to biochemistry and tried
  to discover what gave flowers their distinctive colours. I made
  the (to me) astounding discovery that the pigments I extracted
  changed their colours when I changed the pH of the solution.</p>

  <p>I was fortunate in that the Town Council of
  Germiston gave me a bursary of 60 pounds per year that allowed me
  to go to the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg to
  study medicine and, in 1942, at the age of fifteen, I began the
  course studying Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. I lived
  at home and I cycled every morning to the railway station to
  travel by train to Johannesburg followed by a walk to the
  University, carrying sandwiches for my lunch and returning in the
  evening the same way. My Uncle Harry had given me a microscope as
  a present which allowed me to continue my personal explorations
  of the living world. This was the beginning of my contacts with
  the real science. In my second year, after moving to the Medical
  School, I began the courses of Anatomy and Physiology. I had
  begun to see that I was interested in cells and their
  functions.</p>

  <p>It was noted then that I would be too young
  to qualify for the practice of medicine at the conclusion of my
  six year medical course and I was allowed to deviate and spend
  one year in a Medical B.Sc. course in Anatomy and Physiology.
  This was heaven. The small group of about a dozen students
  inhabited a small room in the Anatomy Department where we each
  had a small laboratory bench. We learnt how to do research by
  working in small groups with more advanced researchers in the
  Department. I learnt physical chemistry with Joel Mandelstam
  (later Professor at Oxford University), microscopy with Alfred Oettle,
  and neurology with Harold Daitz who became a close friend and who
  died at a very early age in Oxford. Raymond Dart and Robert Broom
  taught me anthropology and paleontology, and the man who inspired
  all this activity was Joseph Gillman, a histologist who had
  created a centre of research in that isolated place. He invited
  me (I needed no persuasion) to continue with research and I
  stayed on for two more years doing an Honours degree and then an
  M.Sc., supporting myself by working part-time as a laboratory
  technician. I read many books and taught myself many subjects
  during this period, learnt how to build equipment and how to do
  experiments, and had many arguments and discussions with Joe
  Gillman. I also began to publish papers. My scientific
  bibliography begins in 1945 with a paper published with Joe
  Gillman and his brother, Teddy, but my first paper as sole author
  appeared in 1946. This paper dealt with a histochemical reaction,
  and it was the first of several which reflected my growing
  interest in a subject which I later called cell physiology. My
  M.Sc. thesis was in the field of cytogenetics, another
  self-taught subject, and this was the beginning of my research in
  genetics. This background was to serve me well in later years
  when I became a molecular biologist.</p>

  <p>In 1946, W. Le Gros Clark visited South
  Africa and invited me to come to his Department of Anatomy in
  Oxford, but I was advised by everybody to finish my medical
  course, because it was believed then that a medical qualification
  would be essential for a research position later. I did go back
  to my medical studies but I continued working in the Department
  of Anatomy and moved to the Department of Physiology when Joe
  Gillman became Professor there. I was not a good medical student
  and had an erratic career, brilliant in some subjects, absolutely
  dismal in others. In my final year I failed Medicine, scraped
  through Surgery but got a First Class in the third subject,
  Obstetrics and Gynecology. I had to go back and repeat Medicine
  and Surgery and six months later, in July 1951, I finally
  received the degrees of MB BCh. I had already decided that I
  would do research and that I needed to go abroad. CH Waddington,
  who had earlier visited South Africa had advised me to go to
  Cambridge. I
  applied to the Department of Biochemistry and never even received
  a reply. I had decided that the subject I was interested in was
  molecular biology which, of course, did not exist at the time,
  and when I was awarded a scholarship by the Commission for the
  Royal Exhibition of 1851, H. Raikes, head of the University of
  Witwatersrand, who was originally an Oxford trained chemist,
  advised me to write to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/index.html">C.N. Hinshelwood</a>, the
  Professor of Physical Chemistry at Oxford University, who had
  interests in the applications of physical chemistry to biology.
  That sounded closer to what I wanted to do. Hinshelwood had
  written a book called the "Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial
  Cell" which I read and thought was in the direction I wanted to
  go. He accepted me and suggested I work on bacteriophage
  resistance in bacteria. I immediately began to read about
  bacterial viruses and in October 1952 I arrived in Oxford to do a
  Ph.D. in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory.</p>

  <p>There was still food rationing in England
  and life was difficult all through my 2 year stay in Oxford. In
  addition, I and the others were outsiders three times over; we
  were scientists, we were research students and we were colonials.
  Many of my friends in Oxford shared these stigmata and the only
  compensation was the opportunity to join Halifax House and lunch
  there. This was where I met Jack Dunitz, a crystallographer, and
  through him Leslie Orgel, a theoretical chemist, both of whom
  have remained lifelong friends and colleagues.</p>

  <p>We had many discussions on DNA, for I had
  come to Oxford with two half ideas both of which were more than
  half wrong. One was a way of working out the structure of DNA
  using dyes and the other was how nucleic acids could participate
  in the synthesis of proteins. I can remember in November 1952
  Jack telling me about two fellows in Cambridge who were going to
  solve the structure of DNA. When in April 1953, Jack told us that
  these two fellows in Cambridge, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick and Jim
  Watson</a>, had indeed solved the structure of DNA, Jack, Leslie
  and I drove to Cambridge on a day between the 16 and 18th April
  to see the model.</p>

  <p>This was the watershed in my scientific
  life. The moment I saw the model and heard about the
  complementing base pairs I realized that it was the key to
  understanding all the problems in biology we had found
  intractable - it was the birth of molecular biology. It was a
  revelation reinforced by conversing with Jim Watson at greater
  length during a walk we took together, when I realized that
  working with bacteriophage had put me on the right road to enter
  this exciting new field, even though what I was doing was
  trivial.</p>

  <p>My wife and I were married in London in
  December 1952 and she was also engaged in doing a Ph.D. in
  Psychology in London. She was allowed to move to Oxford and,
  until June 1954, we lived in a flat in Woodstock Road working on
  our theses, had a child in addition to my stepson, Jonathan,
  dreaming all the time of food and the warm climate of our native
  South Africa.</p>

  <p>An opportunity to visit the United States
  came about when Dr. M. Demerec, the director of the Carnegie
  Institution Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor visited Sir Cyril Hinshelwood. It
  was Demerec who invited me to Cold Spring Harbor and who helped
  me to obtain a Carnegie Corporation Travelling Fellowship which
  enabled me at the end of the summer in Cold Spring Harbor to make
  a trip across the United States to visit other laboratories. I
  drove across America with Jim Watson to Cal Tech and I then
  had a period of research at the Virus Laboratory in Berkeley,
  working with Gunther Stent. I also had made a short visit to
  Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>My visit to America was important because
  through it I met many of the then important workers of the Phage
  School, Seymour Benzer, who became a lifelong colleague and
  friend, <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">Max
  Delbr&uuml;ck</a>, the founder of the phage school, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">Salvador Luria</a> and many
  others who were destined to play important roles in the
  development of of the new science of molecular biology.</p>

  <p>I had also met Francis Crick again in Woods
  Hole and Cold Spring Harbor and visited him in Cambridge in
  December 1954 on my way back to South Africa. At this meeting we
  discussed how I might join him in the future and I returned to
  South Africa at the end of 1954 as I was committed to do so by
  the terms of the Carnegie Corporation Fellowship.</p>

  <p>I set up a laboratory in the Department of
  Physiology in the Medical School in South Africa and begin to try
  to find a bacteriophage system which we might use to solve the
  genetic code. I also continued to work on some theoretical
  aspects of the genetic code and during this period was able to
  prove the impossibility of all overlapping triplet codes which
  was circulated in an RNA Tie Club note and later communicated to
  the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by George Gamow.
  Francis worked hard to get me an appointment at the Medical
  Research Council Unit in Cambridge and in December 1956 we left
  South Africa for a new career in England. I did all of my work on
  molecular genetics in the Cavendish Unit and its successor, the
  MRC
  Laboratory of Molecular Biology, where the work on <i>C.
  elegans</i> was initiated and developed. I spent 20 years sharing
  an office with Francis Crick and many new and exciting ideas
  (both right and wrong) were generated from our conversations. The
  centre point of our interests had begun to diverge and whereas we
  were both interested in the nervous system, I was far more
  interested in finding a simple experimental system which might
  tell me how brains were constructed, whereas Francis wanted to
  know about the complex activities of higher nervous systems. He
  left Cambridge in 1976 to join the Salk Institute where he pursued an entirely
  new career in neuroscience.</p>

  <p>In 1977, I was appointed proleptic Director
  of the MRC Laboratory to succeed <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">Max Perutz</a> on his
  retirement in 1979. However, I immediately took over the
  financial management of the laboratory and spent several years in
  trying to get the finances on a proper basis. These were times of
  hyperinflation in Britian and not enough attention had been given
  to the rising costs of our research. I often referred to myself
  as the epileptic Director. During this period, I became
  interested in how the new techniques of cloning and sequencing
  DNA could influence the study of genetics and I was an early and
  active proponent of the Human Genome Sequencing Project. By 1985,
  I found that the administrative load of the Director was becoming
  tiresome and interfering with what I still wanted to do in
  research and so when I was asked whether I wanted to continue as
  Director after 1987 when my term of appointment ended, I jumped
  at the opportunity and left the laboratory in 1986 when my
  successor took office. The MRC gave me a small Unit and, with
  some added resources, I set up a Unit of Molecular Genetics based
  in the Department of Medicine where space was provided for me by
  Professor Keith Peters. It was in this Unit that the pufferfish
  project began. The Unit was closed by the MRC in 1992 when I was
  65 but I continued the laboratory with other support for some
  years thereafter. In the meantime, it became imperative for
  health reasons that I spend the winter months in a warmer climate
  and Richard Lerner made this possible by giving me a part time
  appointment in The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
  California. Here I found I could pursue new interests in
  chemistry and especially in the interface between chemistry and
  biology. I also became involved in a company in the San Francisco
  Bay Area called Lynx where together with another friend, Sam
  Eletr, we developed a new massively parallel method for
  sequencing DNA. In 1995, I founded The Molecular
  Sciences Institute with a gift from the Philip Morris Company
  where I hoped that we could create an environment where young
  people could pursue science in an atmosphere of harmonious
  purpose and high intellectual challenge. I retired from the
  Institute in 2000 and in 2001 was appointed a Distinguished
  Professor in the Salk Institute in La Jolla where I rejoined
  Francis Crick.</p>

  <p>I owe a great debt to the many people who
  have helped me in my life. My parents would have preferred me to
  become a surgeon or a physician but were most understanding of
  the ambitions of their son. My wife and family have borne the
  burden of a preoccupied husband and father for fifty years.
  Living most of the time in a world created mostly in one's head,
  does not make for an easy passage in the real world. Throughout
  my scientific life and in all my projects I have been joined by
  many scientists, young and old, whose work was absolutely
  essential for the success of our scientific endeavours. Many have
  gone on to do important scientific work but all remember those
  wonderful times when we and our science were young and our
  excitement in meeting new challenges knew no bounds. I believe
  that a scientist should be judged by the quality of the people he
  has helped to produce and not by prizes or other honours bestowed
  on him. Let my works speak for themselves.</p>

  <p>I am still, at the age of 76, excited by
  scientific research and the prospect of what can be done in
  biology. Science is something one is tied to for life and one
  should never retire from anything until one has secured one's
  next job. The endless quest for knowledge will continue as long
  as humans exist.</p>
