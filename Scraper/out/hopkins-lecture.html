  <h2>The Earlier History of Vitamin Research</h2>

  <p>When the present century began, animal
  nutrition was being viewed too exclusively from the standpoint of
  energy requirements. The fundamental pioneer work of Rubner and
  its later extension to human subjects in the remarkable
  enterprise of Atwater, Benedict, Rosa, and others in the United
  States could not fail to produce a deep impression upon the
  thought of the time. The quantitative character of the data
  obtained and the attractive circumstance that such data appeared
  to supply a real measure of nutritional needs, independent of,
  and apparently superior to, considerations based upon chemical
  details, induced a feeling that knowledge concerning these needs
  had become highly adequate and was approximating even to
  finality. As a matter of fact, however, these calorimetric
  studies, invaluable in themselves, were then leading to doctrinal
  teaching which contained inherent errors. So fundamental an
  aspect of the then dominant doctrine as, for instance, the law of
  isodynamic equivalence among foodstuffs, is at the most
  approximately true, and fails entirely when the equivalence is
  tested by physiological results rather than by purely physical
  data. The assumption indeed that carbohydrates and fats can
  replace each other indefinitely in a diet, so long as the total
  energy supplied remains the same, has led to serious errors in
  practical dietetics. More serious in leading to error was the
  assumption that all proteins were of equal nutritive value, and
  most serious of all in this respect was, as we now know, the
  belief that proteins, carbohydrate, fat, and suitable in organic
  materials supplied in themselves all the needs of the organism.
  Inhibitory, moreover, was the odd assumption often to be detected
  in the writings of leading authorities that to view nutritional
  needs from the standpoint of energetics was not alone more
  convenient, but more scientific, and even more philosophical,
  than to discuss them in terms of the material supply.</p>

  <p>It must, of course, be most fully
  recognized that the calorimetric studies so dominant twenty years
  ago and, no less, the quantitative studies of respiratory
  exchange which aided and extended them, provided knowledge which
  is of the utmost importance and a permanent asset of science. The
  prime demand of the active organism is for energy, and when all
  the more specific demands are met in a well-balanced food supply,
  the available energy becomes, of course, the limiting factor
  which determines the adequacy of that supply. The studies in
  question were, moreover, usually made upon subjects consuming
  natural foods, and the diet was therefore, in general,
  sufficiently well balanced. When it was not, the inevitable
  brevity of calorimetric observations failed to reveal effects of
  dietetic deficiencies which require time for their display. Such
  studies have therefore retained their value and will yet
  doubtless be extended: but had they continued to dominate the
  whole field of activity, had they not been supplemented by a more
  discriminative enquiry into the various factors which determine
  real adequacy in nutrition, our knowledge would have remained
  highly imperfect, and our views erroneous. For now that the
  organic material factors present in dietaries actually capable of
  maintaining normal nutrition for long periods have been more
  carefully explored, it has become evident that, so far from
  comprising protein, fat, and carbohydrate alone, they are many
  and diverse, and each is indispensable. We have even come to know
  that a diet which, apparently at least, will support the
  individual throughout life may yet lack a factor which is
  necessary to maintain an adequate capacity for parentage, so the
  diversity of materials indispensable for normality is seen to be
  yet greater. The complexity of these nutritional needs as we now
  view them is indeed astonishing.</p>

  <p>We find them displayed in the details of
  the protein supply, in the call for a right balance among the
  inorganic constituents of a diet, and, particularly, in the
  urgent call of the body for a number of organic substances
  specific in nature and function, in respect of which, however,
  the quantitative supply is, in accordance with the demand, so
  small as to contribute little or nothing to the energy factor in
  nutrition. These substances, following the suggestion of Casimir
  Funk, we have agreed to call <i>vitamins</i>.</p>

  <p>Who was the "discoverer" of vitamins? This
  question has no clear answer. So often in the development of
  science, a fundamental idea is foreshadowed in many quarters but
  has long to wait before it emerges as a basis of accepted
  knowledge. As in other cases, so with recognition of vitamins as
  physiological necessities. Their existence was foreshadowed long
  ago, but a certain right moment in the history of the science of
  nutrition had to arrive before it could attain to universal
  recognition. Some workers had discovered suggestive facts, but
  failed to realize their full significance. On the other hand, the
  work and words of true pioneers lay forgotten because published
  when average minds were not ready to appraise them at their right
  value.</p>

  <p>Some fifteen or sixteen years ago, the
  importance of vitamins became somewhat suddenly recognized. So
  enormous now is the existing literature concerning them, so
  complex and, sometimes, so uncertain, are the issues raised, that
  it is impossible to survey the subject adequately in a single
  lecture. The circumstances of my most enviable position here
  today will justify me in dealing rather with the earlier history
  of the subject, and I will venture in virtue of that position to
  put before you certain personal experiences which have no place
  in the proper history of the subject. They have not been, and
  will not be, published elsewhere.</p>

  <p>No one can deny that the recorded
  experience of voyagers and explorers in the eighteenth century,
  and particularly perhaps the records of the British Navy which
  deal with the incidence and cure of scurvy, would have directed
  thought towards our modern conception of vitamins, had the times
  been ripe. The knowledge concerning nutrition was then, however,
  entirely vague, and the days of experiment in such matters had
  not yet come. The earliest experiments indeed supplied evidence
  which was of an independent kind reached from a different
  angle.</p>

  <p>It is now generally agreed that the first
  clear evidence, based upon experiment, for the existence of
  dietary factors of the nature of vitamins came from the school of
  Bunge at Basel. In 1881 Lunin, one of the workers in that school,
  fed mice upon an artificial mixture of the separate constituents
  of milk; of all the constituents, that is, which were then known,
  namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. He found
  that upon such a mixture the animals failed to survive and was
  led to conclude that "a natural food such as milk must therefore
  contain besides these known principal ingredients small
  quantities of unknown substances essential to life". Such a
  statement, already half a century old, when allowed to stand out
  clear and apart from a context which tended to bury it, seems to
  contain the essentials of what is believed today.</p>

  <p>It will not be uninstructive to seek for an
  explanation as to how such a significant remark could remain for
  years almost without notice, instead of being an immediate
  challenge to further investigation. It may be noted first of all
  that the title of Lunin's paper, "Ueber die Bedeutung der
  anorganischen Salze f&uuml;r die Ern&auml;hrung des Thieres" was
  one prone to conceal the important but incidental suggestion it
  contained. The thought of the Bunge school was, as a matter of
  fact, both then and long afterwards concerned largely with the
  inorganic factors of nutrition. After an interval of ten years,
  during which, so far as one can discover, no effort had been made
  to follow up the pregnant suggestion of Lunin's work, another
  member of the school came again to Lunin's point of view. He,
  however, was once more concerned primarily with the study of an
  inorganic element in nutrition. Socin, the worker in questin,
  though, as the title of his paper, "In welcher Form ist das isen
  resorbiert?", indicates, he had not set out to seek further for
  those wholly unknown substances essential to life, the existence
  of which Lunin had predicted, was nevertheless owing to the
  nature of his experiments inevitably driven to a belief in them.
  Socin, it is true, was led to think that the ineffectiveness of
  the synthetic diets employed by him might be due to an inadequacy
  in the quality of the protein contained in them, a view not
  wholly unjustified and foreshadowing knowledge which only long
  afterwards became definite and proven. He became clear, however,
  that other and unknown substances must be sought, substances
  which, he remarks, are certainly present in whole milk and
  egg-yolk. He remarks, moreover, with conviction that to discover
  them was the first task to be faced, before new feeding
  experiments are undertaken. Here was a strong enough challenge to
  investigate, yet we have again, I think, no knowledge of any
  attempt in Bunge's laboratory to follow up the challenge. Perhaps
  an explanation of this is to be found in the circumstances that
  Bunge, though in his well-known book he remarks that it would be
  worth-while to continue the experiments which had suggested the
  existence of unknown nutritional factors, was, as I happen to
  know, himself inclined to disbelieve in them. He thought that the
  real error in the synthetic diets used by his pupils (which was,
  so to speak, "dissected milk") was that the method of its
  preparation had involved the separation of inorganic constituents
  from certain organic combinations in which latter form alone
  could they adequately subserve the purposes of metabolism. Other
  causes may have contributed to the long neglect, first of Lunin's
  and then of Socin's suggestions, and it must be admitted indeed
  that no experimentum crucis was carried out in Bunge's
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>In Lunin's experiments the fate of six mice
  only (those placed by him upon a normal salt mixture) really
  suggested the existence of unknown factors; and no data are given
  as to their consumption of food. Neither Lunin nor Socin made any
  attempt to complete the evidence by making discriminative
  additions to the diets which had proved inadequate. Lastly, as I
  have already suggested, since the main intention of their work,
  and the titles of their publications, were remote from the
  special issue, their significant remarks might well appear as
  mere obiter dicta when read without the light of modern
  developments.</p>

  <p>Yet the pregnant suggestions arising from
  the observations just discussed did ultimately, though not for
  fourteen years after the latest of them were published, awaken
  (as we may suppose) the interest of an investigator distinguished
  in many fields who was led to repeat and extend them. I allude to
  the late Professor Pekelharing, whose own observations (published
  in 1905) unhappily again remained unknown to the majority till
  very recently. It is indeed astonishing that the results of such
  significant work as his, though published in the Dutch language
  alone, should not have become rapidly broadcast. I cannot refrain
  from referring to the circumstance that the paper was not
  abstracted or mentioned in Maly's <i>Jahresbericht f&uuml;r
  Thierchemie</i>, so adequate, and in general so complete, in its
  dealings with current literature. Many of us were accustomed to
  rely upon it for references to work published in journals that we
  could not consult, or in a language that we could not read.
  Though other work by Pekelharing was duly recorded at this time,
  no mention was made of the extraordinarily interesting paper in
  question. My own experiments began soon after the paper was
  published, and as a proportion of my own work was very similar to
  that of Pekelharing, I shall never cease to regret that, in
  common with so many others, I was then completely ignorant of the
  latter. After speaking of experiments carried out on lines
  similar to some of those done in Bunge's laboratory, and
  indicating that they pointed to the existence of some unknown
  essential, Pekelharing goes on to say: "Till now my efforts,
  constantly repeated during the last few years, to separate this
  substance and get to know more about it, have not led to a
  satisfactory result, so I shall not say any more about them. My
  intention is only to point out that there is a still unknown
  substance in milk which even in very small quantities is of
  paramount importance to nutrition. If this substance is absent,
  the organism loses the power properly to assimilate the
  well-known principal parts of food, the appetite is lost and with
  apparent abundance the animals die of want. Undoubtedly this
  substance occurs not only in milk but in all sorts of foodstuffs
  both of vegetable and animal origin." Here we have a clear
  statement of the vitamin doctrine already a quarter of a century
  old. It is noteworthy that Pekelharing records prolonged
  endeavours towards the isolation of a vitamin.</p>

  <p>Between the publications of Lunin, Socin
  and that of Pekelharing appeared the extremely important papers
  of Professor Eijkman. There is no need for me to discuss those
  remarkable publications. A most adequate review of them is fresh
  in your minds. The fundamental importance of Professor Eijkman's.
  work to the whole subject of <i>vitamins</i> and <i>deficiency
  diseases</i> is now universally recognized. It would be difficult
  to rejoice wholeheartedly in one's own good fortune had I not the
  happiness of sharing with him the Nobel Prize for Medicine.</p>

  <p>In my own earlier thought about the
  subject, though in so far as I was familiar with Eijkman's
  observations I could not fail to recognize their importance, yet
  I thought of them in a wrong and too narrow category. Eijkman's
  own earlier teaching as based on his results was that the
  function of the substance in the cortex was to neutralize a
  nutritional error due to excess of carbohydrate in a diet of
  rice. A substance which functions in the neutralization of an
  error is not the same thing as a substance universally necessary,
  and it was to the existence of substances of the latter type that
  my own thoughts had turned. Eijkman did not at first visualize
  beriberi clearly as a deficiency disease; but the view that the
  cortical substance in rice supplied a need rather than
  neutralized a poison was soon after put forward by Grijns and
  ultimately accepted by Professor Eijkman himself. I was myself,
  however, quite ignorant of these later views when my experiments
  were begun twenty-four years ago.</p>

  <p><br>
  It is abundantly clear that before the last century closed, there
  was already ample evidence available to show that the needs of
  nutrition could not be adequately defined in terms of calories,
  proteins, and salts alone. How came it then that this limited
  definition was then in vogue and so remained for the first ten
  years of the present century, while no effective attention was
  given to the facts which have been discussed? The main reason, I
  feel sure, is that the minds of the leaders of thought in
  <i>nutritional science</i> were obsessed by a sense of the
  overwhelming importance of calorimetric studies with their
  impressive technique. A few experiments done mostly on small
  animals, and not very quantitative or crucial in their nature,
  were at best unimpressive. The former studies were clearly
  scientific and sound; the results of the latter appeared to be on
  a less sound basis, while deficiency diseases, in so far as their
  existence was proven, seemed to stand in so special a category
  that their indications might be neglected when the needs of
  normal nutrition were being estimated.</p>

  <p>No general or widespread belief in the view
  that an adequate diet must contain indispensable constituents
  other than adequate calories, a minimum of protein, and a proper
  mineral supply, could be said to exist till the years 1911-1912.
  Those years saw the appearance of my own publications. Thereafter
  started a period of great activity in the study of the facts:
  immediately in the United States of America, a little later, and
  still more after the war, in many centres. I will now refer to my
  own experiments, and will also intrude upon your patience with a
  reference to those personal experiences of which I spoke at the
  beginning of this address.</p>

  <p>Early in my career I became convinced that
  current teaching concerning nutrition was inadequate, and while
  still a student in hospital in the earlier eighteen nineties I
  made up my mind that the part played by nutritional errors in the
  causation of disease was underrated. The current treatment of
  scurvy and rickets seemed to me to ignore the significance of the
  old recorded observations. I had then a great ambition to study
  those diseases from a nutritional standpoint; but fate decreed
  that I was to lose contact with clinical material. I had to
  employ myself in the laboratory on more academic lines. I
  realized, however, as did many others at the last century's
  close, that for a full understanding of nutrition, no less than
  for an understanding of so many other aspects of biochemistry,
  further knowledge of proteins was then a prerequisite; and when I
  was first called to the University of Cambridge I did my best to contribute
  to that knowledge.</p>

  <p>As an ultimate outcome of my experiments
  dealing with the relative metabolic importance of individual
  amino acids from protein, my attention was inevitably turned,
  without, I think, knowledge, or at any rate without memory, of
  the earlier work, to the necessity for supplying other factors
  than the then recognized basal elements of diet if the growth and
  health of an animal were to be maintained. This indeed must at
  any time come home to every observer who employs in feeding
  experiments a synthetic dietary composed of adequately purified
  materials. It was the experience of the workers in Bunge's
  laboratory long ago; it was, as we have lately learned, the
  experience of Pekelharing. A good many investigators using
  synthetic dietaries have, it is true, from time to time expressed
  doubts upon the point, but we now know that it was because the
  constituents they used were not pure and not free from adherent
  vitamins. In 1906-1907 I convinced myself by experiments, carried
  out, as were those of Lunin and Socin, upon mice, that those
  small animals at any rate could not survive upon a mixture of the
  basal foodstuffs alone. I was especially struck at this time, I
  remember, by striking differences in the apparent nutritive value
  of different supplies of casein in my possession. One sample used
  as a protein supply in a synthetic dietary might support moderate
  growth, while another failed even to maintain the animals. I
  found that a sample of the former sort, if thoroughly washed with
  water and alcohol, lost its power of support, while addition of
  the very small amount of extract restored this power and also, if
  added to the samples originally inadequate, made them to some
  degree efficient in maintaining growth. I found further at that
  time (1906-1907) that small amounts of a yeast extract were more
  efficient than the casein extracts. Similar experiences were
  encountered when otherwise adequate mixtures of amino acids were
  used to replace intact proteins. By sheer good fortune, as it
  afterwards turned out, I used butter as a fat supply in these
  early experiments. Upon the evidence of these earlier results I
  made a public statement in 1907 which has been often quoted. I
  cannot, however, justly base any claims for any sort of priority
  upon it, as my experimental evidence was not given on that
  occasion. It was indeed not till four years later that I
  published any experimental data. In explanation of this delay I
  would ask you to consider the circumstances of the time. The
  early experiments of Lunin and others had been forgotten by most;
  the calorimetric studies held the field and tentative suggestions
  concerning their inadequacy were, I found, received with
  hesitation among my physiological acquaintances. It seemed that a
  somewhat rigid proof of the facts would be necessary before
  publication was desirable. Thus came the great temptation to
  endeavour to isolate the active substance or substances before
  publication, and I can claim that throughout the year 1909 I was
  engaged upon such attempts, though without success. At this time
  I was using what is now the classic subject for vitamin studies,
  namely the rat. As I was concerned with the maintenance of growth
  in the animal, the tests applied to successive products of a
  fractionation took much longer than those which could be used in
  studying the cure of polyneuritis in birds by what we have
  learned to call vitamin B, so the work occupied much time. I may
  perhaps be allowed to mention what was for me a somewhat
  unfortunate happening in the beginning of 1910, as it is
  instructive. A commercial firm had prepared for me a special
  extract of a very large quantity of yeast made on lines that I
  had found effective on a small scale. With this I intended to
  repeat some fractionations which had appeared promising. I
  thought, however, upon trial that the whole product was inactive
  and it was thrown away. The real explanation, however, was that
  instead of using butter, as in earlier experiments, I at this
  moment determined to use lard, and my supply of this, as I
  learned to understand much later, was doubtless deficient in
  vitamins A and D; I was now giving my animals in the main the
  B-group alone. If I had then had the acumen to suspect that any
  of the substances I was seeking might be associated with fat I
  should have progressed faster. Later in 1910, if I may intrude so
  personal a matter, I suffered a severe breakdown in health, and
  could do nothing further during the year. On my return to work I
  felt that the evidence I had by then accumulated would be greatly
  strengthened by a study of the energy consumption of rats, on the
  one hand when failing on diets free from the accessory factors
  (as I had then come to call them), and, on the other hand, when,
  as the result of the addition of minute quantities of milk, they
  were growing vigorously. These experiments took a long time, but
  they showed conclusively, as at that time it seemed necessary to
  show, that the failure in the former group of animals was not due
  primarily, or at the outset of the feeding, to any deficiency in
  the total uptake of food.</p>

  <p>My 1912 paper is sometimes unfairly quoted
  as though its bearing applied only to the influence of minimal
  quantities of milk upon nutrition. It will be found, however,
  that it emphasizes on general lines the indispensable nature of
  food constituents which were then receiving no serious
  consideration as physiological necessities.</p>

  <p>In a personal endeavour to estimate the
  influence of my publications in 1912 upon the opinion of the
  time, and their relative importance in the initiation of that
  great activity in kindred studies which shortly followed their
  appearance, I have found it necessary to consider at the same
  time, and particularly, the work and writings of Casimir Funk. It
  is sure that, until the period 1911-1912, the earlier suggestions
  in the literature pointing to the existence of vitamins lay
  buried. There is no evidence, I think, that they were affecting
  the orientation of any authoritative teaching concerning the
  phenomena of normal nutrition either at the time in question or
  indeed, in any effective sense, before.</p>

  <p>A few years ago in the American journal
  <i>Science</i>, Funk published a short article in which, after
  giving me some credit for prophetic vision, he protests against
  my being called the "discoverer of vitamins". In this protest he
  was justified; I have certainly never made any personal claim to
  be their "discoverer", and all the past circumstances of which I
  have reminded you, have deprived perhaps every individual worker
  of that clear title. Funk, however, further remarks in the
  article mentioned that my chief paper appeared too late to affect
  the situation to any appreciable degree; a remark which I believe
  to be entirely unjust.</p>

  <p>F. R&ouml;hmann, an experienced worker on
  nutritional problems, and much concerned with the chemical side
  of them, but one who never fully believed in the claims made for
  vitamins, wrote in 1916 after discussing the earlier literature
  "Als der geistige Vater der Vitaminlehre ist wohl Gowland Hopkins
  zu betrachten, w&auml;hrend die Bezeichnung Vitamine von Casimir
  Funk herstammt." Such a statement without extension does of
  course far less than justice to Funk's influence, which in many
  ways was important. Funk himself, however, made no experiments
  which bore upon the physiological functions of vitamins until
  long after my paper had appeared.</p>

  <p>Funk's first entry into kindred fields was
  in a paper published in December 1911, describing his earliest
  efforts to isolate the curative substance from rice polishings.
  He continued this effort, and further papers appeared in 1912,
  when Suzuki and others were also describing their endeavours to
  isolate the substance. Funk's attempt was extremely praiseworthy,
  and his publications doubtless awakened new interest in Eijkman's
  original discovery. He did not, however, succeed in isolating any
  substance which has since been accepted as being in fact any
  actual vitamin of the B-group, and the papers in question contain
  no suggestion bearing on the general' physiological importance of
  vitamins.</p>

  <p>In June 1912, however, Funk published a
  paper dealing with the Etiology of Deficiency Diseases, which was
  a valuable summary of the existing knowledge concerning such
  conditions, and here he showed more clearly than had been shown
  before, how definite a group is constituted by these diseases. He
  also emphasized in an interesting way and in advance of general
  opinion, the view that pellagra would prove to be one of them.
  This review contains, however, no account of personal work other
  than the attempts already mentioned to isolate the anti-beriberi
  factor. A short final section purports to relate the available
  knowledge concerning deficiency diseases to the facts of normal
  metabolism and nutrition. I feel justified in saying that this
  section is written in a manner which is essentially disingenuous.
  The author says, for instance, "I suppose that the substance
  facilitating growth found in milk is similar to, if not identical
  with, the <i>vitamins</i> described by me." But Funk had then
  "described" no vitamins. He had in this review - the merits of
  which I have already emphasized - on theoretical grounds and with
  reliance mainly on the work of others - only made the doubtless
  very significant suggestion that each deficiency disease might
  depend upon the absence of its own specific factor. He admits
  knowledge of the existence of my experimental results; knowledge
  obtained - according to a footnote - through a "private
  communication". In the article in Science to which I have earlier
  referred, Funk states on the other hand that he had in 1912 no
  knowledge of my work. I am entitled to say that early in October
  1911, I gave a very full account of my 'results at a meeting of
  the English Biochemical Club, and I certainly obtained the
  impression during the succeeding months that they had become
  well-known to English physiologists and biochemists
  generally.<a href="#footnote*">*</a></p>

  <p>In closing these references to Casimir
  Funk's writings and to his earlier work I would like to make
  clear my belief that he has not received too much, but too
  little, credit for his vitamin work as a whole. I venture to
  think, however, that he was in no sense my predecessor in the
  physiological field. I may say that till now I have had no
  intention of commenting on his remarks in the <i>Science</i>
  article of 1925. Only the peculiar circumstances of my present
  position, which seem incompatible with his view, have led me to
  discuss it.</p>

  <p>Very soon after my chief paper appeared the
  study of vitamins was, as you know, developed with great energy
  and success in the United States. We owe especially to Osborne
  and Mendel, and to McCollum and his co-workers, the all important
  work which continued during the earlier years of the war. The
  proof on the part of the American authors of the distinction
  between what were then known as the "water soluble" and "fat
  soluble" vitamins was the fast clear evidence of diversity among
  the vitamin factors required for growth. This discovery made all
  later studies more discriminating, and the pioneer work of the
  authors mentioned was of the greatest importance. So prominent
  indeed was the American work at this time, and so large a
  proportion did it form of the total output from 1912 to near the
  end of the war that, if I wished to claim that my own
  publications exerted any real and effective influence in starting
  a new movement in the study of dietetics, I should have to
  convince myself that they helped to direct the thoughts of the
  Harvard and Baltimore investigators. Anyone reading with care the
  succession of papers describing their experimental studies before
  and after the appearance of my own publications in 1912, will, I
  think, become convinced that such directive influence was indeed
  exerted. This circumstance and much correspondence received at
  the time from European colleagues made me feel then that my
  papers had served the purpose I had wished for it, namely, to
  direct thought concerning normal nutrition into a channel which,
  if not new, had been long and strangely neglected. For a time
  indeed I thought that channel to be even new. I was at least a
  pioneer whose efforts were not wasted, and I am always now
  content to recall an opinion expressed by the late Franz
  Hofmeister, the most just, if also the most generous of critics.
  Hofmeister in 1918, after an exhaustive study of the whole
  literature, speaks of me as the first to realize the full
  significance of the facts. If that be true, and if, as well may
  be, that has been the view of the Nobel Commissioners who have
  thought me worthy of so great a reward, I can happily enjoy my
  good fortune.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote*"></a>* On February 28th
  and again on March 8th, 1911, the London <i>Daily Mail</i> gave
  great publicity to certain statements of my own which, though
  distorted for journalistic purposes, made essentially clear the
  conception of vitamins as based upon my personal experiments.
  These articles were quoted in the continental and, with especial
  freedom, in the American press. At the time I much regretted this
  unsought publicity. My main paper, the publication of which was
  much delayed in the press, appeared in the month following Funk's
  review.</p>
