  <h1>Artturi Virtanen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="virtanen.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Artturi Ilmari Virtanen</b>
  was born in Helsinki on the 15th of January, 1895, as the son of
  Kaarlo Virtanen and Serafiina Isotalo. He was educated at the
  Classical Lyceum at Viipuri, Finland. After finishing school, he
  studied chemistry, biology, and physics at the University of
  Helsinki, where he took his M.Sc. in 1916 and obtained his
  D.Sc. in 1919. Subsequently he studied physical chemistry in
  Zurich in 1920 under G. Wiegner, bacteriology in Stockholm in
  1921 under Chr. Barthel, and enzymology in Stockholm during
  1923-1924 under <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/index.html">H.
  von Euler</a>. Since 1923, his interest turned to
  biochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  He was first-assistant of the Central Laboratory of Industries at
  Helsinki during 1916-1917, and chemist in the Laboratory of
  Valio, Finnish Cooperative Dairies' Association, during
  1919-1920. In 1921 he became Director of this laboratory, and in
  1931 of the Biochemical Research Institute at Helsinki. After
  having been docent in chemistry at the University of Helsinki
  since 1924, he was appointed Professor of Biochemistry at the
  Finland Institute of Technology at Helsinki in 1931, and at the
  University of Helsinki in 1939. Since 1948 he has been member and
  President of the State Academy of Science and Arts in
  Finland.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Virtanen is a member of the Finnish, Norwegian,
  Swedish, Flemish, Bavarian, and Pontifical Academies of Science,
  and of the Swedish and Danish Academies of Engineering Sciences.
  He is an honorary member of learned societies in Finland, Sweden,
  Austria, Edinburgh, and the U.S.A., and holds honorary degrees of
  the Universities of Lund, Paris, Giessen, and
  Helsinki, the Royal Technical College at Stockholm, and the
  Finland Institute of Technology. Numerous medals and other
  distinctions have been conferred upon him from Sweden, Finland,
  Belgium, and Italy.<br>

  Virtanen established the indispensability of cozymase in lactic
  and propionic acid fermentations, as well as the phosphorylation
  of sugar (1924). In these works the similarity of different
  fermentation processes as to the first stages in the
  decomposition of sugar became apparent. Together with his
  collaborators he continued the fermentation experiments, special
  attention being paid to the mechanism of different bacterial
  fermentations. The fermentation of dioxyaceton to glycerol and
  glyceric acid in the presence of phosphates by the effect of
  <i>Coli</i> bacteria (1929) was the first sugar fermentation
  which was elucidated chemically from beginning to end. In this
  work attention was also paid to the adaptive formation of
  enzymes, which phenomenon his collaborator H. Karstr&ouml;m
  treated in great detail in his doctor's thesis (constitutive and
  adaptive enzymes). The phenomenon of adaptation, and in
  connection with it the uptake of nutrients by cells, is still
  subjected to investigations in his laboratory. The concept that
  almost all proteins in bacterial cells are enzyme proteins led to
  investigations on the relation between the protein content and
  enzymic activity of cells.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1925, the biological nitrogen fixation which takes place in
  the root nodules of leguminous plants has been subjected to
  many-sided investigations in his laboratory. The importance of
  the red pigment, leghaemoglobin, in active root nodules for the
  fixation of nitrogen was proved.<br>
  <br>
  The formation of vitamins in plants, as well as the ability of
  plants to utilize organic nitrogen compounds as their nitrogen
  source, have been treated in many publications from his
  laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  Since the end of the 1940's, the chemical composition of higher
  plants has been given special attention in his laboratory. A
  large number of new amino acids have been isolated from different
  plants, and have been characterized chemically. Numerous organic
  sulphur compounds, which may be of importance for the nutrition
  of man and domestic animals, have also been isolated from
  vegetables and fodder plants.<br>
  <br>
  The application of biochemistry to agriculture and the dairy
  industry belongs to the practical activities of his laboratory.
  Among works performed in this field are the creation of a
  theoretical basis for the preservation of fresh fodder and the
  development of a practical method on this basis (the AIV method),
  with the aim to promote an effective utilization of protein-rich
  crops, and to produce milk of the same vitamin content in winter
  as that produced on summer pastures. Investigations aiming at the
  improvement of the quality of dairy products also have to be
  mentioned as belonging to the field of applied research.<br>

  Virtanen married Lilja Moisio in 1920; they have two sons, Kaarlo
  and Olavi.</p>
