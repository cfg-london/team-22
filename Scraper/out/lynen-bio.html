  <h1>Feodor Lynen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lynen.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Feodor
  Lynen</b> was born in Munich on 6 April 1911, the son of Wilhelm
  Lynen, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Munich
  Technische Hochschule. His mother, Frieda, was the daughter of
  the manufacturer Gustav Prym. Lynen completed his primary and
  secondary schooling in Munich, and in 1930 matriculated at the
  chemistry department of Munich University. Those who were to
  become responsible for his scientific training included Heinrich
  Wieland, Otto H&ouml;nigschmidt, Kasimir Fajans, and Walter
  Gerlach. The most enduring impression was left by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1927/index.html">Heinrich Wieland</a>, who
  had won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1927 and under whom
  Lynen graduated in March 1937 with the work: &laquo;On the Toxic
  Substances in Amanita&raquo;. On completion of his doctoral thesis
  Lynen became acquainted under his guidance with the dynamic field
  of biochemistry, to which he has remained faithful to this
  day.<br>
  <br>
  Lynen has also remained faithful to Munich University, where he
  became a chemistry lecturer in 1942, assistant professor in 1947,
  and biochemistry professor in 1953. In addition, in 1954 he
  became head of the Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Zellchemie, newly
  created for him as a result of the initiative of <a href=
  "../1931/index.html">Otto Warburg</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/index.html">Otto Hahn</a>, then
  President of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur F&ouml;rderung der
  Wissenschaften. In this way Lynen acquired outstanding
  opportunities for scientific research.<br>
  <br>
  Lynen's work has been devoted to the elucidation of the chemical
  details of metabolic processes in living cells, and of the
  mechanisms of metabolic regulation. The problems tackled by him,
  in conjunction with German and other workers, include the Pasteur
  effect, acetic acid degradation in yeast, the chemical structure
  of &laquo;activated acetic acid&raquo; of &laquo;activated
  isoprene&raquo;, of &laquo;activated carboxylic acid&raquo;, and of
  cytohaemin, degradation of fatty acids and formation of
  acetoacetic acid, degradation of tararic acid, biosynthesis of
  cysteine, of terpenes, of rubber, and of fatty acids.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 Lynen received the Neuberg Medal of the American Society
  of European Chemists and Pharmacists, in 1955 the Liebig
  Commemorative Medal of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, in
  1961 the Carus Medal of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher
  &laquo;Leopoldina&raquo;, and in 1963 the Otto Warburg Medal of the
  Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Physiologische Chemie.<br>
  <br>
  He is a member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Munich and
  of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher
  &laquo;Leopoldina&raquo; in Halle, honorary member of the
  Harvey Society in New York, the American Society of Biological
  Chemists in Washington, the Asociacion Venezolana para el Avance
  de la Ciencia in Caracas, foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
  America in Washington, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in
  Boston. He has received an honorary doctorate from the faculty of
  medicine of the University of Freiburg i. Br.<br>
  <br>
  On January 1st, 1972, Prof. Feodor Lynen was appointed President
  of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker (GDCh).<br>
  <br>
  He was married on 14 May 1937 to Eva Wieland, daughter of his
  academic teacher. They have five children: Peter, born in 1938;
  Annemarie, born in 1941; Susanne, born in 1945; Heinrich and
  Eva-Maria, born in 1946.</p>
