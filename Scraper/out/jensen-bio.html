  <h1>Johannes V. Jensen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="jensen.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on the 20th of January, 1873, in
  a village in North Jutland, the second son of the district
  veterinary surgeon, H. Jensen, a descendant on both sides of
  farmers and craftsmen. In 1893, at the age of twenty, I graduated
  from the Cathedral School of Viborg, and subsequently studied
  medicine for three years at the University of
  Copenhagen. I earned my living by my pen until it became
  necessary for me to choose between further studies and
  literature. The grounding in natural sciences which I obtained in
  the course of my medical studies, including preliminary
  examinations in botany, zoology, physics, and chemistry, was to
  become decisive in determining the trend of my literary
  work.<br>
  <br>
  My literary career began near the turn of the century with the
  publication of <i>Himmerlandshistorier</i> (1898-1910)
  [Himmerland Stories], comprising a series of tales set in that
  part of Denmark where I was born. This was followed in the years
  up to 1944 by &laquo;legends&raquo; and&laquo;myths&raquo;
  representing literary forms I have particularly liked, and of
  which nine volumes have appeared (<i>Myter</i>, 1907-45 [Myths]).
  I have also written poetry, a few plays, and many essays, chiefly
  on anthropology and the philosophy of evolution.<br>
  <br>
  For many years I was engaged in journalism, writing articles and
  chronicles for the daily press without ever joining the staff of
  any newspaper. Nor have I ever belonged to any political party.
  After extensive journeys to the East, to Malaya and China, and
  several visits to the United States, I inspired a change in the
  Danish literature and press by introducing English and American
  vigour, which was to replace the then dominant trend of decadent
  Gallicism. The essence of my literary work is to be found in my
  collection of poems, which may be regarded as a reaction against
  the fastidious style of the day bearing Baudelaire's poisonous
  hall-mark. My poems represented a turn to simple style and sound
  subject matter (<i>Digte, 1904-41</i>, 1943 [Poems]).<br>
  <br>
  A probing analysis of the problems of evolution forms the basis
  of my prose. During half a century of literary work, I have
  endeavoured to introduce the philosophy of evolution into the
  sphere of literature, and to inspire my readers to think in
  evolutionary terms. I was prompted to do this because of the
  misinterpretation and distortion of Darwinism at the end of the
  19th century. The concept of the <i>&Uuml;bermensch</i> had
  disastrous consequences in that it led to two world wars, and was
  destroyed only with the collapse of Germany in 1945. In the
  course of opposing this fallacious doctrine, I have arrived at a
  new interpretation of the theory of evolution and its moral
  implications.</p>
