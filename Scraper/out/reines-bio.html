  <h1>Frederick Reines - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="reines.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Paterson, New Jersey on
  March 16, 1918, the youngest of four children. My parents, Israel
  and Gussie (Cohen), had met and married in New York City after
  emigrating to the United States from the same small town in
  Russia. A paternal relative in Russia, the Rabbi Isaac Jacob
  Reines (1839-1915), was famous for his role in founding the
  Religious Zionist movement, Mizrachi. Manually very skilled and
  to some extent a frustrated machinist, my father worked as a
  weaver before World War I, started a silk mill business after the
  war, and eventually moved to Hillburn, New York, where he ran a
  general store. My early childhood memories center around this
  typical American country store and life in a small American town,
  including 4th of July celebrations marked by fireworks and
  patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand. As a child, I
  enjoyed building things and participating in group singing in
  school. Music, and singing in particular, was to become a central
  lifelong interest of mine. The first stirrings of interest in
  science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at
  religious school, when, looking out of the window at twilight
  through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed
  something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of
  diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.<br>
  <br>
  My early education was strongly influenced by my older siblings.
  Our home had many books due principally to the educational
  interests of my sister and two brothers, all of whom where
  serious students engaged in professional studies; my sister
  became a doctor of medicine and my brothers became lawyers. Among
  my activities was membership in the Boy Scouts; I rose each year
  through the ranks, eventually achieving the rank of Eagle Scout
  and undertaking leadership roles in the organization. My
  scientific interests also blossomed during this time in the Boy
  Scouts, where I began to build crystal radios "from scratch." By
  this time the family had returned to New Jersey, and I was a
  student at Union Hill High School. In school, I was initially
  more attracted to literary interests and did not do as well in
  science studies. However, by my junior and senior years in high
  school this situation turned around aufficiently to point me in
  the direction of science. I was strongly encouraged by a science
  teacher who took an interest in me and presented me with a key to
  the laboratory to allow me to work whenever I wanted. I also
  served as Editor-in-Chief of the high school year book. In
  response to the year book query to students about their principal
  ambition, my entry was: "To be a physicist extraordinaire."<br>
  <br>
  When time arrived to select a college for study in science or
  engineering, I initially aimed to go to MIT, and was accepted and
  advised to apply for a scholarship based on my grades. However, I
  had a chance encounter with an admissions officer of Stevens Institute
  of Technology, who so impressed me by his erudition and
  enthusiasm for the school that I changed course and entered
  Stevens Institute. There, in addition to engineering studies, I
  participated in the dramatic society and in a dance group
  performance. But the college activity that I engaged in which was
  to have a long-standing attraction to me was singing in the
  chorus, where I performed solo roles in major pieces, including
  H&auml;ndel's "Messiah". My voice and ear for music were
  sufficiently highly regarded that I was encouraged by the leader
  of the chorus to take lessons with a well-known voice coach at
  the Metropolitan Opera. Since, as a student, I could not afford
  to pay for lessons, they were eventually provided to me free of
  charge. Between college and graduate school, I even thought
  briefly about pursuing a professional singing career, but
  ultimately decided against it.<br>
  <br>
  The interests in music and drama that I developed in college have
  persisted throughout my life. Years later, while working in Los
  Alamos, I sang solos with the town chorus and performed with the
  dramatic society; my dramatic roles included the lead role in
  "Inherit the Wind." I also sang in performances of Gilbert and
  Sullivan operettas in Los Alamos. My discovery of Gilbert and
  Sullivan had also occurred while I was in college, and I have
  enjoyed occasionally entertaining colleagues and friends with G
  &amp; S lyrics. The peak of my musical endeavors occurred during
  the period I lived in Cleveland, when I performed with the chorus
  of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert
  Shaw and orchestra conductor George Szell.<br>
  <br>
  I received my undergraduate degree in engineering in 1939 and a
  Master of Science degree in mathematical physics in 1941 at
  Steven Institute of Technology. It was during this period in
  1940, that I married Sylvia Samuels. We have two children, Robert
  G., who currently lives in Ojo Sarco, New Mexico, and Alisa K.
  Cowden, of Trumansburg, New York, and six grandchildren.<br>
  <br>
  I continued with graduate studies at New York University, where I
  worked for a time in experimental cosmic ray physics under the
  direction of S.A. Korff, and wrote a theoretical Ph.D thesis on
  "The Liquid Drop Model for Nuclear Fission" under R.D. Present.
  Even before completing my thesis in 1944, I was recruited as a
  staff member under <a href="../1965/index.html">Richard
  Feynman</a> in the Theoretical Division at the Los Alamos
  Scientific Laboratory, to work on the Manhattan Project. During
  my participation in the Manhattan Project and subsequent research
  at Los Alamos, encompassing a period of fifteen years, I worked
  in the company of perhaps the greatest collection of scientific
  talent the world has ever known. About a year after I arrived I
  became a Group Leader in the Theoretical Division and, later, the
  director of Operation Greenhouse, which consisted of a number of
  Atomic Energy Commission experiments on Eniwetok atoll. In
  addition to my work on the results of bomb tests conducted at
  Eniwetok, Bikini and the testing grounds in Nevada, I directed my
  efforts during this period to the basic understanding of the
  effects of nuclear blasts, including a study of the air blast
  wave coauthored with John von Neumann. In 1958, I was a delegate
  to the Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951, I took a sabbatical-in-residence from my duties at Los
  Alamos to think about the physics I would pursue in the coming
  years. It was during this time that I decided to attempt the
  observation of the neutrino. The idea of searching for the
  elusive neutrino had, in fact, occurred to me as early as 1947,
  but the opportunity did not present itself. I was now determined
  to do it, and formed an extremely fruitful collaboration with
  Clyde Cowan, another Los Alamos staff member. We initially
  considered the use of a nuclear bomb test as the source of
  neutrinos, but soon decided that the reactor at Hanford,
  Washington, would be better. After the first hints of a result at
  Hanford in 1953, we were informed by John Wheeler about the new
  Savannah River reactor facility being built in South Carolina.
  The conditions at Savannah River were ideal for this experiment
  and, in 1955, Cowan and I transferred the operation there. In
  1956 we observed the electron antineutrino. Shortly after that,
  Cowan left Los Alamos and our collaboration came to a natural
  end. I turned my attention for a while to gamma ray astronomy and
  soon began the first in a continuous series of experiments at the
  Savannah River site to study the properties of the
  neutrino.<br>
  <br>
  I left Los Alamos in 1959 to become Professor and Head of the
  Department of Physics of the (then) Case Institute of
  Technology in Cleveland, Ohio. During my seven years at Case,
  I built a group working in reactor neutrino physics, double beta
  decay, electron lifetime studies, searches for nucleon decay, and
  a very ambitious experiment in a gold mine in South Africa that
  made the first observation of the neutrinos produced in the
  atmosphere by cosmic rays. The primary goals of the experimental
  program were elucidation of the properties of the neutrino and
  probing of the limits of fundamental symmetry principles and
  conservation laws, such as the conservation of charge, baryon
  number and lepton number. Most of these experiments required the
  reduction of the cosmic ray muon flux in order to be successful,
  and the group necessarily became expert in the operation of deep
  underground laboratories. The projects also drew us into
  developing innovative detector techniques, including the use of
  large liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors.<br>
  <br>
  This line of research continued when I went, and brought my
  research group with me, to the new University of California, Irvine campus in
  1966 to become the founding Dean of the School of Physical
  Sciences. I served as Dean until 1974, when I stepped down to
  return to full time teaching and research. I was appointed
  Distinguished Professor of Physics at UCI in 1987 and became
  Professor Emeritus in 1988. I have also served as Professor of
  Radiological Sciences in the College of Medicine at UCI. The
  "Neutrino Group" at Irvine has been actively involved in a wide
  range of neutrino and elementary particle physics experiments,
  including its role in the IMB (Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven) proton
  decay experiment. This group has continued the program of reactor
  neutrino experiments, has been the first to observe double beta
  decay in the laboratory, and was awarded the 1989 Bruno Rossi
  prize in High Energy Astrophysics by the American Astronomical
  Society for its joint observation (with the Kamiokande Experiment
  in Japan) of neutrinos from supernova 1987A. The detection of the
  supernova neutrinos was a particularly gratifying outcome of the
  IMB experiment. Our group had always been aware of the
  possibility of seeing neutrinos from stellar collapse in our
  large detectors, and several of the previous detectors had been
  adorned with signs identifying each of them as a "Supernova Early
  Warning System."<br>
  <br>
  Over the years, a number of other intriguing experimental ideas
  and areas of investigation have been the objects of my attention,
  and I have devoted some time and effort to exploring the inherent
  possibilities. These include: the search for relic neutrinos;
  the "neutrino M&ouml;ssbauer effect", in which a photon is
  replaced by a neutrino; the measurement of the gravitational
  constant, G, the most poorly measured non-nuclear fundamental
  constant by several orders of magnitude; a spherical lens space
  telescope; attempting to set more stringent limits on violation
  of the Pauli Exclusion Principle; exploration of the brain using
  ultra-sound; and a variety of new detector ideas. These
  scientific concepts, goals and challenges continue to excite and
  stimulate my interest.</p>
