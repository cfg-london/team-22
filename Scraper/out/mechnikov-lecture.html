  <h2>On the Present State of the Question of Immunity in
  Infectious Diseases</h2>

  <p>I am here before you by virtue of paragraph
  9 of the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which states that "it
  shall be incumbent on a prize-winner, whenever this is possible,
  to give a public lecture on a subject connected with the work for
  which the prize has been awarded, such a lecture to be given
  within six months of Commemoration Day, in Stockholm".</p>

  <p>I have had the great honour of receiving,
  together with my excellent friend, Professor Ehrlich, the Nobel
  Prize for Medicine "for work on immunity", so that it is on this
  subject that I shall speak. Since the study of immunity is a
  chapter in medical theory, and theory is often hard to expound to
  an audience unequipped with the special notions implied, you see
  the difficulty that lies before me. Fortunately, the theoretical
  problem on which I shall enlarge concerns the resistance of the
  body the disease. Whatever concerns health is of real public
  interest. I take advantage of this to make my address less
  arduous for you. I shall moreover use the opportunity to show you
  the practical value of pure research.</p>

  <p>There is no need to be a doctor or a
  scientist to wonder why the human body is capable of resisting so
  many harmful agents in the course of everyday life. It is often
  seen that in households where all members are exposed to the same
  danger, or again in schools or troops where everyone lives the
  same life, disease does not strike everyone indifferently. For
  some individuals who go down at the attack, there are others who
  have immunity to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

  <p>There used to be only a vague answer to the
  problem of the body's resistance, remarkable as it is. Since the
  memorable discoveries of Pasteur and his co-workers who found
  that immunity could be conferred by means of vaccination with
  microbes, the question has all at once become vastly clarified.
  The problem has become open to study by experiment. For Pasteur,
  who was a chemist, the fact that the undamaged organism does not
  allow certain morbid agents to spread within it, could be
  explained simply in terms of the chemistry of the environment. In
  the same way that plants will not grow on soil that lacks some
  substance indispensable to their growth, so microbes, these
  microscopic plants which cause infectious disease, are unable to
  grow in an organism which does not give them all the substances
  they need.</p>

  <p>This theory is completely logical but
  contradicted a number of factors to be found in the protected
  organism. Pasteur and his fellow workers realized this themselves
  when they found that infectious microbes develop very well in the
  blood of animals that enjoy complete immunity.</p>

  <p>The animal organism is very complex and for
  this reason it is often hard to explain in simple concepts the
  phenomena to be observed. To achieve the purpose, a different
  approach has had to be called for. It has been necessary to look
  from the point of view of biology, and attempt to simplify
  research conditions without going beyond the scope of the living
  organism. This is the idea that has been behind our research.
  Disease is not the prerogative of man and the domestic animals,
  so it was quite natural to see if the lower animals, with very
  simple organizations, showed pathological phenomena, and if so,
  infection, cure and immunity could be observed among them.</p>

  <p>To solve medical problems, comparative
  pathology had to be called in.</p>

  <p>While studying the origin of the digestive
  organs in the animal world, we were struck by the fact that
  certain of the organism's elements which have no part to play in
  the digestion of food are nevertheless capable of storing foreign
  bodies. For us, the reason was that these elements had once been
  part of the digestive system. This question of pure zoology has
  no further place here, so we will only stress the general outcome
  of our research in this field, which was that the elements of the
  organism of man and the animals, gifted with autonomic movements
  and capable of enveloping foreign bodies are no more than remains
  from the digestive system of primitive beings.</p>

  <p>Certain of the lower animals, transparent
  enough to be observed alive, clearly show in their midst a host
  of small cells with moving extensions. In these animals the
  smallest lesion brings an accumulation of these elements at the
  point of damage. In small transparent larvae, it can easily be
  shown that the moving cells, reunited at the damage point do
  often close over foreign bodies.</p>

  <p>Such observations on the one hand confirmed
  our assumption on the origin of these migrant elements, while on
  the other they suggested that accumulation round lesions is a
  sort of natural defence on the part of the organism. Some method
  had to be found by which this hypothesis could be verified. I was
  at this time - more than twenty five years ago - in Messina, so I
  turned to the floating larvae of starfish, which had been found
  for the first time on Scandinavian shores and called Bipinnaria.
  Large enough for several operations, they are transparent and can
  be observed alive under the microscope.</p>

  <p>Sharp splinters were introduced into the
  bodies of these Bipinnaria and the next day I could see a mass of
  moving cells surrounding the foreign bodies to form a thick
  cushion layer. The analogy between this phenomenon and what
  happens when a man has a splinter that causes inflammation and
  suppuration is extraordinary. The only thing is that in the larva
  of the starfish, the accumulation of mobile cells round the
  foreign body is done without any help from the blood vessels or
  the nervous system, for the simple reason that these animals do
  not have either the one or the other. It is thus thanks to a sort
  of spontaneous action that the cells group round the
  splinter.</p>

  <p>The experiment I have just outlined shows
  the first stage of inflammation in the animal world. Now
  inflammation as understood in man and the higher animals is a
  phenomenon that almost always results from the intervention of
  some pathogenic microbe. So it is held that the afflux of mobile
  cells towards points of lesion shows the organism's reaction
  against foreign bodies in general and against infectious microbes
  in particular. On this hypothesis, disease would be a fight
  between the morbid agent, the microbe from outside, and the
  mobile cells of the organism itself. Cure would come from the
  victory of the cells and immunity would be the sign of their
  acting sufficiently to prevent the microbial onslaught.</p>

  <p>This deduction, based on the fundamental
  experiment with the splinter in Bipinnaria, had to be checked by
  observations and specific experimentation. Luckily for us, it is
  not only man and the higher animals that are subject to
  infectious diseases. These diseases existed on the earth long
  before the appearance of the human race and few are the creatures
  which escape them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, to demonstrate the value of the
  hypothesis I have mentioned, some higher animal was needed, small
  and transparent enough to be observed living under the microscope
  and yet subject to microbial disease.</p>

  <p>Several starts were made. It became
  possible to study the progress of infection in fresh-water
  animals, commonly known as "water-fleas". These small crustaceans
  abound in all kinds of stagnant water and are subject to various
  diseases. One is caused by a tiny microbe characterized by the
  production of spores in the shape of needles. Swallowed by the
  water-fleas or Daphniae, which is the scientific term, these
  spores readily damage the intestinal wall and penetrate to the
  body cavity. Once they have insinuated themselves into the
  organism's inmost part, the spores cause an accumulation of the
  mobile cells round them, which correspond to the white corpuscles
  in human blood. A battle takes place between the two elements.
  Sometimes the spores succeed in breeding. Microbes are generated
  that secrete a substance capable of dissolving the mobile cells.
  Such cases are rare on the whole. Far more often it happens that
  the mobile cells kill and digest the infectious spores and thus
  ensure immunity for the organism.</p>

  <p>This description is from a living animal
  and can be observed at each stage under the microscope with such
  precision as could hardly be bettered.</p>

  <p>The results obtained from the larvae of
  starfish and from disease in water-fleas form the bedrock of the
  theory that I am here to expound. This theory came under heavy
  fire from the greatest names in science and there was some doubt
  that such an attack was to be withstood. The memory of the
  Bipinnaria and the splinter surrounded by mobile cells and the
  Daphniae with their blood corpuscles devouring the dangerous
  spores of the infectious microbe, these gave me hope to fight on.
  Controlled observations on living organism can not be wrong.</p>

  <p>Having established the base of the theory
  of immunity, it had to be applied to the higher organisms and
  even to man himself. Conditions were incomparably more complex
  than in the little transparent creatures, and difficulties arose
  on all sides. Given the impossibility of submitting a vertebrate,
  even the smallest such as a new-born mouse, to direct examination
  by microscope, a more complicated way had to be taken, by
  combining the results of research on the blood and organs
  extracted from the organism, and thinking out the
  interconnection. In such circumstances, the door is wide open to
  mistakes of all sorts.</p>

  <p>The study of various infectious diseases in
  man and the higher animals showed first that the facts observed
  corresponded very satisfactorily with the theory based on
  research on the lower, transparent animals. Whenever the organism
  enjoys immunity, the introduction of infectious microbes is
  followed by the accumulation of mobile cells, of white corpuscles
  of the blood in particular which absorb the microbes and destroy
  them. The white corpuscles and the other cells capable of doing
  this have been designated "phagocytes", i.e. devouring cells, and
  the whole function that ensures immunity has been given the name
  of "phagocytosis".</p>

  <p>It has been established as a general rule
  that in all cases of immunity, natural or acquired, either by
  preventive vaccination or following an attack of infectious
  illness, phagocytosis takes place to a marked degree, whereas in
  fatal or very dangerous diseases, this phenomenon does not exist
  at all or is attenuated. This rule was demonstrated for the first
  time on animals immunized against anthrax. When the anthrax
  bacillus is injected under the skin of sensitive animals, such as
  the rabbit or the guinea-pig, the microbe is found free in
  abundant fluid from which the white corpuscles are almost wholly
  absent. When however the same inoculation is carried out on a
  rabbit or a guinea-pig that has been previously vaccinated
  against anthrax, a very different picture results. The bacilli
  are within a short space of time seized by the white corpuscles
  which accumulate in quantity at the inoculation point. Once
  inside the phagocytes, the bacilli die within a comparatively
  short time. It happens on occasion that only a few hours after
  the absorption of the bacilli by the white corpuscles, the
  bacilli are dead.</p>

  <p>In time the same rule has been extended to
  cover a whole host of other infectious diseases. Every time the
  organism enjoys immunity, the infectious agent falls prey to the
  phagocytes that gather round the microbes. This general law has
  even been verified by studying pathogenic microbes, discovered
  since the law was formulated. With plague, in all cases where the
  organism is refractory, the plague bacillus is devoured and
  destroyed by the phagocytes, while in fatal cases of plague the
  majority of the microbes remain free in the organism's fluids and
  multiply without hindrance.</p>

  <p>To date we have found no exceptions worthy
  of note to this rule. It is true Weil of Prague has maintained in
  several publications that in cases of immunity regarding the
  cholera microbe in hens, the refractory organism meets the
  microbial invasion by other means than phagocytes. He bases his
  case on the impossibility of finding this microbe inside the
  white corpuscles in animals that are resistant to illness. This
  exception is not a true one. It is explained by the minute
  dimensions of the cholera microbe in hens, owing to which it
  easily eludes the eye of the beholder. Soulima examined this
  question very thoroughly in my laboratory and he found it to be
  true that, in accordance with the general law, in animals
  refractory to the cholera bacillus of hens, it is again the white
  corpuscles that take hold of the microbe and cause it to
  disappear within themselves.</p>

  <p>Opposers of the phagocyte theory have long
  taken the view that the white corpuscles and phagocytes in
  general are only capable of absorbing microbes that have first
  been killed by the humours of the organism, namely blood plasma
  and exudative fluids. It would today be hard to find anyone who
  still maintains this view. Many accurate experiments have shown
  that the phagocytes surround the infectious microbes while these
  are quite alive and in a condition where they are capable of
  bringing fatal infection to the organism that does not enjoy
  immunity.</p>

  <p>The results which I have thus summarized
  have been achieved after many a long year of research and
  discussions. Many scientists still kept to the old idea, that the
  white corpuscles represent an element hostile to health. In
  serious illness, collections of pus used to be met with. This was
  thought to consist of white corpuscles only, as the microbes were
  too small to be detected by the imperfect tools of microscope
  research. It was supposed that the pus corpuscles themselves
  might be the source of disease found in the morbid alteration of
  our cells. When later microbes came to light inside the white
  corpuscles, it was admitted that the corpuscles, as ill-omened
  elements in our body, only serve to feed and spread the body's
  worst enemies, namely the agents of infection. The destruction of
  these in cases of immunity was rather attributed to the direct
  influence of the organisms's fluids.</p>

  <p>The theory of the bactericidal action of
  the humours was brought in against the phagocyte theory. To the
  organism enjoying immunity, natural or acquired, was attributed
  the power of destroying the infectious microbes without any real
  assistance from the live cells. This affirmation was based on
  well-known instances, in which blood and blood serum taken from
  the organism proved able to kill a considerable quantity of
  infectious microbes. This theory of the humoral immunity met
  multiple and major contradictions from the outset, yet it was not
  without ardent support. The discovery of Pfeiffer was of great
  assistance to the theory, for he demonstrated the destruction of
  cholera vibrios in the humour of the abdominal cavity in animals
  immunized against this microbe. This case has become classic. The
  vibrios do not die within the phagocytes but in the fluid of the
  peritoneal secretion. Every attempt was made to show that this
  was not a case of an exception to the rule, but the demonstration
  of a general law of immunity. But, after years of hard research,
  it has been conclusively shown that the vast majority of
  infectious microbes can not be destroyed by the liquids of the
  organism and that the instance of the vibrios is to be explained
  by their extreme fragility. It was also maintained that the
  destruction of the vibrios by the humours took place by means of
  the bactericidal substances released by the white corpuscles
  present in the abdominal cavity. In cases where the very microbes
  had been introduced to regions of the organism where there were
  no white corpuscles already in existence, then the destruction of
  the vibrios was done within the phagocytes which came on to the
  field of battle. Even in the abdominal cavity, the extracellular
  destruction of the vibrios was easily to be avoided if the white
  corpuscles were prevented from suffering and thus from spreading
  their bactericidal substances. This experimental observation was
  denied by many observers over a period of years. It was however
  conclusively confirmed some years back by Bail of Prague. It has
  thus been clearly shown that as long as the white corpuscles are
  intact, the destruction of vibrios in the organism that has
  immunity takes place within the phagocytes.</p>

  <p>Thorough analysis of the phenomena of
  immunization, an analysis based on extremely numerous
  experiments, has shown that phagocytosis is in truth a defence
  action on the part of the organism against the agents of disease.
  Several of the former supporters of the exclusively humoral
  theories of immunity later came round to the cellular theory,
  with more or less important reserve, however. So various
  intermediate theories were adduced, according to which the
  organism, threatened by microbial onrush, brought all its
  resources into play: phagocytes and humours. For some, the
  destruction of certain infectious agents in the cases of immunity
  was by the organism fluids, especially the blood plasma, while
  other microbes had greater resistance and were only killed within
  the phagocytes. This eclectic theory was developed in the main by
  your compatriot, A. Pettersson.</p>

  <p>For this defence action, the organism would
  make use of two classes of bactericidal substances, one of which
  would be circulating in the blood fluid and flow thence to the
  exudations formed round the microbes, while the other group would
  only be found within the phagocytes. The first category would
  react first and foremost on the cholera vibrio, typhoid bacilli
  and their congeners, while the other would destroy anthrax
  bacilli, suppuration microbes and others as well.</p>

  <p>Just as there were two diverse bactericidal
  functions of the organism, so the nature of the substances that
  destroy the microbes would be diverse. The bactericidal
  substances of the humours would be of complex nature, consisting
  of a substance that would prepare the microbes, without damaging
  them, for the action of the substance that would kill them.
  Various names were put forward to designate these two substances.
  Ehrlich gave the name of <i>amboceptor</i> to the preparatory
  substance and the name of <i>complement</i> to that which
  destroys the microbes. Not to complicate further matters that are
  very complicated already, we shall use the terms proposed by our
  eminent colleague, without sharing his view of the actual part
  played by the two substances.</p>

  <p>Formerly, I mean to say ten years and more
  ago, certain scientists thought that the bactericidal substance
  proper, although circulating in the blood fluid, was nevertheless
  a secretion of the white corpuscles. Of late more and more voices
  state the contrary to be the case. It is readily admitted that
  the complement has nothing to do with the corpuscles and has a
  completely different origin. This view is based on much research
  carried out with extracts prepared from the white corpuscles
  taken out of the organism. To this end, exudations that are very
  rich in these corpuscles are used. They are washed to rid them of
  liquid parts and then they are killed by subjecting them to cold
  and letting them macerate in physiological fluid. In the extracts
  of white corpuscles obtained in this way, no complements are
  found capable of destroying microbes. This is established, for it
  has been checked and counterchecked on innumerable occasions. It
  is not however correct to conclude on this account that the white
  corpuscles do not produce the complement.</p>

  <p>To form an opinion on this much discussed
  topic, Levaditi and I began to study the bactericidal properties
  of white corpuscles. First of all we found that these cells,
  taken from the organism, are indeed capable of absorbing and
  destroying many microbes. Making use of Deneke vibrios, that
  resemble the microbes of Asian cholera, we were able to show
  quite easily their transformation into granules in the interior
  of the white corpuscles of guinea-pigs. This transformation,
  which takes place very fast with vibrios impregnated with the
  amboceptor or preparatory substance, implies their destruction.
  The white corpuscles must therefore contain in their components a
  substance which acts just like the complement of the humours. Now
  let us see how the substance behaves in fluids deprived of this
  bactericidal substance but having a large quantity of white
  corpuscles possessing the complement. One has only to keep these
  elements for twenty hours to discover that at the end of that
  time they have become completely incapable of transforming the
  vibrios charged with the amboceptor. The corpuscles have had time
  to die for the most part and in these circumstances the vibrios
  remain intact.</p>

  <p>We have repeated this experiment several
  times with the same result, thus showing that the complement in
  the white corpuscles is a very fragile substance. It is beyond
  doubt that the long operations of washing, cooling and maceration
  of the white corpuscles are destructive for the complement, by
  and large. That is why this method must be rejected in studying
  the bactericidal substances in white corpuscles.</p>

  <p>Do not think that as the action of the
  complement is only manifest while the white corpuscles are alive,
  this is purely a vital phenomenon. On the contrary it is most
  likely that this is a chemical action which alters according to
  the state of the white corpuscles. Here is an analogous example
  which will support this view.</p>

  <p>The magnificent masses of living matter to
  be found in certain mushrooms known as "Myxomycetes" are capable,
  like the white corpuscles, of enveloping foreign bodies and
  digesting them inside the vacuoles. These are filled with acid
  juice which favours digestion and whose function is readily
  demonstrable by giving the living matter some blue litmus
  particles to absorb, which in a short time turn pink. Well,
  without killing the living protoplasm, it is enough to bruise it
  by pressing lightly, and the grains turn blue again. The reason
  is that the living matter is full of alkaline substance which
  straightway, at the least shock, penetrates into the juices of
  the vacuoles and neutralizes the acid in them. This is an example
  of purely chemical reaction, closely linked to the being and
  well-being of living matter.</p>

  <p>It may be asked why the action of the
  complement is so fleeting in the white corpuscles, when it lasts
  much longer in the humours taken from the organism, such as blood
  serum. We believe the difference to lie in that the white
  corpuscles, over and above the complement, contain an
  anti-complement substance as well which prevents the action of
  the complement, just as the myxomycetes besides the acid juice
  contain alkaline substances.</p>

  <p>Without going into more thorough analysis
  of this question, we can state that the white corpuscles are
  microscopic organisms that are more complex than they appear at
  first sight and that to deal with them in the mass to make
  extracts is almost as rough a method as squeezing whole animals,
  say mice or frogs, to find out their digestive powers.</p>

  <p>As a result of research which we can do no
  more than outline to you in summary fashion, we still hold that
  the complement of the humours comes from the white corpuscles.
  When the white corpuscles suffer a faint attack, they only
  release the complement into the fluids in which they are
  immersed. When however the white corpuscles are subject to more
  serious lesion, a substance is released which neutralizes the
  action of the complement. We can quote as evidence to support
  this opinion that in the immunized organism, where the white
  corpuscles are intact, vibrios do not undergo the granular
  transformation in the humours and only take granular form in the
  interior of the white corpuscles.</p>

  <p>Our plea is one of identity, for the
  complements contained in phagocytes and for those in blood serum.
  Are there, besides the complement, other substances capable of
  destroying microbes, substances exclusively and intimately linked
  to the white corpuscles? This question has as yet no ready
  answer, owing to the technical difficulties involved. It is
  likely, as appears from the research carried out by Pettersson
  and others, among whom we mention Max Gruber and his assistants,
  that substances of this kind, the <i>endolysins</i> of Pettersson
  or the <i>leukins</i> of Schneider, do exist in reality.</p>

  <p>Quite apart from this intricate problem of
  the nature of microbicidal substances in the organism, it has
  been clearly shown that the power of the humours to kill
  infectious agents is restricted to the weakest microbes, also
  that the microbicidal part played by the white corpuscles and the
  phagocytes in general holds good for all infectious agents from
  which the body can have immunity.</p>

  <p>As stated above, the bactericidal action of
  the complements is closely linked with another category of
  substances, the amboceptors of Ehrlich. They can not destroy nor
  damage the agents of disease. The amboceptors fasten on the
  agents and help the bactericidal action of the complements. The
  complements are localized in the phagocytes, whereas the
  amboceptors are to be found in the humours of the living organism
  and pass with ease to the fluids that accumulate round the
  microbes. Indubitably these are humoral substances that
  participate in the process of immunity. But the amboceptors are
  nothing else than phagocytic products excreted in the other fluid
  surroundings. Various researchers have established that the
  sources of the amboceptors are the spleen, bone marrow and
  lymphatic ganglia, in other words the very organs which are
  filled with phagocytes. It has even been shown by the experiments
  of Wassermann and Citron that the amboceptors arise in the places
  where infectious microbes have been introduced, places invaded by
  vast hordes of white corpuscles.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of these investigations on
  the amboceptors, it was thought that the substances took part in
  the destruction of the microbes, but were completely alien to the
  system of phagocytic defence. Later it became clear that as
  products of the phagocytes, the amboceptors were only one of the
  terms of this defence.</p>

  <p>The mechanism of the action of the
  amboceptors on microbes is not known in detail, not being
  manifest. In fact, the infectious agents impregnated with the
  amboceptors go on living and reproducing at the normal rate. They
  even keep their pathogenic power, but become capable of
  undergoing the action of the complements and more prone than
  before to be seized and enveloped by the white corpuscles.</p>

  <p>In the case of the most fragile microbes,
  such as cholera vibrios and their kind, the combined action of
  the amboceptor and the complement leads to the destruction of the
  bacteria, whether accompanied or not by the granular
  transformation. But the great majority of pathogenic agents give
  greater resistance to a mixture of these two substances, as
  obtained in the organism or outside it in blood serum. In this
  case, there can be no question of bactericidal action as it is
  usually understood. But the microbes, impregnated with the
  amboceptor and the complement, fall an easy prey to the white
  corpuscles. The mixture of the two substances serves most of all
  to prepare the phagocytosis. Because of this characteristic, it
  has been called <i>opsonin</i> by Wright and
  <i>bacteriotropin</i> by Neufeld.</p>

  <p>Persuaded of the relative unimportance of
  the humours as destructive agents to infectious microbes, the
  followers of the humoral theories have lately fallen back on the
  opsonins and the bacteriotropins, considered as humoral factors
  well to the fore in immunity. Not being able to do any damage at
  all to the microbes, they only modify them in so far as their
  absorption by the phagocytes are facilitated. Wright, who has
  been largely responsible for developing this argument, insists on
  the subordinate role of the white corpuscles that follow blindly
  the opsonin lead. He even judges the progress of immunity and
  cure according to the opsonic strength of the blood fluid. But,
  insisting on the preparation of the morbid agents by the
  opsonins, Wright admits the virtue of the phagocytes in ridding
  the organism of microbes. He even goes so far as to admit the
  existence of a spontaneous phagocytosis, which evolves without
  the aid of the opsonins. The opsonins would be important,
  however, in making the action of the white corpuscles more speedy
  and more sure.</p>

  <p>It is a priori probable that the
  phagocytosis, namely the swallowing and digestion of the microbes
  by the phagocytes, is subject to favourable influences in the
  organism. Is not in intestinal digestion the secretion of the
  pancreatic juice favoured by other elements like secretin? There
  is thus no objection in principle to the theories of Wright and
  Neufeld. Only the methods on which the theories are based do tell
  against them. All research into opsonins and bacteriotropins has
  been conducted with humours and white corpuscles extracted from
  the organism and mixed with the microbes in glass test tubes.
  This method, which is very demonstrative, cannot render adequate
  account of the phenomena in the living body. The fate of the
  bactericidal theory of humours, based on experiments in vitro,
  should serve as a warning against placing too much trust in
  results obtained under these conditions. If it is true, as a
  great number of research workers now hold, that the opsonins and
  the bacteriotropins are mixtures in varying proportions of the
  complements and the amboceptors, one could easily understand that
  in the living organism things go on in quite another way than in
  test-tube experiments. We have already stressed the fact that the
  complements are linked to the phagocytes and only break away in
  exceptional circumstances.</p>

  <p>In the investigations on the opsonins and
  bacteriotropins, investigations guided by humoral notions, on the
  whole only the power of the blood fluid to favour phagocytosis is
  regarded. The white corpuscles are taken as constant elements
  which can only obey the behests of the opsonins. Now the white
  corpuscles are living organisms, hypersensitive to external
  conditions and which admit of very great variation. The least
  change in the salt content of the fluid which surrounds them is
  enough to bring about significant modification of the
  phagocytosis. The white corpuscles of patients attacked by
  different diseases show a real diminution of their vital
  characteristics. The work of Parvu on the cells taken from a
  patient suffering from myelogenic leukemia showed more than half
  of the white corpuscles powerless to absorb the microbes.</p>

  <p>Faced with such facts, some scientists
  stress the need to study not only the opsonic property of blood
  fluid but also to take into account the phagocytic function of
  the white corpuscles themselves. This idea is justified in so far
  as the destruction of the microbes is the main purpose of the
  organism's fight against the agents of disease.</p>

  <p>This destruction is carried out by live
  strong phagocytes. The absorption of the pathogenic bacteria,
  helped by the opsonins, is important but it is only the beginning
  of a series of phenomena that culminates in the digestion of the
  microbes within the phagocytes. In case the microbes that have
  been absorbed by the white globules do not die, owing to a
  deficiency of bactericidal substances, the organism is short on
  its defences and falls victim to the infection. It can happen
  that highly resistant microbes, such as the spores of tetanus
  bacilli, can be a long while in the white corpuscles without
  causing the terrible illness. The moment the corpuscles suffer
  some deleterious influence, for example cooling or overheating,
  then the spores that were hitherto imprisoned are set free and do
  straightway produce fatal tetanic cramps.</p>

  <p>This is why, as several doctors have
  already pointed out, the power of the opsonins is not enough of
  itself in all cases to ascertain the organism's level of
  resistance.</p>

  <p>The phagocytes, subjected to influences
  favourable or unfavourable, have to reckon with the resistance of
  the agents of disease in their fight against the microbes. It can
  happen that the agents secrete substances which bring about
  deterioration in the white corpuscles to the point of dissolving
  them altogether. But in most instances, it is lesions which
  prevent the phagocytes absorbing and destroying the microbes. The
  substances that are directed against the phagocytes have been
  designated agressins by Bail. These are special poisons which
  attack the phagocytes in particular. In order for our defence
  cells to do their job properly, they must be protected against
  the microbial agressins. It has even been maintained that
  salutary phagocytosis can only take place with the aid of some
  preparatory action which is capable of neutralizing the
  agressins. This action would take its origin from elements of the
  body alien to the phagocytes. Series of experiments show that the
  white corpuscles are well fitted to absorb the agressins, without
  the agressins undergoing any modification. The work of Wassermann
  and Citron showed that the macerations of pathogenic microbes,
  prepared outside the organism, give a product which when
  introduced into the organism in quantity hinders phagocytosis.
  But these same microbes, generators of these agressins, are
  easily absorbed by the white corpuscles when the latter are in a
  state of reinforced activity.</p>

  <p>The phagocytes are capable of fighting not
  only the agressins, I mean microbial poisons that work on the
  white corpuscles in particular, but even violent poisons that can
  kill the organism. This is a fact of prime importance in the
  study of immunity. After the wonderful discovery of bacterial
  counterpoisons by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1901/index.html">Behring</a>, the opinion
  has been voiced that the defence of the organism which enjoys
  immunity relies above all on the neutralizations of the toxins,
  which are the poisons that the microbes produce. The microbes,
  following neutralization, forfeit the spearhead of the attack on
  the organism and descend to the level of absolutely harmless
  entities which in turn fall easy prey to the phagocytes.
  Phagocytosis would thus, although acting on live microbes, be
  reduced to an action of entirely secondary importance.</p>

  <p>Numerous findings, achieved with care over
  the last few years, clean contradict this view. It has been shown
  that the white corpuscles entertain no fear of microbial poisons
  and are well fitted to absorb them and make them harmless. This
  was best illustrated by work on poisons in the body of infections
  microbes, going under the name of <i>endotoxins</i>. Besredka's
  work is the most conclusive in this regard. He injected the
  abdominal cavity of guinea-pigs with dead bacilli of typhoid
  fever that could not cause the infection but contained typhoid
  endotoxin. The animals died within twelve hours. The same
  injection was given to animals whose abdominal cavity contained a
  large number of strong white corpuscles, and these took over the
  microbial bodies and their endotoxin and thus saved the animal
  from certain death.</p>

  <p>Bail and Weyl got analogous results using a
  staphylococci poison. Injected by itself, this poison kills young
  rabbits within a matter of hours. Injected with a certain amount
  of white corpuscles, this poison is inactive and the animals live
  on.</p>

  <p>Such examples could be multiplied. So it
  seems certain that the phagocytes do ensure immunity, not only
  from infections microbes but also from poisons produced by these
  microbes. Of all the organism's elements, the phagocytes are
  distinguished by their poor sensitivity to toxicity. This is so
  true that white corpuscles are even able to withstand poisoning
  by mineral poisons. When endotoxins were not so well known and
  when the search for bacterial poisons soluble in the organism was
  fraught with great difficulty, Besredka went into the question of
  protection afforded by the white corpuscles with regard to
  arsenical preparations of small solubility. He selected arsenic
  trisulphide, the crystals of which are absorbed and modified by
  the phagocytes with avidity. He found that when the abdominal
  cavity of guinea-pigs contained a great quantity of white
  corpuscles, these cells saved the animals from fatal poisoning by
  phagocytising the crystals of the arsenic trisulphide. Similar
  findings have since been established on many occasions and it is
  now commonly held that many toxic and medicamental substances,
  introduced into the organism, are to be found in abundance in the
  interior of the white corpuscles. Lately Carles of Bordeaux has
  demonstrated the absorption of lead salts by white corpuscles.
  These salts were absorbed insoluble and became transparent within
  the phagocytes. When subjected to hydrogen sulphide vapour,
  however, they at once turned black. In absorbing poisons, the
  white corpuscles in their capacity as primitive elements
  comparatively non-sensitive to toxins, preserve the noble cells,
  such as those of the nervous system, the liver and other
  glands.</p>

  <p>The sum of the very numerous facts
  established in the archives of science leaves no room to doubt
  the major part played by the phagocytic system, as the organism's
  main defence against the danger from infectious agents of all
  kinds, as well as their poisons. Where natural immunity is
  concerned, and man enjoys this in respect of a large number of
  diseases, it is a question of the phagocytes being strong enough
  to absorb and make the infectious microbes harmless. It goes
  without saying that the phagocytic reaction is helped by every
  means at the organism's command.</p>

  <p>Thus, when the microbes penetrate, the
  white corpuscles make use of the dilatation of the blood vessels
  and the nervous actions that control this, in order to reach the
  battle field in the shortest possible time. Every influence that
  can trigger off the phagocytosis is naturally brought to
  bear.</p>

  <p>In immunity achieved as a result of
  vaccinations or subsequent to an attack of the disease, the
  organism shows a series of modifications. Much stress has been
  laid on the growth in humoral properties under these conditions.
  In fact the blood fluid in these cases contains considerable
  amounts of amboceptors and bacteriotropins (very probably
  identical) which prepare the microbes for phagocytosis. But, as
  said above, the amboceptors are products of the phagocytes. Now
  to secrete great quantities in the humours, the phagocytes must
  be modified in the organism that has acquired immunity. This
  might have been expected a priori but it has not been easy to
  prove by conclusive evidence. Pettersson had the idea of
  introducing white corpuscles into the organism, originating from
  animals that had been vaccinated against certain microbes. He
  found that these elements do give real protection against doses
  of infectious microbes that are fatal several times over. On the
  other hand, the white corpuscles of an organism which does not
  have immunity are powerless to produce this result.</p>

  <p>Salimbeni, in view of the outstanding
  import of this, began a series of experiments at the Pasteur
  Institute, with the aim of checking Pettersson's findings. Using
  a method that allowed of great accuracy, he was able to confirm
  these findings and take them further. He showed that the white
  corpuscles of the immunized organism are a true source of
  protective substances, and that at a time when the blood fluid
  does not yet show any modification. In spite of successive
  washings, the phagocytes still ensured immunity. In the course of
  his research, Salimbeni proved that at the moment when the
  humours have already lost their protective powers altogether, the
  organism is still refractory and resists fatal doses of
  infectious microbes. This fact, together with other supporting
  evidence, leads to a conclusion of the greatest importance.
  Namely, that even in acquired immunity, the properties of the
  cells take pride of place over the humoral properties.</p>

  <p>At this point, it may seem paradoxical that
  in spite of the serious modifications that follow acquired
  immunity, the white corpuscles show no augmentation of their
  function which may strictly be termed phagocytic. They absorb the
  infectious agents to the same extent as the white corpuscles
  taken from a normal organism and put into contact with the
  humours of the immunized organism. Ever since the first
  experiments of Denys and Leclef, those concerned have stressed
  the importance of this finding. It must not be forgotten that
  these experiments were conducted with white corpuscles taken from
  the organism and studied in vitro. In spite of all that has been
  said on this score, the objection is valid. Comparison is drawn
  between phagocytosis of the white corpuscles of an organism that
  has been subjected during weeks and months to injections of
  vaccine and all the while kept captive, and the white corpuscles
  of a fresh organism which has never been under attack. The
  conditions, as may be seen, are far from identical.</p>

  <p>Even were it soundly established that the
  phagocytes in acquired immunity do not undergo any modification,
  to their power of absorbing microbes, this result would not in
  any way invalidate the general fact of augmentation in the
  defensive power of the phagocytic system. It need only be
  admitted in this instance that just as for acquired immunity
  there is no augmentation found in the production of the
  complements, so there is no augmentation in the property of
  enveloping. The strengthening of the defence would then be
  reduced to overproduction by the phagocytes of substances that
  prepare the way for phagocytosis.</p>

  <p>The total of phenomena observed in immunity
  thus reduces to a series of biological acts, for example the
  sensitivity of phagocytes, their active movements directed to
  areas imperilled by the microbes, and a series of chemical and
  physical acts which bring about the destruction and the digestion
  of the infectious agents. Since a dozen years, under the impulse
  provided by the theories of Ehrlich, many men of science have
  tried hard to lay bare the inner mechanism of the phenomena of
  immunity. Ehrlich himself held that the amboceptors, which abound
  in acquired immunity, combine in determined proportions with the
  molecules of the complements on the one hand and with those of
  the microbes, i.e. their receptors on the other. Many
  field-workers, led by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1919/index.html">Bordet</a>, fight this
  theory. According to them, the amboceptors are unworthy of the
  name, for they are not the chemical go-between of the complements
  and the microbes, but act on these like the mordant in tissue
  dyeing. Bordet also calls amboceptors by the name of sensitizing
  substances, on account of their property to facilitate the action
  of the complements on the microbes. The whole phenomenon falls in
  his eyes into the category of molecular absorption in varying
  extents.</p>

  <p>The polemic on these two theories has been
  going on ten years. The problem of the inner mechanism of
  immunity is so delicate and complicated that it is not yet
  definitely resolved. It must however be said that many research
  workers find it fashionable to support the idea that the action
  of the organism on microbes is outside the picture of chemical
  phenomena strictly so-called, and is rather in the domain of the
  physical actions of the colloids, some of which spring from the
  microbes while others belong to the organism. Analogies are
  sought between substances that are observed in immunity and the
  colloids. Some are not far from saying that the complements are
  lipoids, analogous to those that come in to the constitution of
  animal organs.</p>

  <p>All this research promises results of prime
  importance in the more or less near future. At the moment, what
  it amounts to is no more than incursions into a field thick with
  thorny problems. The place of the phagocytic system in immunity
  has however emerged from the stage of theory and is now
  doctrinal.</p>

  <p>It is time to ask now if the notions
  acquired from so many years' work and discussion yield practical
  application in medicine. This general law that in all cases of
  immunity the phagocytic reaction is pronounced, leads one to
  conclude that the degree of phagocytosis can be used in medical
  prognosis. From the beginning of our research on phagocytosis, we
  became convinced that the more the microbes were absorbed by the
  white corpuscles, then the more chance the animal had of
  surviving and making a complete recovery. Swiss veterinary
  expert, Zschokke, was the first to make use of this rule in the
  struggle against infectious mammitis in cows, which is an
  epizootic that causes serious deterioration in milk. He was able
  to show that plentiful phagocytosis of streptococci, which are
  the disease bearers of this sickness, is a good sign that all is
  going well. The fate of cows suffering from "gelber galt", as
  mammitis is locally called, depends on the extent of
  phagocytosis. When this is insignificant or nil, the cows are
  written off as no longer productive of good milk. A whole system
  has been built up to determine the degree of phagocytosis and
  this is confirmed by findings on slaughtered animals. Although in
  most instances, the extent of the phagocytosis gave a precise
  indication, examples have been known of cows which did not
  recover although the majority of the streptococci was contained
  within the white corpuscles. These exceptions in turn led to new
  field-work on the part of Vrijburg. As was to be expected
  according to phagocytosis theory, for the organism to triumph
  over the infectious microbes, these must not only be absorbed by
  the white corpuscles but also utterly destroyed. There are cases
  where the streptococci of mammitis, after absorption by the
  phagocytes, demolish the cells and finish by being free to carry
  on their deadly work. To arrive at sound prognosis, the extent of
  the phagocytosis must be measured and the state of the phagocytes
  with the microbes within them must be known too.</p>

  <p>This example of contagious mammitis should
  admonish those who think it enough to determine the opsonic
  strength to be able to judge how an illness or indeed immunity is
  faring.</p>

  <p>In other diseases brought on by
  streptococci, the degree of the phagocytosis can also serve as a
  prognostic. Professor Bumm in Berlin uses this method to
  prognosticate puerperal fever. Strong phagocytosis indicates
  speedy recovery, while minimal or slight phagocytosis means the
  worst is to be feared.</p>

  <p>In the treatment of illness by Dr. Wright's
  vaccinotherapy, the phagocytosis shows the opsonic strength of
  the blood. It is thus a guide to the doctor. We said above that
  this method was coming to be joined by that of determination of
  the property of phagocytes, independently of the opsonic action
  in itself. For some time phagocytosis has been used with success
  in the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases.</p>

  <p>Among the practical applications of the
  doctrine of phagocytosis mention must be made of the use in
  surgery of substances capable of bringing a large quantity of
  white corpuscles to areas under operation and open to infection.
  There are already surgeons in France and in Germany, who
  introduce into the abdominal cavity or under the skin of their
  patients either warmed blood serum or nucleic acid or other
  substance, with the object of bringing to the scene a protective
  army of phagocytes to ward the microbes off. The results achieved
  are so encouraging that it is possible to predict new progress in
  the approach to the dressing of wounds. At the opening of the new
  era in surgery, only the microbe was taken into account and the
  patients were soused in antiseptics. It was soon seen that these
  are poisons that spell danger to the organism under treatment.
  Antiseptics gave way to aseptics. Now it is known that
  phagocytosis is a valuable force in the organism's defences, an
  attempt is being made to modify surgical methods by the adjunct
  of means that reinforce the number of the phagocytes.</p>

  <p>Of the therapeutic methods that have
  emerged latterly, we note the process of Professor Bier. This
  consists in the systematic application of cupping-glasses and
  rubber strips to augment the veinous stasis round abscesses,
  furuncles and similar afflictions of many kinds. Cure is often
  achieved by this means with a rapidity that is little short of
  surprising. It has been asked what caused such success. Modern
  methods of research at their most refined have been used. The
  contradictions have not been entirely removed. But it is
  generally held that the phagocytosis is an important element in
  cure effected by the Bier method. The application of
  cupping-glasses and bands causes veinous stasis and thus an
  oedema is formed round the injured area. At the same time, a
  large number of white corpuscles come to the spot, and these
  serve to strengthen the phagocytosis. In a very recent treatise
  on this subject, the Japanese Dr. Schimodaira, working in a
  European laboratory and with no particular love of the phagocytic
  theory, has nevertheless been forced to admit that augmenting the
  phagocytic reaction in the use of the Bier method is one of the
  main factors effecting cure.</p>

  <p>It is small wonder after so much evidence
  has been given on the valuable part played by the phagocytes,
  that research should concentrate on the conditions capable of
  strengthening phagocytic reaction. A number of works has recently
  been published on this topic. Among the substances that activate
  phagocytosis, mention can be made of quinine, a medicine much
  loved by medical practitioners. Gr&uuml;nspan's research shows
  that weak solutions of two milligrams per hundred raise the power
  of phagocytosis to a marked degree, while solutions fifty times
  stronger give the opposite result. Neisser and Guerrini have
  studied a whole series of substances that stimulate phagocytic
  activity, among which they make especial reference to certain
  solutions of peptones. The chapter on <i>stimulins</i> that we
  opened a long time ago and that had lain forgotten has recently
  been put back on the map again. All means are used to augment the
  phagocytic reaction to ensure cure and immunity. How different by
  far from the ideas that were once sovereign in medicine. I
  remember forty years ago the famous Helmholtz having learned from
  Cohnheim that the pus corpuscles in inflammation come from the
  white corpuscles in the blood, taught, in accordance with the
  then current theories, that the accumulation of such elements
  constituted a danger to the organism, a danger that must be met
  by doses of quinine, capable of paralysing the movements of the
  white corpuscles. It is enough to compare this point of view with
  the actual concept of the benign role of the inflammatory
  reaction in general and of the phagocytic reaction in particular,
  to gather how far we have come.</p>

  <p>The theory of phagocytes, laid down more
  than twenty-five years ago, has come under heavy fire on all
  sides. It is only of late that it has won recognition from the
  well-informed in all lands, and it is only as it were yesterday
  that it has begun to have practical use. We have thus the right
  to hope that for the future medicine will find more than one way
  to bring phagocytosis into play to the benefit of health.</p>

  <p>I have attempted to outline the present
  state of a subject that may serve as an example of the useful
  purpose to be served by purely theoretical research. The study of
  the origin of the digestive organs in the lower animals, since
  long disappeared, has opened up the field little by little,
  leading to a new concept of immunity, to the quest for methods of
  fighting infection and ensuring resistance and recovery, of the
  organism.</p>

  <p>In awarding me a prize for my research on
  immunity, the Nobel Committee has chosen to honour me for all my
  work done over twenty-six years, and in part carried out by my
  many pupils at the Pasteur Institute.</p>

  <p>I express my deepest thanks to the
  Committee for this great distinction which gives me the greatest
  joy any savant can wish for. I have however one fear. Namely that
  the Committee is esteeming my work beyond its true worth. I take
  heart from the thought that it was the intention of the generous
  founder Alfred Nobel to reward men of learning who give their
  lives to knowledge without deriving any benefit from its
  practical applications.</p>
