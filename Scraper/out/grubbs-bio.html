  <h1>Robert H. Grubbs - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="grubbs.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born at home in rural Kentucky in 1942, in a house that
 my father, Howard, had built. He did most of the construction himself
 and built it on land that his father had given him when he married
 my mother Faye. In some places, my birthplace is listed as Calvert
 City and in others Possum Trot. I was actually born between the
 two, so either one really is correct. Both of my parents were from
 small farm families in western Kentucky where most people stayed
 close to their homes. My many aunts, uncles and cousins formed
 a very supportive environment during my childhood. Although my
 grandmother spent her years working on the farm, she was very well
 educated and set a high standard that has resulted in many of her
 grandchildren becoming teachers and educators. She always read,
 told us stories and maintained an intellectual level that was unusual
 in rural Kentucky at that time. My mother was one of six surviving
 children of my grandmother and grandfather, a strawberry farmer.
 Because she was often sick when she was young and of little help
 on the farm, she was sent to college, where she received her teaching
 certificate after two years. She subsequently taught school for
 over 35 years as she moved from a one room school house teaching
 all grades, to a two room school teaching lower grades and finally
 to an elementary school where she taught first grade. Some of my
 early memories are of going to school with her when the baby sitter
 was not available and going to night and weekend classes with her
 while she finished her BA degree. It took her 28 years, but she
 finished her degree. She and my grandmother provided great role
 models for the value of education. Although my father did not attend
 college, he was a very gifted mechanic and a practical engineer.
 I grew up helping him to rebuild car engines, to install plumbing,
 to build houses and to work on my uncles' farms. After my
 father returned from serving two years in the US army in Europe
 during WW II, we moved into Paducah where he took night classes
 to become a diesel mechanic. He then spent many years working for
 the Tennessee Valley Authority, (TVA), operating and maintaining
 heavy equipment that was used in the construction of the extensive
 series of dams in Kentucky and Tennessee. The academic model of
 my mother and grandmother and the very practical, mechanical training
 from my father turned out to be perfect training for organic chemical
 research. I was the middle child between two sisters. My older
 sister became a teacher and has been heavily involved in art and
 painting. My younger sister became the first female journeyman
 electrician in western Kentucky and has spent a number of years
 working for the TVA.</p>
          
        <p>As a child I was always interested in building things. Instead
 of buying candy, I would purchase nails which I used to construct
 things out of scrap wood. My mother always claimed that my spending
 my money on nails instead of on candy was why I was so skinny as
 a kid. As I grew older, farms in Kentucky provided me with many
 jobs in hauling hay and in cutting tobacco. In addition to helping
 fund my college years, these jobs helped me to meet an array of
        very interesting and amazing men and women.</p>
          
            <p>My interest in science started in Junior High School where an
 outstanding science teacher, Mrs. Baumgardner, introduced me to
 the joys of science. In the 50's there were many excellent
 scientists in Paducah, Kentucky, who had settled there to become
 teachers after working in what we called the &quot;Atomic Plant&quot;.
 This was a major uranium refining facility that was located in
 western Kentucky to take advantage of the power and production
 facilities resulting from the TVA construction in the area.</p>
          
            <p>Since I had grown up with parents who had started life on farms
 in rural Kentucky and I had spent many hours working on farms,
 it was natural that I started college at the University of Florida
 as an Agricultural Chemistry major. This field combined my interests
 in science and agriculture. One of my summer jobs in college was
 in an animal nutrition laboratory where I analyzed steer feces
 all summer long. Fortunately, one of my friends was working in
 an organic laboratory for the summer and invited me to help him
 at night. He was working for Merle Battiste, a new faculty member
 at the University of Florida. I found that organic chemicals smelled
 much better than steer feces and that there was great joy in making
 new molecules. Battiste started me on the chemical journey and
 saved me from a life of analyzing animal matter. Shortly after
 joining his group, I read an organic text, <i>Mechanisms and Structure
 in Organic Chemistry </i>by E.S. Gould on reaction mechanisms
 which explained how chemical reactions take place. I was fascinated
 by being able to do rather simple chemical transformations to learn
 about the details of how organic compounds reacted at the molecular
 level. This direct coupling of simple observations with fundamental
 chemical reactions is the power of organic chemistry. Also, building
 new molecules was even more fun than building houses. The reactions
 of cyclopropenes served as the basis for most of my work in the
 Battiste group, and many years later a similar reaction of cyclopropenes
 opened the way to the synthesis of our first generation of catalysts.
 Battiste not only introduced me to organic research, but after
 he had trained me to be a productive researcher, he told me that
 I would have to leave his group. Although it would have been best
 for him for me to stay in his laboratory to finish my degree, he
 encouraged me to move on to a different group in a different part
 of the US to receive broader training. He encouraged me to go to
 Columbia University in New York City where I worked for Ron Breslow.
 Battiste had been Breslow's first PhD student. Just before
 going to Columbia, I heard a young Australian chemist, Rolli Pettit,
 who worked at the University of Texas, lecture at Florida. He
 talked about the stabilization of unstable molecules by coordination
 to transition metals. Rolli, who unfortunately died much too young,
 was an inspirational scientist who helped to direct me toward the
 use of metals in organic chemistry. For my graduate work, I initially
 chose a project related to the Pettit work and finished studying
 the anti-aromaticity of cyclobutadiene. It was an exciting time
 in the Breslow group. A number of students and postdoctoral fellows
 who have since gone on to stellar academic careers worked in the
 group at that time and, along with Breslow, provided an amazingly
 stimulating environment. Working on projects involving metals confirmed
 my desire to turn my research toward transition metal organometallic
 chemistry and I obtained an NIH fellowship to work with Jim Collman
 who had just moved to Stanford. At that time organometallic chemistry
 was in its infancy and it provided a fertile field for a mechanistic
 chemist. There appeared to be an incredible array of important
 catalytic processes emerging in the field while little was known
 about the fundamental transformation involved. Collman had developed
 a systematic method of discussing reaction types that provided
 a basis for starting to understand the steps in Catalytic processes.
 One of the most exciting of these processes was olefin metathesis.
 It turned out that completely new fundamental steps were required
 to understand this reaction.</p>
          
            <p>In 1969, as I finished my fellowship with Collman, Michigan
 State University, (MSU), was the only school that offered me a
 position in which to start my independent academic career. Harold
 Hart, Mike Karabatsos, Gene LeGoff, Don Farnum, Bill Reusch and
 Pete Wagner served as my early mentors at MSU and provided a very
 supportive environment for a starting faculty member. After nine
 very productive years at MSU where I started my work in olefin
 metathesis and a number of other areas of catalysis, I was offered
 a position at Caltech in 1978. Numerous outstanding graduate students
 contributed to my program at MSU. One postdoctoral fellow, however,
 played a major role in developing my research program. Dr. Akira
 Miyashita, who died in 2004, brought a number of new techniques
 to the group as well as an exemplary work ethic. He moved with
 me to Caltech in 1978 where he helped to reestablish the group
 in California.</p>
          
            <p>The faculty at Caltech had created a rich environment for the
 training of outstanding graduate students, and these students,
 along with creative postdoctoral fellows and new faculty colleagues
 allowed my program to grow in many directions to take advantage
 of the growing field of organometallic catalysts. Bob Ireland and
 Dave Evans helped me to return to organic synthesis and to the
 development of new synthetic processes based on transition metals,
 and Peter Dervan and Dennis Dougherty, who provided guidance in
 physical organic chemistry as well as friendship over many years.
 John Bercaw and Harry Gray kept me honest in inorganic chemistry.
 Shortly after I arrived at Caltech, Fred Tebbe, a DuPont chemist,
 reported the structure and reactions of the complex that we later
 named the &quot;Tebbe Reagent.&quot; Working with Dave Evans
 and Stan Pine on sabbatical from CSULA, we demonstrated that this
 reagent provided the first general route for the conversion of
 esters to vinyl ethers. This work also provided the basis for our
 mechanistic work that resulted in the synthesis of the first metathesis
 active metallacyclobutane. Many of the lessons learned with the
 Tebbe reagent were important in later developments. We discovered
 that it was important to develop a commercial source of this organometallic
 reagent so that other researchers could try the reaction without
 making a major investment of time in developing the techniques
 for making the reagent. The utility of the reagent was always limited
 by its instability under normal laboratory conditions. It required
 special air and water free conditions for its use. The desire for
 ease of use drove the early development of the ruthenium catalysts.
 We pursued the ruthenium based catalysts since they did not suffer
 many of the instability problems that had limited the use of the
 earlier tungsten and molybdenum based catalysts. We also developed
 early commercial sources and later commercially viable methods
 for the production of the well defined ruthenium based catalysts.
 In my lecture I discussed many of the developments from this point
 that let to the discovery of the family of ruthenium based metathesis
 catalysts and I named key members of the group who contributed
 directly to their development. Surrounding the group who made the
 key discoveries were others who made equally significant contributions
 that served as the basis for the specifically listed advances.</p>
          
            <p>The olefin metathesis mechanism was one of my first projects
 at MSU and my group explored various aspects of this reaction throughout
 my career. In addition, we explored other mechanistic questions.
 An early project returned me to my interest in cyclobutadiene and
 we designed a mechanistic study to determine if cyclobutadiene
 was really formed from the decomposition of the Pettit iron tricarbonyl
 complexes. Other studies explored the mechanism of the Ziegler
 catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene. Using
 isotopes and stereochemistry, while working along with Mike Steigerwald,
 we developed a method that determined the critical steps in this
 reaction. Other work involved the study of metallacyclopentanes,
 a class of complexes we had become interested in from our early
 mechanistic studies of metathesis. Although metallacyclopentanes
 are not important in olefin metathesis, they have been found to
 be important in a variety of other olefin dimerization reactions.
 In a similar way, the discoveries in olefin metathesis have led
 to new processes that can benefit from detailed mechanistic explorations.
 Many of our advances in ruthenium catalyst development were the
 result of applying the techniques developed earlier in our group
 in the study of other complex catalytic processes.</p>
          
            <p>One of the important developments in the group was the growth
 of research in polymer chemistry. Many of the students and postdoctoral
 fellows who helped to develop our polymer program have moved on
 to outstanding careers and have helped to establish polymer chemistry
 in other universities. The polymer program has opened many new
 opportunities and has led the group in a number of directions from
 biomedical applications to the synthesis of new membranes and barrier
 films. Although ring opening olefin metathesis polymerization,
 (ROMP), provided the path into polymer science, the techniques
 learned have opened possibilities outside of olefin metathesis.
 For example, they have resulted in the development of a new material
 that has found applications in light adjustable interocular lenses.</p>
          
            <p>In the present commercial environment, it is difficult for fundamental
 discoveries to be transitioned into large companies. After a number
 of early frustrations that resulted from attempts to move our work
 directly into major companies, we were involved in the creation
 of a company to aid in the transition of technology from discovery
 to product. Mike Giardello, in addition to developing the first
 commercially viable route to a ruthenium metathesis catalyst, has
 played a major role in establishing Materia, Inc., where many of
 the commercial applications of the ruthenium technology &ndash; and
 other metathesis based products &ndash; were developed.</p>
          
            <p>It has been very pleasing that a process that we started to study
 from pure intellectual curiosity has resulted in new processes
 which have very practical applications. I hope the success of the
 process has been a sufficient reward for the patience of the granting
 agencies who have allowed me to follow the metathesis reaction
 on the wandering path that has resulted from many chance and unanticipated
 discoveries. There are still many turns left on the metathesis
 path.</p>
          
            <p>During my career, over 200 students and postdoctoral fellows
 have worked in my research group. They have all left their mark.
 I thank them all for their hard work, for their creative contributions
 and for making chemistry fun.</p>
          
            <p>During my second year at Columbia, I met a wonderful lady from
 Brooklyn, Helen O'Kane. She has been my companion and best
 friend since that time. I thank her and our three children, Barney,
 now a Professor of Chemistry at Dartmouth, Brendan, an MD resident
 at USC and Kathleen, a PhD in Clinical Psychology program at University
 of Hawaii, who have supported me professionally as well as personally
 during this chemical quest.</p>
