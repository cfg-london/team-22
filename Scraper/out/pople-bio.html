  <h1>John Pople - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="pople.jpg" class="bio-img">My early life was spent in Burnham-on-Sea,
  Somerset, a small seaside resort town (population around 5000) on
  the west coast of England. I was born on October 31, 1925 and
  lived there with my parents until shortly after the end of the
  Second World War in 1946. No member of my family was involved in
  any scientific or technical activity. Indeed, I was the first to
  attend a university.<br>
  <br>
  My father, Keith Pople, owned the principal men's clothing store
  in Burnham. In addition to selling clothes in the shop, he used
  to drive around the surrounding countryside with a car full of
  clothes for people in remote farms and villages. He was
  resourceful and made a fair income, considering the economic
  difficulties during the depression of the 1930s. My
  great-grandfather had come to Burnham around 1850 and set up a
  number of local businesses. He had a large family and these were
  split up among his children. As a result, I had relatives in many
  of the other businesses in the town. My grandfather inherited the
  clothing shop and this passed to my father when he returned from
  the army at end of the First World War.<br>
  <br>
  My mother, Mary Jones, came from a farming background. Her father
  had moved from Shropshire as a young man and had farmed near Bath
  for most of his life. I suspect that he would have preferred to
  be a teacher, for he had a large collection of books and
  encyclopedias. He wanted my mother to be a schoolteacher, but
  this did not happen. Instead, she became a tutor to children in a
  rich family and, later, a librarian in the army during the first
  war. Most of her relatives were farmers in various parts of
  Somerset and Wiltshire so, as small children, my younger brother
  and I spent much time staying on farms.<br>
  <br>
  Both of my parents were ambitious for their children; from an
  early age I was told that I was expected to do more than continue
  to run a small business in this small town. Education was
  important and seen as a way of moving forward. However,
  difficulties arose in the choice of school. There was a good
  preparatory school in Burnham but, as part of the complex English
  class system, it was not open to children of retail tradesmen,
  even if they could afford the fees. The available alternative was
  unsatisfactory and my parents must have agonized over what to do.
  Eventually, they decided to send us to Bristol Grammar School
  (BGS) in the nearest big city thirty miles away. BGS was the
  prime day school for boys, catering mainly to middle class
  families resident in the city, although it received a government
  grant for accepting about thirty boys a year from the state
  elementary schools. I went there in the spring of 1936 at the age
  of ten. Some arrangement had to be made for boarding and I used
  to return home by train each weekend. This I found unappealing
  and eventually I persuaded my parents to allow me to commute
  daily - two miles by bicycle, twenty-five miles by train and one
  mile on foot. I continued to do this during the early part of the
  war, a challenging experience during the many air attacks on
  Bristol. Often, we had to wend our way past burning buildings and
  around unexploded bombs on the way to school in the morning. Many
  classes had to be held in damp concrete shelters under the
  playing fields. In spite of all these difficulties, the school
  staff coped well and I received a superb education.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of twelve, I developed an intense interest in
  mathematics. On exposure to algebra, I was fascinated by
  simultaneous equations and rapidly read ahead of the class to the
  end of the book. I found a discarded textbook on calculus in a
  wastebasket and read it from cover to cover. Within a year, I was
  familiar with most of the normal school mathematical curriculum.
  I even started some research projects, formulating the theory of
  permutations in response to a challenge about the number of
  possible batting orders of the eleven players in a cricket team.
  For a very short time, I thought this to be original work but was
  mortified to find <i>n!</i> described in a textbook. I then
  attempted to extend <i>n!</i> to fractional numbers by various
  interpolation schemes. Despite a lot of effort, this project was
  ultimately unsuccessful; I was angry with myself when I learned
  of Euler's solution some years later. However, these early
  experiences were valuable in formulating an attitude of
  persistence in research.<br>
  <br>
  All this mathematical activity was kept secret. My parents did
  not comprehend what I was doing and, in class, I often introduced
  deliberate errors in my exercises to avoid giving an impression
  of being too clever. My grades outside of mathematics and science
  were undistinguished so I usually ended up several places down in
  the monthly class order. This all changed suddenly three years
  later when the new senior mathematics teacher, R.C. Lyness,
  decided to challenge the class with an unusually difficult test.
  I succumbed to temptation and turned in a perfect paper, with
  multiple solutions to many of the problems. Shortly afterwards,
  my parents and I were summoned to a special conference with the
  headmaster at which it was decided that I should be prepared for
  a scholarship in mathematics at Cambridge University. During the remaining
  two years at BGS, I received intense personal coaching from
  Lyness and the senior physics master, T.A. Morris. Both were
  outstanding teachers. The school, like many others in Britain,
  attached great importance to the placement of students at
  Oxford or
  Cambridge. Most such awards were in the classics and I think that
  the mathematics and science staff were very anxious to compete.
  Ironically, during the last two years at BGS, I abandoned
  chemistry to concentrate on mathematics and physics. In 1942, I
  travelled to Cambridge to take the scholarship examination at
  Trinity
  College, received an award and entered the university in
  October 1943.<br>
  <br>
  In the middle of the war, most young men of my age were inducted
  into the armed forces at the age of seventeen. However, a small
  group of students in mathematics, science and medicine was
  permitted to attend university before taking part in wartime
  research projects such as radar, nuclear explosives,
  code-breaking and the like. This was a highly successful project
  and many of my predecessors in earlier years made important
  contributions to the war effort. The plan was to complete all
  degree courses in only two years, followed by secondment to a
  government research establishment. In my case, I completed Part
  II of the mathematical tripos in May 1945, just as the European
  war was ending. In fact, it was hard to concentrate on the
  examinations because of the noisy celebrations going on in the
  streets outside. The government no longer had need for my
  services and the university was under great pressure to make room
  for the deluge of exservicemen as they were demobilized from the
  armed forces. So, I had to leave Cambridge and take up industrial
  employment for a period. This was with the Bristol Aeroplane
  Company, close to where I had attended school. There was little
  to do there and I had a period of enforced idleness as changing
  employment was illegal at the time (part of the obsession for a
  planned economy in postwar Britain).<br>
  <br>
  In 1945, I had little idea of what my future career might be. My
  interest in pure mathematics began to wane; after toying with
  several ideas, I finally resolved to use my mathematical skills
  in some branch of science. The choice of a particular field was
  postponed, so I devoted much of my time to pestering government
  offices for permission to return to Cambridge and resume my
  studies. In the late summer of 1947, I finally received a letter
  informing me that an unexpectedly large number of students had
  failed their examinations and a few places were available. So, in
  October 1947, I returned to Cambridge to begin a career in
  mathematical science.<br>
  <br>
  Cambridge in 1947 had greatly changed since 1943. The university
  was crowded with students in their late twenties who had spent
  many years away at the war. In addition, the lectures were given
  by the younger generation who had also been away on research
  projects. There was a general air of excitement as these people
  turned their attention to new scientific challenges. I remained
  as a mathematics student but spent the academic year 1947-8
  taking courses in as many branches of theoretical science as I
  could manage. These included quantum mechanics (taught in part by
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a>), fluid
  dynamics, cosmology and statistical mechanics. Most of the class
  opted for research in fundamental areas of physics such as
  quantum electrodynamics which was an active field at the time. I
  felt that challenging the likes of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> and Dirac was
  overambitious and decided to seek a less crowded (and possibly
  easier) branch of science. I developed an interest in the theory
  of liquids, particularly as the statistical mechanics of this
  phase had received relatively little attention, compared with
  solids and gases. I approached Fred Hoyle, who was giving the
  statistical mechanics lectures (following the death of R.H.
  Fowler). However, his current interests were in the fields of
  astrophysics and cosmology, which I found rather remote from
  everyday experience. I next approached Sir John Lennard-Jones
  (LJ), who had published important papers on a theory of liquids
  in 1937. He held the chair of theoretical chemistry at Cambridge
  and was lecturing on molecular orbital theory at the time. When I
  approached him, he told me that his interests were currently in
  electronic structure but he would very possibly return to liquid
  theory at some time. On this basis, we agreed that I would become
  a research student with him for the following year. Thus, after
  the examinations in June 1948, I began my career in theoretical
  chemistry at the beginning of July. I had almost no chemical
  background, having last taken a chemistry course at BGS at the
  age of fifteen. Other important events took place in my life at
  this time. In late 1947, I was attempting to learn to play the
  piano and rented an instrument for the attic in which I lived in
  the most remote part of Trinity College. The neighbouring room
  was occupied by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who had
  retired to live in primitive and undisturbed conditions in the
  same attic area. There is some evidence that my musical efforts
  distracted him so much that he left Cambridge shortly thereafter.
  In the following year, I sought out a professional teacher. The
  young lady I contacted, Joy Bowers, subsequently became my wife.
  We were married in Great St. Mary's Church, Cambridge in 1952,
  after a long courtship. Like many other Laureates, I have benefit
  immeasurably from the love and support of my wife and children.
  Life with a scientist who is often changing jobs and is
  frequently away at meetings and on lecture tours is not easy.
  Without a secure home base, I could not have made much progress.
  The next ten years (1948-1958) were spent in Cambridge. I was a
  research student until 1951, then a research fellow at Trinity
  College and finally a lecturer on the Mathematics Faculty from
  1954 to 1958. Cambridge was an extraordinarily active place
  during that decade. I was a close observer of the remarkable
  developments in molecular biology, leading up to the double helix
  papers of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Watson</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Crick</a>. At the same
  time, the X-ray group of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">Perutz</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">Kendrew</a> (introduced to
  the Cavendish Laboratory by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html">Lawrence Bragg</a>) were
  achieving the first definitive structures of proteins. Elsewhere,
  Hoyle, Bondi and Gold were arguing their case for a cosmology of
  continuous creation, ultimately disproved but vigorously
  presented. Looking through the list of earlier Nobel laureates, I
  note a large number with whom I became acquainted and with whom I
  interacted during those years as they passed through
  Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  In the theoretical chemistry department, LJ was professor and
  Frank Boys started as lecturer in September 1948. I began
  research with some studies of the water molecule, examining the
  nature of the lone pairs of electrons. This was an initial step
  towards a theory of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and
  a preliminary, rather empirical study of the structure of liquid
  water. This fulfilled my initial objective of dealing with
  properties of liquids and gained me a Ph.D. and a research
  fellowship at Trinity College. This highly competitive stage
  accomplished, I was able to relax a bit and formulate a more
  general philosophy for future research in chemistry. The general
  plan of developing mathematical models for simulating a whole
  chemistry was formulated, at least in principle, some time late
  in 1952. It is the progress towards those early objectives that
  is the subject of my Nobel lecture.<br>
  <br>
  At that early date, of course, computational resources were
  limited to hand calculators and very limited access to motorized
  electric machines. So my early notes show attempts to simplify
  theories enough to turn them into practical possibilities. The
  work paralleling studies of Pariser and Parr led to what became
  known as PPP theory. This was not a complete model but rather one
  applicable to systems with only one significant electron per
  atom. It did fit the general form of conjugated hydrocarbons and
  achieved some notoriety. In 1953, Bob Parr came to Cambridge to
  spend a year with Frank Boys. We shared an office and had many
  valuable discussions; he was to have a major influence on my
  future. I talked about PPP theory when I began to speak at
  international meetings in 1955.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the PPP work, I started theoretical work on other
  topics in physical chemistry. I began supervision of research
  students in 1952, beginning with David Buckingham, who completed
  a masterly thesis on properties of compressed gases. He was the
  first of a long list of remarkably able and dedicated students
  who have worked with me over the years. In 1954, LJ was succeeded
  as professor of theoretical chemistry by Christopher
  Longuet-Higgins, who was joined by Leslie Orgel shortly
  afterwards. I continued to spend a lot of time in the chemistry
  department, although by then I had undertaken new teaching
  responsibilities as a lecturer in mathematics. The department was
  crowded and active in those years. Among the many visitors were
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/index.html">Linus Pauling</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1966/index.html">Robert
  Mulliken</a>, Jack Kirkwood, Clemens Roothaan and Bill Schneider.
  Frank Boys was also managing a lively group of students.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of 1955, I developed an interest in nuclear magnetic
  resonance, which was then emerging as a powerful technique for
  studying molecular structure. At the urging of Bill Schneider, I
  agreed to spend two summers (1956 and 1957) at the National
  Research Council in Ottawa, Canada, working on the theoretical
  background of NMR. This was extremely stimulating for, at that
  time, we were measuring the spectra and interpreting the nuclear
  spin behaviour of many standard chemicals for the first time. My
  time there with Bill and Harold Bernstein led to a book, <i>High
  Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,</i> which was well
  received. This area was the main emphasis of my research during
  the final years in Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  By 1958, I had become dissatisfied with my mathematics teaching
  position at Cambridge. I had clearly changed from being a
  mathematician to a practicing scientist. Indeed, I was
  increasingly embarassed that I could no longer follow some of the
  more modern branches of pure mathematics, in which my
  undergraduate students were being examined. I therefore resolved
  to seek a new job with greater scientific content. After some
  hesitation, I accepted a position as head of the new Basics
  Physics Division at the National Physical Laboratory near London.
  This involved direction of experimental work and a considerable
  amount of administration. When I took the job, I hoped that the
  administrative burden would not be large enough to interfere with
  my research programme. Although I was given plenty of help, this
  turned out not to be so and I had a rather fallow period while I
  was there.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1961, I organized an international conference in
  Oxford, along with Charles Coulson and Christopher
  Longuet-Higgins. Bob Parr was an invited speaker and, during a
  break, he urged me to come and spend a sabbatical year at
  Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. This was an
  attractive suggestion and I arranged to come for the academic
  year 1961-2 with my family. By this time, Joy and I had three
  children and were expecting a fourth. We arrived in September,
  accompanied by a charming young Swedish <i>au pair,</i> Elisabeth
  Fahlvik. One of the most delightful side-effects of winning the
  Nobel Prize is the opportunity to meet her again after a gap of
  over thirty-six years.<br>
  <br>
  By the time we arrived in Pittsburgh, Bob Parr had decided to
  leave for Johns
  Hopkins University and he did, in fact, leave in January.
  Nevertheless, we had a delightful year, travelling as a family
  over much of the eastern part of the U.S.A. During this period, I
  made up my mind to abandon my administrative job and seek an
  opportunity to devote as much time as possible to chemical
  research. I was approaching the age of forty, with a substantial
  publication record, but had not yet held any position in a
  chemistry department. When we returned to England in June, 1962,
  it was not clear where we might go for there were opportunities
  both in the U.K. and the U.S.A. Eventually, after much debate, we
  decided to return to Pittsburgh in 1964. Leaving England was a
  painful decision and we still have some regrets about it.
  However, at that time, the research environment for theoretical
  chemistry was clearly better in the U.S.<br>
  <br>
  On my return to Pittsburgh, I resolved to go back to the
  fundamental problems of electronic structure that I had
  contemplated abstractly many years earlier. Prospects of really
  implementing model chemistries had improved because of the
  emerging development of high-speed computers. I was late in
  recognizing the role that computers, would play in the field
  &#8211; I should not have been, for Frank Boys was continually
  urging the use of early machines back in Cambridge days. However,
  by 1964, it was clear that the development of an efficient
  computer code was one of the major tasks facing a practical
  theoretician and I learned the trade with enthusiasm. Mellon
  Institute, where I had an adjunct appointment, acquired a Control
  Data machine in 1966 and my group was able to make rapid progress
  in the dingy deep basement of that classic building. In 1967,
  Carnegie Tech and Mellon Institute merged to become Carnegie-Mellon
  University (CMU) and I remained on the faculty there until
  1993. Almost all of the work honored by the Nobel Foundation was
  done at CMU. That institution deserves much of the credit for
  their continuing support and encouragement over many years.<br>
  <br>
  The scientific details of the Pittsburgh work are related, in
  part, in the accompanying lecture. Over the years, we were able
  to keep abreast with the rapid developments in computer
  technology. Around 1971, the work was moved to a Univac 1108
  machine and then, in 1978, we were fortunate enough to acquire
  the first VAX/780 minicomputer from the Digital Equipment
  Corporation for use entirely within the chemistry department.
  This became a valuable workhorse as we began to distribute
  programs to the general chemical community. In more recent years,
  of course, the techniques have become available on small work
  stations and personal computers. The astonishing progress made in
  computer technology has had profound consequences in so many
  branches of theoretical science.<br>
  <br>
  Our children were mostly brought up and educated in the Churchill
  suburb east of Pittsburgh. Each summer, we took them back to
  England for an extended period. By 1979, all had gone away and
  Joy and I decided to move again to Illinois, where our daughter
  had settled. In 1981, we set up house in Rogers Park, Chicago and
  then moved to Wilmette in 1988. Our family is now scattered in
  Chicago, Houston, Pittsburgh and Cork, Ireland. We have been
  blessed with ten grandchildren (an eleventh expected), who
  greatly enrich our lives in many ways.<br>
  <br>
  From 1981 to 1993, I continued to run my research group in
  Pittsburgh, commuting frequently and communicating with my
  students by telephone and modem. Northwestern
  University kindly offered me an adjunct appointment and I
  became a full member of their faculty in 1993. I am very grateful
  to them for the opportunity to continue my research programme and
  interact with other members of the chemistry department.<br>
  <br>
  I have had many opportunities to visit universities all over the
  world in the past fifty years. Among the most rewarding have been
  frequent trips to Australia and New Zealand, where Joy and I have
  wintered no fewer than nine times since 1982. The campus of the
  Australian
  National University, where Leo Radom became Professor after
  spending time with me as a postdoctoral fellow from 1968 to 1972,
  has become a second academic home &#8211; a great place for
  relaxed contemplation.<br>
  <br>
  Israel and Germany are other countries with which I have become
  closely associated, having visited and collaborated many times.
  In the 1980s, I held a von Humboldt Award, which allowed me to
  spend some time in Erlangen, where I collaborated with Paul
  Schleyer on a large number of applications of the theory. In
  Israel, I have visited and lectured at all universities,
  including a period as Visiting Professor at the Technion, Haifa.
  In 1992, I was fortunate enough to receive the Wolf Prize in
  Chemistry at a ceremony in the Knesset.<br>
  <br>
  I must emphasize that my contribution to quantum chemistry has
  depended hugely on work by others. The international community in
  our field is a close one, meeting frequently and exchanging ideas
  freely. I am delighted to have had students, friends and
  colleagues in so many nations and to have learned so much of what
  I know from them. This Nobel Award honours them all.</p>
