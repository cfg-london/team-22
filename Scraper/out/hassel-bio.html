  <h1>Odd Hassel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hassel.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Odd Hassel</b> was born in Kristiania
  (now Oslo), Norway, I7 May, 1897. His father was Ernst Hassel, a
  physician who specialized in gynaecology, his mother Mathilde
  n&eacute;e Klaveness.<br>
  <br>
  In 1915 he entered the University of his native town where he
  studied mathematics and physics with chemistry as his chief
  subject and graduated as a cand. real. in 1920. After a year of
  leisure in France and Italy he went to Germany in the autumn of
  1922 where he first spent more than half a year in Munich in the
  laboratory of Professor K. Fajans. Work on the sensibilisation of
  silver halides by organic dyes led to the detection of what is
  now termed the "adsorption indicators" After moving to Berlin
  Hassel worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Dahlem, carrying
  out X-ray crystallographic work. During that time he obtained, on
  the proposal of <a href="../1918/index.html">Fritz Haber</a>, a
  Rockefeller Fellowship. In 1924 he graduated as Dr. Phil. at the
  Berlin University. From 1925 to 1926 he worked at the University
  of Oslo in the capacity of "universitetsstipendiat", from 1926 to
  1934 as "dosent" in physical chemistry and electrochemistry. From
  1934 to 1964 he had the chair of physical chemistry in Oslo, the
  first of its kind in Norway, and headed the department of
  physical chemistry started in 1934.<br>
  <br>
  Hassel's main interest during the first years of his teaching at
  the University of
  Oslo dealt with inorganic chemistry, but from 1930 onwards
  his work was concentrated on problems connected with molecular
  structure, particularly the structure of cyclohexane and its
  derivatives and other substances containing six-membered rings
  related to that of cyclohexane.<br>
  <br>
  In order to supplement the experimental methods available two
  additional methods not previously used in Norway were introduced;
  the measurements of electric dipole moments and electron
  diffraction by vapours. Sufficient experimental material had been
  gathered by 1943 to allow more general conclusions regarding the
  possible configurations (conformations) and the transition
  between them to be drawn. A short paper had just been published
  in a Norwegian journal when Hassel was arrested by Norwegian
  Nazis and later taken into custody by the German occupants.
  Released in November 1944 he found the institute almost deserted.
  After the war experimental work could be taken up again and in
  particular electron-diffraction work based on the rotating sector
  method.<br>
  <br>
  During the early 1950's Hassel opened a new field of structure
  investigation, namely that of the charge-transfer compounds.
  Compounds formed by organic electron- donor molecules like ethers
  and amines and electron acceptors as halogen molecules or organic
  halides had mainly been investigated by spectroscopic methods.
  Information on the steric structures was scarce, however, and a
  series of structure determinations was undertaken. After some
  years work he was able to set up rules for the geometry of this
  kind of addition compounds, and this field still remains his main
  interest in structural chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Hassel holds honorary degrees from the Universities of
  Copenhagen and Stockholm. He is an honorary Fellow of the Norwegian
  Chemical Society and of the Chemical Society, London.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences, the Royal
  Danish Academy of Sciences, the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1969/hassel-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> and the
  Royal Norwegian Academy of Science. In 1964 he received the
  Guldberg-Waage Medal from the Norwegian Chemical Society and the
  Gunnerus Medal from the Royal Norwegian Academy of
  Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Knight of the Order of St. Olav.<br>
  <br>
  From 1967 a lecture is given yearly by distinguished scientists
  from abroad to his honour at the University of Oslo ("The Hassel
  Lecture").</p>
