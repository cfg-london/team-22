  <h1>Rigoberta Mench&uacute; Tum - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tum.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Rigoberta Mench&uacute;</b> was born on
  January 9, 1959 to a poor Indian peasant family and raised in the
  Quiche branch of the Mayan culture. In her early years she helped
  with the family farm work, either in the northern highlands where
  her family lived, or on the Pacific coast, where both adults and
  children went to pick coffee on the big plantations.<br>
  <br>
  Rigoberta Mench&uacute; soon became involved in social reform
  activities through the Catholic Church, and became prominent in
  the women's rights movement when still only a teenager. Such
  reform work aroused considerable opposition in influential
  circles, especially after a guerilla organization established
  itself in the area. The Mench&uacute; family was accused of taking
  part in guerrilla activities and Rigoberta's father, Vicente, was
  imprisoned and tortured for allegedly having participated in the
  execution of a local plantation owner. After his release, he
  joined the recently founded Committee of the Peasant Union
  (CUC).<br>
  <br>
  In 1979, Rigoberta, too, joined the CUC. That year her brother
  was arrested, tortured and killed by the army. The following
  year, her father was killed when security forces in the capital
  stormed the Spanish Embassy where he and some other peasants were
  staying. Shortly afterwards, her mother also died after having
  been arrested, tortured and raped. Rigoberta became increasingly
  active in the CUC, and taught herself Spanish as well as other
  Mayan languages than her native Quiche. In 1980, she figured
  prominently in a strike the CUC organized for better conditions
  for farm workers on the Pacific coast, and on May 1, 1981, she
  was active in large demonstrations in the capital. She joined the
  radical 31st of January Popular Front, in which her contribution
  chiefly consisted of educating the Indian peasant population in
  resistance to massive military oppression.<br>
  <br>
  In 1981, Rigoberta Mench&uacute; had to go into hiding in
  Guatemala, and then flee to Mexico. That marked the beginning of
  a new phase in her life: as the organizer abroad of resistance to
  oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for Indian peasant
  peoples' rights. In 1982, she took part in the founding of the
  joint opposition body, The United Representation of the
  Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). In 1983, she told her life story to
  Elisabeth Burgos Debray. The resulting book, called in English,
  <i>I, Rigoberta Mench&uacute;</i>, is a gripping human document
  which attracted considerable international attention. In 1986,
  Rigoberta Mench&uacute; became a member of the National
  Coordinating Committee of the CUC, and the following year she
  performed as the narrator in a powerful film called <i>When the
  Mountains Tremble</i>, about the struggles and sufferings of the
  Maya people. On at least three occasions, Rigoberta Mench&uacute;
  has returned to Guatemala to plead the cause of the Indian
  peasants, but death threats have forced her to return into
  exile.<br>
  <br>
  Over the years, Rigoberta Mench&uacute; has become widely known as
  a leading advocate of Indian rights and ethno-cultural
  reconciliation, not only in Guatemala but in the Western
  Hemisphere generally, and her work has earned her several
  international awards.</p>
