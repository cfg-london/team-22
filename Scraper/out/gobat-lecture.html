  <h2>The Development of the Hague Conventions of July 29,
  1899</h2>

  <p>It will soon be seven years since the ninth
  Interparliamentary Conference<sup><a href="#not1">1</a></sup> met
  here in your capital city. It was a notable assembly whose
  participants will long remember the magnificent hospitality of
  Norway. Some time before that meeting the official
  representatives of the majority of European, American, and Asian
  powers had gathered at The Hague to discuss the most important
  questions affecting the law of nations; and on the fourth of
  August, just as our deliberations here were nearing their close,
  we received word of the actions taken by the Hague
  Conference<sup><a href="#not2">2</a></sup>. Our assembly was the
  first to acclaim this great work, and several of our speakers
  paid it handsome tribute not far from here in the Chamber of the
  Norwegian Parliament. No one will deny that this first general
  congress of world powers was brought about by the efforts of the
  Interparliamentary Union. It is therefore hardly surprising that
  the Union should not only submit the resolutions of the Hague
  Conference to exhaustive discussion, but should also work for the
  convocation of a second conference. At our request, President
  Roosevelt has been kind enough to assume the initiative in this
  matter<sup><a href="#not3">3</a></sup>. You must agree, then,
  that it would be difficult for one who has been secretary-general
  of the Interparliamentary Union for the past fifteen years and
  who has in this capacity been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, to
  select a more appropriate or topical subject than the work of the
  Hague Conference.</p>

  <p>This great assembly of nations drew up
  three international conventions<sup><a href="#not4">4</a></sup>.
  Today I shall confine myself to only one of these, that
  concerning the pacific settlement of international disputes. It
  can be divided into two parts: preservation of general peace, and
  international arbitration.</p>

  <p>To keep the peace! What a noble and
  magnificent idea! How many hopes are stirred by the thought that
  this greatest of all ideals - the maintenance of peace - should
  be the objective of an international convention bearing the
  signatures of most of the nations of the world! How sad to
  relate, then, that it is precisely this part of the Hague
  Convention of July 29, 1899, which to date has been applied
  least. For it has averted neither the Boer War nor the
  Russo-Japanese Wars<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>, not to speak
  of colonial wars.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of preserving general
  peace, the Convention established procedures for making offers of
  good offices and for mediation. The first entails an offer made
  by one or several nations, in the event of imminent war or during
  the course of actual war, to intercede between the belligerents
  in an effort to effect conciliation - a very useful procedure and
  one easily carried out, for all that is required is a diplomatic
  note. And since, under the terms of the Hague Convention, neither
  the offer of good offices nor its rejection can be considered an
  unfriendly act, all powers, especially those favorably disposed
  to one or the other of the adversaries, should be only too
  anxious to offer their services. It is highly probable that in
  most cases war could be avoided or ended. For discussions allow
  passion to subside; and to persuade alienated neighbors, or at
  least one of them, to listen to the voice of a conciliator, is a
  step in the direction of peace.</p>

  <p>If we examine the Hague Convention
  carefully, we see that it considers the offer of good offices a
  duty of every nation. In other words, such offers should be made
  whenever a dispute becomes critical and threatens to explode into
  war. Article 27 is very clear on this point. Now not only have
  nations failed in this obligation, but, worse still, when at the
  beginning of the war between Russia and Japan, the President of
  the United States<sup><a href="#not6">6</a></sup> was said to be
  on the point of offering his good offices, the
  government-inspired Russian press declared that any such act
  would be regarded as unfriendly. Thus, in this one instance a
  double violation of the Convention took place: first, by the
  failure of any nation to offer its good offices, and second, by
  the Russian government's semiofficial declaration that such an
  offer would be looked upon as an unfriendly act. But the
  Convention had already been violated previously, only a few
  months after the Hague Conference. No government, no head of
  state made any attempt to avert or arrest the Boer War.
  Civilization and morality have not yet influenced nations to
  consider inviolable a promise or agreement, solemnly signed and
  sealed, when it becomes part of international law. Ordinary
  citizens are obliged and, if need be, compelled by force to meet
  their commitments. But let higher obligations of an international
  order be involved, and governments repudiate them, more often
  than not with a disdainful shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>We can, however, record one very honorable
  exception: President Roosevelt, in spite of everything, persisted
  in offering his good offices to the Russians and Japanese.
  Neither party chose to condemn the offer as an unfriendly act.
  Exhausted by a terrible war, both accepted, and peace was
  concluded<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> under the folds of the
  star-spangled banner. President Roosevelt was the first head of
  state to apply the rules of the Hague Convention concerning the
  preservation of general peace. Honor and glory to this eminent
  statesman!</p>

  <p>Since the procedure of offering good
  offices can effectively contribute to the maintenance of peace,
  and since the powers seem reluctant to use it voluntarily, there
  should be a way of organizing it so that it may be applied in all
  cases. Good offices may be either offered or required. An offer
  is preferable, but it should not have to depend purely and simply
  on chance; nor should indifference, false pride, fear, or secret
  satisfaction at the sight of two nations tearing each other apart
  prevent this sacred obligation from being exercised in all its
  dignity. By the organization of good offices I mean the
  establishment of a convention under the terms of which the powers
  obliged to offer them would be designated for each individual
  case. The signatories of the Hague Convention could be arranged
  in groups of two or three, the individual groups being nominated
  in advance to act in given contingencies; in other words, every
  possible conflict would be covered by a group of states, of whom
  at least one would be obliged to offer its good offices. Since
  the number of warlike powers is fortunately limited, it is no
  difficult matter to determine what possibilities of war exist.
  The adoption of such a system would mean that hostilities could
  never break out without the adversaries first having been
  exhorted to listen to the voice of conciliation.</p>

  <p>The second method contained in the Hague
  Convention for preserving peace is that of mediation. There is a
  subtle distinction between this method and the one just outlined:
  whereas good offices are intended primarily to assure preliminary
  conciliation, the mediating power may go so far as to propose
  terms of settlement. Everything I have just said about good
  offices holds true in the case of mediation. Here again, it is a
  great pity that the Conference, after devoting five articles to
  it, stopped halfway and did not make mediation compulsory. It
  should have been stipulated that the conflicting parties must,
  before opening hostilities, call upon one or more friendly powers
  to mediate in the dispute. Compulsory mediation was provided for
  in the Declaration of Paris of 1856; the seven contracting
  parties<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a> undertook to refer to
  mediation any dispute arising from the implementation of the
  agreement. Compulsory mediation was also provided for in the
  draft treaty of arbitration drawn up by the United States and
  Great Britain in 1897<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>. These two
  examples alone give abundant proof that mediation can feasibly be
  incorporated on a compulsory basis in the Hague Convention. In
  acceding to this rule of mediation no power would in any way be
  abrogating its rights to another. For mediation is simply an
  attempt at conciliation like that which is insisted upon by many
  civil codes before a case can be taken to court. The mediator's
  proposals are not a judgment but a simple, friendly presentation.
  The sovereignty of the states involved remains completely intact,
  and it would really take a peculiarly obstinate government,
  devoid of all moral sense and concern for intellectual values, to
  reject mediation in the face of impending war. The state ruled by
  such a government would place itself beyond the precincts of
  civilization.</p>

  <p>Compulsory arbitration is a practical
  instrument of pacification and, as such, it can and should be
  enacted by the Hague Conference. By laying down the procedure and
  the rules for arbitration, by placing a permanent court of
  arbitration at the disposal of conflicting powers, the Conference
  has no more than made a start upon its task in the realm of
  international justice. All of this is discretionary and left to
  the goodwill of nations. What is more, the powers seem to be in
  no hurry to rally to the idea of general treaties of arbitration,
  for only three have concluded such treaties to date: Denmark, The
  Netherlands, and Italy<a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>. It will
  be a long while yet, unfortunately, before the military powers
  recognize the principle accepted thousands of years ago in
  relations between individuals: that nations are obliged to submit
  their controversies to the processes of law.</p>

  <p>In this sphere of arbitration treaties, the
  Hague Conference could introduce a ruling that certain categories
  of international disputes should be submitted to arbitration. In
  my opinion this is the most that can be hoped for at present - I
  repeat, in the sphere of arbitration treaties. It is likely that
  the fourteenth Interparliamentary Conference, which is to meet
  next week in London, will express this opinion<a href=
  "#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Under such circumstances, military
  powers will still have too many opportunities and too many
  pretexts to unleash the horrors of war. This is what compulsory
  mediation could prevent. And even if this very simple and logical
  method were not accepted, then another possibility would still
  remain: compulsory contractual mediation, whereby nations having
  incomplete treaties of arbitration would be compelled to insert
  into these treaties the following clause which the United States
  and Great Britain had adopted in their draft treaty of 1897: "In
  the event a dispute arises which is not subject to arbitration
  under the terms of the present treaty, the contracting parties
  undertake to request the mediation of one or several friendly
  powers." This formula would make an outbreak of war impossible
  without some attempt at conciliation having been made first. Now
  this is crucial. For it is hardly tenable that, once mediation
  has been accepted, agreement should not finally be reached. Peace
  negotiations between Japan and Russia were fraught with so many
  difficulties that success appeared to be out of the question; yet
  the voice of President Roosevelt prevailed in the end.</p>

  <p>Let us restate the principal conclusions we
  have reached so far. We must:<br>
  (1) Organize offers of good offices.<br>
  (2) Substitute compulsory for optional mediation in the
  Convention of July 29, 1899.<br>
  (3) In some cases, that is to say when compulsory mediation is
  not accepted, declare that the mediation clause will always be
  inserted into every arbitration treaty, subject to the exclusion
  of certain disputes.</p>

  <p>I should now like to consider the Hague
  Conference as an international political institution.</p>

  <p>Before dispersing, the members of that
  first general congress of civilized states resolved to meet again
  at some future date. This is in effect the implication of the
  Final Act of the Conference, which stipulated that three
  questions<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a> be referred for
  examination to a subsequent conference, and furthermore that the
  governments concerned should study the question of limiting armed
  forces and that of the types and calibers of firearms, with a
  view to reaching agreement. This mention of agreement clearly
  presupposes a discussion of these problems at another conference.
  Thus the nations represented at the Conference of 1899, and those
  who later acceded, affirmed in principle that similar gatherings
  would be convened in the future. Certainly, one cannot dispute
  the fact that they are deliberative assemblies, since the first
  Hague Conference has yielded three important international
  conventions, a permanent court of arbitration, and an
  administrative council. We can, therefore, truly say that there
  is in existence an international political organization whose
  object is the regulation of common international problems. But
  this is neither the first nor the only such organization. The
  international offices for postal (Universal Postal Union) and
  telegraph services, for railways, and for the protection of
  intellectual properties are also international political
  organizations, created to serve particular interests common to
  the whole of the civilized world. I cite these offices situated
  in Bern to illustrate how general conferences of states can give
  rise to the establishment of international political institutions
  equipped with administrative machinery that function for the
  benefit of humanity in the same way that public authorities in
  our civilized states function.</p>

  <p>Let us for a moment consider the Hague
  Conference from this point of view. You may perhaps have heard of
  the proposal submitted last year by the American Group to the
  Interparliamentary Conference at Brussels, that the latter should
  organize a kind of world parliament<a href=
  "#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>. However alluring the picture of an
  amphictyonic council embracing all civilized nations may be, I do
  not believe that our efforts should be directed toward this end,
  an end whose realization can scarcely be glimpsed even in some
  dim and distant future. In any case, the Hague Conference can
  offer to mankind, to civilization, and to justice the same
  services that an international parliament could offer. And since
  it already exists, there is no need to create it. What is
  necessary is to perfect its organization and to ensure its
  ability to function properly.</p>

  <p>In the first place the Conference must be
  convened. The best method of assuring this is to have it meet at
  regular intervals. Let it take place every three or every five
  years. There is no fear of an empty agenda! Nations are linked by
  so many conventions, agreements, understandings, so many
  practices and interests that these common concerns alone could
  fill the program of an entire conference.</p>

  <p>Second, the Conference must be arranged in
  such a way that it can function effectively. For this reason
  neither the program of the Conference nor its decisions should be
  subject to unanimous approval. If the majority decides that a
  question be placed on the agenda, then it should be discussed
  regardless of any opposition. I grant you that, for the time
  being, resolutions would be binding only on nations who voted in
  their favor. But let the future attend to making them universally
  binding, and let us be satisfied if we reach the point where it
  will be impossible for one state to thwart the discussion of a
  question by obstruction or systematic opposition.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Conference must be equipped
  with an administrative organization. This is absolutely vital for
  any Areopagus which disbands after completing its work but which
  is to reassemble at a later date. Such an organization presents
  no problems. As proof of this, I cite the international offices
  in Bern already mentioned; these are precisely administrative
  organs that function on behalf of the states forming the
  international unions charged with postal and telegraph services,
  railways, and the protection of literary and artistic works. It
  is scarcely to be expected that the member nations of the Hague
  Conference will immediately establish, on a similar scale, an
  office of international political affairs. But it is certainly
  possible to guarantee at least the continuity of the Hague
  Conference as an institution, both in terms of its existence and
  of its work. Among the duties which could be referred to such an
  administrative organ I mention the following:<br>
  (1) To communicate the decisions of the Conference to the
  governments of the states which have taken part.<br>
  (2) To invite other states to accede to such decisions.<br>
  (3) To receive and study claims arising from the implementation
  of the resolutions and conventions passed by the Hague
  Conference.<br>
  (4) To prepare a memorandum for the next Conference on the
  subject of these difficulties, if the states themselves have not
  provided some other method of resolving them.<br>
  (5) To prepare the next Conference.<br>
  (6) To convene the latter.</p>

  <p>The organization in question could be set
  up in a variety of ways. The Office (president and secretaries)
  of the Conference, or a committee appointed by it, or a special
  administrative body such as the International Bureau instituted
  by the Convention of July 29, 1899 (Art. 22) - any of these could
  easily handle the assignments involved, especially the last
  named. For the two cases are highly analogous. Since the
  International Court of Arbitration is not in fact permanent
  because it sits only when its decisions are sought, a permanent
  office<a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a> has been attached to it.
  By the same token, a similar office could be set up for the
  benefit of the Conference itself, which would be meeting only
  every three or five years.</p>

  <p>But I do not wish to impose any longer on
  your kind attention. What I have said represents the thoughts of
  a practical politician. It is true that I am not one of those who
  laugh at utopias. The utopia of today can become the reality of
  tomorrow. Utopias are conceived by optimistic logic which regards
  constant social and political progress as the ultimate goal of
  human endeavor; pessimism would plunge a hopeless mankind into a
  fresh cataclysm. But though I take my place in the crowded ranks
  of the optimists, I draw a distinction between the aims which can
  be realized immediately and those for which we are not yet ready.
  Today one thing is certain: thanks to the marvellous inventions
  and discoveries of our era, the human spirit has finally awakened
  a social order long dormant: the solidarity of nations. This
  solidarity, spurred on by an irrepressible force to assert
  itself, must be protected in the exercise of its rights and
  duties. May the Hague Conference be its instrument! May the
  Conference act as its shield against the modern barbarians who
  would menace it. Civilization can justly rejoice in possessing in
  it an institution capable of advancing the aspirations and ideals
  of mankind. Let us wish this important Conference, so long and so
  impatiently awaited, every success and prosperity. May the second
  assembly and those which follow - upholders of the law and
  custodians of man's happiness - develop, perfect, and consummate
  the great work so auspiciously - begun!</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not*"></a>*Having requested and
  received an extension of time in which to discharge his
  obligation as a laureate, Dr. Gobat delivered his Nobel lecture
  three and a half years after receiving the prize. According to
  the Oslo <i>Morgenbladet</i> for July 19, 1906, he did so in
  German after being introduced by Mr. L&oslash;vland, chairman of
  the Nobel Committee, at the Nobel Institute in Oslo on July 18,
  1906. The <i>Morgenbladet</i> remarks that many people attended
  even though it was the middle of summer. The French text, the
  only one available, on which this translation is based is taken
  from <i>Les Prix Nobel en 1902: Suppl&eacute;ment</i> (Stockholm,
  1907).</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not1" id="not1"></a>1. Meeting of
  the Interparliamentary Union, founded in 1888 through Passy and
  Cremer (peace laureates for 1901 and 1903) and composed of
  members of parliaments from various nations. The primary
  objective of the Union at this time was to promote, via
  governmental channels, the principle of solving international
  disputes by arbitration; it also studied other problems related
  to international law and to peace in general. For a good brief
  account of the Union and its relations with the universal peace
  congresses, see F.S.L. Lyons, <i>Internationalism in Europe
  1815-1914</i> (Leyden: A.W. Sythoff, 1963), pp. 325-330.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not2" id="not2"></a>2. The Hague
  Conference of 1899 approved three conventions, three
  declarations, one resolution, and six <i>voeux</i> or
  recommendations.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not3" id="not3"></a>3. See
  biography, p. 40.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not4" id="not4"></a>4. The three
  international conventions were: I. Convention for the pacific
  settlement of international disputes. II. Convention with respect
  to the laws and customs of war on land. III. Convention for the
  adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva
  Convention of August 22, 1864.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not5" id="not5"></a>5. Boer War
  (1899-1902); Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not6" id="not6"></a>6. President
  Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), recipient of the Nobel Peace
  Prize for 1906.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not7" id="not7"></a>7. By the
  Treaty of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, signed September 5,
  1905.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not8" id="not8"></a>8. The
  Declaration of Paris, an agreement concerning rules of maritime
  warfare, was issued by the Congress of Paris which negotiated the
  Treaty of Paris after the Crimean War; the contracting parties
  were Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia,
  and Turkey.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not9" id="not9"></a>9. Signed by
  Secretary of State Richard Olney and British Ambassador Julian
  Pauncefote but not ratified by the United States Senate; the
  treaty was significant because it stated terms on which two
  nations might henceforth deal with each other.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not10" id="not10"></a>10. Numerous
  specific treaties of arbitration had been concluded between
  various powers since 1899. But only Denmark, The Netherlands,
  Italy, and later Portugal were, up to the time of the 1907
  Conference, willing to bind themselves to submit practically all
  disputes to arbitration.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not11" id="not11"></a>11. The
  Conference adopted a model arbitration treaty for powers that did
  not consider themselves in a position to submit all international
  disputes to arbitration.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not12" id="not12"></a>12. The three
  dealt with the rights and duties of neutrals, the inviolability
  of private property in naval warfare, and the bombardment of
  ports, towns, and villages by naval forces.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not13" id="not13"></a>13. For this
  proposal, see <i>Union interparlementaire: R&eacute;solutions des
  conf&eacute;rences et decisions principales du consei</i>l by
  Christian L. Lange (Brussels: Misch &amp; Thron, 1911), pp.
  93-94.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not14" id="not14"></a>14. This
  Bureau, established by Article 22 of Convention I, served the
  Court as a record office, as a channel of communication on court
  meetings, as administrator, and as depository of documents
  relative to actions by special tribunals.</p>
