  <h1>Albert Gobat - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gobat.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Charles
  Albert Gobat</b> (May 21, 1843-March 16, 1914) was born at
  Tramelan, Switzerland, the son of a Protestant pastor and the
  nephew of Samuel Gobat, a missionary who became bishop of
  Jerusalem. A brilliant student, he studied at the Universities of
  Basel, Heidelberg,
  Bern, and Paris, taking his
  doctorate in law, <i>summa cum laude</i>, from Heidelberg in
  1867.<br>
  <br>
  For the next fifteen years, Gobat devoted his time and energy to
  the law. He began his practice in Bern and, at the same time,
  lectured on French civil law at Bern University. He then opened
  an office in Del&eacute;mont in the canton of Bern, which soon
  became the leading legal firm of the district.<br>
  <br>
  After 1882, however, he became increasingly absorbed in politics
  and education. In that year he was appointed superintendent of
  public instruction for the canton of Bern, a position he held for
  thirty years. A progressive in educational philosophy, he
  reformed the system of primary training, obtained increased
  budgetary support to improve the teacher-pupil ratio, supported
  the study of living languages, provided pupils with an
  alternative to the traditionally narrow classical education by
  establishing curricula in vocational and professional
  training.<br>
  <br>
  His personal scholarship was concerned with history. He won
  acclaim for his erudite <i>R&eacute;publique de Berne et la France
  pendant les guerres de religion</i> (1891) and widespread
  recognition (as well as large sales) for his more popularly
  conceived <i>Histoire de la Suisse racont&eacute;e au peuple</i> [A
  People's History of Switzerland] (1900).<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he was pursuing a career in politics. In 1882 he was
  elected to the Grand Council of Bern, becoming president of the
  cantonal government for the 1886-1887 term. From 1884 to 1890 he
  was a member of the Council of States of Switzerland and from
  1890 until his death a member of the National Council, the other
  chamber of the central Swiss legislative body. In politics as in
  education, Gobat was a liberal, a moderate reformer. A major
  piece of legislation he sponsored in 1902 applied the principle
  of arbitration to commercial treaties. By its terms, Switzerland
  agreed to insert in all commercial treaties such as customs
  agreements, a clause requiring the parties to submit to the
  Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague any dispute that
  might arise from the day-to-day operation of the treaty.<br>
  <br>
  The Interparliamentary Union,
  which held its first major international conference in 1889,
  provided Gobat with an appealing outlet for his advocacy of
  arbitration and peace. Founded largely through the efforts of the
  English parliamentarian <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1903/index.html">Cremer</a>, a Nobel Peace
  Prizewinner in 1903, and the French Deputy <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/index.html">Passy</a>, a co-recipient of
  the Nobel Peace Prize for 1901, the Interparliamentary Union,
  then as now, brought together interested members of the
  parliaments of all countries to discuss international issues and
  to explore ways to improve collaboration among nations via
  parliamentary and democratic institutions; at this time, however,
  its primary objective was to promote international
  arbitration.<br>
  <br>
  Gobat presided over the fourth conference of the Union convened
  in 1892 at Bern. This conference officially established a central
  headquarters at Bern to be called the Interparliamentary Bureau
  and entrusted its direction to Albert Gobat. As director of the
  Bureau, a position he filled without remuneration for the next
  seventeen years, Gobat supervised the details of setting up the
  annual conferences, prepared the agenda, arranged for the
  publication of the proceedings (beginning in 1896), edited a
  monthly publication to which he frequently made personal
  contributions, encouraged members to sponsor within their own
  legislatures proposals to improve relations among nations. After
  the twelfth Interparliamentary Conference of 1904 in St. Louis
  passed a resolution calling for a second Hague Peace Conference,
  it was Gobat who acted as the Union's spokesman in asking U. S.
  President <a href="../1906/index.html">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to
  appeal to all nations to participate in such conference.<a href=

  <br>
  When <a href="index.html">&Eacute;lie Ducommun</a>, co-laureate for
  1902, died in 1906, Gobat took over the direction of the <a href=
  "../1910/index.html">International Peace Bureau</a>, performing
  duties for that office during the next eight years analogous to
  those he had discharged for the Interparliamentary Bureau.<br>
  <br>
  Gobat died with his boots on. On March 16, 1914, while attending
  meeting of the peace conference at Bern, he arose as if to speak
  but collapsed, dying about an hour later.</p>

  responded affirmatively to this request and shortly thereafter

  For various reasons, however, the credit for convening the
  Conference of 1907 is legitimately ascribed to Czar Nicholas II
