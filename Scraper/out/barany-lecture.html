  <h2>Some New Methods for Functional Testing of the Vestibular
  Apparatus and the Cerebellum</h2>

  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! It gives me great
  pleasure to be giving the Nobel Lecture before you. In it I shall
  be reporting on the results of my research for which the Royal
  <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1914/barany-lecture.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se" target="_blank">Caroline Institute</a>
  - permit me here once again to give public expression of my
  deepest gratitude - has awarded me the Nobel Prize. Naturally I
  can only present a fraction of these results and I shall have to
  content myself with telling you briefly the history of those
  discoveries, the understanding of which only requires a minimum
  of specialist knowledge. For, as one becomes immersed in the
  material, the things which must be known for a proper
  comprehension of what follows become so numerous and complicated
  that it would almost certainly be impossible for the lay public
  to follow and I must regard as laymen, Ladies and Gentlemen, not
  only the many non-medical persons among you, but also the
  representatives of other branches of medical science whose
  presence here does me great honour. I have already given, on
  repeated occasions, a historical account of my discoveries. I
  must, therefore, ask the indulgence of those specialist
  colleagues, the Prize judges and the members of the Royal
  Caroline Institute who have found my work worthy of the highest
  scientific distinction if I say nothing which is new or
  interesting to them. This, if I have understood it aright, is not
  the purpose of the Nobel Lecture either, for it should serve far
  more to give the lay public a glimpse into the world of thought
  and work of the research scientist, just as the distinguished
  founder of this prize was a layman himself. To raise the general
  cultural level of mankind by promoting scientific work lay very
  close to the heart of Alfred Nobel. I shall ask this eminent
  gathering to regard my lecture from this standpoint.</p>

  <p>I will start by describing to you the
  discovery of a new method of testing the apparatus of the
  semi-circular canals. As you will know, the inner ear, not only
  in humans but also in all vertebrates, consists of the cochlea
  for the purpose of hearing and the vestibulo-semi-circular
  canals. The anatomy of the vestibulo-semi-circular apparatus has
  been enormously developed here in Sweden by Gustaf Retzius whose
  wonderful work in this sphere I can show you here. You will see
  the manifold developments of the semi-circular canal apparatus in
  different classes of vertebrates. I can pass round anatomical
  preparations of this organ in man thanks to the kindness of the
  Director of the Otological Clinic, Professor G. Holmgren. Up
  until the 19th century there was a complete lack of knowledge of
  its function. The first to begin experimental investigations in
  this field was the celebrated French physiologist Flourens. His
  investigations were published in 1825. Flourens thought that it
  would be possible to get an insight into the function of the
  semi-circular canal apparatus by destroying it. In fact, these
  experiments which were undertaken with pigeons, rabbits and other
  animals produced quite remarkable, constant and previously
  unknown disturbances. For instance, if the horizontal
  semi-circular canal was destroyed in a pigeon, it went on turning
  horizontally in a circle. If a vertical semi-circular canal was
  destroyed, the pigeon turned somersaults. Flourens has described
  the phenomena extremely well. But he did not give an explanation.
  In particular, he did not have the faintest idea that the animals
  were suffering from vertigo. For the well known symptoms of
  vertigo in humans are too different from those in animals for
  Flourens to have been able to see this connection. Also, the work
  of a great physiologist in Prague, Purkinje, was unknown to
  Flourens, although Purkinje was actually, in the same year,
  investigating the phenomena of vertigo in humans. Purkinje tried
  out his experiments partly on himself and partly on mentally sick
  persons, who, at that time, if they became violent were treated
  by being rotated in a cage until such time as the nausea thus
  induced made them quiet and manageable again. Purkinje has
  discovered the involuntary movements of the eye ball during
  vertigo, the nystagmus of the eyes, about which we shall be
  speaking a great deal. He has also proved the influence of the
  head position upon the vertigo symptoms and has shown that the
  vertigo arises in the head itself. He thought, it is true, that
  the brain itself was being directly stimulated by the rotation.
  He knew of Flourens's work. But strangely enough he too did not
  realize that Flourens's animals were suffering from vertigo, nor
  that in the spot where certain sensations arise there must be a
  sensory organ present which receives them. Like other research
  scientists of the 19th century, he had not yet penetrated far
  enough into epistemology. Even such an obvious idea as to observe
  an animal with vertigo or to rotate an animal did not occur to
  him, in spite of the fact that he conducted numerous vertigo
  experiments with human subjects and made frequent use of animal
  experiments. You can see from this how easily one can pass by
  within an inch of the truth.</p>

  <p>As neither of these two great research
  scientists was able to find the solution to the mystery, it is
  small wonder that none of their contemporaries were able to do so
  either. Science stood still in this respect for nearly 40 years.
  Only in the year 1861 was a Frenchman, M&eacute;ni&egrave;re, able to
  take a bold step forward.</p>

  <p>M&eacute;ini&egrave;re proceeded along totally
  different lines from his predecessors. He was an otologist and
  had observed from a purely clinical standpoint the frequent
  coincidence of vertigo, "Schwerh&ouml;rigkeit" and tinnitus in
  cases with normal middle ear. The site of hearing was now known
  to be in the cochlea. Its destruction or impairment caused the
  tinnitus and the "Schwerh&ouml;rigkeit". Vertigo, it was thought
  at the time, could only be caused by a disease of the cerebellum.
  He observed this kind of patient for years and saw absolutely no
  symptoms of brain disease. Apart from Flourens's experiments, the
  semi-circular canal apparatus which is connected with the cochlea
  was at that time thought to have no function. It was not known
  what the disease there might produce. M&eacute;ni&egrave;re now had
  the idea that the vertigo phenomena were symptoms of disease in
  the semi-circular canal apparatus and he now succeeded, where
  Flourens and Purkinje had failed, in seeing through the confusing
  diversity of the vertigo manifestations in humans and in animals
  and recognizing that those animals whose semi-circular canals had
  been operated upon by Flourens had vertigo. This was the
  principle great achievement of the man who, unfortunately, did
  not survive to enjoy the fame of his discovery since he died in
  the same year. M&eacute;ni&egrave;re did not express himself as
  regards the importance of the semi-circular canal apparatus in
  normal life. The first to produce a theory on this was the German
  physiologist, Goltz, in 1870. He thought approximately as
  follows: if the destruction of the semi-circular canal apparatus
  gives rise to vertigo and imbalance, then the normal function of
  this apparatus must be to maintain equilibrium. And he formulated
  a theory as to how this might be so. I will not go into this
  theory here, since it was subsequently proved to be incorrect.
  But from this example you will see the chief importance of a
  working hypothesis. The interpretation of facts in a certain way
  stimulates other scientists' thoughts. The incorrectness and
  weaknesses of a theory cause other minds to formulate the
  problems more exactly and in this way scientific progress is
  made. In actual fact, we observe the spectacle not uncommon in
  the history of medicine, that only a few years later, in 1874,
  three men arrived all at the same time at a theory concerning the
  semi-circular canal apparatus which is even today, broadly
  speaking, correct. These were a general practitioner who is still
  alive, Dr. Josef Breuer in Vienna, the Viennese physicist and
  philosopher, Ernst Mach, who died last year and the American,
  Crum Brown, in Philadelphia. These three men arrived at the same
  result in very different ways. Breuer started by repeating
  Flourens's experiments with pigeons with improved technique and
  came directly to the conviction that movement of the fluid in the
  semi-circular canals, the endolymph, gave rise to the Flourens
  phenomena. He was, in addition, the first to put animals into
  rotation and proved thereby that the same phenomena which
  Flourens had produced by destruction of the semi-circular canals
  could be equally well produced by rotating the animal when the
  symptoms would be only transitory and harmless to it, the
  symptoms being, in fact, the result of rotatory vertigo. He also
  proved that when the semi-circular canals were destroyed on both
  sides, rotation no longer produced these symptoms. With this
  experiment he was the man who purposely took the first steps on
  the way towards establishing the function of the semi-circular
  canal apparatus. As a result of his experiments and of much
  physiological and anatomical deliberation, he came to the
  conclusion that the semi-circular canal apparatus is a sensory
  organ for the perception of rotary motion and that the phenomena
  of rotatory vertigo is the result of abnormally strong
  stimulation of this sensory organ. Mach set to work in quite a
  different way. First he established the mathematical equations
  for rotary movements. Then he made some investigations with human
  subjects to ascertain whether there was any evidence of a sensory
  organ capable of perceiving rotary motion. For as a thinker of
  the philosophical school he could not make the same mistake as
  Purkinje of imagining that the brain itself perceived directly
  its pulling as a result of rotation. Gradually, as a result of
  his deliberations, he was able to prove that all the other senses
  were incapable of producing the turning sensation. There remained
  only the semi-circular canal apparatus and he then showed that
  this, by virtue of its structure, was absolutely suited to the
  task of perceiving rotary movement. Crum Brown solved the problem
  in yet another way. He investigated a number of persons with
  regard to their vertigo symptoms and without much further thought
  he came directly to the assumption that the semi-circular canal
  mechanism must be the sensory organ capable of apprehending these
  quite specific sensations.</p>

  <p>These are the founders of the theory of the
  semi-circular canal apparatus. Out of the large number of
  subsequent research scientists I can only name a few with the
  most outstanding achievements. Among the physiologists there is
  the Hungarian H&ouml;gyes; Ewald, a pupil of Goltz, and among the
  clinicians Jansen, an otologist in Berlin. H&ouml;gyes began by
  reexamining and modifying the experiments of Flourens and Breuer.
  He then set himself the task of establishing the site of the
  central mechanism governing the movements of the eyes, the
  nystagmus already referred to, which is set in motion by the
  movement of the endolymph. Here he was successful in the case of
  rabbits. He was able to show that the nystagmus mechanism is
  located in the parts of the brain between the entrance of the
  auditory nerve into the medulla oblongata and the corpora
  quadrigemina, and that the removal of other parts of the brain
  has no great influence on the course of this reflex. Hogyes also
  produced the best description of the symptoms after uni- and
  bilateral destruction of the semi-circular canals in animals and,
  in particular, proof that these symptoms are at their most
  violent immediately after the injury and then gradually subside,
  furthermore that the violent symptoms caused by the destruction
  of one side only can be reduced to a minimum by the destruction
  of the other side. He proved, in fact that the semi-circular
  canal on the one side influences that on the other side and that
  during stimulation they balance one another. It was Ewald who
  conducted the most exact experiments on the semi-circular
  apparatus in animals. He established an unquestionable connection
  between specifically directed head and eye movements of the
  animal with specifically directed movements of the endolymph in
  the semi-circular canals. It was he, also, who proved the
  extraordinarily marked and powerful influence of stimulation of
  the semi-circular canal apparatus upon the entire body
  musculature, thereby adding to the purely psychological theory of
  this organ an important new aspect, that of the tonic, reflex
  influence on the body muscles. Among the clinicians of this
  epoch, Jansen comes next in importance after Breuer and Mach. He
  was the first to discover the great significance of nystagmus of
  the eye as a symptom of disease of the semi-circular canal
  apparatus. He has given an extremely good description of the
  course of symptoms in human beings after destruction of the
  semi-circular canals, although he was, in fact, unaware that he
  was describing their destruction. He believed rather that he was
  referring to a special form of disease. Jansen also showed the
  great frequency with which diseases of the semi-circular canals
  occur in cases of suppuration of the middle ear and he was the
  first to remove by operation a suppurating semi-circular canal in
  human patients. In spite of the pioneer work of all these men,
  however, the whole field of diseases of the semi-circular canals
  in humans was veiled in obscurity. It was impossible to
  understand all the phenomena observed, for there was no real
  method for testing the function of the apparatus such as had long
  since been carried out for other sensory organs.</p>

  <p>This is understandable because in the case
  of other sensory organs the test of function was easy to
  instigate. It was only necessary to arrange the various stimuli
  systematically and then, after exclusion of one of the sensory
  organs which occur everywhere in pairs, to test the other. This
  can be done with the eye, the auditory organ, the nose, taste and
  skin sensitivity. But this system of one-sided testing was
  impossible with the semi-circular canal apparatus.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The rotary method instigated by Breuer
  stimulated both sides at once and was, therefore, not
  satisfactory for clinical use where one-sided testing was nearly
  always required. The galvanic reaction method discovered by
  Purkinje and further studied by Hitzig and others did not give
  results which were suitable for clinical use, and this is still
  the case today. The caloric reaction method which I discovered
  was the first to bring light into this obscurity. Only after its
  discovery was a methodical examination of the function of the
  semi-circular canals made possible. Permit me now to tell you
  about the history of its discovery.</p>

  <p>As a young otologist I worked in Professor
  Politzer's Clinic in Vienna. Among my patients there were many
  who required syringing of the ears. A number of them complained
  afterwards of vertigo. Obviously I examined their eyes and I
  noticed in doing this that there was nystagmus in a certain
  direction. I made a note of this. After a time, when I had
  collected about twenty of these observations, I compared them one
  with another and was amazed always to find the same note. I then
  realized that some general principle must be implied, but at the
  time I did not understand it. Chance came to my aid. One of my
  patients, whose ears I was syringing, said to me: "Doctor, I only
  get giddy when the water is not warm enough. When I do my own
  ears at home and use warm enough water I never get giddy." I then
  called the nurse and asked her to get me warmer water for the
  syringe. She maintained that it was already warm enough. I
  replied that if the patient found it too cold we should conform
  to his wish. The next time she brought me very hot water in the
  bowl. When I syringed the patient's ear he shouted: "But Doctor,
  this water is much too hot and now I am giddy again." I quickly
  observed his eyes and noticed that the nystagmus was in an
  exactly opposite direction from the previous one when cold water
  had been used. It came to me then in a flash that obviously the
  temperature of the water was responsible for the nystagmus. From
  this I immediately drew certain conclusions. If the temperature
  of the water was really responsible, then water at exactly body
  temperature should cause neither nystagmus nor vertigo. An
  experiment confirmed this conclusion. Furthermore, I said to
  myself, if it is the temperature of the water, nystagmus must be
  caused in normal cases also and not only in cases of suppurating
  ears. This I was also able to prove.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Because of my earlier research, I did not
  doubt for a second that the nystagmus was the result of a reflex
  action of the semi-circular canals. Hence, the further conclusion
  followed that if these were destroyed there would be no reflex
  action. I was able now to look among the abundant material
  available in the Vienna Otological Clinic for a suitable case.
  Before long, I found a case of severe suppuration of the middle
  ear, in which, even after continuous cold syringing, there was no
  nystagmus reaction. I diagnosed destruction of the labyrinth (or
  semi-circular canal mechanism) and an operation proved this to be
  correct. The importance of this reaction in the diagnosis of
  diseases of the inner ear was obvious. But there had now to be a
  series of cases in order to confirm its correctness. This was
  forthcoming. Afterwards I set myself to study the clinical value
  of this method of testing the semi-circular canal apparatus,
  using the caloric reaction as a control, while at the same time a
  clinic now had to be set up for diseases of the semi-circular
  canals. In this a number of research scientists have co-operated
  and I must mention in particular, in addition to those of the
  Vienna school, the Stockholm Professor of Otology, Gunnar
  Holmgren. I had already recognized the importance of the caloric
  reaction and yet I could not explain it. In vain I reflected upon
  it. Then, one day, I had an idea. I remembered the bath water
  tank and my surprise, as a child, at finding the water
  immediately above the fire quite cold, whereas higher up, at the
  top, the tank was so hot that it burned ones finger. The
  labyrinth reminded me of a bath-water tank, i.e. a container
  filled with fluid. The temperature of the fluid is, of course,
  37&deg;C - body temperature. Suppose I spray one side of the
  container with cold water? What will happen? The water on this
  side of the tank will cool, of course, and, therefore, it will
  attain a higher specific weight than the surrounding water and
  will sink to the bottom of the container. Other water at body
  temperature will take its place. If I syringe the ear with hot
  water, on the other hand, the movement will be exactly the
  opposite. The movement of the fluid must change, however, when I
  alter the position of the container, and if I turn the container
  through 180&deg;, it must change in exactly the opposite
  direction. Immediately I was able to envisage the kind of test
  which would serve as <i>experimentum crucis</i> for this theory.
  If, in two head positions differing from one another by
  180&deg;, it is possible to obtain nystagmus in opposite
  directions by syringing, whether with hot or cold fluid, then
  this theory must be correct. I went to the clinic and arranged
  the experiment and, in fact, the hoped-for result showed itself
  very clearly. Two head positions differing by 180&deg; show
  nystagmus in exactly opposite directions. The theory of the
  reaction was now established and it agreed absolutely with the
  theory of both Breuer and Mach which had recognized the movements
  of the endolymph, the fluid contained in the semi-circular
  canals, as being the cause of stimulation in them.</p>

  <p>I will not proceed any further with this
  line of thought, but, on the other hand, mention my discoveries
  with regard to localization in the cerebellum. The investigations
  of <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/index.html">Ram&oacute;n y
  Cajal</a>, the Spanish histologist, who is also a Nobel Prize
  winner, have shown that each fibre of the nervus vestibularis,
  i.e. the semi-circular canal nerve, divides into a number of
  branches at the point of entry into the brain. One branch leads
  towards a group of cells which are in direct connection with the
  ganglia cells of the central eye muscles and we can understand,
  therefore, why stimulation of the semi-circular canal causes
  nystagmus of the eyes. One branch, however, goes into the
  cerebellum and divides into a series of branches leading to the
  two side portions of the cerebellum, the so-called cerebellar
  hemispheres, and to the central portion of the cerebellum, the
  vermis. Admittedly Ram&oacute;n y Cajal only carried out these
  investigations on the embryos of quite small animals. His methods
  are not applicable to larger animals and, in particular, to human
  beings. Analogy, however, allowed me to conclude that in humans
  also there must be a connection between the semi-circular canal
  nerve and the cerebellum. Up until now, I have only mentioned
  among the symptoms caused by vertigo the turning sensation and
  the eye nystagmus. But you are all aware of the other symptoms,
  in particular the effect upon the trunk muscles caused by
  disturbances of equilibrium. I cannot give you all the reasons
  here which led me to conclude that this influence upon the
  muscular apparatus of the whole body comes from the semi-circular
  canals via the brain, but the book by the Dutch anatomist, Louis
  Balk, on the cerebellum in mammals, which appeared in 1906, gave
  me some very valuable pointers. In this book Balk tells us
  roughly what follows. The efforts of the physiologists have shown
  us that the cerebellum has something to do with the innervation
  of the muscular apparatus. In vertebrates we find that the
  muscular apparatus of the body is very different in different
  classes of animal. For instance, the giraffe has an enormously
  long and mobile neck, the mole has a very short and quite
  immobile neck. Bolk decided, therefore, that obviously the parts
  of the brain which take care of he neck muscles in these animals
  must be developed in quite a different way. He examined the
  cerebellum in both these species and noticed the extremely
  striking formation of a certain portion of it in the giraffe
  which was almost completely missing in the mole. From this Balk
  concluded that this particular portion was concerned with the
  innervation of the neck muscles. In a similar way coming to
  conclusions, he arrived at quite definite localizations for all
  parts of the cerebellum and, what is particularly important for
  us, that the muscular apparatus of the upper and lower
  extremities was represented in the side portions of the
  cerebellum and that of the trunk in the centre portion. Testing
  the influence of the semi-circular canal apparatus on the trunk
  muscles is very simple. The patient is asked to stand or walk and
  disturbances of equilibrium, deviation from a straight line, are
  noted when the semi-circular canal is stimulated, e.g. by cold
  water. The effect of stimulation upon the extremities, e.g. the
  upper extremities, is also very easily demonstrated. The patient
  is asked to stretch his arm straight out and keep it quite still.
  Without stimulation of the semi-circular canal mechanism this is
  done without difficulty. If, however, the ear, let us say the
  right ear, is syringed with cold water, the patient's arm will
  move slowly towards the right without his being aware of it. It
  can easily be shown that this deviation of movement will also
  occur with the left upper extremity and also with both legs. This
  experiment is the most certain way of demonstrating the direct
  influence on the muscular mechanism. Usually, however, I employ
  the so-called pointing test. This is as follows: The patient is
  asked to close his eyes and touch the doctor's finger with his
  own index finger, then, still keeping the arm outstretched, to
  lower it to knee-level, then raise it again and touch the
  doctor's finger once more. In a normal state, with very little
  practice, this can be done without difficulty. After stimulation
  of the semi-circular canal, i.e. after syringing of the right ear
  with cold water, a normal subject will not be able to touch the
  doctor's finger, but will pass it on the right. The direction of
  this deviation will differ according to the direction of the
  nystagmus and is always in an opposite direction to the
  nystagmus. Should, for instance, nystagmus occur to the right,
  the finger will pass the target to the left. If nystagmus occurs
  in a downward direction, then deviation will be upwards.
  Nystagmus in an upward direction will be associated with
  deviation below the target. The reactions always affect all four
  extremities and the whole muscular apparatus.</p>

  <p>I was now successful in proving that a
  direction of movement is localized in the cerebellum. For I found
  cases in which the reaction of the extremities was missing in one
  direction only (on the side of the cerebellar hemisphere which
  was diseased) whereas the reaction of the extremities on the
  other, healthy side and all the other reactions in the
  extremities on the diseased side were normal. This indicated that
  the nerve cells and nerve fibres concerned with reaction in a
  certain direction must lie close together within the cerebellar
  hemisphere. Close investigations, however, proved something more
  namely that within such a centre there was also localization with
  regard to joints. For I found cases where deviation only occurred
  in a certain joint of the extremity, while all other reactions
  were normal. For instance, failure in the pointing test only
  occurred in the shoulder joint of the right arm towards the left,
  whereas the elbow joint of the right arm, the right wrist, the
  hip joint of the right leg and all the joints of the left side
  showed a normal reaction to the left when there was nystagmus to
  the right.</p>

  <p>The investigations also proved that there
  were many cases of spontaneous deviation, i.e. <i>cases where
  there had been no stimulation of the semi-circular canal
  apparatus</i>. Let us assume, for instance, that in one case the
  right shoulder joint deviates to the right. If in such a case I
  tested the reactions while there was a nystagmus to the right,
  the right shoulder joint showed no deviation to the left but
  pointed correctly, whereas the other extremities and joints
  showed the typical deviation to the left. From an accumulation of
  such experiments I came to an absolutely definite concept of the
  method of action of the cerebellum. I assumed the presence in the
  cerebellum of four centres in which the muscular apparatus was
  arranged firstly according to direction and within these centres
  according to articulation - one centre for the right, one for the
  left, one for an upwards and one for a downwards direction. In
  normal people, as long as there is no stimulation of the
  semi-circular canals, these four centers provide a certain
  tension, called tonus, for the muscles during movement of the
  extremities. Each pair of these centres acts like two reins
  between which the arm, for instance, moves. If both reins are
  spanned equally tightly, the arm moves, without any deviation,
  towards the required position. I might, however, pull one rein
  harder than the other. This happens if I stimulate the
  semi-circular canal mechanism. If I produce a nystagmus to the
  left, this is equivalent to pulling on the right-hand rein and,
  therefore, the arm deviates to the right. But I can also bring
  about a deviation of the right arm to the right if I cut the
  left-hand rein, for then the tension of the right-hand rein which
  is already present without any stimulation of the semi-circular
  canal will make itself felt and will pull the right arm
  spontaneously to the right. If I now attempt to tighten the
  left-hand rein, this is now, of course, impossible since it has
  been cut. All I can do is to relax the right-hand rein completely
  and then the arm will once again point correctly.</p>

  <p>Let us now translate this comparison into
  medical language. Disease of a certain centre, for instance the
  centre for the tonus of the right arm towards the left, causes
  the right arm to deviate to the right without any stimulation of
  the semi-circular canal mechanism: there is spontaneous deviation
  in the pointing test to the right. If I produce a nystagmus to
  the right, i.e. if I attempt to stimulate the tonus centre for
  the right arm to the left, I am unsuccessful, for this centre is
  diseased and is not functioning. All I can do is to inhibit the
  tonus centre for the right arm to the right completely and thus
  obtain correct pointing. This is the chief interpretation of the
  physiology and pathology of the cerebellum which I profess. There
  are many other illustrations of it which I have not time to
  mention here.</p>

  <p>Finally, I must mention one more experiment
  which I was the first to use with human subjects and which seems
  to me to give important results for our study of localization in
  the brain. It is an experiment which the physiologist W.
  Trendelenburg first used on apes. Trendelenburg exposed the dura
  mater over the right cerebral hemisphere just at that spot which
  experience has shown to be the movement centre for the left hand.
  The localization of muscles in the cerebrum has been very exactly
  defined, thanks to the work of a number of research scientists.
  Over this spot Trendelenburg fastened a capsule through which he
  could pour iced water. The animal was then put into the cage
  where it soon recovered from the narcosis and began to move
  around the cage and eat, etc. Trendelenburg, who was standing
  outside the cage, now suddenly poured iced water through the
  capsule. Instantly the ape's left arm fell paralysed to its side,
  without, however, the animal noticing. It went on quite happily
  eating its turnips or climbing around in the cage, but now,
  instead of using all four extremities, it only used three, for
  the left arm was paralysed. This paralysing effect lasted as long
  as the cooling effect of the iced water on the cerebral cortex.
  If Trendelenburg exchanged iced water for water at body
  temperature, the left arm at once came into use again. The animal
  began to use it for climbing, eating, etc. just as though it had
  not been paralysed a few seconds earlier. Trendelenburg was able
  to repeat this experiment over and over again without the
  slightest damage being shown, and no paralysis remained. This
  very interesting and important experiment was pointed out to me
  by Professor Kolmer and I decided at once to use it upon human
  subjects. Quite by chance, a patient was available with a healed
  cere-bellar abscess whose life I had saved by operation. Here the
  dura mater of the cerebellum was exposed immediately underneath
  the skin and I thought I would try to cool this spot on the skin
  in order to paralyse temporarily the cerebellum lying beneath it.
  As a result of the experiment with apes, it was to be assumed
  that no harm would come to the patient from this procedure. I
  decided that although the cooling of the skin might not be very
  pleasant, I could reasonably expose this patient, whose life I
  had saved, to this small discomfort in order to achieve
  scientific progress which would benefit the whole of humanity.
  The experiment was intended to prove two things: (1) the
  localization in the cere-bellar cortex; (2) the practicability of
  the cooling method in research into brain function in living
  human beings. The experiment fulfilled my expectations
  completely. For the cooling process I used ethyl chloride, the
  fluid often used in surgery to anaesthetize parts of the skin
  when small operations are to be carried out here. I froze the
  skin over the right side of the cerebellum and the effect of this
  was immediately visible. The right arm deviated immediately to
  the right and, for the duration of the cooling period, there was
  no pointing reaction to the left when I produced a nystagmus to
  the right in the subject. I had, therefore, hit the exact
  position of the tonus centre for the right-shoulder joint to the
  left. The momentary paralysis in the patient showed itself by the
  deviation of the shoulder joint in the right arm to the right
  during pointing and in the non-appearance of the pointing
  reaction to the left. As soon as I had proved this and, of
  course, also the normal pointing action and reactions in all
  other extremities and joints, I stopped the experiment. Two
  minutes later the right arm was pointing normally and the
  reaction to the left appeared. The patient made no complaint at
  all about the experiment. I repeated it on the same subject
  approximately twelve times, always with the same result. It was
  also carried out on a patient in Professor Voss's Clinic in
  Frankfurt, where Dr. Hirsch, who was at that time an assistant in
  the Otological Clinic, used it repeatedly and always with the
  same success. I also used it successfully on a patient in the
  Passow Clinic in Berlin in the presence of Professor Beyer and
  Professor Lewandowsky. During my present stay in Denmark
  Professor Schmiegelow told me that it had several times been used
  with success on one of his patients. One can, therefore, say with
  confidence (1) that localization in this spot is correct, and (2)
  that the experiment can be used on a large scale without any
  danger to the patient. During the present war, and afterwards,
  there will be numerous opportunities of using the experiment, for
  the instances of head injuries arecountless, in which, after
  healing of the wounds, the dura mater will be covered with only a
  thin layer of skin. I am convinced that people with such wounds
  will be quite ready to co-operate in a safe and painless
  experiment in the interests of humanity as a whole.</p>
