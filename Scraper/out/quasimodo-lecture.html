  <h2>The Poet and the Politician</h2>

  <p>&quot;The night is long that never finds
  the day&quot;. These are Shakespeare's words in Macbeth, and they
  help us to define the poet's condition. At first, the reader
  appears to the poet in his solitude as an image with the face and
  the gestures of a childhood friend, perhaps of that more
  sensitive friend who is experienced in solitary readings but a
  bit diffident in evaluating a presumed representation, or
  misrepresentation, of the world. This representation is attempted
  with rigorous poetic measures extraneous to science and with
  words whose sounds are predetermined.<br>
  <br>
  An exact poetic duplication of a man is for the poet a negation
  of the earth, an impossibility of being, even though his greatest
  desire is to speak to many men, to unite with them by means of
  harmonious verses about the truths of the mind or of things.
  Innocence is sometimes an acute quality which permits the
  greatest representation of the sensible. And the innocence of the
  poet's friend, who requires, dialectically, that the first poetic
  rhythms have a logical form, will remain a fixed point of
  reference, a focus which will enable the poet to construct half
  of a parabola. The poet's other readers are the ancient poets,
  who look upon the freshly written pages from an incorruptible
  distance. Their poetic forms are permanent, and it is difficult
  to create new forms which can approach them.<br>
  <br>
  The writer of stories or of novels settles on men and imitates
  them; he exhausts the possibilities of his characters. The poet
  is alone with infinite objects in his own obscure sphere and does
  not know whether he should be indifferent or hopeful. Later that
  single face will multiply; those gestures will become approving
  or disapproving opinions. This happens at the publication of the
  first poems. As the poet has expected, the alarms now are
  sounded, for - and it must be said again - the birth of a poet is
  always a threat to the existing cultural order, because he
  attempts to break through the circle of literary castes to reach
  the center.<br>
  <br>
  He has a strange public now, with whom he begins to have silent
  and hostile rapport: critics, provincial professors, men of
  letters. In the poet's youth, the majority of these persons
  destroy his metaphysics, correct his images. They are abstract
  judges who revise &quot;mistaken&quot; poems according to an
  indifferent, poetic standard.<br>
  <br>
  Poetry is also the physical self of the poet, and it is
  impossible to separate the poet from his poetry. However, I shall
  not indulge in autobiography by speaking of my own country,
  which, as everyone knows, has been filled in every century with
  Giovanni Della Casas, that is, with men of letters of metrical
  neatness and fully developed dexterity. These high priests of
  tradition have clairvoyance and imagination. Moreover, they are
  obsessed with allegories of the credible destruction of the
  world. They do not tolerate chronicles but only ideal figures and
  attitudes. For them the history of poetry is a gallery of ghosts.
  Even a polemic has some justification if one considers that my
  own first poetic experiments began during a dictatorship and mark
  the origin of the Hermetic movement.<br>
  <br>
  From my first book, published in 1930, to the second and the
  third and the fourth (a translation of Greek lyrics published in
  1940), I succeeded in seeing only a stratified public of humble
  or ambitious readers through the political haze and the academic
  aversion to harsh poetry that departed from the standard
  classical composition. The <i>Lirici Greci</i> (1940) [Greek
  Lyrics] entered fresh and new into the literary generation of the
  time; and they initiated a truer reading of the classics
  throughout Europe. I knew that young men quoted verses from my
  lyrics in their love letters; others were written on the walls of
  jails by political prisoners. What a time to be writing poetry!
  We wrote verses that condemned us, with no hope of pardon, to the
  most bitter solitude. Were such verses categories of the soul -
  great truths? Traditional European poetry, as yet unrestricted,
  was unaware of our presence: the Latin province, under the aegis
  of its Caesars, fostered bloodshed, not lessons in
  humanism.<br>
  <br>
  My readers at that time were still men of letters; but there had
  to be other people waiting to read my poems. Students,
  white-collar workers, labourers? Had I sought only an abstract
  verisimilitude in my poetry? Or was I being overly presumptuous?
  On the contrary, I was an example of how solitude is broken.
  Solitude, Shakespeare's &quot;long night&quot;, ill-borne by the
  politician - who wanted a poet such as Tyrtaeus during the
  African or Russian campaigns - became clearly poetic; taken to be
  a continuation of European decadence, it was rather the rough
  draft for neo-humanism. War, I have always said, forces men to
  change their standards, regardless of whether their country has
  won or lost. Poetics and philosophies disintegrate &quot;when the
  trees fall and the walls collapse &quot;. At the point when
  continuity was interrupted by the first nuclear explosion, it
  would have been too easy to recover the formal sediment which
  linked us with an age of poetic decorum, of a preoccupation with
  poetic sounds. After the turbulence of death, moral principles
  and even religious proofs are called into question. Men of
  letters who cling to the private successes of their petty
  aesthetics shut themselves off from poetry's restless presence.
  From the night, his solitude, the poet finds day and starts a
  diary that is lethal to the inert. The dark landscape yields a
  dialogue. The politician and the mediocre poets with their armour
  of symbols and mystic purities pretend to ignore the real poet.
  It is a story which repeats itself like the cock's crow; indeed,
  like the cock's third crow.<br>
  <br>
  The poet is a nonconformist and does not penetrate the shell of
  the false literary civilization, which is full of defensive
  turrets as in the time of the Communes. He may seem to destroy
  his forms, while instead he actually continues them. He passes
  from lyric to epic poetry in order to speak about the world and
  the torment in the world through man, rationally and emotionally.
  The poet then becomes a danger. The politician judges cultural
  freedom with suspicion, and by means of conformist criticism
  tries to render the very concept of poetry immobile. He sees the
  creative act as being both extratemporal and ineffectual within
  society, as if the poet, instead of being a man, were a mere
  abstraction.<br>
  <br>
  The poet is the sum total of the diverse &quot;experiences&quot;
  of the man of his times. His language is no longer that of the
  avant-garde, but is rather concrete in the classical sense. Eliot
  has pointed out that the language of Dante is &quot;the
  perfection of a common language ... nevertheless the 'simple
  style' of which Dante is the greatest master, is a very
  difficult style&quot;. The poet's language must be given its
  proper emphasis. It is neither the language of the Parnassians,
  nor that of the linguistic revolutionaries, particularly in
  countries where contamination by dialects only produces
  additional doubts and literary hieroglyphs. Indeed, philologists
  will never revive a written language. This is a right which
  belongs exclusively to the poet. His language is difficult not
  because of philological reasons or spiritual obscurity, but
  because of its content. Poets can be translated; men of letters
  cannot, because they use intellectual skills to copy other poets'
  techniques and support Symbolism or Decadence for their very lack
  of content, for their derivative thought, for the truths on which
  they have been theoretically nourished when they are found to
  resemble Goethe or the great nineteenth-century French poets. A
  poet clings to his own tradition and avoids internationalism. Men
  of letters think of Europe or even of the whole world in the
  light of a poetics that isolates itself, as if poetry were an
  identical &quot;object&quot; all over the world. Then, with this
  understanding of poetics, formalistic men of letters may prefer
  certain kinds of content and violently reject others. But the
  problem on either side of the barricade is always content. Thus,
  the poet's word is beginning to strike forcefully upon the hearts
  of all men, while absolute men of letters think that they alone
  live in the real world. According to them, the poet is confined
  to the provinces with his mouth broken on his own syllabic
  trapeze. The politician takes advantage of the men of letters who
  do not assume a contemporary spiritual position, but rather one
  that has been outdated by at least two generations. Out of
  cultural unity he makes a game of sophisticated, turbulent
  decomposition wherein the religious forces can still press for
  the enslavement of man's intelligence.<br>
  <br>
  Religious poetry, civic poetry, lyric or dramatic poetry are all
  categories of man's expression which are valid only if the
  endorsement of formal content is valid. It is a mistake to
  believe that a spiritual conquest, a particular emotional
  situation (a religious state) of the individual, can become
  &quot;society&quot; by extension. Pious abnegation, the
  renunciation of man by man, is nothing but a formula for death.
  The truly creative spirit always falls into the claws of wolves.
  The poet's spoken discourse often depends on a mystique, on the
  spiritual freedom that finds itself enslaved on earth. He
  terrifies his interlocutor (his shadow, an object to be
  disciplined) with images of physical decomposition, with
  complacent analyses of the horrid. The poet does not fear death,
  not because he believes in the fantasy of heroes, but because
  death constantly visits his thoughts and is thus an image of a
  serene dialogue. In opposition to this detachment, he finds an
  image of man which contains within itself man's dreams, man's
  illness, man's redemption from the misery of poverty - poverty
  which can no longer be for him a sign of the acceptance of
  life.<br>
  <br>
  In order to assess the extent of the politician's power - and
  here religious power is also included - one need only recall the
  silence which lasted for a millennium in the fields of poetry and
  the arts after the close of the classical epoch, or recall the
  great paintings of the fifteenth century, a period in which the
  Church commissioned the work and dictated its content.<br>
  <br>
  Formalistic criticism attempts to strike at the concept of art by
  focusing its attack on forms. It expresses reservations on the
  consistency of content in order to infringe upon artistic
  autonomy in an absolute sense. In fact, poetry will not accept
  the politician's &quot;missionary&quot; attempts, nor any other
  kind of critical interference, from whatever philosophy it may
  originate. The poet does not deviate from his moral or aesthetic
  path; hence his double solitude in the face of both the world and
  the literary militias.<br>
  <br>
  But is there a contemporary aesthetics? And what philosophy
  offers truly significant suggestions? An existentialist or
  Marxist poetry has not yet appeared on the literary horizon; the
  philosophical dialogue or the chorus of new generations
  presupposes a crisis, even presupposes crises in man. The
  politician uses this confusion to give an air of illusory
  stability to fragmented poetry.<br>
  <br>
  The antagonism between the poet and the politician has generally
  been evident in all cultures. Today the two blocs that govern the
  world are fashioning contradictory concepts of freedom, even
  though it is clear that for the politician there is but one sort
  of freedom, which leads in a single direction. It is difficult to
  break down this barrier which has stained the history of
  civilization with blood. There always exist at least two ways of
  regarding cultural freedom: the freedom found in those countries
  where a profound social revolution has occurred (the French
  Revolution, for example, or the October Revolution); and that
  found in other countries, which resist stubbornly before
  undergoing any change in their world view.<br>
  <br>
  Can poet and politician cooperate? Perhaps they could in
  societies that are not yet fully developed, but never with
  complete freedom for both. In the contemporary world the
  politician may well take a variety of stands, but an accord
  between poet and politician will never be possible, because the
  one is concerned with the internal order of man, the other with
  the ordering of men. A quest for the internal order of man could,
  in a given epoch, coincide with the ordering and construction of
  a new society.<br>
  <br>
  Religious power, which, as I have already said, frequently
  identifies itself with political power, has always been a
  protagonist of this bitter struggle, even when it seemingly was
  neutral. The reasons for which the poet, as moral barometer of
  his own people, becomes a danger to the politician are always
  those which Giovanni Villani cites in his <i>Croniche
  Fiorentine</i>. He says here that, for the benefit of his
  contemporaries, Dante &quot;as a poet thoroughly enjoyed ranting
  and raving in his <i>Commedia</i> perhaps more than was proper;
  but possibly his exile was to blame&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Unlike Villani, Dante does not write chronicles. To the excellent
  &quot;hermetic&quot; poetry of the <i>dolce stil nuovo</i> Dante
  later adds, without ever betraying his own moral integrity, the
  violence of human and political invective, not dictated by his
  aversions, but by his internal standard of justice which is
  religious in the universal sense. The aesthetes have gingerly
  placed these verses, which burn in eternity, into the limbo of
  <i>non-poesia</i>. Verses like &quot;Trivia ride tra le ninfe
  eterne&quot; (&quot;Trivia smiles among the eternal nymphs&quot;)
  have always seemed only if he remains the continuer of
  pseudo-existential enlightenment, the decorator of placid human
  sentiments, or if he does not penetrate too profoundly into the
  dialectic of his time, whether from political fear or simple
  inertia. For example, Angelo Poliziano in the fifteenth century
  showed his artistic freedom in one of the <i>Stanze per lagiostra
  di Ginliano de' Medici</i>[Stanzas Written for the Medici Joust],
  where he cautiously speaks of a confused nymph who goes to mass
  with secular ladies. But Leonardo da Vinci, a writer of a
  different kind, was not free. Here liberty assumes its true
  meaning; it is nothing but a permission granted by the political
  powers which allows the poet to enter his society unarmed. Not
  even Ariosto and Tasso were free, nor the Abbot Parini, nor
  Alfieri, nor Foscolo: the rhetoric of these persecuted men places
  them in time among the propagators of the voice of man - a voice
  that seems to cry out in the wilderness and instead corrodes
  society's untruths.<br>
  <br>
  But is the politician free in his turn? No. In fact, the castes
  that besiege him determine a society's fate and act even upon the
  dictator. Around these two protagonists of history, both
  adversaries and neither of them free - and by poets we mean all
  important writers of a given epoch - passions are stirred and
  conflict ensues. And there is peace only in time of war or
  revolution - revolution the bearer of order, and war the bearer
  of confusion.<br>
  <br>
  The last war was a clash of systems, of politics, of civil
  orders, nation by nation. Its violence twisted even the smallest
  liberties. A sense of life reappeared in the very resistance to
  the inimical but familiar invader, a resistance by culture and by
  folk humanism which, in Vergil's words, &quot;raised its head in
  the bitter fields &quot; against the powerful.<br>
  <br>
  In every country a cultural tradition remains detached from this
  military movement. This tradition is not merely provisional,
  although it is considered as such by the conservative bankers who
  finance construction on civilization's &quot;real estate&quot;. I
  insist upon saying not merely provisional, because the nucleus of
  contemporary culture (including the philosophy of existence) is
  oriented not toward the disasters of the soul and the spirit, but
  toward an attempt to repair man's broken bones. Neither fear, nor
  absence, nor indifference, nor impotence will ever allow the poet
  to communicate a non-metaphysical fate to others.<br>
  <br>
  The poet can say that man begins today; the politician can say,
  and indeed does say, that man has been and always may be caught
  in the trap of his moral baseness, a baseness which is not
  congenital but rather implanted by a slow secular
  infection.<br>
  <br>
  This truth, concealed among the unattainable attitudes of
  political wisdom, suggests as a first conclusion that the poet
  can speak only in periods of anarchy. The Resistance is a moral
  certainty, not a poetic one. The true poet never uses words in
  order to punish someone. His judgment belongs to a creative
  order; it is not formulated as a prophetic scripture.<br>
  <br>
  Europeans know the importance of the Resistance; it has been the
  shining example of the modern conscience. The enemy of the
  Resistance, for all his shouting, is today only a shadow, without
  much strength. His voice is more impersonal than his proposals.
  The popular sensibility is not deceived about the condition of
  the poet or about that of his adversary. When the antagonism is
  increased, poetry replaces the subordinate thought of the
  politician who makes poetry into an idea that can be exploited or
  extinguished.<br>
  <br>
  The Resistance is the perfect image of the conflict between the
  present and the past. The language of blood is not only a drama
  in the physical sense; it is the definitive expression of a
  continuous trial on man's moral &quot;technology&quot;. Europe
  was born of the Resistance and of the admiration for the
  indeterminate figures who belong to that order which the war
  sought to establish. These figures have now been torn out by the
  roots. Death has an autonomous sleep, and any intervention to
  solicit this sleep either by logic or by skill of political
  intelligence is inhuman. Poetry's loyalty lies beyond any
  consideration of injustice or the intentions of death. The
  politician wants men to know how to die courageously; the poet
  wants men to live courageously.<br>
  <br>
  While the poet is conscious of the politician's power, the
  politician notices the poet only when his voice reaches deep into
  the various social strata; that is, when lyrical or epic content
  is revealed as well as poetic form. At this moment, a
  subterranean struggle begins between the politician and the poet.
  In history the names of exiled poets are treated like human dice,
  while the politician claims to uphold culture but, in fact, tries
  only to reduce its power. His only purpose, as always, is to
  deprive man of three or four fundamental liberties, so that in
  his eternal cycle man continually retrieves what has been taken
  from him.<br>
  <br>
  In our time the politician's defence against culture and thus
  against the poet operates both surreptitiously and openly in
  manifold ways. His easiest defence is the degradation of the
  concept of culture. Mechanical and scientific means, radio and
  television, help to break the unity of the arts, to favour a
  poetics that will not even disturb shadows. His most favoured
  poetics is always that which allies itself with the memory of
  Arcadia for the artistic disparagement of its own epoch. This is
  the meaning of Aeschylus' verse, &quot;I maintain that the dead
  kill the living&quot;, which I used as the epigraph to my latest
  work, <i>La terra impareggiabile</i>. In this book man is
  compared to the earth. If it is a sin to speak of man's
  intelligence, we can also say that religious powers - and the
  adjective &quot;lay&quot; used to qualify intelligence is
  intended to indicate not an accidental quality but rather an
  intrinsic value - go beyond their bounds when they use their
  might to suppress the humble rather than to deal with the
  internal fire of the conscience.<br>
  <br>
  The corruption of the concept of culture offered to the masses,
  who are led by it to believe that they are catching a glimpse of
  the paradise of knowledge, is not a modern political device; but
  the techniques used for this multiple dissipation of man's
  meditative interests are new and effective. Optimism has become a
  tangible item; it is nothing but a memory game. Myths and stories
  (anxiety about supernatural events, let us say) not only sink to
  the level of murder mysteries, but even undergo visible
  metamorphoses in the cinema or in the epic tales of criminals and
  pioneers. Any choice between the poet and the politician is
  precluded. Elegant urbanity, which sometimes pretends to be
  indifferent, ironically confines culture to the darker corners of
  its history, affirming that the scene of strife has been
  dramatized, that man and his suffering always have been and
  always will be in their habitual confines, yesterday as well as
  today and tomorrow. Surely. The poet knows that drama is still
  possible today - a provocative kind of drama. He knows that the
  adulators of culture are also its pyromaniacs. The collage
  composed of writers in any regime corrupts the literary groups in
  the center as easily as on the periphery. The former groups
  pretend to immortality with a tawdry calligraphy of the soul
  which they decorate with the colours of their impossible mental
  lives. In certain moments of history, culture secretly unites its
  forces against the politician. But it is a temporary unity which
  serves as a battering ram to beat down the doors of dictatorship.
  This force establishes itself under every dictatorship when it
  coincides with a search for man's fundamental liberties. When the
  dictator has been defeated, this unity disappears and factions
  again spring up. The poet is alone. Around him rises a wall of
  hate built with the stones thrown by literary mercenaries. The
  poet contemplates the world from the top of this wall, without
  ever descending either into the public places, like the wandering
  bards, or into the sophisticated circles, like the men of
  letters. From this very ivory tower, so dear to the corruptors of
  the romantic soul, he enters into the people's midst, not only
  into their emotional needs, but even into their jealous political
  thoughts.<br>
  <br>
  This is not mere rhetoric. The story of the poet subjected to the
  silent siege is found in all countries and all chronicles of
  mankind. But the men of letters who are on the side of the
  politician do not represent the whole nation; they serve only - I
  say &quot;serve &quot; - to delay by a few moments the voice of
  the poet in the world. In time, according to Leonardo da Vinci,
  &quot;every wrong is made right&quot;.</p>
