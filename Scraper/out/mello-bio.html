  <h1>Craig C. Mello - Biographical</h1>
 <p><img src="mello.jpg" class="bio-img">I recall a sunny September morning in Virginia. I remember the sound of
    the school bus taking away the older kids, including my two siblings Jean
    and Frank. My mother, no doubt, was busy with my baby brother Roger. I was
    playing in the creek as I often did, turning over stones, looking for small animals.
    I remember a mourning dove cooing on the telephone wire, and the
    way the sunlight felt on my red sweatshirt and my rolled up hand-me-down
    blue jeans. I remember a sense of contentment with being alive, a feeling
    that infuses many of my early memories in a general, fuzzy, unfocused way.
    However, this memory is different. It was etched with stunning clarity in my
    mind by adrenalin and other sharper emotions.</p>

    <p>That morning, a box turtle
    decided to choose this peaceful moment to make its way across the street adjacent
    to the field where I was playing. My attention was drawn to the road by
    the sound of an oncoming car, and I remember my excitement with seeing
    the turtle changing to shock as I watched the car swerve with clear intention
    toward the turtle. I remember a smirking teenage boy driving off, leaving
    the turtle, his shell broken, still struggling to move to the edge of the road.
    The turtle died before my eyes, etching this scene deeply into my mind. Even
    though this might seem a sad memory, the fact is that I'm grateful in a sense.

    That morning of my youth seems timeless now. I can see in my heart that the
    child playing in the creek is me, and that I haven't changed much really in
    the intervening years. I'm still turning over stones, hoping to find something
    new. I'm still struggling to understand what drives us humans to cruelty and
    hoping that knowledge of our place in the world can help us to achieve a
  higher purpose.</p>


    <p>I was born in New Haven, Connecticut on October 18<sup>th</sup> 1960, the third
    child of a paleontologist father and artist mother (James and Sally Mello). In
    1962 my father completed his doctorate in paleontology at Yale University,
    and my family moved to Falls Church in northern Virginia so that he could
    take a position with the US Geological Survey (USGS) in Washington, DC.
    My parents met while attending Brown University and were the first children
    in their respective families to attend college. My grandparents on both sides
    withdrew from school as teenagers to work for their families. My paternal
    grandfather, Frank Mello, was of Azorean descent although he was born in
    Warren, Rhode Island. He was an outstanding athlete nicknamed "Bullet"
    Mello for his speed. He played semi-pro baseball and football. He worked a
    variety of jobs including delivering grain for many years and operating trucks
    for the town. My grandmother, Elena (Primiano) Mello, was of Italian descent, but was also born in Warren, Rhode Island, she worked in local textile
    factories. They both worked for their families for close to ten years before
    they were able to marry and start their own household at the age of 24. On
    my mother's side I have English and Scottish roots dating to colonial times
    and including a distant link to Lyman Hall who signed the declaration of
    independence. My maternal grandfather, William Cameron, ran a very successful
    plumbing business in Middletown, CT. My grandmother, Ida (Hall)
    Cameron, was a home- maker. I'm proud of my melting pot origins, and of
    the accomplishments of my grandparents. They worked hard, and sacrificed
    so that their children could go to college. They were wonderful, creative,
    thoughtful and extremely loving people who gave me a refreshing perspective
    on what's important in life.</p>
    
    <p>After a brief stay in Falls Church, we moved to Fairfax, VA, when my father
    switched from the USGS to a position as assistant director at the Smithsonian
    Museum of Natural History. Among my fondest early memories are field trips
    with my father and the whole family to Colorado and Wyoming and more
    frequent trips to the Blue Ridge mountains in Virginia. I remember searching
    for fossils, hiking, exploring, and wonderful family discussions around
    the campfire.</p>
    
    <p>My family had a very strong tradition of discussions around the dinner
    table. This experience was extremely important to me. I learned to argue,
    to listen, and to admit it (sometimes grudgingly) when I was wrong about
    something. These were often lively discussions, and my parents did a great
    job of allowing each of us to be heard. At a time when I was not performing
    so well in school, these daily discussions helped to build my confidence and
    self esteem. I struggled during the first few years of grade school. I started
    first grade at the age of 5 in a local private school because I was too young to
    enter first grade in the public system. I don't know if I was a slow learner, or
    just not interested, but I did not do well in school until the 7<sup>th</sup> grade. In second
    grade, I remember faking that I could read and the embarrassment of
    being called on in class. I much preferred playing outdoors, in the woods and
    creeks, to time spent in the classroom. Meanwhile, my older siblings were
    model students, raising the teacher's expectations for me. If not for the family
    discussions, where I was respected and could hold my own in arguments, I
    might have been discouraged with my academic prospects.</p>
    
    <p>During these early years, I remember having no doubt that I would be a
    scientist when I grew up. I was amazed that so few adults (including my teachers)
    understood basic concepts such as deep (geologic) time, the vastness of
    the universe, and the common evolutionary origins of life. In first grade, the
    private school I attended had a Bible session each day, and I remember being
    shocked that the teacher presented the story of Noah and his ark as fact.
    Similarly, I was exposed to religious instruction in Sunday school. My father
    had agreed to raise us as Catholics. My mother was a Methodist by birth but
    did not practice her religion and did not attend Catholic services with the
    family. I remember learning the argument of intelligent design in Sunday
    school, as a counterargument to evolution. Given my own exposure to my
    dad's museum, and our family discussions about evolution and the history of
    the earth, these exposures to religious dogma actually had the effect of intensifying
    my interest in science as a way of knowing about the world.</p>

Its mysteries define the human condition; to exist without knowing why.</span></div>
   
    <p>By the time I was in middle school, I had decided to reject religious dogma
    altogether. The 'absolute knowledge' offered, was in my view, inadequate to
    explain the world around me. Furthermore, it seemed wrong to claim knowledge
    based on ones culture or upbringing. I saw the leap of faith involved in
    religion as smothering dialogue, closing the door on non-believers and walling
    them out of one's society. In contrast, the scientific method with its focus
    on asking questions and admitting no absolutes, was and continues to be
    refreshing to me. Science is grounded on, and values, dialogue. It is a human
    enterprise that breaks down walls and challenges its practitioners to admit
    ignorance and to question all ideas. However, we must all arrive at and defend
    our moral choices of right and wrong. Science can't touch these issues
    and shouldn't try. I believe that there is no more spiritual and worthwhile
    undertaking than that of trying to understand the world around us, and our
    place in it. The world is a far more remarkable place than we can imagine. Its
    mysteries define the human condition; to exist without knowing why.
    My first exposure to academic science came in 7<sup>th</sup> grade, and during that
    year I can remember for the first time applying myself to my studies. I became
    an avid reader of science fiction, an amateur astronomer, and a serious
    student. I remember organizing my desk at home and doing homework, with
    music blasting, for at least a couple hours every night. I attended Fairfax
    High School, where I took all of the science courses offered except advanced
    physics. My earth science, chemistry and biology teachers were excellent. My
    biology teacher, Randy Scott, was also my wrestling, football and track coach.
    He was a wonderful man, who had a large role in fostering my interest in
    biology. I reconnected with him and was able to thank him after the news of
    October, but tragically, he has since lost his battle with cancer.</p>
    
    <p>In 1978, I learned about molecular biology from a newspaper article in
    the Washington Post. The article described the cloning of the human insulin
    gene in bacteria, and described how the bacterial cells were able to read the
    human genetic code and produce functional human insulin. I found this
    concept incredible and extremely exciting. Incredible because the bacterial
    cells were able to speak the same language as the human cells, reading out
    the genetic code to make functional, life-giving, human protein for diabetic
    patients. Prior to that time, diabetics used animal insulin. I found this extremely
    exciting because I could see the potential for understanding disease
    at the genetic level and for treating it with molecular medicines, like insulin,
    and with gene therapy.</p>
    
    <p>At Brown University, I pursued biochemistry and molecular biology as my
    major and had inspiring teachers, including Frank Rothman, Ken Miller,
    Susan Gerbi and Nelson Fausto. Brown provided a wonderful environment
    for learning, and had the added benefit of being close to my grandparents'
    home in Warren, RI, and to my small sailboat on the Warren River, a tributary
    to the upper Narragansett Bay. Sailing continues to be an important part
    of my life. It gives me a sense of place that settles and refreshes my mind. I
    sail in a wide range of conditions, for hours and hours (if possible). I don't
    prefer to race, but rather to explore. I gradually trained my parents and
    grandparents to accept the fact that if the wind died, then I might not get
    back until long after dark. Eventually, they even agreed to my taking camping
    gear and doing overnight trips ranging along the coast from Martha's
    Vineyard to half way up Long Island Sound.</p>
    
    <p>After Brown, I went to Colorado for graduate school, where I enjoyed the
    mountains again and a really fantastic and inspiring course in molecular, cellular
    and developmental biology. The course consisted of a small group of 15
    or so students with outstanding instructors, including Drs. Dick McIntosh,
    Mike Yarus, Larry Gold, Bill Wood and others. At Boulder, I was introduced
    to <i>C. elegans</i> in the laboratory of Dr. David Hirsh. David's lab was fantastic 
    filled with people who would prove to be really important in my future training.
    These included Dan Stinchcomb, who introduced me to the practice of
    molecular biology; Mike Krause, Jim Kramer, and Ken Kemphues, with whom
    I collaborated; and Jim Priess with whom I did my postdoctoral work.
    When I joined David's lab in 1982, no one had succeeded in introducing
    DNA back into <i>C. elegans</i> (a method referred to as "DNA transformation").
    Work in yeast had identified functional DNA elements that direct the replication
    and partitioning of chromosomes (replication origins and centromeres,
    respectively). Working with Dan Stinchcomb, my project was to identify such
    elements from the worm, with the goals of 1) understanding these essential
    functional chromosomal elements, and 2) of using them to produce stable
    artificial chromosomes for worm molecular genetics. During my first year in
    Boulder, David Hirsh decided to take a position in industry, and so I chose
    to move to Harvard University where I could continue my research with Dan
    Stinchcomb, who was starting up an independent lab there.</p>
    
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed Harvard! Dan set up his lab at the Biolabs in
    Cambridge next to Victor Ambros, another brand new, junior faculty member
    at Harward working on <i>C. elegans</i>. Dan and Victor integrated their labs to
    make a single "wormlab", and both served as advisors to me during my studies.
    I loved my project and worked long hours in the lab, never going home until
    I had a gel running or something incubating, so as to use the overnight
    hours. I took advantage of opportunities to attend lectures on a wide range of
    subjects. I obtained permission to use the large refracting telescope located
    atop the Science center, which was, surprisingly, available for individual use. I
    got to meet and teach with Stephen J. Gould, who's essays on natural history
    and the philosophy of science had inspired me over the years. Gould's, "<i>The
    Freezing of Noah</i>," is one of my favorites as it captures the essence of good science;
    admitting when your theory is wrong and developing a new theory.    </p>
    <p>I learned an important lesson in graduate school; that it's not enough to
      be persistent and to work hard, it's also important to attack the question
      you wish to address from every conceivable angle. By focusing on identifying
      worm centromere activities using yeast as a model system, I ended up
      learning about the yeast centromere, not the worm centromere. While this
      project was fulfilling and interesting to me, it was flawed. To study the yeast
      centromere, I should have been working with the yeast sequences directly.
      To study the worm centromere, I should have been injecting DNA into the
      worm. Only after I began to experiment directly with the worm did my project
      really take off.</p>
    <p>Technology is what drives science, and yet, developing new technology is
    often a thankless task. Getting something to work that has never been done
    before can be exceedingly frustrating because you may never know how close
    you were to success, and failures quite often teach you nothing. Partly because
    of this, those working on technology development often tend to band
    together and share ideas more than would otherwise be common among
    scientists. This was certainly the case for Andrew Fire and me. We were both
    working on developing techniques for DNA transformation in worms. Andy
    had some early success and developed a number of clever methods. I followed
    up with some improvements. And together we made DNA transformation
    a routine procedure for the worm. In the course of these studies, we became
    frequent correspondents, spending hours on the phone (before email
    was invented). We developed the mutual trust and respect that ultimately led
    to our collaboration on RNAi.</p>
    
    <p>After graduating from Harvard, I joined the lab of Jim Priess at the Fred
    Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle Washington. Jim is one of
    those rare scientists who has "a feeling for the organism" as E.F. Keller put
    it when describing <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/index.html">Barbara McClintock</a>. Jim put me in touch with my own
    feelings for the worm. Through Jim, I was able to learn genetics, without
    which our later work on RNAi would have remained entirely descriptive. In
    Jim's lab, we identified genes that act as regulators of early development in <i>C.
    elegans</i>. It turns out that some of these genes are connected to RNAi-related
    mechanisms in ways that we are still trying to understand.</p>
    
    <p>In Seattle, my daughter Melissa was born in 1992. I wish she could remember
    those first two years of her life in Seattle. We hiked and biked together
    regularly and had a wonderful time. However, her mother and I struggled to
    find enough time together as a family. Melissa's mother, Margaret Hunter,
    worked mornings and weekends as a chef at a Café in Seattle. Because my
    schedule often demanded late nights and weekends, we handed Melissa off
    from one to the other and rarely had enough time to be together as a family.
    Shortly after we moved to Massachusetts in 1994, we separated and divorced.
    Fortunately, we remain respectful and friendly to this day. I focused on my
    work and continued to have Melissa with me half of each week.</p>
    
    <p>Shortly before I started my lab in 1994, I learned from Ken Kemphues and
    his student Sue Guo about an "antisense" RNAinjection technique that surprisingly
    well in <i>C. elegans</i> silenced target genes. I began using this method to
    study the genes we had identified during my genetic studies with Jim Priess.
    The genome-sequencing project for <i>C. elegans</i> had begun in earnest and had
    revealed dozens of genes in the sequence data base that were similar in DNA
    sequence to those that I had discovered in Jim's lab. These related genes
    (or homologs, as we call them) could have important developmental functions, and so I began using the RNA injection method described by Guo and
    Kemphues to silence them in order to identify those functions.</p>
         <div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 10px; background-color: #fff; color: #024664; font-size: 22px; width: 250px; float: right;"><img style="padding-right: 10px; float: left; vertical-align: top;" src="http://www.nobelprize.org/images/front/citation_teaser_front.gif">This was truly amazing and prompted further studies&nbsp;...</div>
    
    <p> At that time, RNA injection was performed according to the same procedure
    that Andy and I had developed for DNA injection. A fine, sharp, glass
    needle was inserted with care through the cuticle of the worm and positioned
    inside the large shared cytoplasm of a gonad that contains hundreds of germline
    nuclei. After positioning the needle and injecting, the procedure was
    then carried out a second time on the other gonad arm, two injections per
    worm. The power of this gene-silencing approach accelerated our studies
    and we began to make rapid progress in understanding the developmental
    mechanisms that specify cell fate in the early embryo. However, we also became
    interested in the silencing phenomenon itself. The first observation
    that truly galvanized my interest occurred when, having injected RNA targeting
      <i>apx-1</i>, a gene essential for embryogenesis, I observed by chance that some
    embryos hatched and matured to adulthood only to produce 100% <i>apx-1</i>    dead embryos. The silencing phenomenon had skipped a generation and
    had been passed on <i>via</i> the germline to the next generation! This was truly
    amazing and prompted further studies that demonstrated the transmission
  of silencing for multiple generations <i>via</i> both the sperm and the egg.    </p>
    <p>The first graduate student to work on RNAi in my lab, Sam Driver, discovered,
      in part by accident while learning to inject, that the RNA need
      not be delivered directly to the germline. Injection anywhere in the body
      was sufficient to induce interference that spread into the germline and was
      transmitted to progeny. These findings, along with the inheritance properties,
      and the lack of strand specificity (first noted by Guo and Kemphues),
      prompted us to recognize the silencing phenomenon as an active response
      in the organism to the RNA. To distinguish this mechanism from the earlier
      "antisense" methodology, we decided to give it the simple name RNAi (for
      RNA interference). We envisioned a mechanism where either strand could
      template the production of the other strand and could somehow build up silencing
      RNA levels. The specificity of the silencing indicated that ultimately,
      after amplification, the antisense strand must unwind from its complement
      to find its target RNA and induce silencing.</p>
    <p>Throughout this period, Andy and I continued to correspond and collaborate.
    It was Andy's suggestion that dsRNA contaminating our preparations
    could be the actual trigger molecule underlying RNAi. At the time, I was still
    thinking of dsRNA as an amplification intermediate, rather than trigger. It
    was not until after Andy sent me purified double stranded RNA to test in my
    own hands that I became a believer in this molecule as a potent trigger for
    gene silencing. We now know that dsRNA is both a trigger and intermediate
    in RNAi. The concept of dsRNA as a trigger for sequence-specific gene silencing
    only makes sense if one recognizes that the organism is actively responding
    by unwinding the RNA strands both for amplification and to generate
    single strands capable of base pairing with targets. This concept of an active
    response in the animal prompted Hiroaki Tabara in my lab to undertake his
    exciting genetic studies that identified cellular gene products that mediate
    silencing. As discussed in my <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/mello-lecture.html">lecture</a>, dsRNA is not the only trigger for this
    silencing mechanism. However, importantly, dsRNA turned out to be a highly
    conserved trigger that rapidly led to the application of RNAi in diverse species
    including humans.</p>
    
    <p> 1998 was a truly outstanding year. In January of that year, Andy and I published
    our paper on RNAi. In August, I married Edit Kiss and became the
    stepfather of two wonderful kids, David and Sarah Apotheker. In the year
    2000 our daughter Victoria was born. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Victoria
    developed type-one diabetes in the fall of 2001. Suddenly, I had to learn how
    to inject into a human, my own daughter, for the first time. Ironically, human
    insulin, the same bacterially synthesized molecule that inspired me to pursue
    molecular biology, is now giving Victoria her very life. This experience has
    given me a new perspective on the importance of medical research. Edit,
    who is a wonderful nurse, is now taking care of Victoria, and serving as a diabetes
    counselor for newly diagnosed families.</p>
    
    <p>With RNAi and the completion of the genome sequences for humans and
    numerous other organisms, we now have unprecedented opportunities to
    develop new, life saving therapies and to advance the basic understanding of
    our biology. We humans have a potentially very bright future. The biological
    mechanisms at work inside our cells are truly ancient and remarkably stable,
    more stable even than the positions of continents and oceans on the face of
    the Earth. However, in my view, our thriving global economy has engendered
    serious problems. Climate change and other forces beyond our control could
    easily disrupt our economies causing widespread human suffering at unprecedented
    levels. We are fishing out oceans, depleting our topsoils, and exhausting
    our sources of fossil fuel and fresh water. Scientists and policy makers
    must begin to work together to foster the development of technologies
    that are sustainable and resilient. As humans, we must work with common
    purpose around the world to prepare for the challenges and opportunities
    ahead. I hope that I can further that cause.</p>
