  <h1>Nicholas Murray Butler - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="butler.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Nicholas
  Murray Butler</b> (April 2, 1862-December 7, 1947) was an
  educator and university president; an adviser to seven presidents
  and friend of statesmen in foreign nations; recipient of
  decorations from fifteen foreign governments and of honorary
  degrees from thirty-seven colleges and universities; a member of
  more than fifty learned societies and twenty clubs; the author of
  a small library of books, pamphlets, reports, and speeches; an
  international traveler who crossed the Atlantic at least a
  hundred times; a national leader of the Republican Party; an
  advocate of peace and the embodiment of the &laquo;international
  mind&raquo; that he frequently spoke about. He was called Nicholas
  Miraculous Butler by his good friend <a href=
  "../1906/index.html">Theodore Roosevelt</a>; the epithet was so
  perfect that, once uttered, it could not be forgotten.<br>
  <br>
  Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, this son of Henry L. Butler, a
  manufacturer, and Mary Murray Butler, daughter of Nicholas
  Murray, a clergyman and author, began his career with a brilliant
  record as a student. In 1882, at the age of twenty, he received
  his bachelor's degree, in 1883, a master's degree, in 1884, a
  doctorate - all from Columbia College; in 1885 he studied in
  Paris and in Berlin where he began a lifelong friendship with
  <a href="../1912/index.html">Elihu Root</a>, who was also
  destined to become a Nobel peace laureate. In the fall of 1885,
  he accepted an appointment on the staff of the Department of
  Philosophy at Columbia College, which in 1896 became Columbia
  University. And so began a professional association that was
  to last for sixty years.<br>
  <br>
  From the first, Butler distinguished himself as an educational
  administrator. Within four years he gave administrative form to
  his philosophical theory of pedagogy by establishing an institute
  which, later affiliated with Columbia, became known as Teachers
  College. He founded the <i>Educational Review</i> and edited
  it for thirty years, wrote reports on state and local educational
  systems, served as a member of the New Jersey Board of Education
  from 1887 to 1895, participated in the formation of the College
  Entrance Examination Board. He was named acting president of
  Columbia University in 1901 and president in 1902, retaining that
  position until retirement in October, 1945.<br>
  <br>
  Under his presidency, Columbia University made phenomenal growth.
  It became a major university. All graduate studies were
  enormously expanded; the scope of professional training was
  enlarged to include new schools such as those of journalism and
  dentistry; the student body was increased from 4,000 to 34,000
  and the faculty by a like ratio; the plant was enlarged by a
  construction program that averaged a new building each year, and
  the endowment kept pace; the professorial salaries were increased
  enough to attract many of the world's leading scholars to the
  teaching and research staff.<br>
  <br>
  Butler moved in the realm of politics as easily as he did in that
  of education. He was a delegate to the Republican convention for
  the first time in 1888 and for the last in 1936. Butler, Root,
  William Howard Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt
  constituted a powerful political quartet in the early years of
  the century. Breaking with the others in 1912, Roosevelt ran for
  the presidency as the candidate of the Progressive Party, which
  drew most of its strength from Republicans, against the nominees
  of the constituted party: Taft for the presidency and Butler for
  the vice-presidency. By splitting the national vote, they
  permitted the Democrat, <a href="../1919/index.html">Woodrow
  Wilson</a>, to win the election. In 1916 Butler failed in his
  attempt to secure the Republican presidential nomination for Root
  and in 1920 and 1928 failed to secure it for himself<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Butler sought to unite the world of education and that
  of politics in a struggle to achieve world peace through
  international cooperation. He was chairman of the Lake Mohonk
  Conferences on International Arbitration, which met periodically
  from 1907 to 1912, and was appointed president of the American
  branch of International Conciliation, an organization founded by
  another Nobel peace laureate, <a href=
  "../1909/index.html">d'Estournelles de Constant</a>. His
  association with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was a
  fruitful one of thirty-five years. Influential in persuading
  Andrew Carnegie to establish the Endowment in 1910
  with a gift of $ 10,000,000, he served as head of the Endowment's
  section on international education and communication, founded the
  European branch of the Endowment, with headquarters in Paris, and
  held the presidency of the parent Endowment from 1925 to
  1945.<br>
  <br>
  Butler married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1887 and
  by whom he had one daughter, died in 1903; he remarried in 1907.
  When Butler became almost totally blind in 1945 at the age of
  eighty-three, he resigned the demanding posts he still held. He
  died two years later.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940, Butler completed his autobiography with the publication
  of the second volume of <i>Across the Busy Years</i>. Both in
  size and in title it is peculiarly appropriate.</p>
