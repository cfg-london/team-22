  <h1>Ronald G.W. Norrish - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="norrish.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ronald George Wreyford Norrish</b>
  was born in Cambridge on November 9th, 1897. His father, a native
  of Crediton, Devonshire, came to Cambridge as a young Pharmacist
  to open one of the early shops of Boots, the Chemists, and
  remained there for the rest of his long life.<br>
  <br>
  After spending his early years at the local Board school, Norrish
  obtained a scholarship to the Perse Grammar School in 1910. He
  remembers with deep gratitude his early teachers, in particular
  Rouse, Turnbull and Hersch, who gave dedicated and individual
  help to promising young scholars. In 1915 he obtained an entrance
  scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in Natural Sciences,
  but left in 1916 with a commission in the Royal Field Artillery
  for service in France. He was made prisoner of war in March 1918
  and spent the rest of the war in Germany, first at Rastatt and
  later at Graudenz in Poland. Repatriated in 1919, he returned to
  Emmanuel
  College where he has remained ever since, first as a student
  and after 1925 as a Fellow. Norrish's early research was inspired
  by Eric Redeal (now Sir Eric Redeal) under whose lively
  supervision he first took up the study of Photochemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 he was made Demonstrator and in 1930, Humphrey Owen Jones
  Lecturer in Physical Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry at
  Cambridge and upon the death of the first Professor of Physical
  Chemistry, Dr. T.M. Lowry, was appointed to the Professorship in
  1937. He occupied the chair until 1965 when he retired as
  Emeritus Professor of Physical Chemistry in the University.<br>
  <br>
  Norrish has had the good fortune to work with many gifted
  students and with them has carried out a wide range of research
  in the fields of Photochemistry and Reaction Kinetics, including
  Combustion and Polymerisation. As the study of Chemical Kinetics
  developed, there was a fortunate integration in the various
  aspects of the study in which his school of work was engaged, as
  a result of which the importance of Photochemistry and
  Spectroscopy to Chemical Kinetics in general emerged. All this
  was sadly brought to a temporary halt in 1940. During the second
  world war, while still continuing to direct the Department of
  Physical Chemistry and to teach, Norrish was concerned with a
  good deal of research work in connection with various ministries
  and was able to collaborate with his colleagues on various
  government committees. It was after the war in 1945 when research
  was recommenced that work was started with the object of
  observing short lived transients in chemical reactions. In
  collaboration with his student, now Professor George Porter, this
  led to the development of Flash Photolysis and Kinetic
  Spectroscopy which has had considerable influence on the
  subsequent development of Photochemistry and Reaction Kinetics,
  and in the hands of workers in many parts of the world is
  continuing to develop as a powerful technique for the study of
  all aspects of chemical reaction.<br>
  <br>
  In 1926 Ronald Norrish married Annie Smith who was Lecturer in
  the Faculty of Education in the University of Wales in Cardiff. They have two
  daughters and four grandchildren. Much of their time has been
  spent in travel.<br>
  <br>
  Norrish has served on the Councils of the Chemical Society, the
  Faraday Society of which he became President in 1951-1955 and on
  the Council of the Royal Institute of Chemistry of which he was
  Vice President from 1957 to 1959. He delivered the Liversidge
  Lecture to the Chemical Society in 1958, the Faraday Memorial
  Lecture to the Chemical Society in 1965, and the Bakerian Lecture
  to the Royal Society in 1966. He was President of the British
  Association Section B (Chemistry) in 1961, and in the same year
  was made Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers. In
  1958 he received the honorary degree of D. de l'U. at the
  Sorbonne in Paris and also honorary degrees D. Sc. in Leeds and
  Sheffield in 1965, Liverpool and Lancaster (1968) and British
  Columbia (1969). He is an honorary member of the Polish Chemical
  Society and Membre d'honneur of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Chimie
  Physique in Paris. He is a foreign member of the Polish and the
  Bulgarian Academies of Sciences, a corresponding member of the
  Academy of Sciences in G&ouml;ttingen and of the Royal Society of
  Sciences in Liege. He is a honorary member of the Royal Society
  of Sciences in Uppsala and the New York Academy of Sciences. He
  has received the Meldola medal of the Royal Institute of
  Chemistry (1926), the Davy medal of the Royal Society (1958), the
  Lewis medal of the Combustion Institute (1964), the Faraday medal
  of the Chemical Society (1965) and their Longstaff medal (1969).
  He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936 and is still
  endeavouring to continue to prosecute his scientific activities
  in Cambridge.<br>
  <br>
  To mark his retirement in 1965, many of his old friends and
  younger colleagues now occupying distinguished positions in
  academic and industrial work in Great Britain and abroad
  collaborated to publish a work entitled "Photochcmistry and
  Reaction Kinetics". To them and to all others with whom he has
  worked for over 50 years he is deeply grateful.</p>
