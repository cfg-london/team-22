  <h1>Odysseus Elytis - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="elytis.jpg" class="bio-img">Descendant of an old family of Lesbos, he
  was born in Heraclion (Candia) on the island of Crete, November
  2, 1911. Some time later his family settled permanently in Athens
  where the poet finished his secondary school studies and later
  visited the Law School of the Athens University. His first appearance as a
  poet in 1935 through the magazine "Nea Grammata" ("New Culture")
  was saluted as an important event and the new style he introduced
  - though giving rise to a great many reactions - succeeded in
  prevailing and effectively contributing to the poetical reform
  commencing in the Second World War's eve and going on up to our
  days.</p>

  <p>In 1937 he visited the Reserve Officer's
  Cadet School in Corfu. Upon the outbreak of the war he served in
  the rank of Second Lieutenant, first at the Headquarters of the
  1st Army Corps and then at the 24th Regiment, on the advanced
  fire line. During the German occupation and later, after Greece
  was liberated, he has been unabatedly active, publishing
  successive collections of poetry and writing essays concerning
  contemporary poetry and art problems.&sect;</p>

  <p>He has twice been Programme Director of the
  Greek National Radio Foundation (1945-46 and 1953-54), Member of
  the National Theatre's Administrative Council, President of the
  Administrative Council of the Greek Radio and Television Service
  as well as Member of the Consultative Committee of the Greek
  National Tourist's Organisation on the Athens Festival. In 1960
  he was awarded the First State Poetry Prize, in 1965 the Order of
  the Phoenix Brigade and in 1975 he was proclaimed Doctor Honoris
  Causa of the Philosophical School of the Thessaloniki University
  and Honorary Citizen of the Town of Mytilene.</p>

  <p>During the years 1948-1952 and 1969-1972 he
  settled in Paris. There, he listened to philology and literature
  lessons in the Sorbonne and got acquainted with the pioneers of
  the world's avant-garde (Reverdy, Breton, Tzara, Ungaretti,
  Matisse, Picasso, Chagall, Giacometti). Starting from Paris he
  travelled and visited subsequently Switzerland, England, Italy
  and Spain. In 1948 he was the representative of Greece at the
  "International Meetings of Geneva", in 1949 at the Founding
  Congress of the "International Art Critics Union" in Paris and in
  1962 at the "Incontro Romano della Cultura" in Rome.</p>

  <p>In 1961, upon an invitation of the State
  Department, he traveled through the U.S.A.; and - upon similar
  invitations - through the Soviet Union in 1963 and Bulgaria in
  1965.</p>

  <p>Elytis' poetry has marked, through an
  active presence of over forty years, a broad spectrum. Unlike
  others, he did not turn back to Ancient Greece or Byzantium but
  devoted himself exclusively to today's Hellenism, of which he
  attempted - in a certain way based on psychical and sentimental
  aspects - to build up the mythology and the institutions. His
  main endeavour has been to rid his people's conscience from
  remorses unjustifiable, to complement natural elements through
  ethical powers, to achieve the highest possible transparency in
  expression and to finally succeed in approaching the mystery of
  light, "the metaphysic of the sun" - according to his own
  definition. A parallel way concerning technique resulted in
  introducing the "inner architecture", which is clearly
  perceptible in a great many works of his; mainly in the <i>Axion
  Esti</i> - <i>It Is Worthy</i>. This work - thanks to its setting
  to music by Mikis Theodorakis - was to be widely spread among all
  Greeks and grew to be a kind of the people's new gospel. Elytis'
  theoretical ideas have been expressed in a series of essays under
  the title <i>(Offering) My Cards To Sight</i>. Besides he applied
  himself to translating poetry and theatre as well as creating a
  series of <i>collage</i> pictures. Translations of his poetry
  have been published as autonomous books, in anthologies or in
  periodicals in eleven languages.</p>
