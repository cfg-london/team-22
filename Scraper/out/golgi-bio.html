  <h1>Camillo Golgi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="golgi.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Camillo
  Golgi</b> was born at Corteno near Brescia on July 7,
  1843<a href="#not">*</a>, the son of a physician. He studied
  medicine at the University of Pavia under Mantegazza, Bizzozero
  and Oehl. After graduating in 1865 he continued to work in Pavia
  at the Hospital of St. Matteo. Golgi himself stated that
  Bizzozero greatly influenced him and his methods of scientific
  research; at that time most of his investigations were concerned
  with the nervous system, i.e. insanity, neurology and the
  lymphatics of the brain. In 1872 he accepted the post of Chief
  Medical Officer at the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at
  Abbiategrasso, and it is believed that in the seclusion of this
  hospital, in a little kitchen which he had converted into a
  laboratory, he first started his investigations into the nervous
  system.</p>

  <p>Golgi returned to the University of Pavia
  as Extraordinary Professor of Histology, went to Siena for a
  short time, but returned to Pavia and was appointed to the Chair
  for General Pathology in 1881, in succession to his teacher
  Bizzozero. He settled down in Pavia for good, and married Donna
  Lina, a niece of Bizzozero.</p>

  <p>Already while working at the Hospital of
  St. Matteo, Golgi became interested in the investigation of the
  causes of malaria and he must be credited for having determined
  the three forms of the parasite and the three types of fever.
  After prolonged studies he found a way of photographing the most
  characteristic phases in 1890.</p>

  <p>Golgi was a famous teacher, his laboratory
  was open to anyone anxious to do research. He never actually
  practised medicine, but directed the Department of General
  Pathology at St.Matteo Hospital where young doctors were trained.
  He also founded and directed the Istituto
  Sieroterapico-Vaccinogeno of the Province of Pavia. Golgi was
  Rector of Pavia University for a long time and was also made a
  Senator of the Kingdom of Italy.</p>

  <p>He was an old man during the First World
  War, but assumed the responsibility for a Military Hospital in
  Pavia, where he created a neuro-pathological and
  mechano-therapeutical centre for the study and treatment of
  peripheral nervous lesions and for the rehabilitation of the
  wounded.</p>

  <p>However, the work of greatest importance
  which Golgi carried out was a revolutionary method of staining
  individual nerve and cell structures, which is referred to as the
  &laquo;black reaction&raquo;. This method uses a weak solution of
  silver nitrate and is particularly valuable in tracing the
  processes and most delicate ramifications of cells. Golgi himself
  was extremely modest and reticent about his work and it is not
  known when exactly he made this invention. All through his life,
  however, he continued to work on these lines, modifying and
  improving this technique.</p>

  <p>Golgi received the highest honours and
  awards in recognition of his work. He shared the Nobel Prize for
  1906 with <a href="index.html">Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal</a>
  for their work on the structure of the nervous system. The
  Historical Museum at the University of Pavia dedicated a hall to
  Golgi, where more than 80 certificates of honorary degrees,
  diplomas and awards are exhibited.</p>

  <p>Golgi married Donna Lina Aletti, previously
  mentioned. They had no children of their own, but adopted his
  niece, now Mrs. Carolina Golgi-Papini in Rome. He died at Pavia,
  where he had lived all his life, on January 21, 1926.</p>
