  <h2>Suture of Blood-Vessels and Transplantation of Organs</h2>

  <p>The idea of replacing diseased organs by
  sound ones, of putting back an amputated limb or even of grafting
  a new limb on to a patient who has undergone an amputation, is
  far from being original. Many surgeons before me have had this
  idea, but they were prevented from applying it, owing to the lack
  of a method for reestablishing immediately a normal circulation
  through the transplanted structures. It was of fundamental
  importance to first discover a suitable method of uniting the
  blood-vessels of the new organ to those of its host. In 1902,
  therefore, I began to investigate by what means a vascular
  anastomosis might be effected without producing either stenosis
  or thrombosis. Many surgeons had previously to myself performed
  vascular anastomosis, but the results were far from satisfactory.
  I began by using Payr's and Murphy's methods, after which I
  proceeded to study the principles for a new technique on human
  cadavers. I next performed some vascular anastomoses on living
  dogs at the University of Lyons in the laboratory of Professor
  Soulier and with the collaboration of Dr. Morel. This study was
  continued at the University of Chicago in Professor Stewart's
  laboratory and with the collaboration of Dr. Guthrie. Later, at
  the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the
  causes of all possible complications were analysed and greater
  perfection of methods was obtained. With this modified technique
  a great many experimental operations were performed and their
  clinical and anatomical results were observed during a period of
  three and four years. As a result the study of vascular
  anastomosis can today be considered as completed from the
  standpoints both of the technique and of the experimental
  results.  </p>
  <h3>Vascular anastomoses</h3>

  <p><b>General rules</b><br>
  In operations on blood-vessels certain general rules must be
  followed. These rules have been adopted with the view of
  eliminating the complications which are especially liable to
  occur after vascular sutures, namely, stenosis, haemorrhage, and
  thrombosis. A rigid asepsis is absolutely essential. Sutures of
  blood-vessels must never be performed in infected wounds. It
  seems that the degree of asepsis under which general surgical
  operations can safely be made may be insticient for the success
  of a vascular operation. It is possible that a slight
  non-suppurative infection, which does not prevent the union of
  tissues "per primam intentionem", may yet be sufficient to cause
  thrombosis. The obliteration of the vessel also follows injuries
  to its walls. The arteries and veins can be freely handled with
  the fingers without being injured, but it is often harmful to use
  forceps or other instruments. If a forceps be used, it must take
  between its jaws nothing but the external sheath. When temporary
  haemostasis is obtained by means of forceps or clamps, these
  instruments must be smooth-jawed and their pressure carefully
  regulated. The dessication of the endothelium may also lead to
  the formation of a thrombus. Therefore, during the operation the
  wall of the vessels must be humidified with Ringer's solution or
  be covered with Vaseline. The presence of coagulated blood, of
  fibrin ferment, or of foreign tissues or tissue juices on the
  intima can determine the production of a thrombus. It is,
  therefore, necessary to resect or to remove the external sheath
  from the edges of the vessels, for if, during the suture, it gets
  between the edges of the vessels or around the silk threads, it
  very quickly leads to a deposit of fibrin, and possibly to an
  obliterative thrombus. By washing the vessel carefully with
  Ringer's solution and coating it and the surrounding parts of the
  operating-field with Vaseline, we can efficiently protect the
  endothelium against coagulating blood and the juices of tissues.
  Vaseline also prevents the fingers of the operators and the
  threads from becoming soiled by fibrin ferment. As perforating
  stitches are always used, the endothelial layer is necessarily
  wounded by the needle. These wounds, however, are rendered as
  harmless as possible by the use of very fine and sharp round
  needles. Extremely small wounds are made. The threads are
  sterilized in vaseline and kept heavily coated with it during the
  suture, thus preventing the wounded tissue and the foreign
  material from coming into actual contact with the blood. Stenosis
  is very liable to occur at the point of anastomosis, therefore
  the suture must be performed while the wall is under tension. The
  tension can easily be obtained by traction on retaining stitches
  properly located. Great care is taken to obtain a smooth union
  and approximation of the internal coats, in order to produce as
  small a scar as possible. When these general rules are observed
  the operation can be safely performed.</p>

  <p><b>Technique</b><br>
  The instruments employed are very simple. Temporary haemostasis
  in the case of small vessels is secured by an ordinary serrefine,
  the spring of which is carefully regulated, and in the case of
  large vessels by Crile clamps or smooth-jawed Gentile forceps.
  These instruments are all smooth-jawed and are applied to the
  vessel without a cover of rubber. The vessel is washed in
  Ringer's solution by means of a Gentile syringe, which is
  composed of a rubber bulb and a glass-tube narrowed at its end.
  The anastomosis is performed with round, straight Kirby needles.
  No.16 is used for the small vessels and No.12 for the large ones.
  Short, curved needles can also be used, but the straight ones are
  always preferable. The needles are threaded and the thread is
  rolled on cardboard, after which the needles and threads are
  placed in a hermetically closed jar, which is put in the
  sterilizer under fifteen or eighteen pounds' pressure. The
  needles and thread are removed from the jar whilst the Vaseline
  is still warm and deposited on a black towel. During the
  operation the threads are fixed by means of small Gentile
  haemostatic forceps. The operating-field is circumscribed by a
  black Japanese silk towel on which the fine threads can easily be
  seen.</p>

  <p><i>(1) Temporary haemostasis and
  preparation of the vessels</i>. The vessels are exposed by a
  large incision and they are freely dissected. The dissection of a
  very long segment of artery or vein is not dangerous. Careful
  haemostasis of the wound is made, because during the suture the
  operating-field must be free from blood. The temporary
  haemostasis is secured by clamps placed at a few centimeters'
  distance from the location of the suture. If there are collateral
  branches between the forceps and the point of section, they are
  ligated or clamped. Then the vessels are cut and the external
  sheath is resected from the ends of the vessels. The end of the
  syringe is introduced into the lumen of the vessel and the blood
  is washed out of the vessel and from the operating-field. The
  fluid is removed with dry gauze sponges. Then the vessels and the
  surrounding parts are covered with vaseline and a black Japanese
  silk towel is placed around the ends of the vessels.</p>

  <p><i>(2) Suture</i>. We shall now proceed to
  describe the technique of the suture, selecting as our type the
  termino-terminal anastomosis. Then we will point out the
  modifications which take place in the termino-lateral and
  latero-lateral anastomoses.</p>

  <p><i>The termino-terminal anastomosis</i> is
  effected by bringing the extremities of the vessels into contact,
  no traction being necessary. The ends are united by three
  retaining stitches located in three equidistant points of their
  circumference. By traction on the threads the circumference of
  the artery can be transformed into a triangle, and the perimeter
  can be dilated at will. Then the edges of each side of the
  triangle are united by a continuous suture whilst they are under
  tension. During the suture great care is taken to approximate
  exactly the surfaces of section of the wall. Before the last
  stitch is made, the remaining Vaseline is removed by pressure
  from the lumen of the vessel. In venous anastomoses the ends of
  the veins are also united by three retaining stitches. A venous
  suture, however, requires more stitches than an arterial suture,
  on account of the thinness of the walls. The union of the
  extremities is made by eversion of the edges, which are united
  not by their surface of section, but by their endothelial
  surfaces. An inversion of the edges would be very dangerous and
  would provoke the formation of a thrombus. In arterio-venous
  sutures the vein is generally larger than the artery. After the
  ends of both vessels have been united by the retaining stitches
  each side of the venous triangle is longer than the corresponding
  side of the artery. By traction on the retaining stitches the
  arterial lumen can be greatly dilated and be brought nearer to
  the size of the vein. Each stitch of the continuous suture is
  made larger on the vein than on the artery, and the size of the
  vein is thus progressively reduced and a good union ensured.
  During the suture the venous wall is turned outward and its
  endothelial surface is applied to the surface of section of the
  arterial wall.</p>

  <p><i>The termino-lateral anastomosis</i>
  consists in implanting the end of one vessel on to the wall of
  another vessel. A triangular or elliptic incision is made in the
  wall of one vessel, whereupon the edges of the opening are united
  to the extremity of the second vessel by three or four retaining
  stitches, and the operation finally concluded by a continuous
  suture. If the vessel is of small caliber it is better to perform
  the termino-lateral anastomosis by the patching method. This
  consists in dissecting the small vessel to the level of its
  implantation in a larger trunk and in resecting the patch of the
  wall of this trunk which surrounds the mouth of the small artery.
  This patch must be elliptic in shape and its edges as regular as
  possible in order that a smooth anastomosis can be made. The
  patch is then inserted into an opening made through the wall of
  the larger vessel and fixed by four retaining stitches and a
  continuous suture. This method is safer than the direct
  implantation, for the formation of a slight thrombus on the line
  of suture would not impede the circulation of the large vessel,
  whereas the lumen of the smaller vessel would be obliterated if
  the thrombus were formed at its mouth.</p>

  <p><i>The latero-lateral anastomosis</i> is
  performed by placing two vessels parallel to one another and
  opening them longitudinally by incision or resection of an
  elliptic flap. The ends of the openings are united by two
  posterior retaining stitches and by a continuous suture performed
  on the interior of the vessels whilst their walls are under
  tension. A third retaining stitch unites the middle points of the
  anterior edges, the posterior line of suture being still
  stretched by traction on the two retaining stitches. Finally by
  traction on the posterior and anterior retaining stitches the
  opening is transformed into a triangle and the anastomosis is
  completed by a continuous suture running along both anterior
  sides.</p>

  <p><i>(3) Reestablishment of the
  circulation</i>. Before the circulation is reestablished the line
  of suture must be carefully examined, and if a gap is found
  between two stitches it is immediately closed. Next, gauze
  sponges are placed on the line of suture and the clamps are
  removed, while a gentle pressure is exercised on the sponges.
  There is almost always some leakage during the first minutes.
  After two or three minutes the sponges are removed, and if the
  haemorrhage persists one or two complementary stitches are added.
  It is of fundamental importance that the wound be not closed
  before complete haemostasis of the anastomosis has been obtained.
  Finally, the vessels and the operating-field are washed in
  Ringer's solution and the wound closed without drainage.</p>

  <p><b>Results</b><br>
  A great number of vascular sutures and anastomoses were performed
  by this method on dogs and cats, and some on man. The operations
  were made on arteries and veins of both large and small caliber.
  The simplicity of the technique makes it readily adaptable to all
  vessels. It is as easy to make a circular suture of the delicate
  renal vein of a small-sized dog as of the thoracic artery of a
  large dog, or even of the femoral artery of man. In aortic
  sutures, where the walls are very friable, the edges of the
  vessel are jointed by <i>u</i>-shaped stitches, instead of by a
  continuous suture. If it is necessary not to interrupt the
  circulation during the suturing, a diversion of the flow can be
  practised by means of a paraffined tube, which is inserted into
  the lumen of the vessel and afterwards removed by means of an
  incision in the wall. But in nearly all cases it is possible to
  interrupt the circulation for the space of a few minutes. Even
  during the operation of the Eck fistula or the circular suture of
  the thoracic aorta, the circulation in the portal vein or in the
  aorta was completely interrupted. The operation is always simple,
  except in those cases in which the region to be operated upon is
  deeply situated. It is possible to perform the suture of the
  carotid artery of a medium-sized dog in two and a half minutes,
  and of the aorta of a dog or of the femoral artery of a man in
  five or six minutes. Generally there is nothing to be gained by
  hastening the operations, as they could last 10 or 20 minutes
  without any harm resulting.</p>

  <p>The results were as simple as the
  technique. No haemorrhage was ever observed and no stenosis was
  ever produced at the location of the anastomosis, provided a
  proper tension was made on the retaining stitches during the
  suture. Occasionally I noticed in the Eck fistulas a reduction in
  the size of the vascular opening, which was due, doubtless, to
  deposits of fibrin. The commonest complication which was apt to
  take place in connection with vascular sutures, viz. thrombosis,
  never occurred when this method was properly employed. In sutures
  of vessels of the caliber of the carotid of a middle-sized dog,
  as well as in those of smaller vessels, it may be said that an
  obliteration occurred in hardly five out of one hundred cases. In
  the sutures of arteries or veins of larger caliber deposits of
  fibrin could sometimes be detected on the line of the suture, but
  never an obliterative thrombosis. In short, we can say that
  thrombosis has become an altogether unusual complication in cases
  of vascular operations.</p>

  <p>The anatomical evolution of vascular
  sutures was studied during a period of time varying from several
  days to over four years. One week after the operation all the
  stitches could still be seen on the endothelial surface of the
  vessel. In certain cases the line of suture was covered by a very
  fine layer of fibrin. Little by little the threads became
  invisible and at the end of some months no trace of the suture
  could be perceived except a more or less indistinct transverse
  line. Sometimes this line was slightly depressed, but there was
  never any trace of dilatation or of stenosis at the location of
  the suture. Sometimes, again, the line of juncture became
  entirely invisible, and this occurred in the case of the suturing
  of the renal artery, for, six months after the operation, it was
  impossible to locate the place where the anastomosis had taken
  place. Careful examination disclosed the place where the wall of
  the vessel had become slightly thicker, but no signs of the
  operation could be detected on the inner surface. Similarly,
  after the extirpation and replantation of the spleen, performed
  with a circular suture of the splenic vessels, an examination of
  the endothelial surface of the vessels, conducted twentytwo
  months after the operation, likewise failed to show where the
  anastomosis had taken place. It was only after the vessel had
  been placed in formalin, that two faint whitish lines began to
  appear, indicating the place where the suture had been performed.
  In the case of veins, where the walls are thinner, the marks of
  the operation remain for a longer time. Nearly all the stitches
  of a suture of a renal vein could still be seen as long as ten
  months after the kidney had been replanted. Certain animals on
  which circular sutures of the thoracic or abdominal aortas or of
  the carotid artery had been performed, and which we had retained
  in health two, three, and even four years afterwards, showed the
  same results. A histological examination of the sutured vessels
  readily explains the perfection of the clinical results obtained.
  The union produced by the suture is so exact that the scar
  resulting from the junction of the extremities of the vessels is
  in consequence very slight, and in some cases the medias become
  directly united without the interposition of any fibrous tissue.
  A longitudinal section of the anastomosis of the abdominal aorta
  of a cat, to which a segment of the aorta from another cat had
  been transplanted, showed that the wall at one of the extremities
  was slightly everted and had united with the surface of the
  section of the intima at the other extremity, without the
  interposition of fibrous tissue. At a short distance from the
  line of suture the elastic tunic was seen to be interrupted,
  because the section had encroached upon one of the silk threads
  surrounded by fibrous tissue. This result was exceptionally good.
  In most cases the elastic tunic was interrupted by a faint scar
  at the place of the anastomosis. The faintness of the scar
  explains why there was never any stenosis or dilatation at the
  level of the suture lines.</p>

  <p>By means of this technique I have been able
  to successfully perform sutures of incisions made on the
  ascending part of the aortic arch, and likewise to perform
  circular anastomoses of the thoracic aorta, of the abdominal
  aorta, of the vena cava, and of the majority of the vessels of
  the organism. Lateral anastomoses were employed in arterio-venous
  sutures and in the operation of the Eck fistula. Finally, by
  applying this technique to operations on the human body, I have
  shown it to be equally simple and efficacious as in the case of
  animals. It has made possible the successful transplantation of
  arterial and venous segments, of organs and members.</p>

  <p><b>Transplantation of
  blood-vessels</b><br>
  It is possible to perform two kinds of vascular transplantations,
  uni-terminal transplantation and bi-terminal transplantation. The
  uni-terminal transplantation consists in grafting one extremity
  of a vessel on to another part of the vascular system, and
  includes many different varieties. The main result of a
  uni-terminal transplantation is to change the quality of the
  blood circulating through a certain vessel and to modify its
  pressure. If the peripheral end of the external jugular vein is
  united to the central end of the carotid artery, the vein becomes
  filled with red blood and its pressure is augmented, whilst the
  pressure of the artery diminishes. The vessels readily adapt
  themselves to these modifications. An augmentation of the
  pressure in the carotid artery, produces a thickening of its
  walls. After several months, hypertrophy of the muscular coat and
  sclerosis of the intima arise. If on the other hand, the pressure
  of the carotid artery is diminished by anastomosing it with a
  large venous system, such as the superficial veins of the neck,
  its wall becomes thinner, and hypertrophy of the intima is
  produced. When an arterial circulation is established through a
  vein, the wall of the latter rapidly responds to the change by
  becoming thicker. When the carotid vein and the external jugular
  vein are united, the wall of the jugular vein becomes much
  thicker, although its pressure is less than ordinary arterial
  pressure. When the wall of the vein has to bear still more
  pressure, as, for instance, when the central end of the carotid
  artery is united to the peripheral end of the inferior thyroid
  vein, the reaction of the venous wall is very much greater. The
  lumen of the vein diminishes and the wall shows an enormous
  sclerosis.</p>

  <p>These uni-terminal transplantations were
  used in order to modify the circulation of certain vascular
  regions. Thus it was possible to produce a reversion of the
  circulation in the posterior limb by performing a cross
  anastomosis of the femoral artery and vein. In many instances we
  have modified the circulation of the veins of the neck and head
  as well as of the veins of certain organs. The union of the
  carotid artery and of the external jugular vein allowed the blood
  to pass from the carotid into the superficial veins of the neck
  and of the head, whereupon the latter pulsated like arteries. It
  was also possible to diminish the pressure of the upper carotid
  by uniting its central end to the central end of the jugular
  vein, and thereby the arterial blood was made to return
  immediately to the heart through this vein. In various other
  experiments I was able to reverse the direction of the
  circulation of an organ, such as the thyroid, in which case the
  thyroid vein was united to the carotid and the thyroid artery to
  the jugular.</p>

  <p>It is possible that some of the numerous
  operations performed by means of uni-terminal transplantation of
  blood vessels may some day be of practical use. So far these
  operations have above all shown how sensitive the walls of the
  vessels are to changes in the pressure of the blood, and how
  readily, by becoming thinner or thicker, they adapt themselves to
  these modifications.</p>

  <p>The <i>bi-terminal transplantation</i>
  consists in interposing a segment of a vessel between the ends of
  another vessel. This transplantation can be carried out in
  various ways, according as the segment is interposed between the
  cut ends of an artery or vein, or between two different regions
  of the circulatory system, or, again, between a serous membrane
  and a vein. If the transplanted segment is from the same animal,
  or from another animal of the same kind, or from a different kind
  of animal, the transplantations are autoplastic, homoplastic or
  heteroplastic respectively.</p>

  <p>The first <i>arterial transplantation</i>
  was performed in 1896 by Jaboulay. He thought that this method
  could be applied to the treatment of aneurisms, but the
  anastomoses were imperfect and in each case thrombosis of the
  vascular segment occurred. Nine years later Hoepfner successfully
  performed the transplantation of segments of arteries by using
  the method of Payr. In a remarkable series of experiments he
  demonstrated the possibility of transplanting arteries without
  any obliteration resulting therefrom. In 1905, at the University
  of Chicago, with the help of Dr. Guthrie, I took up this study.
  In a large number of experiments conducted subsequently at the
  Rockefeller Institute, the results of this method were studied in
  greater detail. Segments of the carotid artery or aorta of a dog
  and a cat were transplanted on to the same animal, another animal
  of the same species, and an animal of a different species. The
  vessels used were either fresh or had been preserved in cold
  storage. These operations performed with fresh vessels of proper
  caliber invariably showed positive results. The circulation
  continued in a normal manner and at the end of several months the
  transplanted segment usually presented the same appearance as the
  normal vessel.</p>

  <p>In the case of autoplastic transplantations
  there was no change in the appearance of the vessel, which
  preserved its normal diameter and its elasticity. The only trace
  left by the operation was two whitish transverse lines, which
  were visible on the endothelial surface of the wall of the
  vessel. The histological examination likewise showed that the
  wall of the vessel had undergone no change.</p>

  <p>In homoplastic transplantations the
  appearance of the vessel also remained normal. When the vessel
  was examined on the living animal six months or more after the
  operation it was usually impossible to locate the transplanted
  segment. Even in cases in which the vessel had been preserved for
  several weeks in cold storage the results were the same. But a
  histological examination made three months or more after the
  operation often showed that the histological constitution of the
  wall had become modified. In some cases the wall had remained
  normal, but in the majority of cases the muscular fibres had
  completely disappeared and the intima had thickened. The elastic
  fibres of the media always remained in a normal condition, even
  after several years. Hitherto it has not been possible to
  recognize before operating the animals that may undergo an
  exchange of vascular segments without suffering degeneration of
  the muscular fibres, and those whose muscular fibres would, after
  such an exchange, completely degenerate.</p>

  <p>In heteroplastic transplantations the
  results were different. Segments of the carotid from dogs were
  grafted on to the aorta of a cat or the segments of the aorta of
  a cat on to the carotids of dogs. Also segments of human aortas
  were transplanted on to the aorta or carotid of dogs.
  Obliteration often occurred in cases where human vessels were
  transplanted on to other human beings, but this obliteration may
  possibly be attributed to secondary causes, as the vessels
  employed had been preserved in cold storage. In nearly all cases
  in which the carotid of a dog had been transplanted on to the
  aorta of a cat the results were positive and the circulation
  remained normal. The clinical results were observed during a
  period of time varying from several days to more than four years.
  The anatomical evolution of the heterologous vessels is different
  from the evolution of the autologous and homologous vessels.
  Their caliber becomes progressively larger, but this augmentation
  of the diameter does not augment indefinitely and never results
  in the formation of aneurisms. Similarly the wall becomes
  thinner. The histological examination showed that, during the
  weeks and the months following the transplantation, not only the
  muscular fibres had degenerated but the elastic framework had
  also completely disappeared. Thus the wall only consisted of
  connective tissue. A dog, which in 1907 had undergone the
  resection of the abdominal aorta and the transplantation of a
  segment of a human popliteal artery, died four years after the
  operation. The vascular segment was slightly dilated and the
  anastomoses were normal. But the wall contained neither muscular
  nor elastic fibres. The same results were observed after the
  arteries of a cat or of a rabbit were transplanted on to a dog.
  The lesions consisted in the progressive disappearance of the
  elastic and muscular elements of the wall, of an augmentation of
  interstitial connective tissue and of a thickening of the intima.
  But the resistance of this fibrous wall was sufficient and the
  segment of the artery was able to take the place of an artery
  during several years. In these arterial transplantations fresh
  segments, or such as had been preserved in cold storage, were
  used. The clinical results were identical in both cases, that is
  to say, when the period of preservation in cold storage had not
  exceeded two or three months. Vessels preserved in formalin or by
  means of a system of thorough drying were also used. In the
  latter experiments the wall of the vessel, which was devitalized,
  had become regenerated at the expense of its host.</p>

  <p>The transplantation of veins was attempted
  for the first time by Gl&uuml;ckin 1898, but the segment of the
  jugular vein which he transplanted on to the carotid artery of a
  dog became quickly obliterated. Exner attempted to perform the
  same experiments, as did also Hoepner and Goyanes. The results of
  these operations, however, were always negative. In 1905 I
  succeeded with Guthrie in transplanting segments of the jugular
  veins of a dog on to the carotid artery. Later on I was able to
  graft segments of the vena cava on to the abdominal aorta or on
  to the vena cava of dogs or cats. Finally I succeeded in
  performing the same operation on the thoracic aorta of a dog. The
  upper part of the descending aorta of a fox-terrier having been
  cut transversely, a segment of the jugular vein of a large dog
  was interposed between the extremities of the vessel. The animal
  remained in an excellent condition. More than two years after the
  operation he died of poliomyelitis, which at that time was
  epidemic in dogs. The autopsy showed that the venous segment was
  not dilated and that the valves were in the same condition as at
  the time of the operation. The muscular fibres of the wall had
  disappeared, but the diameter of the vessel was practically the
  same as that of the neighbouring parts of the aorta.</p>

  <p>I have performed many venous
  transplantations, both autoplastic and homoplastic. In the case
  of the autoplastic transplantations the vein immediately
  underwent important anatomic modifications. The wall became
  thicker while the lumen became slightly dilated; but aneurism
  never occurred. On the contrary, the vein adapted itself to its
  arterial function, and responded to the pressure of the blood by
  thickening its wall. This thickening was mainly produced by an
  augmentation of the connective tissue of the adventitia and of
  the intima. Sometimes, too, the number of muscular fibres
  increased. Four months after the transplantation of the segment
  of the jugular on to the carotid of a dog, I removed a small
  piece of the wall and sutured the wound. The histological
  examination showed a large increase of the connective tissue of
  the adventitia and of the connective tissue of the intima, but
  the muscular fibres were normal. Twelve months later the venous
  segment was examined again. It was found that the wall had become
  still thicker and that all the muscular fibres had degenerated.
  In the homoplastic transplantations the clinical evolution showed
  the same results, but all the muscular fibres disappeared more or
  less rapidly. These experiments served to demonstrate, therefore,
  that the segment of a vein, notwithstanding the thinness of its
  wall, may perform the function of an artery. From a practical
  point of view it is possible to replace segments of arteries by
  sections of veins. On human beings this operation would be easier
  than the transplantation of arteries, as it is always possible to
  find on the patient himself a segment of vein suitable for
  transplantation.</p>

  <p>In still other experiments a piece of the
  wall of an artery, such as the aorta or carotid, was extirpated
  and replaced by a fragment of vein or peritoneum. In some cases
  the entire section of a vessel was removed and replaced by a tube
  of peritoneum, but in this case thrombosis of the tube occurred
  in a few days. When a piece of the wall was resected and replaced
  by a patch of perito-neumor vein, the results were always
  positive. The adaptation of the pieces of peritoneum or vein to
  their new conditions was so perfect, that in less than two years
  after the operation the wall of the vessel was almost normal,
  although it showed a slight thickening at the point where the
  operation had been performed. The exterior appearance of the
  abdominal aorta of a dog, on to which a patch of peritoneum had
  been grafted, was in no wise modified, although the wall was
  composed of a different tissue. It possessed the same thickness
  and appearance as the adjoining normal portion of the wall. By a
  kind of mimetism the connective cells of the peritoneum had taken
  on the aspect of muscular fibres. In spite of the absence of
  muscular and elastic fibres, such as those possessed by the
  normal aorta, the new wall supported the pressure of the blood
  without dilating. Aneurism was never produced unless there was
  bacteriological infection. The only way in which I succeeded in
  provoking fusiform aneurisms was by transplanting tissues which
  had been infected. I also succeeded in repairing the wall of an
  artery with the aid of foreign organic and inorganic substances.
  A portion of the anterior wall of the abdominal aorta of a dog
  was replaced by a piece of rubber. Fifteen months after the
  operation the function of the aorta had not become modified and
  its lumen was normal. A thick layer of connective tissue had
  formed on the inside and outside of the venous piece. In other
  experiments glass and metal tubes covered with paraffin were
  introduced into the thoracic aorta of the dog. The blood did not
  coagulate as long as the wall of the artery was not ulcerated. A
  dog whose thoracic aorta contained a piece of glass remained in
  perfect health for 90 days and finally died of an ulceration of
  the aorta. These experiments showed that the presence of foreign
  bodies in the lumen of a vessel does not necessarily produce a
  thrombus, as was formerly believed. This observation caused a
  simplification of the technique of the transfusion of blood to
  human beings.</p>

  <p>These various experiments on blood-vessels
  demonstrated that arterial or venous transplantations could be
  performed with safety when a proper technique was used. It was of
  little importance whether the muscular fibres were preserved or
  not, as the vascular wall adapted itself to the pressure, and no
  dilatation occurred. Autoplastic and homoplastic transplantations
  of arteries and veins may, therefore, be adopted in surgical
  practice for those cases in which it is necessary to reestablish
  the continuity of an artery.</p>

  <p><b>Transplantation of limbs and
  organs</b><br>
  The question of the transplantation of tissues and organs must be
  considered from two points of view, the surgical and the
  biological. I began by seeking to develop a technique which would
  enable the circulation to be reestablished in the organs without
  delay. After that I endeavoured to ascertain to what extent the
  organs fulfilled their functions, according as the
  transplantations were autoplastic or homoplastic. I found that an
  entire anatomic region could be transplanted from one animal to
  another. The following observation is an illustration of the
  transplantation from one dog to another of the anatomic
  structures supplied by the external carotid artery. From a first
  dog the right part of the scalp and the auricle were extirpated
  in one mass with the auditory canal, the connective tissue and
  the glands of the retro-maxillary space and the upper portions of
  the external jugular vein and of the common carotid artery. The
  dog was then chloroformed. The anatomic specimen was perfused
  with Locke's solution. Then it was wrapped in a silk towel
  saturated with Vaseline and placed on a table at the temperature
  of the laboratory. On a second dog the auricle and the adjoining
  portion of the scalp were extirpated and the right part of the
  neck opened through a longitudinal incision. The anatomic
  specimen was then placed in the wound, and the peripheral ends of
  the carotid artery and of the jugular vein were united to the
  central end of the corresponding vessels of the host. The
  circulation was then reestablished. An abundant haemorrhage
  occurred from the little peripheral branches of the carotid
  artery, which were immediately ligated. Then the neck was closed
  by two rows of suture. The purpose of making the vascular
  anastomosis very far from the transplanted ear was to prevent the
  occurrence of thrombosis, if infection should be produced at the
  level of the external auditory canal. A few minutes after the
  establishment of the circulation the ear and the scalp assumed
  the normal appearance of the internal auditory canal. The new ear
  was fixed to the external auditory canal of the host. The
  auricular muscles were sutured and the operation was completed by
  continuous suture of the skin without drainage. During the days
  following the operation oedema of the auricle occurred, but the
  circulation remained excellent. The temperature of the
  transplanted ear was much higher than that of the normal ear. The
  cutaneous wounds united by first intention, but subsequently a
  voluminous abscess appeared under the scalp and had to be drained
  eight days after the operation. The oedema of the auricle
  diminished and disappeared, but the animal had some fever and a
  secondary abscess appeared in the left leg. The animal developed
  a slow form of pyaemia. Nevertheless, the local condition became
  excellent. The temperature of both auricles, normal and
  transplanted, were about the same. The transplanted ear was as
  thin and glossy as the normal one and its circulation was normal.
  The animal finally died, three weeks after the operation, of
  pyaemia. The transplanted parts were normal. I performed several
  other operations similar in character, without any infection
  arising. The transplanted ear remained normal for from six to
  eight days. After that the transplanted tissues became oedematous
  and in every case necrosis of the skin developed. The animals had
  then to be chloroformed. In no case did the lesions appear to
  have been caused by a defect of the circulation, which was
  apparently normal. It is therefore safe to assume that they
  resulted from the reaction of the host against the transplanted
  anatomic region, a reaction which failed to take place in the
  first experiment.</p>

  <p>In 1907 I commenced the study of the
  transplantation of limbs. This study had been preceded by various
  experiments conducted by other surgeons who had studied the
  subject of the replantation of limbs. In 1891 Robert Abbe
  amputated almost completely the fore-limb of a dog. He cut the
  entire limb with the exception of the femoral vessels. Then he
  sutured the bone, the nerves, the muscles and the skin, and the
  animal recovered completely. If he had had at his disposal an
  efficient method of anastomosing blood vessels, he would have
  doubtless accomplished a real replantation of the limb. Hoepfner
  in 1903 amputated the thigh of a dog and replanted it immediately
  by suturing the bones and all the anatomic structures of the
  limb, and by uniting the vessels according to Payr's prothesis.
  In one case the circulation remained excellent. Unfortunately the
  animal died eleven days after the operation. The tissues of the
  limb were well united, but the bone had very little tendency to
  callus formation. In 1905, in Chicago, I performed with Guthrie
  several experiments of the replantation of the thigh. The tissues
  and vessels healed by first intention, but we were unable to keep
  any animal alive longer than eleven days. I performed no more
  replantations and after this I proceeded to study the
  transplantation of limbs from one animal to another. These
  experiments were made at the Rockefeller Institute in 1907 and
  1908, and they consisted in transplanting the front or back limbs
  from one dog to another. The animals used for these experiments
  were of no special variety, and they belonged neither to the same
  race nor to the same family. I merely endeavored to procure two
  animals of the same size. First of all a dog was killed with
  chloroform, then the limb was amputated circularly in its middle
  part, minute aseptic precautions being observed. In the case of
  the transplantation of the thigh a circular incision was first
  made at the level of the upper part of the limb. The sartorius
  muscle was cut and the femoral vessels dissected in such a way as
  to enable them to retain a considerable length. The limb was then
  amputated and the surface of the section, covered with a silk
  towel saturated with Vaseline. By means of a canula introduced
  into the femoral artery the limb was completely perfused with
  Ringer's solution. It was considered advisable to eject all the
  blood from the limb, as by so doing there was no danger of
  embolisms arising upon the reestablishment of the circulation.
  The animal upon which the limb was to be grafted was
  anaesthetized in the usual manner and the thigh was amputated
  transversely after dissection of the femoral vessels. It was
  necessary to calculate the exact length of the vascular pedicle,
  for tension on an arterial or venous suture is a dangerous thing.
  Moreover, if after a suture has been performed a vein is left too
  long, it doubles up and the circulation is impaired. Thus,
  whether the vessels be too short or too long, in either case
  congestion of the limb would result. The operation was then begun
  by fixing the new limb to the stump of the host by means of an
  Elsberg splint. When the junction of the femur had been secured,
  the periosteum was sutured. After this the internal muscles of
  the thigh were sutured and the femoral vessels and nerves of the
  limb were united to the corresponding vessels and nerves of the
  host. The circulation was reestablished and the haemostasis of
  the surface of the section of the member was performed. The
  operation was concluded by suturing with catgut each muscle and
  aponeurosis and then the superficial aponeurosis and the skin.
  The whole operation lasted about one hour and a half.</p>

  <p>The technique of the transplantation of the
  front limb is somewhat different. The humerus was amputated a
  little above the elbow, whilst the nerves and vessels were
  severed much higher up. In some experiments the leg alone was
  transplanted and the tibia was cut a little below the knee. In
  this operation a large strip of skin was preserved, containing
  the saphenic vessels, which were dissected at the level of the
  femoral vessels. The circulation was reestablished by uniting
  these segments of the femoral vessels with the femoral vessels of
  the host. But the general lines of the operation were similar to
  those above described. The limb was next confined in a
  plaster-of-Paris cast and the animal was laid on a small bed,
  consisting of a sheet stretched on a metal frame. The animal was
  fixed there by means of two broad linen bandages and was watched
  night and day by a nurse. From time to time it was liberated and
  made to walk round the room, thus taking some exercise each day.
  It is difficult to keep an animal in good condition, after it has
  suffered transplantation of the thigh. Little by little we were
  led to observe all these minute details, in order to avoid
  various complications which invariably arose in cases where a
  simpler procedure was adopted. The immediate results of these
  operations were excellent. The limb resumed its normal
  temperature and color. The arterial pulsations could be felt, not
  only in the femoral artery, but also in the branches of the
  saphenic artery and in the interdigital spaces. During the first
  few days there was no sign of oedema, the animal suffered no
  pain, ate in a normal manner, walked about and remained in
  excellent health. But after seven or eight days a difference was
  apparent, which produced very marked results. In nearly every
  case the oedema appeared at the level of the toes, ascended to
  the leg and thigh and stopped at the line of suture. The
  circulation, however, remained normal. Next, the oedema became
  harder and the skin became bluish in places. Notwithstanding this
  fact, however, an incision made in the skin produced a flow of
  red blood. After several days the skin became necrosed, although
  the inner circulation remained normal. At this stage the animals
  were chloroformed. It seems that this necrosis of the epithelium
  was not produced by the circulation but by a reaction of the
  organism against its new limb. In certain rare instances these
  phenomena did not occur and the limb seemed to adapt itself to
  its new conditions of life.</p>

  <p>The best result was obtained in one of the
  first experiments, performed in April, 1908. The leg of a
  fox-terrier was amputated at the level of its upper third. This
  was then immediately transplanted on to a white, young female
  fox-terrier of the same size and shape as the first dog. In the
  evening of the day of operation the circulation was excellent and
  the foot was pink and warmer than the fellow foot. The animal
  recovered rapidly. She had a keen appetite and was gay and
  affectionate as before the operation. Several times she broke the
  plaster cast and even twisted her leg a little. During the first
  few days the temperature of the new foot was higher than that of
  its fellow; it was oedematous too, but this feature entirely
  disappeared after a few days. A week later the temperature of the
  feet was the same. The new leg united with the stump of the host
  by first intention, and fifteen days after the operation it had
  quite healed. The skin had the same appearance above the line of
  suture as below it and there seemed to be no vasodilatation of
  the new limb. Owing to the fact that the Elsberg splint had
  become twisted, the extremities of the bones had set somewhat
  imperfectly and in consequence the tibia was bent outwards a
  little. The other parts of the limb looked quite normal and it
  would have been impossible for anyone unacquainted with the fact
  to detect that the leg did not in reality belong to the animal.
  At this stage the animal began to cough. Then it refused to eat
  and rapidly grew thinner. On the twentieth day it was very sick.
  The plaster-of-Paris cast was removed and the leg examined. The
  new limb was in excellent condition and there was neither oedema
  nor any kind of trophic trouble. The temperature was the same as
  that of the normal leg. The bone had hardened and the animal
  walked round the room on its three sound legs without attempting
  to use the new limb. The cutaneous anaesthesia persisted. The
  skin was as soft and the coat as bright on the transplanted leg
  as on the normal one. The general health of the animal rapidly
  grew worse and it died on the twenty-second day after the
  operation. The circulation of the leg remained normal until the
  end. The autopsy showed diffuse broncho-pneumonia, which carried
  off a number of other dogs about the same time. In two other
  experiments the results were almost identical. It should be
  mentioned that the three animals which showed the best local
  results were animals suffering from a general infection of a
  serious nature. The same fact had previously been observed in the
  transplantation of the auricle. This may be a matter of pure
  coincidence, although one may be permitted to conjecture that the
  tolerance shown by an organism towards its new member may vary in
  degree according to certain general conditions.</p>

  <p>During the last seven years I have
  performed a large number of experiments in the replantation and
  transplantation of organs, in the course of which the technique
  relating thereto has been thoroughly worked out. In 1902, in
  conjunction with M. Morel, I performed my first experiment on the
  extirpation and replantation of the thyroid gland of a dog. The
  vessels were sutured, but thrombosis speedily occurred. In 1905,
  with the collaboration of Mr. Guthrie, I succeeded in replanting
  a thyroid gland, accompanied by a reversion of the circulation.
  The circulation remained normal. These experiments were confirmed
  in 1907 by Stich and Makkas, who found that the replanted glands
  remained normal from a histological point of view. After that I
  performed other experiments in the transplantation of the thyroid
  gland, the replantation and transplantation of the suprarenal
  gland, of the ovaries, the intestine, the heart and the spleen.
  Some of the animals operated on lived a long time and the
  anatomic results were examined several years after. The spleen is
  anatomically well adapted for use in these experiments, and the
  replantation of this organ can be taken as characteristic of this
  kind of operation. The abdomen of a large or medium-sized dog was
  cut open by a longitudinal incision and the spleen was drawn to
  the exterior. The gastrosplenic vessels were then separated,
  ligated and cut. The temporary haemostasis of the splenic vessels
  was secured by means of two serrefines, after which the pedicle
  of the spleen was cut and the organ extracted. The organ was next
  washed as thoroughly as possible in Locke's solution, by means of
  a cannula placed in the splenic artery of the organ, after which
  it was placed in a jar containing the same solution. The central
  ends of the splenic vessels were prepared for anastomosis. The
  spleen was taken out of the jar, replaced in the abdominal cavity
  and the central ends of the splenic vessels were united to the
  vessels of the organ. Immediately after the circulation had been
  reestablished the spleen became red and it greatly increased in
  size. The nerves were sutured, the organ was suspended in the
  large curve of the stomach by suturing the pedicles of the
  gastrosplenic vessels, and the abdominal wound was closed up.
  This operation was performed in two cases, and both animals
  completely recovered. One of them, which was small in size, was
  examined fifteen months after the operation. The spleen had
  entirely disappeared. This atrophy was doubtless caused by
  thrombosis of the splenic artery, which was very small. In the
  second case the animal was a large dog and the splenic vessels
  were of proper dimensions. The anatomical result was examined
  twenty-one months after the operation. Both the spleen and its
  vessels were normal. The sutures were almost invisible and their
  exact location could only be detected after a close examination
  had been made of the internal wall of the vessels.</p>

  <p>The largest number of experiments were
  performed on the kidney. These can be divided into two classes -
  autoplastic transplantations and homoplastic transplantations.
  The first autoplastic transplantation of a kidney was performed
  by Ullmann in 1902. He took out a dog's kidney and transplanted
  it into the neck, suturing the blood-vessels by means of Payr
  tubes. During the same year I similarly undertook two autoplastic
  transplantations of a dog's kidney, but in each case septic
  complications arose. Similar experiments were also conducted by
  de Castello, Karl Beck and Floresco. In 1905, with the help of
  Guthrie, I succeeded for the first time in witnessing the
  functioning of a kidney that had been transplanted into the neck.
  We also succeeded in performing the first homoplastic
  transplantation of the kidney, which consisted in grafting both
  kidneys of one dog "en masse" on to another dog. The majority of
  the subsequent operations were conducted at the Rockefeller
  Institute, where I was able to make a systematic study of the
  results of replantation and transplantation of the kidney. The
  operation of replanting the kidney was performed principally on
  dogs. After a few experiments it was found that the only way of
  enabling the kidney to carry on its normal function was to
  replace it in its proper position in the lumbar region. This
  operation consisted in removing one of the kidneys of a dog and
  of grafting it anew in the lumbar egion. The other kidney was
  removed during the same operation or fifteen days later. The
  technique of this operation, when performed on medium-sized dogs,
  was comparatively simple. The abdominal cavity was opened by
  means of a transverse incision, then the kidney with its
  peritoneum was extirpated, together with its cellulo-adipose
  atmosphere and its blood-vessels. By means of a cannula
  introduced into the renal aorta the organ was then perfused by
  Ringer's solution, whereupon it became whitish-yellow in color
  and a pale liquid escaped from the renal vein. Then the kidney
  was enveloped in a silk veil saturated with Vaseline and placed
  upon a table, while the central ends of the vessels were prepared
  for the anastomosis. After this the kidney was replaced in the
  abdominal cavity in its normal position and the arterial and
  venous ends were immediately sutured circularly. No suture of the
  nerves was made. After this, the serrefines, which served to
  secure the temporary haemostasis, were removed and the
  circulation was reestablished, after having been interrupted for
  50 or 60 minutes more or less. The artery at once began to beat,
  the kidney became filled with blood, first blue then red, after
  which it resumed its normal size. After half an hour or an hour
  its colour had become the same as that of the other kidney. The
  phenomena of vasodilatation, which resulted after the
  transplantation of limbs usually failed to appear in he case of
  transplanted kidneys. The ureter was sutured circularly, after
  which the kidney was fixed in its normal position by means of a
  suture of the peritoneum. These anastomoses were performed with
  very fine thread, the result of which was that the traces of the
  operation had almost completely disappeared in a few months'
  time. In some cases the other kidney was removed immediately, in
  other cases fifteen days afterwards; in others again, it was left
  intact, so that after several months a comparative study could be
  made of the anatomy of the replanted and of the normal kidney. A
  dozen of these operations were performed, and in every case the
  animals recovered. After the animals had undergone a double
  nephrectomy, their general health remained normal until some
  ureteral complication arose. In the first experiments the
  anastomosis of the ureter produced stenosis and the animals died
  after a few weeks or months, showing lesions of hydronephrosis.
  The technique of the ureteral anastomosis was then modified and
  all the animals experimented on since have retained their health.
  The urine was normal and contained no albumen. The kidneys were
  examined after several months and their histological condition
  was always found to be normal. Ten months after the replantation
  of a kidney both the normal and the replanted organs were
  examined. They looked identical, and in the histological
  examination it was impossible to distinguish the normal kidney
  from the replanted one. The caliber of the renal artery and vein
  had not changed at the point of the anastomoses, which were
  hardly discernible. These results may safely be considered
  permanent. A female dog, upon which a double nephrectomy and the
  replantation of one kidney had been performed, continued to live
  in perfect health for two years and a half, at the end of which
  time she died of a disease unconnected with the operation. The
  replanted kidney was normal. These experiments thus served to
  show that the extirpation of a kidney, its perfusion in Locke's
  solution, the complete interruption of the circulation for a
  period of 50 minutes and the subsequent suturing of its vessels
  and of its ureter did not occasion any interference with its
  functions, even after a considerable interval of time. It was
  thus shown that from a purely surgical point of view the grafting
  of an organ is possible.</p>

  <p>In other series of experiments I examined
  the influence exercised by a transplanted kidney upon its host.
  The kidneys of dogs and cats were removed and replaced in the
  abdomen, not of the same animal, but of another animal of the
  same species. I used the same technique as that just described.
  One of the kidneys of a dog was removed and transplanted on to
  another dog. Seven experiments were conducted. During the first
  week more or less the animals remained in good health and the
  urine contained no albumen. During the second week a little
  albumen was found in the urine. Towards the twentieth day it was
  noticed that the kidney had slightly increased in volume. Then
  the quantity of albumen augmented more and more and in certain
  cases some haematuria even was observed. The animals,
  notwithstanding, remained in good health, for they had retained
  one normal kidney alongside the transplanted kidney.. After six
  months all the animals operated upon showed albumen in their
  urine. The quantity of albumen progressively diminished and the
  urine became normal. The anatomical examination performed a year
  or two after the operation showed that the transplanted kidneys
  had become completely atrophied.</p>

  <p>The interactions of the host and of its new
  organs was further studied by means of the transplantation "en
  masse" of kidneys, these experiments being conducted on cats. The
  transplantation in mass of the kidneys consisted of extirpating
  from a first animal both kidneys, their vessels and the
  corresponding segments of the aorta and vena cava, their nerves
  and nervous ganglia, their ureters and the corresponding part of
  the bladder; of placing this anatomic specimen in the abdominal
  cavity of a second animal whose normal kidneys had been
  previously resected and the aorta and vena cava cut transversely;
  and also of suturing the vascular segments between the ends of
  the aorta and vena cava, and of grafting the flap of the bladder
  on to the bladder of the host. In every case the reestablishment
  of the renal functions was observed. The secretion of urine began
  as soon as the arterial circulation was reestablished. In several
  cases clear urine flowed from the ureters while the flap of the
  bladder was being grafted on to the host. Oftener no urine was
  seen flowing from the ureters immediately after completion of the
  operation, but the secretion always began during the first
  twenty-four hours. In all the experiments the urinary secretion
  went on as long as the animal lived. Every cat urinated
  abundantly every day, but there arose in the animals sooner or
  later some complication, which modified in some measure the renal
  functions. The color of the urine was generally yellow, and often
  less dark than the normal urine of the cat. Its reaction was
  acid. Its quantity for the twenty-four hours varied from 120 to
  160 cc, but, exceptionally, was as little as 25 and even 15 cc,
  though in another case, as much as 215 or 255 cc for the
  twenty-four hours. In this last case there was congestion of the
  kidneys produced by venous compression. The density was very far
  from constant; generally it varied between 1.018 and 1.030, going
  sometimes as high as 1.035 and 1.050. Among the abnormal
  constituents of the urine, albumen only has been looked for. In
  some cases there was a little albumen during the first days,
  ranging from 0.50 to 0.25 per 1,000 cc. In other cases the
  albumen disappeared about one week after the operation.</p>

  <p>The general condition of the animal can, in
  some measure, be said to indicate the perfection of the urinary
  excretion. In one case, the animal was in apparently normal
  condition four days after the operation. She walked about the
  room, played, and ate a great deal of raw meat, and her condition
  remained excellent for several weeks. Twenty days after the
  operation she was in good health, had glossy hair, was very fat,
  ate all kinds of food with a good appetite, and urinated
  normally. There was, however, albumen in the urine, and slow and
  progressive enlargement of the kidneys took place, which showed
  that she was not in an entirely normal condition. The animal
  remained in excellent health until the twenty-ninth day after the
  operation. Then gastro-intestinal symptoms appeared and death
  occurred on the thirty-first day after the operation. Some of the
  animals were able to live in an excellent condition of health for
  15 or 25 days and more after a double nephrectomy had been
  performed and they excreted every 24 hours from 120 to 160 cc of
  urine through their new kidneys. Nevertheless, all the animals
  died less than 40 days after the operation. The histological
  examination of the transplanted kidneys showed that the organs
  presented some lesions, very slight in some cases and more marked
  in others. The lesions were of diffuse nephritis. It is very
  probable that in the transplantation of the kidneys, as in the
  transplantation of the limbs, a reaction of the organism against
  the new organ takes place after a few days. The new organ may
  have a marked influence on the general condition of its host. In
  one experiment, the animal was a female cat which lived in the
  laboratory for several months. She was in excellent condition
  when she was operated on and recovered very quickly from the
  operation. Her life went on just the same as before. The kidneys
  were movable and small. She looked in excellent health and lived
  like any ordinary cat. On the eighteenth day after the
  transplantation albumen appeared in the urine and a direct
  examination of the kidneys was made to ascertain the cause. The
  general condition was little affected by the operation and the
  albumen disappeared almost completely. On the thirty-fifth day
  the animal was very weak and emaciated. She died on the
  thirty-sixth day. The autopsy showed that the whole arterial
  system was calcified. By exercising slight pressure the carotid
  artery or the aorta could be broken like a piece of glass tubing;
  but the renal arteries and the transplanted aortic segment were
  normal. The histological examination of the kidneys showed that
  they had undergone very slight morphological changes and that
  they were almost normal. This observation demonstrated that a
  change of organs may produce very marked modifications in the
  organism. The interactions of the organ and of its host have not
  been sufficiently studied thus far. In the course of these
  experiments the technique of transplantation was developed and
  their surgical study is now completed. Hereafter it will be
  necessary to investigate the reciprocal influences of an organism
  and of its new organ, and to ascertain under what conditions an
  organ taken from one individual can adapt itself to another
  individual.</p>

  <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
  It is for the above-described experiments that the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1912/carrel-lecture.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Caroline Institute</a> has
  honored me by conferring upon me the Nobel Prize. Many of these
  experiments were performed more than six years ago and have been
  applied in human surgery. The technique by means of which the
  blood-vessels are anastomosed or transplanted could be used with
  complete success and absolute safety on human beings. It has been
  shown to be possible, in cases of surgical and accidental wounds,
  to suture the humeral and femoral arteries, the common carotid,
  and even the abdominal aorta and other vessels. In cases of
  aneurisms several surgeons have been able to reestablish the
  continuity of the artery by the transplantation of a segment of
  vein. The principles found out in the course of the experiments
  will make possible all kinds of operations on the blood-vessels
  of human beings. In his admirable method for the transfusion of
  the blood Crile first used suture for the anastomosis of the
  blood-vessels. Although the suture is difficult on very small
  vessels, it has, nevertheless, been used with success in the
  transfusion of the blood in infants. The study of the circulation
  of the blood through metallic tubes has led to a simpler
  technique, which has been used by Dr. Tuffier and which will
  increase the efficiency of Crile's method. It is probable that
  many other practical applications will be found, since the
  experimental studies have definitely demonstrated that operations
  on blood-vessels, and transplantation of the same, can be made
  without danger.</p>

  <p>It has further been demonstrated that
  autoplastic transplantation of organs like the kidney, for
  example, is always successful; but this fact is of itself of
  little practical interest. However, a limb which has been
  accidentally severed from the body, as for instance happens with
  a circular saw, etc. might easily be replanted on its owner. But
  it is not yet known whether surgeons will ever be able to perform
  a homoplastic transplantation with permanent success. Before this
  is accomplished it will be necessary to discover a means of
  recognizing the individuals, if such exist, between whom organs
  can be interchanged with impunity. Thus, while the problem of the
  transplantation of organs has been solved from a surgical point
  of view, we see that this by no means suffices to render such
  operations of definite surgical practicability, and it will only
  be through a more fundamental study of the biological
  relationships existing between living tissues that the problems
  involved will come to be solved and thereby render possible the
  benefits to humanity which we hope to see accomplished in the
