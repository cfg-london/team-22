  <h1>Lester Bowles Pearson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pearson.jpg" class="bio-img">For four
  decades <b>Lester Bowles Pearson</b> (April 23, 1897-1972) has
  been noted for his diplomatic sensitivity, his political acumen,
  and his personal popularity. He is affectionately called
  &laquo;Mike&raquo;, a nickname given to him by his flying
  instructor in World War I, who discarded &laquo;Lester&raquo; as
  being insufficiently bellicose.<br>
  <br>
  Born in Toronto of Irish stock on both sides of his family, he
  received a balanced education in politics, learning the
  conservative position from his father, a Methodist minister, and
  the liberal from his mother. Pearson entered Victoria
  College at the University of Toronto in 1913 at the age of sixteen.
  Too young to enlist as a private when Canada declared war in
  1914, he volunteered to serve with a hospital unit sponsored by
  the University. After two years in England, Egypt, and Greece, he
  was commissioned and transferred eventually to the Royal Flying
  Corps, but, sustaining some injuries from two accidents, one of
  them a plane crash, he was invalided home. He served as a
  training instructor for the rest of the war, meanwhile continuing
  his studies at the University. He received his degree in 1919 and
  then worked for two years for Armour and Company, a meat
  processing firm; years later he said, with the wit for which he
  is renowned, that the Russians were claiming he had once worked
  for an armament manufacturer.<br>
  <br>
  Returning to academic life, Pearson won a two-year fellowship and
  enrolled at Oxford
  University. There he excelled not only in his chosen field of
  history where he received the bachelor and master degrees, but
  also in athletics where he won his blues in lacrosse and ice
  hockey.<br>
  <br>
  In 1924 Pearson joined the staff of the History Department of the
  University of Toronto, leaving it and academic life in 1928 to
  accept a position as first secretary in the Canadian Department
  of External Affairs. In this post until 1935, Pearson received an
  education in domestic economic affairs while &laquo;on loan&raquo;;
  in 1931 as secretary to a commission on wheat futures and during
  1934-1935 as secretary of a commission investigating commodity
  prices; the same post provided him with an apprenticeship in
  international diplomacy when he participated in the Hague
  Conference on Codification of International Law(1930), the London
  Naval Conference (1930), the Geneva World Disarmament Conference
  (1933-1934), another London Naval Conference (1935), and in
  sessions of the League of Nations (1935).<br>
  <br>
  Pearson moved forward rapidly. From 1935 to 1941 he served in the
  office of the High Commissioner for Canada in London; in May,
  1941, he was appointed assistant undersecretary of state for
  External Affairs at Ottawa; in June, 1942, named
  minister-counselor at the Canadian Legation in Washington; in
  July, 1944, promoted to the rank of minister plenipotentiary and
  in January, 1945, to the rank of ambassador. During his
  Washington stay, Pearson participated in the establishment of the
  United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)
  in 1943 and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
  (FAO) 1943-1945; in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference on
  preliminary discussion for an organization of united nations
  (1944); and in the San Francisco Conference on the establishment
  of the UN
  (1945).<br>
  <br>
  Pearson took over the post of undersecretary of state for
  External Affairs in the fall of 1946, but gave it up two years
  later for the possibility of action in a larger arena. In that
  year, Louis S. St. Laurent, the secretary of state, became
  prime minister of a Liberal government, replacing his retiring
  leader, Mackenzie King. Pearson, having conducted a
  successful campaign for a seat in the Commons to represent the
  Algoma East riding of Ontario, was given the External Affairs
  portfolio, holding it for nine years until the advent of John
  Diefenbaker's Conservative government.<br>
  <br>
  Pearson drafted the speech in which Prime Minister St. Laurent
  proposed the establishment of the North Atlantic
  Treaty Organization (NATO), signed the enabling treaty in
  1949, headed the Canadian delegation to NATO until 1957, and
  functioned as chairman of the NATO Council in 1951-1952. Pearson
  also headed the Canadian delegation to the UN from 1946 to 1956,
  being elected to the presidency of the Seventh Session of the
  General Assembly in 1952-1953. As chairman of the General
  Assembly's Special Committee on Palestine, he laid the groundwork
  for the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. In the Suez
  crisis of 1956, when the United Kingdom, France, and Israel
  invaded Egyptian territory, Pearson proposed and sponsored the
  resolution which created a United Nations Emergency Force to
  police that area, thus permitting the invading nations to
  withdraw with a minimum loss of face.<br>
  <br>
  When the Liberals were defeated in the elections of 1957, Pearson
  relinquished his cabinet post but, accepting that of leader of
  the Opposition, began to rebuild the party. Six years later, when
  the Conservative government lost the confidence of the
  electorate, especially on the issues raised by the Cuban
  confrontations between the United States and Russia, and when
  Pearson, after a careful review of his philosophical position on
  national defence, announced his willingness to accept nuclear
  warheads from the United States, the Liberal Party was voted
  enough strength to establish a government with Pearson as prime
  minister.<br>
  <br>
  In control for five years, Pearson pursued a bipartisan foreign
  policy based on a philosophy of internationalism. In domestic
  policy he implemented programs long discussed but never adopted;
  among them, in the field of social legislation: provisions for
  old age pensions, medical care, and a generalized &laquo;war on
  poverty&raquo;; in education: governmental assistance for higher
  education and technical and vocational education; in governmental
  operations: redistribution of electoral districts and reformation
  of legislative procedures. The most acrimonious debate of his
  half-decade in office centered on legislation to create a new
  flag for Canada. This legislation became the battlefield of the
  Conservatives, who wanted some portion of the design to recognize
  the traditions of the past, versus the Liberals, who wanted to
  eliminate historical symbols. The Liberals won and the new flag
  was raised on February 15, 1965.<br>
  <br>
  Pearson retired from the leadership of his party in the spring of
  1968 and died in 1972.</p>
