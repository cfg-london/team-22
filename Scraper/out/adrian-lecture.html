  <h2>The Activity of the Nerve Fibres</h2>

  <p>The sense organs respond to certain changes
  in their environment by sending messages or signals to the
  central nervous system. The signals travel rapidly over the long
  threads of protoplasm which form the sensory nerve fibres, and
  fresh signals are sent out by the motor fibres to arouse
  contraction in the appropriate muscles. What kind of signals are
  these, and how are they elaborated in the same organs and nerve
  cells? The first part of this question would have been answered
  correctly by most physiologists many years ago, but now it can be
  answered in much greater detail. It can be answered because of a
  recent improvement in electrical technique. The nerves do their
  work economically, without visible change and with the smallest
  expenditure of energy. The signals which they transmit can only
  be detected as changes of electrical potential, and these changes
  are very small and of very brief duration. It is little wonder
  therefore that progress in this branch of physiology has always
  been governed by the progress of physical technique and that the
  advent of the triode valve amplifier has opened up new lines in
  this, as in so many other fields of research.</p>

  <p>I shall deal mainly with some of the
  results which have followed from this new technique, but the
  present state of our knowledge will be made clearer by a brief
  survey of the position as it was twenty years ago when I was a
  student in the Cambridge laboratories.</p>

  <p>In the closing years of the last century
  the improvement of the capillary electrometer had marked a new
  phase. It was already known that some kind of rapid wave, called
  the nerve impulse, could be set up in the nerve by an electric
  stimulus, and there was good reason to suppose that the signals
  normally transmitted were made up of similar impulses. The
  disturbance due to an electric stimulus travelled at much the
  same rate as the natural signals, and it would produce similar
  effects on the muscles or on the central nervous system. It could
  be detected in the nerve by the change of potential which
  accompanied it; in fact Bernstein had already elaborated the
  "membrane hypothesis"which regards the impulse as a wave of
  surface disintegration spreading by reason of the electric
  disturbance which it creates. With the development of the
  capillary electrometer it became possible to make direct and
  accurate records of this electric disturbance. Before long the
  work of Gotch and Burch, Garten, Samojloff, and finally of Keith
  Lucas had given a detailed knowledge of its time relations and of
  its connection with the impulse. It was made clear that the wave
  of activity is invariably accompanied by a change of potential,
  that the activity at any point lasts only for a few thousandths
  of a second, and that it is followed by a refractory state which
  must pass away before another wave of activity can occur. The
  existence of a refractory period in the heart muscle had been
  recognized long before and its discovery in the nerve was of
  fundamental importance. It showed that the nerve fibre, when
  stimulated electrically, could only work in a succession of jerks
  separated by periods of enforced rest, and this was true both for
  the waves of potential change and for the underlying impulse
  which produced them.</p>

  <p>In the same period came Gotch's observation
  that the potential wave in a nerve had an equal duration whether
  it was set up by a strong or a weak stimulus. As it seemed
  unlikely that a feeble and an intense disturbance would last for
  the same time, Gotch suggested that in each nerve fibre the
  disturbance was always of the same intensity, and that a strong
  stimulus set up a larger potential wave merely because it brought
  more fibres into activity. This agreed with the fact that the
  rate of conduction and the length of the refractory period were
  also uninfluenced by the strength of the stimulus. It seemed,
  therefore, that each pulse of activity in a nerve fibre must be
  of constant intensity, involving the entire resources of the
  fibre whatever the strength of the stimulus which set it in
  motion. The fibre was a unit giving always its maximal response,
  behaving like the heart muscle in this respect as well as in that
  of its refractory state. Conclusive proof was lacking, but
  Gotch's work made it likely that the same all-or-nothing
  behaviour might be found in skeletal muscle fibres. Keith Lucas
  recorded the contraction of a band of muscle containing only a
  few fibres and found that with an increasing stimulus the
  contraction increased in sudden steps. The number of steps was
  never greater than the number of fibres in the preparation. It
  was clear, then, that skeletal muscle fibres followed the
  all-or-nothing rule.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned this work of Keith Lucas
  (confirmed later by Pratt) because it was the first direct
  evidence of the ungraded character of the wave of activity in
  excitable tissues other than the heart. It was also the first
  successful attempt to record the behaviour of the units in muscle
  and nerve instead of inferring the behaviour of the units from
  that of the whole aggregate. A few years later I had the great
  good fortune to work with him, to appreciate his technical skill
  and his penetrating thought. I cannot let this occasion pass by
  without recording how much I owe to his inspiration. In my own
  work I have tried to follow the lines which Keith Lucas would
  have developed if he had lived, and I am happy to think that in
  honouring me with the Nobel Prize you have honoured the master as
  well as the pupil.</p>

  <p>After Keith Lucas's work on muscle,
  attempts were made to secure more evidence as to the
  all-or-nothing reaction of the nerve fibre. Verworn and his
  school showed that the strength of the stimulus made no
  difference to the ability of the impulse to pass through a
  narcotized area, and Lucas and I made use of the same method. Its
  value seemed to lie in its offering a means of measuring the
  impulse in terms of its ability to travel, but Kato has since
  pointed out the fallacies which arose from supposing that the
  impulse became progressively smaller as it passed through the
  affected region.</p>

  <p>More direct evidence was lacking, but at
  the end of this period we had good reason to believe that the
  nerve impulse was a brief wave of activity depending in no way on
  the intensity of the stimulus which set it up. We did not know
  for certain that the nervous signalling in the intact animal was
  carried out by means of such impulses, but it seemed highly
  probable - so much that we could elaborate hypotheses to explain
  the working of the central nervous system in terms of the
  interference and reinforcement of trains of impulses.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that the need arose
  for a more sensitive electrical technique. When a nerve trunk is
  stimulated by an electric shock every fibre is thrown into action
  simultaneously and the total potential change in the whole nerve
  is large enough to be recorded directly. But in more normal
  circumstances the nerve fibres work as independent conducting
  units, and simultaneous activity in many fibres is a rare event.
  Potential changes could be detected when there was reason to
  believe that signals were passing, but to analyse these changes
  was a far more difficult problem. Granting that they were caused
  by the passage of impulses of the familiar type, there was little
  or nothing to show how the impulses were spaced. Records of the
  electric changes in contracting muscle seemed to one school to
  imply a very high frequency of discharge in each nerve fibre.
  Others believed that the frequency was lower, but neither side
  could find convincing evidence. To show clearly what kind of
  signals passed from the sense organs to the brain and from the
  brain to the muscles it would have been necessary to record the
  electrical events in the individual nerve fibres. The potentials
  to be dealt with are of the order of a few microvolts lasting for
  a few thousandths of a second. They were quite beyond the reach
  of the instruments available at the time, and other lines of
  evidence had to be followed. These were indirect and, in fact,
  most of them led nowhere.</p>

  <p>The revolution in technique has come about
  not from any increase in the sensitivity of galvanometers and
  electrometers but from the use of the thermionic valve to amplify
  potential changes. The recording instruments used nowadays are
  actually far less sensitive than their predecessors. Since the
  energy available is almost unlimited, any system can be chosen
  which will react rapidly enough and the limiting factor has
  become not the period of the instrument but that of the
  amplifying circuits. There is a lower limit to the sensitivity of
  a valve, but fortunately a change as small as one or two
  microvolts is within the range of useful amplification. Many
  workers have contributed to the introduction of this technique
  into physiology, notably Forbes of Harvard, Gasser of St. Louis,
  who was the first to use very high amplification, and Matthews of
  Cambridge who devised the convenient moving-iron oscillograph
  which is now in common use; to all these my own work is deeply
  indebted.</p>

  <p>Seven years ago it became clear to me that
  a combination of the capillary electrometer with an amplifier
  would permit the recording of far smaller potential changes than
  had been dealt with previously, and might enable us to work on
  the units of the nerve trunk instead of on the aggregate. A
  preliminary survey confirmed this, for it showed that the normal
  activity of sensory and motor fibres was always accompanied by
  potential changes of the familiar type. The problem was then to
  limit the activity to only one or two nerve fibres. In this I was
  happy to have the cooperation of Dr. Zotterman of the Caroline
  Institute. We found that the Sterno-cutaneous muscle of the frog
  could be divided progressively until it contained only one sense
  organ; this could be stimulated by stretching the muscle, and we
  could record the succession of impulses which passed up the
  single sensory nerve fibre.</p>

  <p>A variety of methods now exists for
  studying in this way the activity of individual sensory and motor
  nerve fibres. Many records have been made of the signals which
  they transmit in the normal working of the organism and in every
  case the signals are found to be extremely simple. They consist
  of nerve impulses repeated more or less rapidly, impulses which
  differ in no way from those already studied by the classical
  methods of electro-physiology. This may have seemed no more than
  a proof of what was already obvious, but our records showed
  another point which was more illuminating. To illustrate this we
  may take the discharge produced by stretching a muscle spindle. A
  record of the potential changes in the nerve shows a succession
  of brief diphasic waves, each due to the passage of a single
  impulse along the nerve fibre. The waves are of constant size and
  duration, but they begin at a frequency of about 10 a second, and
  as the extension increases, their frequency rises to 50 a second
  or more. The frequency depends on the extent and on the rapidity
  of the stretch; it depends, that is to say, on the intensity of
  excitation in the sense organ, and in this way the impulse
  message can signal far more than the mere fact that excitation
  has occurred.</p>

  <p>In all the sense organs which give a
  prolonged discharge under constant stimulation the message in the
  nerve fibre is composed of a rhythmic series of impulses of
  varying frequency. Hartline, for instance, has shown that the
  discharge from one of the light-sensitive receptor organs in the
  eye of Limulus is a fairly close copy of that from a frog's
  muscle spindle. With some kinds of sense organ there is a rapid
  adaptation to the stimulus, and the nervous discharge is too
  brief to show a definite rhythm, though it consists as before of
  repeated impulses of unvarying size.</p>

  <p>The nerve fibre is clearly a signalling
  mechanism of limited scope. It can only transmit a succession of
  brief explosive waves, and the message can only be varied by
  changes in the frequency and in the total number of these waves.
  Moreover, the frequency depends on the rate of development of the
  stimulus, as well as on its intensity; also the briefer the
  discharge the less opportunity will there be for signalling by
  change of frequency. But this limitation is really a small
  matter, for in the body the nervous units do not act in isolation
  as they do in our experiments. A sensory stimulus will usually
  affect a number of receptor organs, and its result will depend on
  the composite message in many nerve fibres. A good example of
  this is to be found in the discharge which passes up the nerve
  from the carotid sinus at each heart beat. Bronk and Stella have
  shown that as the blood pressure rises, the impulses in each
  nerve fibre increase in frequency and more and more fibres come
  into action. Since rapid potential changes can be made audible as
  sound waves, a gramophone record will illustrate this, and you
  will be able to hear the two kinds of gradation, the changes in
  frequency in each unit and in the number of units in action.</p>

  <p>The sense organs which are most easily
  investigated in this way are those which react to mechanical
  deformation-tactile endings, muscle spindles and the like. They
  are supplied by the larger nerve fibres in which the potential
  change can be readily detected. But there are many sensory nerve
  fibres which are exceedingly small. The recent work of Erlanger
  and Gasser and of Ranson has made it highly probable that some of
  these fibres are concerned with pain, and this alone makes it
  essential to learn more about their normal activities. For such
  problems our present methods are still scarcely adequate, for in
  the smallest fibres the potential changes are probably too small
  to appear above the random fluctuations due to the operation of
  the thermionic valve. But we may hope that this failure will be
  remedied before long.</p>

  <p>There is another field of sensory
  physiology which seemed at first to offer special difficulties
  but is now more promising. This is the field of the special sense
  organs. With Mrs. Matthews I investigated the activity of the
  vertebrate optic nerve, but although the usual impulse messages
  could-be recorded they gave very little information about the
  working of the receptor organs in the retina. The reason is that
  the retina is a complex nervous structure. The messages in the
  optic nerve fibres have been elaborated by the interaction of
  many nerve cells, even though the stimulus is restricted so as to
  fall on a very small number of rods and cones. We learnt
  something of the processes which take place in groups of nerve
  cells with synaptic connections, but little about the action of
  light as a sensory stimulus. Fortunately this difficulty has been
  overcome by Hartline, who finds that in the eye of Limulus there
  is no evidence of such interaction and no reason to expect it on
  grounds of structure. And since his work is showing what takes
  place in the receptors themselves, the complexities of the
  vertebrate retina become less formidable.</p>

  <p>The messages in the vertebrate optic nerve
  have come not from receptor organs but from nerve cells. They are
  comparable, therefore,- with the messages which are sent from the
  motor nerve cells to the muscles. The grading and coordination of
  muscular activity is a subject which has been so greatly
  illuminated by my friend Sir Charles Sherrington that I mention
  my own work as a very small supplement to his. It has dealt as
  before with the signals which are sent by the individual nerve
  fibres, and its results emphasize the close correspondence
  between the sensory and motor activities of the nervous system.
  The messages which pass down the motor fibres to the muscles
  have, of course, the same limitations as the sensory messages,
  and again we find that the effect is graded by changes in the
  frequency of the impulse discharge and in 'the number of units in
  action. In a contraction of gradually increasing force the nerve
  fibres transmit a succession of impulses beginning at a very low
  frequency (5 to 10 a second) and rising to 40 or 50 a second at
  the height of the contraction; and as the frequency rises in one
  nerve fibre, another will start at a low frequency and then more
  and more, until it becomes impossible to distinguish the
  individual rhythms. The force of contraction varies with the
  impulse frequency, because in a muscle fibre each impulse
  produces a mechanical effect of relatively long duration and the
  successive effects of a series of impulses can be summed to give
  a greater contraction. Thus the result of the intermittent
  message in each nerve fibre is a much less intermittent
  contraction in a group of muscle fibres, and in the whole muscle
  there are so many of these fibre groups working independently
  that the contraction rises and subsides smoothly.</p>

  <p>On the whole it appears that the frequency
  of the impulses varies over a more restricted range in the motor
  than in the sensory discharge, but the two are so closely alike
  that the mechanism of the sense organ and of the motor nerve cell
  must have much in common. They have, of course, the common factor
  of a nerve fibre which can only respond in one way, but the
  likeness goes beyond this. Also the particular frequencies which
  commonly occur are lower than they would be if determined solely
  by the characteristics of the nerve fibre. In quiet breathing,
  for instance, at each expansion of the lungs the sense organs of
  the vagus send up a train of impulses rising to a frequency of
  about 20 a second at the height of inspiration, and
  simultaneously the movement of expansion is being produced by
  trains of motor impulses rising to much the same frequency and
  almost indistinguishable from the discharge in the sensory
  fibres. In fact the motor nerve cells seem to be acting just like
  a collection of sense organs responding to a rhythmic
  stretch.</p>

  <p>Resemblances of this kind show that there
  is an underlying unity of response in the various parts of the
  neurone in spite of their differentiation into axon, dendrites or
  terminal arborizations. They show, too, that a knowledge of the
  mechanism of the sensory end organ might lead us very far in our
  search for the mechanisms of the central nervous system. Here we
  must enter a more speculative region, but there are certain
  pointers to guide us. In the nerve fibre, for instance, a
  rhythmic discharge of impulses may arise from an injured region.
  Electrically such a region behaves as though it were permanently
  instead of momentarily active. It is at a negative potential to
  the rest of the fibre owing to the destruction of the polarized
  surface membrane, and we have fair grounds for supposing that the
  rhythmic discharge is a consequence of this depolarization. A
  closer parallel with the sense organ is afforded by a muscle
  fibre bathed in a solution of NaCl instead of its usual Ringer's
  fluid. Sooner or later such a fibre becomes spontaneously active,
  the activity consisting of a serial discharge of impulses from
  some point. At an earlier stage, however, the activity can be
  started, as with a sense organ, by mechanical deformation, and it
  ceases when the deformation is over. Thus a muscle fibre may
  discharge impulses in response to stretch or touch almost as
  though it had been transformed into a muscle spindle or a touch
  receptor, though naturally it is a far less perfect instrument
  for translating mechanical stress into an impulse message. Here
  again there is reason to suppose that discharge of impulses is
  due to a breakdown in the polarized surface, a breakdown which is
  repaired as soon as the mechanical stress is removed.</p>

  <p>Analogies of this kind suggest that sense
  organs and nerve cells send out impulses because some part of
  their surface has become depolarized. There are certain
  difficulties to be faced before this can be treated as more than
  a crude working hypothesis, but it is one which has important
  consequences. If the regions from which the discharge originates
  remain partly or wholly depolarized as long as they are excited,
  it should be possible to detect potential changes of relatively
  long duration in sense organs and in the motor nerve centres.
  Such changes are well known to occur in the eye, and they have
  been found in the vertebrate brain stem and in the nerve ganglia
  of insects. Unfortunately the structures in which they occur are
  so complex that it is difficult to be sure of their
  interpretation, but at least they suggest the possibility of
  obtaining direct records of the activities of the grey matter. To
  extract much information from such records is likely to be a far
  harder task than it has been in the case of peripheral nerve. In
  the latter our chief concern is to find out what is happening in
  the units, and this turns out to be a fairly simple series of
  events. Within the central nervous system the events in each unit
  are not so important. We are more concerned with the
  inter-actions of large numbers, and our problem is to find the
  way in which such interactions can take place<a href=
