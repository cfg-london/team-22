  <h1>Ahmed Zewail - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="zewail.jpg" class="bio-img">On the banks of the Nile, the Rosetta
  branch, I lived an enjoyable childhood in the City of Disuq,
  which is the home of the famous mosque, Sidi Ibrahim. I was born
  (February 26, 1946) in nearby Damanhur, the "City of Horus", only
  60 km from Alexandria. In retrospect, it is remarkable that my
  childhood origins were flanked by two great places - Rosetta, the
  city where the famous Stone was discovered, and Alexandria, the
  home of ancient learning. The dawn of my memory begins with my
  days, at Disuq's preparatory school. I am the only son in a
  family of three sisters and two loving parents. My father was
  liked and respected by the city community - he was helpful,
  cheerful and very much enjoyed his life. He worked for the
  government and also had his own business. My mother, a
  good-natured, contented person, devoted all her life to her
  children and, in particular, to me. She was central to my "walks
  of life" with her kindness, total devotion and native
  intelligence. Although our immediate family is small, the Zewails
  are well known in Damanhur.</p>

  <p>The family's dream was to see me receive a
  high degree abroad and to return to become a university professor
  - on the door to my study room, a sign was placed reading, "Dr.
  Ahmed," even though I was still far from becoming a doctor. My
  father did live to see that day, but a dear uncle did not. Uncle
  Rizk was special in my boyhood years and I learned much from him
  - an appreciation for critical analyses, an enjoyment of music,
  and of intermingling with the masses and intellectuals alike; he
  was respected for his wisdom, financially well-to-do, and
  self-educated. Culturally, my interests were focused -
  <i>reading, music, some sports and playing backgammon</i>. The
  great singer Um Kulthum (actually named Kawkab Elsharq - a
  superstar of the East) had a major influence on my appreciation
  of music. On the first Thursday of each month we listened to Um
  Kulthum's concert - "waslats" (three songs) - for more than three
  hours. During all of my study years in Egypt, the music of this
  unique figure gave me a special happiness, and her voice was
  often in the background while I was studying mathematics,
  chemistry... etc. After three decades I still have the same
  feeling and passion for her music. In America, the only music I
  have been able to appreciate on this level is classical, and some
  jazz. Reading was and still is my real joy.</p>

  <p>As a boy it was clear that my inclinations
  were toward the physical sciences. Mathematics, mechanics, and
  chemistry were among the fields that gave me a special
  satisfaction. Social sciences were not as attractive because in
  those days much emphasis was placed on memorization of subjects,
  names and the like, and for reasons unknown (to me), my mind kept
  asking "how" and "why". This characteristic has persisted from
  the beginning of my life. In my teens, I recall feeling a thrill
  when I solved a difficult problem in mechanics, for instance,
  considering all of the tricky operational forces of a car going
  uphill or downhill. Even though chemistry required some
  memorization, I was intrigued by the "mathematics of chemistry".
  It provides laboratory phenomena which, as a boy, I wanted to
  reproduce and understand. In my bedroom I constructed a small
  apparatus, out of my mother's oil burner (for making Arabic
  coffee) and a few glass tubes, in order to see how wood is
  transformed into a burning gas and a liquid substance. I still
  remember this vividly, not only for the science, but also for the
  danger of burning down our house! It is not clear why I developed
  this attraction to science at such an early stage.</p>

  <p>After finishing high school, I applied to
  universities. In Egypt, you send your application to a central
  Bureau (Maktab El Tansiq), and according to your grades, you are
  assigned a university, hopefully on your list of choice. In the
  sixties, Engineering, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Science were tops.
  I was admitted to Alexandria University and to the faculty of science.
  Here, luck played a crucial role because I had little to do with
  Maktab El Tansiq's decision, which gave me the career I still
  love most: science. At the time, I did not know the depth of this
  feeling, and, if accepted to another faculty, I probably would
  not have insisted on the faculty of science. But this passion for
  science became evident on the first day I went to the campus in
  Maharem Bek with my uncle - I had tears in my eyes as I felt the
  greatness of the university and the sacredness of its atmosphere.
  My grades throughout the next four years reflected this special
  passion. In the first year, I took four courses, mathematics,
  physics, chemistry, and geology, and my grades were either
  excellent or very good. Similarly, in the second year I scored
  very highly (excellent) in Chemistry and was chosen for a group
  of seven students (called "special chemistry"), an elite science
  group. I graduated with the highest honors - "Distinction with
  First Class Honor" - with above 90% in all areas of chemistry.
  With these scores, i was awarded, as a student, a stipend every
  month of approximately &pound;13, which was close to that of a
  university graduate who made &pound;17 at the time!</p>

  <p>After graduating with the degree of
  Bachelor of Science, I was appointed to a University position as
  a demonstrator ("Moeid"), to carry on research toward a Masters
  and then a Ph.D. degree, and to teach undergraduates at the
  University of Alexandria. This was a tenured position,
  guaranteeing a faculty appointment at the University. In
  teaching, I was successful to the point that, although not yet a
  professor, I gave "professorial lectures" to help students after
  the Professor had given his lecture. Through this experience I
  discovered an affinity and enjoyment of explaining science and
  natural phenomena in the clearest and simplest way. The students
  (500 or more) enriched this sense with the appreciation they
  expressed. At the age of 21, as a Moeid, I believed that behind
  every universal phenomenon there must be beauty and simplicity in
  its description. This belief remains true today.</p>

  <p>On the research side, I finished the
  requirements for a Masters in Science in about eight months. The
  tool was spectroscopy, and I was excited about developing an
  understanding of how and why the spectra of certain molecules
  change with solvents. This is an old subject, but to me it
  involved a new level of understanding that was quite modern in
  our department. My research advisors were three: The head of the
  inorganic section, Professor Tahany Salem and Professors Rafaat
  Issa and Samir El Ezaby, with whom I worked most closely; they
  suggested the research problem to me, and this research resulted
  in several publications. I was ready to think about my Ph.D.
  research (called "research point") after one year of being a
  Moeid. Professors El Ezaby (a graduate of Utah) and Yehia El
  Tantawy (a graduate of Penn) encouraged me to go abroad to
  complete my Ph.D. work. All the odds were against my going to
  America. First, I did not have the connections abroad. Second,
  the 1967 war had just ended and American stocks in Egypt were at
  their lowest value, so study missions were only sent to the USSR
  or Eastern European countries. I had to obtain a scholarship
  directly from an American University. After corresponding with a
  dozen universities, the University of Pennsylvania and a few others offered
  me scholarships, providing the tuition and paying a monthly
  stipend (some $300). There were still further obstacles against
  travel to America ("Safer to America"). It took enormous energy
  to pass the regulatory and bureaucratic barriers.</p>

  <p>Arriving in the States, I had the feeling
  of being thrown into an ocean. The ocean was full of knowledge,
  culture, and opportunities, and the choice was clear: I could
  either learn to swim or sink. The culture was foreign, the
  language was difficult, but my hopes were high. I did not speak
  or write English fluently, and I did not know much about western
  culture in general, or American culture in particular. I remember
  a "cultural incident" that opened my eyes to the new traditions I
  was experiencing right after settling in Philadelphia. In Egypt,
  as boys, we used to kid each other by saying "I'll kill you", and
  good friends often said such phrases jokingly. I became friends
  with a sympathetic American graduate student, and, at one point,
  jokingly said "I'll kill you". I immediately noticed his reserve
  and coolness, perhaps worrying that a fellow from the Middle East
  might actually do it!</p>

  <p>My presence - as the Egyptian at Penn - was
  starting to be felt by the professors and students as my scores
  were high, and I also began a successful course of research. I
  owe much to my research advisor, Professor Robin Hochstrasser,
  who was, and still is, a committed scientist and educator. The
  diverse research problems I worked on, and the collaborations
  with many able scientists, were both enjoyable and profitable. My
  publication list was increasing, but just as importantly, I was
  learning new things literally every day - in chemistry, in
  physics and in other fields. The atmosphere at the Laboratory for
  Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) was most
  stimulating and I was enthusiastic about researching in areas
  that crossed the disciplines of physics and chemistry (sometimes
  too enthusiastic!). My courses were enjoyable too; I still recall
  the series 501, 502, 503 and the physics courses I took with the
  Nobel Laureate, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1972/index.html">Bob
  Schrieffer</a>. I was working almost "day and night," and doing
  several projects at the same time: The Stark effect of simple
  molecules; the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">Zeeman</a> effect of solids
  like NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and benzene; the optical
  detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR); double resonance
  techniques, etc. Now, thinking about it, I cannot imagine doing
  all of this again, but of course then I was "young and
  innocent".</p>

  <p>The research for my Ph.D. and the
  requirements for a degree were essentially completed by 1973,
  when another war erupted in the Middle East. I had strong
  feelings about returning to Egypt to be a University Professor,
  even though at the beginning of my years in America my memories
  of the frustrating bureaucracy encountered at the time of my
  departure were still vivid. With time, things change, and I
  recollected all the wonderful years of my childhood and the
  opportunities Egypt had provided to me. Returning was important
  to me, but I also knew that Egypt would not be able to provide
  the scientific atmosphere I had enjoyed in the U.S. A few more
  years in America would give me and my family two opportunities:
  First, I could think about another area of research in a
  different place (while learning to be professorial!). Second, my
  salary would be higher than that of a graduate student, and we
  could then buy a big American car that would be so impressive for
  the new Professor at Alexandria University! I applied for five
  positions, three in the U.S., one in Germany and one in Holland,
  and all of them with world-renowned professors. I received five
  offers and decided on Berkeley.</p>

  <p>Early in 1974 we went to Berkeley, excited
  by the new opportunities. Culturally, moving from Philadelphia to
  Berkeley was almost as much of a shock as the transition from
  Alexandria to Philadelphia - Berkeley was a new world! I saw
  Telegraph Avenue for the first time, and this was sufficient to
  indicate the difference. I also met many graduate students whose
  language and behavior I had never seen before, neither in
  Alexandria, nor in Philadelphia. I interacted well with
  essentially everybody, and in some cases I guided some graduate
  students. But I also learned from members of the group. The
  obstacles did not seem as high as they had when I came to the
  University of Pennsylvania because culturally and scientifically
  I was better equipped. Berkeley was a great place for science -
  the BIG science. In the laboratory, my aim was to utilize the
  expertise I had gained from my Ph.D. work on the spectroscopy of
  pairs of molecules, called dimers, and to measure their coherence
  with the new tools available at Berkeley. Professor Charles
  Harris was traveling to Holland for an extensive stay, but when
  he returned to Berkeley we enjoyed discussing science at late
  hours! His ideas were broad and numerous, and in some cases went
  beyond the scientific language I was familiar with. Nevertheless,
  my general direction was established. I immediately saw the
  importance of the concept of coherence. I decided to tackle the
  problem, and, in a rather short time, acquired a rigorous
  theoretical foundation which was new to me. I believe that this
  transition proved vital in subsequent years of my research.</p>

  <p>I wrote two papers with Charles, one
  theoretical and the other experimental. They were published in
  <i>Physical Review</i>. These papers were followed by other work,
  and I extended the concept of coherence to multidimensional
  systems, publishing my first independently authored paper while
  at Berkeley. In collaboration with other graduate students, I
  also published papers on energy transfer in solids. I enjoyed my
  interactions with the students and professors, and at Berkeley's
  popular and well-attended physical chemistry seminars. Charles
  decided to offer me the IBM Fellowship that was only given to a
  few in the department. He strongly felt that I should get a job
  at one of the top universities in America, or at least have the
  experience of going to the interviews; I am grateful for his
  belief in me. I only applied to a few places and thought I had no
  chance at these top universities. During the process, I contacted
  Egypt, and I also considered the American University in Beirut
  (AUB). Although I visited some places, nothing was finalized, and
  I was preparing myself for the return. Meanwhile, I was busy and
  excited about the new research I was doing. Charles decided to
  build a picosecond laser, and two of us in the group were
  involved in this hard and "non-profitable" direction of research
  (!); I learned a great deal about the principles of lasers and
  their physics.</p>

  <p>During this period, many of the top
  universities announced new positions, and Charles asked me to
  apply. I decided to send applications to nearly a dozen places
  and, at the end, after interviews and enjoyable visits, I was
  offered an Assistant Professorship at many, including Harvard, 
  Caltech, Chicago, Rice, and Northwestern. My
  interview at Caltech had gone well, despite the experience of an
  exhausting two days, visiting each half hour with a different
  faculty member in chemistry and chemical engineering. The visit
  was exciting, surprising and memorable. The talks went well and I
  even received some undeserved praise for style. At one point, I
  was speaking about what is known as the FVH, picture of
  coherence, where F stands for <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a>, the famous
  Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate. I went to the board to
  write the name and all of a sudden I was stuck on the spelling.
  Half way through, I turned to the audience and said, "you know
  how to spell Feynman". A big laugh erupted, and the audience
  thought I was joking - I wasn't! After receiving several offers,
  the time had come to make up my mind, but I had not yet heard
  from Caltech. I called the Head of the Search Committee, now a
  colleague of mine, and he was lukewarm, encouraging me to accept
  other offers. However, shortly after this, I was contacted by
  Caltech with a very attractive offer, asking me to visit with my
  family. We received the red carpet treatment, and that visit did
  cost Caltech! I never regretted the decision of accepting the
  Caltech offer.</p>

  <p>My science family came from all over the
  world, and members were of varied backgrounds, cultures, and
  abilities. The diversity in this "small world" I worked in daily
  provided the most stimulating environment, with many challenges
  and much optimism. Over the years, my research group has had
  close to 150 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
  visiting associates. Many of them are now in leading academic,
  industrial and governmental positions. Working with such minds in
  a village of science has been the most rewarding experience -
  Caltech was the right place for me.</p>

  <p>My biological children were all "made in
  America". I have two daughters, Maha, a Ph.D. student at the
  University of
  Texas, Austin, and Amani, a junior at Berkeley, both of whom
  I am very proud. I met Dema, my wife, by a surprising chance, a
  fairy tale. In 1988 it was announced that I was a winner of the
  King Faisal International Prize. In March of 1989, I went to
  receive the award from Saudi Arabia, and there I met Dema; her
  father was receiving the same prize in literature. We met in
  March, got engaged in July and married in September, all of the
  same year, 1989. Dema has her M.D. from Damascus University, 
  and completed a Master's degree
  in Public Health at UCLA. We have two young sons, Nabeel and Hani, and
  both bring joy and excitement to our life. Dema is a wonderful
  mother, and is my friend and confidante.</p>

  <p>The journey from Egypt to America has been
  full of surprises. As a Moeid, I was unaware of the Nobel Prize
  in the way I now see its impact in the West. We used to gather
  around the TV or read in the newspaper about the recognition of
  famous Egyptian scientists and writers by the President, and
  these moments gave me and my friends a real thrill - maybe one
  day we would be in this position ourselves for achievements in
  science or literature. Some decades later, when President Mubarak
  bestowed on me the Order of Merit, first class, and the Grand
  Collar of the Nile ("Kiladate El Niel"), the highest State honor,
  it brought these emotional boyhood days back to my memory. I
  never expected that my portrait, next to the pyramids, would be
  on a postage stamp or that the school I went to as a boy and the
  road to Rosetta would be named after me. Certainly, as a
  youngster in love with science, I had no dreams about the honor
  of the Nobel Prize.</p>

  <p>Since my arrival at Caltech in 1976, our
  contributions have been recognized by countries around the world.
  Among the awards and honors are:</p>
