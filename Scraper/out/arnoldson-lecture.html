  <h2>World Referendum</h2>

  <p>Like many such legends in many nations, an
  old Nordic saga tells of a time when the streets were paved with
  gold without tempting anyone to sin, a time when human beings
  were good and their customs and laws mild, inspired by the spirit
  of wisdom. The whole world lived a life of happiness. This
  paradise was buried in a mire of conflict and degraded values.
  However, the hope of finding it again is not yet lost. The nature
  of man provides a guarantee of this. Man's nature is
  fundamentally good, or perhaps it is neither good nor evil. In
  any case, man is something to work on. We must hold fast to this
fact - man is something to work on.</p>

  <p>The age of our race can perhaps be reckoned
  in millions of years. So it is probably true that the human brain
  has now reached a state of high development and that after an
  immeasurable process of evolution it is now biologically and
  physiologically similar in all peoples and races.</p>

  <p>Accepting this as a scientific fact, one
  necessarily comes to the conclusion that every normal human being
  must be as susceptible to the light of knowledge as he is to the
  light of the sun. It is in his nature to want peace rather than
  war. Education is the only certain road to the final goal of
  peace. And there is no higher goal.</p>

  <p>"In truth," someone replies, "the rule of
  law is higher; and so are personal freedom and national
  independence." But for these, as for all the other good things of
  life, peace is perforce a prerequisite.</p>

  <p>This idea confuses those who lack
  understanding. "Surely", they say, "one has to defend oneself."
  And they add: "National defense can be likened to fire insurance"
  or "Nobody wants his house to stand open to thieves and
  murderers" or "Nobody wants to walk unarmed in the woods,
  surrounded by robbers and brigands." And so on. Seductive
  phrases! For civilized peoples are not gangs of brigands, and
  their rulers not robber barons.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is not a question of giving
  up one's national independence. We hold on to that which is dear
  to our hearts, but we must see things in their true perspective.
  Without peace there is no freedom, individual or national. War
  and hostilities are a form of slavery. Under such conditions, the
  laws are silent. Without peace there is nothing truly human.
  Peace is harmony. And harmony is the highest ideal of life.</p>

  <p>For a long time this fact has been clear to
  seekers of the lost paradise, those thorn-crowned servants of
  humanity. Unnoticed by the world, their work has persevered
  through the ages, just as, slowly and quietly in a dark crevice
  of the earth, the forming of a brilliant diamond goes on for
  thousands and thousands of years. No sound rises from the silent
  depths while atom fuses with atom and the crystal slowly grows,
  finally to gleam and glitter in a royal crown.</p>

  <p>Thus the concept of peace, mankind's most
  brilliant treasure, has at last been disclosed to the eyes of us
  all. No one now denies its beauty; all extol its worth. But these
  tributes have all too often taken the form of words alone, seldom
  that of actions as well.</p>

  <p>At last, however, it has dawned on many
  people in all countries that militarism lies like a heavy curse
  over the land. Perhaps, though, the reason for this does not lie
  entirely in the unutterable woe of war - woe which defies
  description. Unfortunately we have not yet reached the stage
  where militarism is condemned on these grounds.</p>

  <p>We do not yet consider it beneath ourselves
  to invent and develop tools of destruction. We have not yet been
  seized with a holy wrath against evil, against militarism's
  coarsening influence on our inner selves, an influence which
  darkens our view of life and nurtures that frightened and
  insidious distrust which beguiles us into inflicting on each
  other so much suffering, so much wrong and sorrow.</p>

  <p>Rather, it is with the economic weight of
  the militaristic systems that many people are concerned. It is
  estimated that for each minute of the nineteenth century, 1,350
  Swedish kroner were spent on armaments in Europe. The burden of
  armaments on the great powers between the first and second
  conferences at The Hague - that is to say, in the eight years
  1899-1907 - increased by sixty-nine million pounds sterling. And
  the increase is still continuing. As far as the smaller states
  were concerned, in Sweden for example, the annual military
  expenditure increased from 27.7 million Swedish kroner to 84.3
  million over the years 1888-1908; in other words, it more than
  trebled in two decades. Ample evidence of this increase may be
  obtained; for instance, from the International <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1910/index.html">Peace Bureau</a> in Bern or
  the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1908/arnoldson-lecture.html&object=nobelpeaceprize.org&to=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/" target="_blank">Nobel
  Institute</a> in Oslo.</p>

  <p>The relation between the pressures of
  militarism and the deterioration of social conditions becomes
  more and more apparent. Vast resources are absorbed by
  militarism, without benefit to anyone. If these were set free, we
  could double the harvests of the nourishing earth, harness the
  power of roaring rivers for mills and factories, and open up
  undreamt of opportunities to challenge the finest talents
  possessed by man.</p>

  <p>That something must be done to eliminate
  this evil now seems clear even to those in power in the
  world.</p>

  <p>The Czar of Russia issued a Peace
  Manifesto<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> which led to the
  creation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and
  the President of the United States is encouraging the nations to
  use it<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The aged ruler of
  Austria-Hungary<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> is often
  called the "Emperor of Peace" on account of his character. The
  young Italian monarch<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> has
  created an International Agricultural Institute which he
  maintains with his own private means, and has also offered to pay
  for the marble for the Palace of Peace at The Hague. The British
  head of state<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> is at the
  forefront of an entente policy which seeks to anticipate
  complications leading to hostility. King Edward greeted the World
  Peace Congress in London<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
  with words to the effect that the heads of state could not aim at
  any goal higher than that of fostering a common spirit of
  understanding and warm friendship between nations, such being the
  surest means of realizing the highest ideal of humanity; and he
  further promised that "to achieve this goal would be [his]
  perpetual endeavor". Kaiser Wilhelm<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, in a telegram to the
  Interparliamentary Conference in Berlin<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, said that he took the blessings of
  peace very much to heart, and the Crown Prince echoed these
  words, stating on behalf of his father, that the latter's
  greatest concern was the maintenance of peace, "which is, and
  shall ever be the foundation of all true cultural progress". The
  president of the French Republic<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> finds it natural to continue to
  advocate world peace, and the Japanese sovereign<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> neglects no opportunity to
  convince the world of his love of peace.</p>

  <p>At every suitable opportunity, the heads of
  smaller states express themselves in the same spirit to the world
  press, as also do the responsible ministers in parliament when
  accompanying their heads of state to the more and more frequent
  peace conferences.</p>

  <p>An ever increasing volume of intercourse is
  occurring between the various nations through their
  representatives in science and art, health care and education,
  communications, trade and industry, and all other cultural
  fields. The human feeling of spiritual affinity is the
  fundamental motivation of all these international congresses and
  conferences. This idealistic impulse shared by all peoples is
  leading to real agreements and to laws which are incompatible
  with war and militarism.</p>

  <p>Now, at last, active pacifists from all
  classes of society are receiving considerable assistance from the
  modern labor movement, which participates in the effort to
  forestall war by advocating arbitration and disarmament. At the
  Stuttgart Congress in the spring of 1908, 900 representatives of
  ten million organized workers from all the states of the world
  unanimously accepted a resolution to try to abolish all
  militaristic systems and to prevent all international acts of
  force. Furthermore, at the meeting of the International Socialist
  Bureau in Brussels last autumn, it was unanimously declared that
  one of the main tasks of the labor organizations would be to try
  to avert the danger of war.</p>

  <p>It is thus obvious that in such matters the
  interests of the governments and of the governed are identical.
  This fact receives constant confirmation at the international
  meetings of sovereigns and peoples. The persistence of a state of
  suspense and anxiety in the world must therefore be imputed to
  other interests, which achieve this result through rumors of war
  which appear now and then. It would be much wiser to try to
  expose the meaning of such rumors than to let ourselves be taken
  in by them.</p>

  <p>Nowadays it is probable that no subject of
  international disagreement would lead to war if it were first
  submitted to examination by experts. This procedure is as a rule
  adopted by the responsible governments of states in the case of
  vital international questions. Of course, Europe in particular is
  still divided into certain power groups, but when anything vital
  is at stake, there is immediate cooperation, as seen in Morocco,
  the Balkans, Crete, etc<a href="#footnote11"><sup>.11</sup></a>
  Then too the new Scandinavian treaties are peaceably and
  tranquilly succeeding in providing greater security<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Such an approach is also likely
  to be applicable to colonial policy, despite what the
  "know-it-alls" say about trade wars and the like.</p>

  <p>America poses no threat. She is gathering
  her strength. Washington recently saw the laying of the
  cornerstone of a palace for the Pan-American Bureau, which will
  be a shrine to the idea of a peace uniting the whole of the
  western hemisphere<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Nor is
  there any threat from Japan, which is now reducing her annual
  military expenditure by 360 million Swedish kroner. Warlike
  adventures do not suit the peaceful nature of the Chinese. The
  "Yellow Peril" is probably not all that perilous! The Sultanate
  of Turkey is developing into a great civilized state, a powerful
  center of peace for all of the Moslem world. In addition, South
  Africa constitutes a new peaceful confederation within the
  British Empire<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Many of these far-flung nations are
  graphically united by an "arbitration" map drawn by the French
  Foreign Ministry, on which a red line joins the capitals of those
  thirty-five, or rather thirty-two, states<a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> which voted for a complete plan
  of compulsory arbitration of international disputes at the second
  conference of governments at The Hague in 1907. No less does the
  following resolution<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>,
  which was passed at the same conference, correspond to this
  ideal: "The Second Peace Conference confirms the resolution
  adopted by the Conference of 1899 in regard to the limitation of
  military expenditure; and inasmuch as military expenditure has
  considerably increased in almost every country since that time,
  the conference declares that it is eminently desirable that the
  governments should resume the serious examination of this
  question."</p>

  <p>If the whole of humanity is now weary of
  the burdens of war, something more effective than a mere "serious
  examination" is required if we are to lighten these burdens and
  perhaps finally eradicate them. If this is regarded as
  impossible, it is not so much because of certain technical
  difficulties as it is because we lack strong moral fiber.</p>

  <p>We demand too much of others and too little
  of ourselves. No one wishes to be the first to take the straight
  and narrow path. In addition, there is a tendency to overrate our
  own goodwill and underestimate that of others. "Of course
  <i>we</i> want to live in peace", we say. "But our neighbor and
  the others!" If only we would worry a little less about others
  and a little more about ourselves, ask a little less of others
  and more of ourselves!</p>

  <p>This applies to all nations. It also
  applies first and last to individuals, especially in the context
  of their citizenship. They should each of them carry the
  responsibility for the welfare of their country and for the whole
  of mankind. This, then, is the original idea which I have very
  much at heart, and now is the time and opportunity to proclaim it
  to the world.</p>

  <p>If a present-day prophet were to exhort the
  peoples to peace and common sense, he would speak as one human
  being to others. With the power of the law and the gentleness of
  the Gospel, he would speak thus: "Patriotism is a noble feeling,
  insofar as it approaches that which is purely human, but the very
  reverse the further it is removed therefrom. No interests,
  however great, are higher than those common to the whole of
  mankind. Among them, the foremost is the old commandment, as old
  as the oldest documents of any nation: Thou shalt not kill! You
  are all of one blood. Love one another. People can. Nations can.
  All this is eminently possible because love is as natural as
  national hatred is the most unnatural of all human feelings."</p>

  <p>Inspired by such a spirit, I wish to
  suggest that the peoples of the earth should be exhorted to unite
  in a common aim.</p>

  <p>In all countries an appeal should be issued
  for every adult man and woman to sign the following declaration:
  "If all other nations will abolish their armed forces and be
  content with a joint police force for the whole world, then I,
  the undersigned, wish my own nation to do the same."<a href=
  "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

  <p>This appeal would probably be answered by
  the well-informed elite in all countries, perhaps to a larger
  extent than anyone can now imagine. If this were to happen, a new
  great power would emerge - the united will of the peoples. Then,
  at their next peace conference, the governments would receive
  moral support powerful enough to enable them to agree to an
  effective commencement of general disarmament.</p>

  <p>Much work would be necessary. At first, a
  genuine effort would have to be made to interest as many men and
  women as possible in helping to publicize the plan throughout the
  nations and in many languages, even at a considerable cost in
  time and money.</p>

  <p>It might be unnecessary to wait for a
  resolution to be passed by one of the international peace
  organizations - by an institute, a directorate, a congress, or a
  conference. This might make a simple matter too complicated and
  irksome. It would insure a minimum of delay in beginning the task
  if a well-known man of peace, able to unite belief in the cause
  with financial resources, having no authority other than his own
  as a member of the human race, were to send out a referendum
  accompanied by petition forms for signatures, together with
  administrative directions for their distribution.</p>

  <p>The more simply this could be done, the
  better. The petition forms for signatures should consist of only
  one sheet, bearing a declaration on the front, together with
  columns for names, titles, and addresses, and on the reverse side
  a short and extremely simple explanation of its purpose<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>.18</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lists should be distributed in many
  ways, not the least being as newspaper supplements, and should be
  returned as soon as possible, with the greatest possible number
  of signatures, to the peace association committees of the
  individual countries, through whom the returns could
  systematically be communicated to the International Peace Bureau
  in Bern, as well as to the respective governments at their next
  peace conference.</p>

  <p>Once the principle of this measure is
  clearly grasped and strongly adhered to, incidentals would look
  after themselves. Everyone would answer for himself and hold to
  his word; that is the principle of this worldwide referendum.</p>

  <p>People may object: "We already know that
  all men want to live in peace. There is no need to ascertain this
  fact." If that were true, they should not be dangerous to each
  other. However, since militarism still flourishes, this objection
  must be proved. The answer has to be obtained, not from groups,
  but from individuals; we must not hide behind the backs of
  others, but bravely step forward to confirm our will with our own
  signature.</p>

  <p>People may object: "This is all too easy:"
  But it is very easy, also, to understand the necessity of
  cleanliness, sunshine, and fresh air for our health.
  Nevertheless, it took a very, very long time before this
  understanding became generally accepted practice.</p>

  <p>Thus also, the real meaning of
  Christianity, insofar as it departs in some measure from strict
  reality, creates an eternal source of contention, although in the
  near future it will be clear that its essential message,
  untrammeled by the disputes of theology, is a true religion of
  peace; that this natural and easily comprehensible religion is
  absolutely incompatible with all war and military organization;
  and that it is exemplified, better than by all the sermons in the
  world, by the statue of Christ which two South American peoples
  have erected on top of the mountain separating their countries,
  to proclaim that war between them is now a thing of the past.</p>

  <p>We are not here concerned with a question
  of faith, which so often gives rise to differences and schisms,
  but with one of love, which equalizes and unites. Thus,
  individual religious and social interests must not on any
  condition become involved in this cooperation of all peoples.</p>

  <p>A foreseeable objection is this: "If less
  than half the adult population of a country votes against
  military organization, this will be considered proof of its
  acceptance by the majority." Such a view, however, attributes to
  a mass of people who lack willpower an importance which they do
  not possess. In a case like this it is not the inert majority
  that counts. Even ten percent of the population would represent a
  sizeable expression of opinion. Furthermore, the average man can
  grasp a simple idea easily enough, but if he should be dependent
  on authority even in such a simple matter as this, then he must
  be awakened by the vigilant and by those who have seen the
  light.</p>

  <p>"In any case," some may protest, "this will
  take a long time even in the free countries, not to mention the
  backward ones." It is not, however, proposed that a campaign
  which concerns all civilized peoples should be concluded
  hurriedly. Nor is it the intention to be precipitate, though it
  is important to make the best use of the time available until
  1914 or 1915, when the third peace conference of the governments
  is likely to take place<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A further objection may arise: "In the hard
  struggle for the necessities of life, men in general are not
  conscious of things which go beyond or above their daily cares,
  nor do they have the time to attend to such matters. There are
  far too many who, in their dark and straitened circumstances, are
  never able to look toward bright and wide horizons." True enough,
  and for a long time to come, the old, persistent lamentation
  about the burdens and adversities of life will not be
  silenced.</p>

  <p>But if, in fact, the world is so gloomy, it
  is to be hoped that many of those who complain will, at least
  once in their lives, make a sacrifice for the establishment of a
  better state of affairs in this world, the sacrifice of a minute
  to be occupied in reading and signing a declaration which favors
  taking an axe to the root of the evil. Otherwise, all their
  laments are in vain.</p>

  <p>The last objection may be: "My vote, being
  but a drop in the ocean, means nothing." It does, however, mean
  everything to every responsible human being, for all those who
  are powerless individually gain power beyond measure when they
  are united. Many small rivulets make a great stream, the stream
  becomes a river and the river a great sea, a pacific ocean around
  this world of ours.</p>

  <p>A new power is emerging from the depths and
  slowly spreading over land and water. It is the concept of peace
  of the ancient sagas, enriched by new and immense cultural
  progress. Those who seek after the lost paradise can see it
  shimmering in the sunrise of a new era, presaging the fulfillment
  of the Christian prayer and the heathen saga, presaging the
  kingdom of peace which we pray for in saying "Our Father - Thy
  kingdom come" and which the old inhabitants of the North sensed
  in the happy era of the ancient sagas - when the streets were
  paved with gold which remained untouched and when human beings
  were good, their customs and laws mild and wise.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, to pave the streets with gold
  would be quite unsafe. It is certain, however, that the gold
  which has now been placed in my path shall not rest untouched. It
  gives me the opportunity of devoting more work and more time to
  the idea of the world referendum which I have proposed here. It
  also enables me to serve the cause of peace in yet other ways and
  with even stronger perseverance. So will I try to carry my burden
  of gratitude, and to discharge the mission to which I have been
  called.</p>

  From the Final Act of the Hague Peace Conference of 1907.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote17" id="footnote17"></a>17.
  Immediately following this paragraph, the text of the lecture
  carries a parenthetical paragraph which reads as follows:
  "Arnoldson later suggested the following as an alternative: I,
  the undersigned, desire peace on earth. I want all armed forces
  to be abolished. I want a joint police force to be created, to
  which each nation should contribute according to the size of its
  population. I want that force to be subject to an International
  Supreme Court. I want all states to be in duty bound to refer any
  kind of international controversy to this court, and subject
  themselves to the judgments of the court."</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote18" id="footnote18"></a>18.
  At this point another parenthetical paragraph is inserted in the
  text: "Arnoldson suggests that the reverse side might carry,
  instead, an alternatively worded declaration, together with
  columns for names, titles, and addresses as on the front page.
  The referendum would thus be designed to cover, on the one hand,
  those whose desire, that something be done, is in some way
  conditional, and on the other, those for whom this desire is
  unqualified and who demand the drawing up of a definite
  program."</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote19" id="footnote19"></a>I9.
  Preparations to hold this conference had been started but were
  cancelled with the outbreak of World War I in August, 1914.</p>
