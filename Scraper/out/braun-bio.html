  <h1>Ferdinand Braun - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="braun.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Karl Ferdinand Braun</b> was born on
  June 6, 1850 at Fulda, where he was educated at the local
  "Gymnasium" (grammar school). He studied at the Universities of
  Marburg
  and Berlin and graduated in 1872 with a paper on the oscillations
  of elastic strings. He worked as assistant to Professor Quincke
  at W&uuml;rzburg University and in 1874 accepted a
  teaching appointment to the St. Thomas Gymnasium in Leipzig. Two
  years later he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of
  Theoretical Physics at the University of Marburg, and in 1880 he
  was invited to fill a similar post at Strasbourg
  University. Braun was made Professor of Physics at the
  Technische
  Hochschule in Karlsruhe in 1883 and was finally invited by
  the University of T&uuml;bingen in 1885; one of his
  tasks there was to build a new Physics Institute. Ten years
  later, in 1895, he returned to Strasbourg as Principal of the
  Physics Institute, where he remained, in spite of an invitation
  from Leipzig
  University to succeed G. Wiedemann.</p>

  <p>Braun's first investigations were concerned
  with oscillations of strings and elastic rods, especially with
  regard to the influence of the amplitude and environment of rods
  on their oscillations. Other studies were based on thermodynamic
  principles, such as those on the influence of pressure on the
  solubility of solids.</p>

  <p>His most important works, however, were in
  the field of electricity. He published papers on deviations from
  Ohm's law and on the calculations of the electromotive force of
  reversible galvanic elements from thermal sources. His practical
  experiments led him to invent what is now called Braun's
  electrometer, and also a cathode-ray oscillograph, constructed in
  1897.</p>

  <p>In 1898 he started to occupy himself with
  wireless telegraphy, by attempting to transmit Morse signals
  through water by means of high-frequency currents. Subsequently
  he introduced the closed circuit of oscillation into wireless
  telegraphy, and was one of the first to send electric waves in
  definite directions. In 1902 he succeeded in receiving definitely
  directed messages by means of inclined beam antennae.</p>

  <p>Braun's papers on wireless telegraphy were
  published in 1901 in the form of a brochure under the title
  Drahtlose Telegraphie durch Wasser und Luff (Wireless telegraphy
  through water and air).</p>

  <p>After the outbreak of the First World War,
  Braun was summoned to New York to attend as a witness in a
  lawsuit regarding a patent claim. Owing to his absence from his
  laboratory and due to illness he was unable to carry out further
  scientific work. Braun thus spent the last years of his life
  peacefully in the United States, where he died on April 20,
  1918.</p>
