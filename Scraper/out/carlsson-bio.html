  <h1>Arvid Carlsson - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="carlsson.jpg" class="bio-img">

  I grew up in an academic middle-class
  family. In 1926, when I was 3 years old, my father was appointed
  professor of history at the University of
  Lund, Sweden, and moved there with his family from Uppsala,
  Sweden. My mother had passed a master-of-arts examination and my
  father a Ph.D. degree at the University of
  Uppsala. My mother had a keen interest in research throughout
  her life but gave priority to raising her children and to
  assisting her husband in his research. However, when her husband
  died at the age of 76 she, then 71 years old, started to devote
  herself entirely to her favorite area of research, that is the
  legal status of women in the Middle Ages in Sweden. She published
  a couple of books and a number of articles on this subject in
  Swedish, which rendered her an honorary Ph.D. degree at the
  University of Uppsala several years later.</p>

  <p>We were four children in the family, and we
  were all to take academic degrees at different levels. The family
  had a strong orientation toward humanities. However, in contrast
  to my elder brother and sister, who also chose humanities, I
  decided to study medicine, and my 7 years younger brother later
  joined me. The reason for this deviating behavior of mine was
  partly the kind of opposition often occurring in youngsters,
  partly some vague idea of science being more "useful than
  arts.</p>

  <p>My childhood and youth were characterized
  by a happy life in a stable environment with loving and
  supportive parents. I was probably just about average in terms of
  disobedience and escapades. At school, which I found fairly
  endurable, I had very good marks without too much effort.</p>

  <p>At the age of 16, in June 1939, I took a
  hitch-hiking trip to Germany for two weeks together with a boy of
  the same age. This was to be my only trip outside the Nordic
  countries until the age of 32. It occurred only two and a half
  months before the outbreak of World War II. We had then the
  opportunity to talk to many Germans of varying social standing.
  Most of them felt convinced that a war would begin as soon as the
  harvest was done, and they seemed to accept that, though
  reluctantly. In Berlin I spent one night in a hospits run by an
  Evangelic foundation and inhabitated by obviously very poor
  people. I especially remember several Jews with long beards and
  sad faces, mumbling while reading a heavy book that could have
  been the Talmud, apparently searching for an answer and a
  solution in a desperate situation. Otherwise I was not aware of
  the terrible actions against Jews that were probably ongoing
  around me.</p>

  <p>My medical studies started in 1941 and went
  on smoothly, apart from several interruptions due to altogether a
  couple of years of military service. Lund was, and still is, a
  fairly typical small university town somewhat reminiscent of
  Oxford. The quality of research and teaching, including that of
  the medical school, was good. Among the professors of that school
  a couple of prominent names may be mentioned. Torsten Thunberg,
  professor of physiology, had discovered "the tissue respiration",
  i.e. the dehydrogenases, and had developed a method to measure
  their activity. His work was simultaneous but independent of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1931/index.html">Warburg</a>'s
  research on the same subject in Berlin. Warburg, but not
  Thunberg, was awarded the Nobel Prize. Ernest Overton, professor
  of pharmacology, was famous for his revolutionary theories
  regarding the structure and lipid properties of the cell membrane
  and on the mechanism underlying narcosis. However, Overton had
  died before I started my medical studies, and Thunberg was
  already emeritus at that time. Sadly Overton became mentally ill
  in his later life; he was said to propose himself repeatedly for
  the Nobel Prize, which he like Thunberg certainly deserved but
  did not get. Among the most innovative of my contemporaries at
  the medical school of the University of Lund was Nils Alwall,
  although his seminal contributions were not generally recognized
  at that time. Alwall is one of the pioneers in the development of
  the "artificial kidney". He successfully ran a department of
  kidney dialysis in the Medical University Clinic. The
  internationally renowned Gambro Company developed out of this
  work. It is still quite successful in kidney dialysis and other
  biomedical technology. Another major innovation created at the
  University of Lund at this time was the ultrasonar cardiography,
  developed by Helmuth Hertz and Inge Edler. Finally J&ouml;rgen
  Lehmann may be mentioned as the most prominent among Thunberg's
  students. In the 1940s, then in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, he
  discovered para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), which together with
  streptomycin, discovered by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1952/index.html">Waksman</a>, provided the
  first effective drug treatment for tuberculosis. Waksman, but not
  Lehmann, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery.</p>

  <p>During the first five years of my medical
  studies World War II was going on, rendering Sweden almost
  entirely isolated. During my first year, however, five Danish
  medical students were allowed to leave Denmark, then occupied by
  Germany, to do their anatomy studies together with us in Lund. I
  became especially friendly with one of them: Ib Munkvad. Among
  other things we played check together. Munkvad later became a
  psychiatrist with an orientation towards biological psychiatry.
  He was instrumental in developing biological psychiatry in
  Denmark and is also known for formulating the hypothesis that the
  dyskinesias induced by dopaminergic agonists could make a model
  of psychosis.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable contact with the war
  occurred during a few nights in October, 1943, when thousands of
  Jews managed to escape in small fishing boats across the sound
  between Denmark and Sweden. This happened because one of the top
  members of the German occupation establishment had informed
  Danish authorities that a major deportation of Jews from Denmark
  to Germany was forthcoming. Among the Jews who came to Sweden at
  this time were a number of prominent medical researchers. These
  people were immediately enrolled and became an important
  acquisition as teachers and researchers at our medical
  school.</p>

  <p>An even sadder contact with the war
  occurred in the spring of 1944, when I was in my first year of
  clinical training. At this time Count Folke Bernadotte, a member
  of the royal Swedish family, had managed to persuade German
  authorities to allow him to go from Sweden into Germany with a
  number of "white busses" and to pick up prisoners at
  concentration camps. These transportations turned out to be
  successful, allowing about 30,000 prisoners, among them 11,000
  Jews, to escape. Some of the prisoners were taken to Lund, where
  a big tent was erected in a park to house them. As a medical
  student I was given the task to examine several of these
  prisoners. Many of them were children, suffering from
  undernutrition. Tuberculosis was not uncommon. However, most
  shocking was their mental status. They behaved like wild animals,
  obviously suffering from severe anguish and suspiciousness and
  trusting nobody.</p>

  <p><b>Starting in pharmacology</b><br>
  Already at the outset of my medical studies I had decided to try
  to go into research, and in 1944, I was offered a modest position
  as "amanuens" (initially without salary) at the Department of
  Pharmacology, after I had passed a successful examination in that
  discipline. The head of that department, and at that time the
  only professor, was Gunnar Ahlgren. He had been Thunberg's
  favorite student and apparently been an asset in the group around
  Thunberg. However, when on his own as professor of pharmacology
  he was not scientifically productive. But he managed to attract a
  number of talented students, who were to make successful careers
  in various medical disciplines. One of these people was the
  already mentioned Nils Alwall.</p>

  <p>Ahlgren gave me and another student, named
  Georg Theander, a topic to investigate, i.e. to measure the
  duration of action of pentylenetetrazol (Cardiazol), a convulsant
  at that time frequently used as an "artaleptic" to wake up people
  who had taken an overdose of a hypnotic or sedative, and also
  used as a forerunner of electroconvulsive therapy. Nowadays this
  drug has a modest use as a diagnostic and experimental tool. To
  measure the action of pentylenetetrazol Ahlgren proposed to
  employ its awakening action against central depressants. At first
  we tried nitrous oxide, but to our surprise the drug was unable
  to antagonize its anesthetic action. We then added a subhypnotic
  dose of barbital and found that the combined action of this drug
  and nitrous oxide could be antagonized, and the increase in
  partial pressure of nitrous oxide needed to inhibit the righting
  reflex could be used as a measure of pentylenetetrazol action.
  The result of this study was that the duration of action of
  pentyleneterazol was much longer than expected from observations
  on its effect in animals not treated with central depressants. We
  published our results (Carlsson and Theander, 1946), and this
  first publication of ours was awarded a modest prize, intended
  for young medical scientists at the University of Lund. One might
  wonder why Ahlgren was interested in the duration of action of
  this drug. He never explained that to me, but when I told him
  about our results, he was obviously pleased, but not surprised. A
  plausible reason for this was that he had actually tried it on
  himself to antagonize a sedative and thus discovered its long
  duration of action.</p>

  <p>Together with another, five years older
  pharmacologist, named Folke Serin, I studied the action of
  another "analeptic", i.e. nikethamide, and discovered a circadian
  rhythm in its lethal action. The publication of these findings
  (Carlsson and Serin, 1950) appears to have been the first
  describing a circadian rhythm of a drug's action, according to a
  review article on chronobiology, that was published much later
  when this subject became fashionable in connection with space
  research.</p>

  <p><b>Work on calcium metabolism</b><br>
  In 1948 Gunnar Ahlgren persuaded me to go into an entirely
  different area of research, i.e. calcium metabolism. At that time
  radioactive tracers, among them Ca<sup>45</sup>, had become
  commercially available, and a Swedish drug company wanted us to
  test a number of calcium salts regarding their oral availability.
  I accepted to do this research. The testing of different calcium
  salts did not disclose anything of interest, but I utilized this
  opportunity to investigate the absorption of calcium as well as
  its metabolism in the skeleton by means of the new technique.
  That work resulted in my thesis for the M.D. degree
  (corresponding to the American Ph.D. degree) and in several
  subsequent papers, including the doctoral theses of two students
  of mine, namely Bertil Lindquist and G&ouml;ran Bauer, who later
  became professors of pediatrics and orthopedic surgery,
  respectively. Briefly, what we found was that it is possible,
  contrary to the current opinion at that time, to use tracer
  techniques for measurement of the uptake (or "accretion") and the
  resorption of the bone mineral differentially (for review, see
  Bauer <i>et al</i>., 1961). Among other things we discovered that
  vitamin D in physiological doses can stimulate not only the
  intestinal absorption and "accretion" but also the resorption of
  bone mineral. Our findings aroused some international interest
  and resulted in an invitation to a Gordon Conference in the
  summer of 1955.</p>
