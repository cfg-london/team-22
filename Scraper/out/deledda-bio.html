  <h1>Grazia Deledda - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="deledda.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in the little town of Nuoro in
  Sardinia in 1871<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. My father was a
  fairly well-to-do landowner who farmed his own land. He was also
  a hospitable man and had friends in all of the towns surrounding
  Nuoro. When these friends and their families had to come to Nuoro
  on business or for religious holidays, they usually stayed at our
  house. Thus I began to know the various characters of my novels.
  I went only to elementary school in Nuoro. After this, I took
  private lessons in Italian from an elementary school teacher. He
  gave me themes to write about, and some of them turned out so
  well that he told me to publish them in a newspaper. I was
  thirteen and I didn't know to whom I should go to have my stories
  published. But I came across a fashion magazine. I took the
  address and sent off a short story. It was immediately published.
  Then I wrote my first novel, <i>Fior di Sardegna</i> (1892)
  [Flower of Sardinia], which I sent to an editor in Rome. He
  published it, and it was quite successful. But my first real
  success was <i>Elias Portol&uacute;</i> (1903), which was first
  translated by the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, and then into all
  of the European languages. I have written a great deal:</p>
  
  <p><i>Novels: Anime oneste, romanzo famigliare</i> (1895) [Honest
  Souls], with preface by Ruggero Bonghi; <i>Il vecchio della
  montagna</i> (1900) [The Old Man of the Mountain] followed by a
  dramatic sketch <i>Odio vince</i>(1904) [HateWins] ; <i>Elias
  Portol&uacute;</i> (1903); <i>Cenere</i> (1904) [Ashes];
  <i>Nostalgie</i> (1905); <i>La via del male</i> (1896) [The Evil
  Way]; <i>Naufraghi in porto</i> [originally <i>Dopo il
  divorzio</i>, 1902] (1920) [<i>After the Divorce</i>];
  <i>L'edera</i> (1908) [The Ivy]; <i>Il nostro padrone</i> (1910)
  [Our Master]; <i>Sino al confine</i> (1910) [Up to the Limit];
  <i>Nel deserto</i> (1911) [In the Desertl; <i>Colombi e
  sparvieri</i> (1912) [Doves and Falcons]; <i>Canne al vento</i>
  (1913) [Canes in the Wind]; <i>Le colpe altrui</i> (1914) [The
  Others' Faults]; <i>Marianna Sirca</i> (1915); <i>L'incendio
  nell'oliveto</i> (1918) [The Fire in the Olive Grove]; <i>La
  Madre</i> (1920) [The Mother]; <i>Il segreto dell'uomo
  solitario</i> (1921) [The Secret of the Solitary Man]; <i>Il Dio
  dei viventi</i> (1922) [The God of the Living]; <i>La danza della
  collana</i> (1924) [The Dance of the Necklace], followed by the
  dramatic sketch <i>A sinistra</i> (1924) [To the Left]; <i>La
  fuga in Egitto</i> (1925) [The Flight into Egypt]; <i>Annalena
  Bilsini</i> (1927).</p>

  <p><i>Short Stories:</i> &laquo;Il giuochi
  della vita&raquo; (1905) [The Gambles in Life];
  &laquo;Chiaroscuro&raquo; (1912) [Light and Dark]; &laquo;Il
  fanciullo nascosto&raquo; (1915) [The Hidden Boy]; &laquo;Il
  ritorno del figlio&raquo; (1919) [The Son's Return]; &laquo;La
  bambina rubata&raquo; (1919) [The Stolen Child]; &laquo;Cattive com
  pagnie&raquo; (1921) [Evil Company]; &laquo;Il flauto nel
  bosco&raquo; (1923) [The Flute in the Wood]; &laquo;Il sigillo
  d'amore&raquo; (1926) [The Seal of Love].<br>
  <br>
  <i>L'edera</i> (1912) [The Ivy], a play in three acts, with the
  collaboration of Camillo Antona-Traversi.<br>
  <br>
  In 1900 I took my first trip. It was to Cagliari, the beautiful
  Sardinian capital. There I met my husband. We later moved to
  Rome, where I am presently living. I have also written some poems
  which have not been collected in a volume.</p>

  <p><b>Biographical note on Grazia
  Deledda</b></p>

  <p>Grazia Deledda (1875-1936) continued to
  write extensively after she received the Nobel Prize. <i>La casa
  del poeta</i> (1930) [The Poet's House] and <i>Sole d'estate</i>
  (1933) [Summer Sun], both collections of short stories, reflect
  her optimistic vision of life even during the most painful years
  of her incurable illness. Life remains beautiful and serene,
  unaltered by personal suffering; man and nature are reconciled in
  order to overcome physical and spiritual hardship.<br>
  <br>
  In many of her later works, Grazia Deledda combined the imaginary
  and the autobiographical; this blend is readily apparent in her
  novel, <i>Il paese del vento</i> (1931) [Land of the Wind]. In
  another novel, <i>L'argine</i> (1934) [<i>The Barrier</i>], the
  renunciation of worldly things, including love, mirrors the life
  of the author who, accepting self-sacrifice as a higher manner of
  living, is reconciled with God. The common trait of all her later
  writings is a constant faith in mankind and in God.<br>
  <br>
  Two of Grazia Deledda's novels were published posthumously:
  <i>Cosima</i> (1937) and <i>Il cedro di Libano</i> (1939) [<i>The
  Cedar of Lebanon</i>].</p>
