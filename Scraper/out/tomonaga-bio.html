  <h1>Sin-Itiro Tomonaga - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tomonaga.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Sin-Itiro Tomonaga</b> was
  born in Tokyo, Japan, on March 31, 1906, the eldest son of
  Sanjuro Tomonaga and Hide Tomonaga. In 1913 his family moved to
  Kyoto when his father was appointed a professor of philosophy at
  Kyoto Imperial University. From that time he was brought up in
  Kyoto. He is a graduate of the Third Higher School, Kyoto, a
  renowned senior high school which has educated a number of
  leading personalities in prewarJapan.<br>
  <br>
  Tomonaga completed work for Rigakushi (bachelor's degree) in
  physics at Kyoto Imperial University in 1929, with one of his
  intimate friends. <a href="../1949/index.html">Dr. Hideki
  Yukawa</a>, Nobel laureate. He was engaged in graduate work for
  three years at the same university and was then appointed a
  research associate by Dr. Yoshio Nishina at the Institute of
  Physical and Chemical Research, Tokyo, where he started to work
  in a newly developed frontier of theoretical physics quantum
  electrodynamics - under the guidance of Dr. Nishina. His paper on
  the photoelectric pair creation is well-known.<br>
  <br>
  Tomonaga stayed in Leipzig, Germany, from 1937 to 1939, to study
  nuclear physics and the quantum field theory in collaboration
  with the theoretical group of Dr. W. Heisenberg, where he
  published a paper "Innere Reibung und
  W&auml;rmeleitf&auml;higkeit der Kernmaterie", which was chosen
  as the thesis for Rigakuhakushi (Doctor of Science) at Tokyo
  Imperial University in December,1939.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940, Dr. Tomonaga directed his attention to the meson theory
  and developed the intermediate coupling theory in order to
  clarify the structure of the meson cloud around the nucleon. He
  joined the faculty of Tokyo Bunrika University (which was
  absorbed into the Tokyo University of Education in 1949<a href="#not">*</a>) as
  Professor of Physics in 1941. It was in 1942 when he first
  proposed the covariant formulation of the quantum field theory in
  which the concept of the quantum state was generalized so as to
  be relativistically covariant.<br>
  <br>
  During the Second World War, Dr. Tomonaga was interested in
  developing a theory of microwave systems. He solved the motion of
  electrons in the magnetron and also developed a unified theory of
  the systems consisting of wave guides and cavity
  resonators.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as the War was over, Tomonaga came back to academic
  research again with a programme in which he was first to
  summarize and extend the intermediate coupling theory and
  secondly to apply the covariant field theory to actual physical
  systems. His aim was to investigate the nature of field reaction
  in the meson theory as well as in quantum electrodynamics. He was
  confident, prior to the Lamb-Retherford experiment, by means of a
  model calculation that divergence difficulty in
  quantumelectrodynamics could be overcome simply by handling the
  infinite mass and charge due to field reactions in some way or
  another. It was only a step further for him to develop the
  renormalization theory with covariant formalism in his right hand
  and experimental support in his left.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Tomonaga was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study,
  Princeton, in 1949 where he was engaged in the investigation of a
  one-dimensional fermion system. Thus he first succeeded in
  clarifying the nature of collective oscillations of a
  quantum-mechanical many-body system and opened a new frontier of
  theoretical physics, modern many-body problem. In 1955, he
  published an elementary theory of quantum mechanical collective
  motions.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Tomonaga took the leadership in establishing the Institute
  for Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo, in 1955. From 1956 to 1962 he
  was appointed President of the Tokyo University of Education and
  since 1963 he has been President of the Science Council of Japan
  and Director of the Institute for Optical Research, Tokyo
  University of Education. He occupies an important position in
  various governmental committees for scientific research and
  policymaking.<br>
  <br>
  Tomonaga's honours and awards include the Japan Academy Prize
  (1948); the Order of Culture (1952); the Lomonosov Medal,
  U.S.S.R. (1964).<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Tomonaga is a member of the Japan Academy, the Deutsche
  Akademie der Naturforscher "Leopoldina" and a foreign member of
  the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/tomonaga-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se" target="_blank">Royal Swedish
  Academy of Science</a>. He is a corresponding member of the
  Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften and a foreign associate of
  the National Academy
  of Science of U.S.A.<br>
  <br>
  Tomonaga has published widely in scientific journals on such
  subjects as quantum electrodynamics, the meson theory, nuclear
  physics, cosmic rays, and the many-body problem. His book,
  "Quantum Mechanics", was published in 1949 and translated into
  English in 1963.<br>
  <br>
  Tomonaga was married in 1940 to Ryoko Sekiguchi, daughter of Dr.
  K. Sekiguchi, the former Director of the Tokyo Metropolitan
  Observatory. They have two sons, Atsushi and Makoto and one
  daughter. Their daughter was married in 1965 to Dr. Y. Nagashima,
  research associate of the Physics Department, University of
  Rochester.</p>
