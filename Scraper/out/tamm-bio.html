  <h1>Igor Y. Tamm - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tamm.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm</b> was born
  in Vladivostok on July 8, 1895, as the son of Evgenij Tamm, an
  engineer, and Olga Davydova. He graduated from Moscow State
  University in 1918, specializing in physics, and immediately
  commenced an academic career in institutes of higher learning. He
  was progressively assistant, instructor, lecturer, and professor
  in charge of chairs, and he has taught in the Crimean and Moscow
  State Universities, in Polytechnical and Engineering-Physical
  Institutes, and in the J.M. Sverdlov Communist University. Tamm
  was awarded the degree of Doctor of Physico-Mathematical
  Sciences, and he has attained the academic rank of Professor.
  Since 1934, he has been in charge of the theoretical division of
  the P.N. Lebedev
  Institute of Physics of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
  Sciences.<br>

  A decisive influence on his scientific activity was exercised by
  Prof. L. Mandelstam, under whose guidance he worked a number of
  years and with whom he was closely associated since 1920, when
  they met for the first time, and up to the death of Prof.
  Mandelstam in 1944.<br>

  Tamm is an outstanding theoretical physicist, and his early
  researches were devoted to crystallo-optics and the quantum
  theory of diffused light in solid bodies. He turned his attention
  to the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and he evolved
  a method for interpreting the interaction of nuclear particles.
  Together with I.M. Frank, he developed the theoretical
  interpretation of the radiation of electrons moving through
  matter faster than the speed of light (the Cerenkov effect), and
  the theory of showers in cosmic rays. He has also contributed
  towards methods for the control of thermonuclear reactions.
  Resulting from his original researches, Tamm has written two
  important books, <i>Relativistic Interaction of Elementary
  Particles</i> (1935) and <i>On the Magnetic Moment of the
  Neutron</i> (1938).<br>

  I. Tamm was elected Corresponding Member of the U.S.S.R. Academy
  of Sciences in 1933, and in 1953 he became an Academician. He
  shared the 1946 State Prize with Vavilov, Cerenkov, and Frank,
  and is a Hero of Socialist Labour. He is also a member of the
  Polish Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and
  Sciences and the Swedish Physical Society.</p>
