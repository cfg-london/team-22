  <h1>Lord Rayleigh - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="strutt.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>John William Strutt</b>, third Baron
  Rayleigh, was born on November 12, 1842 at Langford Grove,
  Maldon, Essex, as the son of John James Strutt, second Baron, and
  his wife Clara Elizabeth La Touche, eldest daughter of Captain
  Richard Vicars, R. E. He was one of the very few members of
  higher nobility who won fame as an outstanding scientist.<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his infancy and youth he was of frail physique; his
  education was repeatedly interrupted by ill-health, and his
  prospects of attaining maturity appeared precarious. After a
  short spell at Eton at the age of 10, mainly spent in the school
  sanatorium, three years in a private school at Wimbledon, and
  another short stay at Harrow, he finally spent four years with
  the Rev. George Townsend Warner (1857) who took pupils at
  Torquay.<br>
  <br>
  In 1861 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he commenced reading
  mathematics, not at first equal in attainments to the best of his
  contemporaries, but his exceptional abilities soon enabled him to
  overtake his competitors. He graduated in the Mathematical Tripos
  in 1865 as Senior Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman. In 1866 he
  obtained a fellowship at Trinity which he held until 1871, the
  year of his marriage.<br>
  <br>
  A severe attack of rheumatic fever in 1872 made him spend the
  winter in Egypt and Greece. Shortly after his return his father
  died (1873) and he succeeded to the barony, taking up residence
  in the family seat, Terling Place, at Witham, Essex. He now found
  himself compelled to devote part of his time to the management of
  his estates (7000 acres). The combination of general scientific
  knowledge and acumen with acquired knowledge of agriculture made
  his practice in estate management in many respects in advance of
  his time. Nevertheless, in 1876 he left the entire management of
  the land to his younger brother.<br>
  <br>
  From then on, he could devote his full time to science again. In
  1879 he was appointed to follow James Clerk Maxwell as Professor
  of Experimental Physics and Head of the Cavendish
  Laboratory at Cambridge. In 1884 he left Cambridge to
  continue his experimental work at his country seat at Terling,
  Essex, and from 1887 to 1905 he was Professor of Natural
  Philosophy in the Royal Institution of Great Britain, being successor
  of Tyndall.<br>
  <br>
  He served for six years as President of a Government Committee on
  Explosives, and from 1896 to 1919 he was Scientific Advisor to
  Trinity House. He was Lord Lieutenant of Essex from 1892 to
  1901.<br>
  <br>
  Lord Rayleigh's first researches were mainly mathematical,
  concerning optics and vibrating systems, but his later work
  ranged over almost the whole field of physics, covering sound,
  wave theory, colour vision, electrodynamics, electromagnetism,
  light scattering, flow of liquids, hydrodynamics, density of
  gases, viscosity, capillarity, elasticity, and photography. His
  patient and delicate experiments led to the establishment of the
  standards of resistance, current, and electromotive force; and
  his later work was concentrated on electric and magnetic
  problems. Lord Rayleigh was an excellent instructor and, under
  his active supervision, a system of practical instruction in
  experimental physics was devised at Cambridge, developing from a
  class of five or six students to an advanced school of some
  seventy experimental physicists. His <i>Theory of Sound</i> was
  published in two volumes during 1877-1878, and his other
  extensive studies are reported in his <i>Scientific Papers</i> -
  six volumes issued during 1889-1920. He has also contributed to
  the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica.</i><br>
  <br>
  He had a fine sense of literary style; every paper he wrote, even
  on the most abstruse subject, is a model of clearness and
  simplicity of diction. The 446 papers reprinted in his collected
  works clearly show his capacity for understanding everything just
  a little more deeply than anyone else. Although a member of the
  House of Lords, he intervened in debate only on rare occasions,
  never allowing politics to interfere with science. His
  recreations were travel, tennis, photography and music.<br>
  <br>
  Lord Rayleigh, a former Chancellor of Cambridge University, was a
  Justice of the Peace and the recipient of honorary science and
  law degrees. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society
  (1873) and served as Secretary from 1885 to 1896, and as
  President from 1905 to 1908. He was an original recipient of the
  Order of Merit (1902), and in 1905 he was made a Privy
  Councillor. He was awarded the Copley, Royal, and Rumford Medals
  of the Royal Society, and the <a href="index.html">Nobel
  Prize</a> for 1904.<br>
  <br>
  In 1871 he married Evelyn, sister of the future prime minister,
  the Earl of Balfour, and daughter of James Maitland Balfour and
  his wife Blanche, the daughter of the second Marquis of
  Salisbury. They had three sons, the eldest of whom was to become
  Professor of Physics at Imperial College of Science and Technology,
  London.<br>
  <br>
  Lord Rayleigh died on June 30, 1919, at Witham, Essex.</p>
