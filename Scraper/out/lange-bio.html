  <h1>Christian Lange - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lange.jpg" class="bio-img">In the first
  third of the twentieth century, <b>Christian Lous Lange</b>
  (September 17, 1869-December 11, 1938) became one of the world's
  foremost exponents of the theory and practice of
  internationalism. His career from his school days to his death
  was closely focused on international affairs.<br>
  <br>
  Lange was born in Stavanger, an old city on Norway's southwestern
  coast. His paternal grandfather had been an editor and historian;
  his father was an engineer in the armed services. After
  graduating from the local schools in 1887, Lange studied history,
  French, and English at the University of Oslo, traveled and studied in
  France and England, and received the Master of Arts degree from
  the University of Oslo in 1893. For some years thereafter he
  taught in the secondary schools of Oslo. In 1919 he was granted
  the Ph.D. degree by the University of Oslo.<br>
  <br>
  Lange's first official connection with internationalism came in
  1899 when he was appointed secretary of the committee on
  arrangements for the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union
  to be held that year in Oslo. His capacity for organization
  having been noted, Lange was the next year appointed secretary to
  the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1921/lange-bio.html&object=nobelpeaceprize.org&to=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/" target="_blank">Norwegian Parliament's Nobel Committee</a> and to the
  nascent Norwegian Nobel Institute. He resigned from this position
  in 1909 but served as an adviser to the Institute from then until
  1933, and from 1934 until his death as a member of the Committee
  itself. Lange was involved in the planning of the Institute's
  building, which was opened in 1905, as well as in the founding of
  its library the year before. He looked upon the Institute as a
  &laquo;scientific&raquo; institution, a &laquo;peace laboratory, a
  breeding place of ideas and plans for the improvement and
  development of international relations&raquo;<a href=
  "#not_1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Lange's association with the Interparliamentary Union,
  auspiciously begun in 1899, was continued in 1909 when he was
  appointed its secretary-general, holding this office until 1933
  when he declined reappointment. The organization which he was
  called to administer, still flourishing today, was initiated in
  1888 by <a href="../1903/index.html">William Randal Cremer</a>
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
  Passy</a>, both destined to become Nobel Peace Prize laureates.
  Its members are active parliamentarians who form groups within
  the structure of national legislative bodies - there are
  sixty-eight such groups at present. Broadly stated, its
  objectives, then and now, are to promote personal relations among
  the world's legislators and to strengthen democratic institutions
  throughout the world; its more specific objective is that of
  encouraging efforts on behalf of peace and international
  intercourse, especially by substituting processes of adjudication
  for force in the resolution of international conflicts.<br>
  <br>
  As the first paid, nonparliamentary secretary-general, Lange
  administered the affairs of the Interparliamentary Bureau, met
  with parliamentary groups in various countries, helped to
  formulate the agenda for the annual meetings, edited the official
  publications of the Union, raised money (Norway was the first
  country to provide an annual subvention to the Union), and kept
  the Union in the public eye by lecturing and publishing on his
  own account. To this job in which personal diplomacy was a
  necessity, Lange brought tact, personal magnetism, and a
  character that elicited trust.<br>
  <br>
  Lange supervised the reorganization of the Bureau after it was
  moved from Bern to Brussels in 1909, and in 1914, when Germany
  overran Belgium, installed the office in his own home in Oslo.
  That the Union continued to exist during and after the war when
  so many international organizations became casualties is a
  tribute to Lange's persistence. Since the Union's funds in
  Brussels had been impounded by the Germans and most of the
  parliamentary groups were no longer providing contributions,
  Lange made ends meet by obtaining loans from the Carnegie Endowment for
  International Peace and by cutting expenses, even carrying on
  correspondence in his own hand. The war over, he convened the
  Council of the Union in Geneva in 1919, and the Council, in turn,
  convened the first postwar conference of the Union in Geneva in
  1921. To be close to the League of Nations and its vast array of
  international activities, Lange moved the administrative and
  editorial headquarters of the Union to Geneva.<br>
  <br>
  Either as private citizen or as governmental representative,
  Lange participated in numerous other international activities. In
  1907 he was a technical delegate of the Norwegian government to
  the second Hague Peace Conference; in 1915 and later he was
  active in the work of the Central Organization for a Lasting
  Peace, an organization founded by the Dutch; in 1917, at the
  invitation of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he
  prepared a report, later published both separately and in the
  <i>New York Times</i>, on conditions in the warring countries,
  especially in Russia; from 1916 to 1929 he was a &laquo;special
  correspondent&raquo; for the Carnegie Endowment.<br>
  <br>
  From the opening of the League of Nations until his death, Lange
  was a delegate or an alternate delegate from Norway, always
  &laquo;a sort of standing adviser&raquo;. The author of those
  words, Oscar J. Falnes, lists some of Lange's official League
  duties: in 1920 Lange provided a general orientation for the
  Assembly's Committee VI (Disarmament); in 1932 he headed the
  Assembly's Committee VI (Political Questions); in 1933 headed the
  Advisory Committee which kept the Assembly informed on the
  Sino-Japanese situation; in 1936 chaired the Assembly's Committee
  III (Arms Reduction); in 1938 served on the Assembly's committee
  on armament problems<a href="#not_2"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Lange was a liberal in social philosophy, buttressing his
  progressive beliefs with sound historical knowledge and wide
  acquaintance with contemporary culture. He believed in free
  speech, free trade, universal suffrage, the mobility of labor and
  the workers' right to organize. An international defender of
  democratic doctrine, he pinpointed its special characteristic as
  &laquo;the subordination of the executive to the
  legislature&raquo;<a href="#not_3"><sup>3</sup></a>. He was an
  expert on the complicated subjects of arbitration and control of
  armament. He treated the subjects of internationalism and
  pacifism theoretically, but, perhaps more habitually,
  historically. His book-length history of pacifist doctrine
  surveys the subject from antiquity to the period immediately
  after World War I. The first volume of his <i>Histoire de
  l'internationalisme</i>, published in 1919, initiated a projected
  survey from classical times to his own day. Volume II, for which
  he had written the early chapters before his death, was completed
  and published in 1954 by August Schou, the present director of
  the Norwegian Nobel Institute, who himself did the research and
  the writing of Volume III, published in 1963. Of Lange's theory
  of internationalism defined in the <i>Histoire</i>, as well as in
  many of his other publications and speeches, including his Nobel
  lecture, Schou has remarked that it &laquo;agrees with the
  principle that had become the basis of the League of
  Nations&raquo; and that Lange &laquo;made an important contribution
  by participating in the work of ideological preparation for the
  League&raquo;<a href="#not_4"><sup>4</sup></a>.<br>
  <br>
  Lange died at the age of sixty-nine on December 11, 1938, one day
  after the seventeenth anniversary of his being awarded the Nobel
  Peace Prize.</p>
