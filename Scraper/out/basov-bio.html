  <h1>Nicolay G. Basov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="basov.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov</b> was
  born on December, 14, 1922 in the small town of Usman near
  Voronezh, the son of Gennady Fedorovich Basov and Zinaida
  Andreevna Molchanova. His father was a professor of the Voronezh
  Forest Institute and devoted his life to investigation of the
  influence of forest belts on underground waters and on surface
  drainage.<br>
  <br>
  After finishing secondary school in 1941 in Voronezh Basov was
  called up for military service and directed to the Kuibyshev
  Military Medical Academy. In 1943 he left the Academy with the
  qualification of a military doctor's assistant. He served in the
  Soviet Army and took part in the Second World War in the area
  of the First Ukrainian Front. In December 1945, he was demobilized
  and entered the Moscow Institute of Physical Engineers where he
  studied theoretical and experimental physics.<br>
  <br>
  From 1950 to 1953 he was a postgraduate student of the Moscow
  Institute of Physical Engineers. At that time, Basov was working
  on his thesis at the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Academy of
  Sciences, U.S.S.R., under the guidance of Professor M.A.
  Leontovich and Professor A.M. Prochorov.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950 Basov joined the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute, where
  at present he is vicedirector and head of the laboratory of
  quantum radiophysics. He is also a professor of the department of
  solid-state physics at the Moscow Institute of Physical
  Engineers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1952 Dr. Basov began to work in the field of quantum
  radiophysics. He made various attempts (firstly, theoretical and
  then experimental) to design and build oscillators (together with
  A.M. Prochorov). In 1956 he defended his doctoral thesis on the
  theme "A Molecular Oscillator", which summed up the theoretical
  and experimental works on creation of a molecular oscillator
  utilizing an ammonia beam.<br>
  <br>
  In 1955 Basov organized a group for the investigation of the
  frequency stability of molecular oscillators. Together with his
  pupils and collaborators A.N. Oraevsky, V.V. Nikitin, G.M.
  Strakhovsky, V.S. Zuev and others, Dr Basov studied the
  dependence of the oscillator frequency on different parameters
  for a series of ammonia spectral lines, proposed methods of
  increasing the frequency stability by means of slowing down
  molecules, proposed methods of producing slow molecules,
  investigated the operation of oscillators with resonators in
  series, realized phase stabilization of klystron frequency by
  means of molecular oscillators, studied transition processes in
  molecular oscillators, and designed an oscillator utilizing a
  beam of deuterium ammonia. In the result of these investigations
  the oscillators with a frequency stability of 10<sup>-11</sup>
  have been realized in 1962.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957 Basov started to work on the design and construction of
  quantum oscillators in the optical range. A group of theorists
  and research workers began to study the possibilities for
  realization of quantum oscillators by means of semiconductors,
  and after A. Javan's proposal, the possibility of their
  realization in the gas media was also investigated. In 1958
  together with B.M. Vul and Yu.M. Popov he investigated the
  conditions for production of states with a negative temperature
  in semiconductors, and suggested utilization of a pulse breakdown
  for that purpose. In 1961 together with O.N. Krokhin and Yu.M.
  Popov, Basov proposed three different methods for the obtaining
  of a negative temperature state in semiconductors in the presence
  of direct and indirect transitions (optical excitation,
  utilization of a beam of fast electrons and injection of carriers
  through a degenerated <i>p-n</i> junction).<br>
  <br>
  As a result of a cooperative effort with B.M. Vul and
  collaborators the injection semiconductor lasers utilizing
  crystals of gallium arsenide were made at the beginning of
  1963.<br>
  <br>
  In 1964 semiconductor lasers with electronic excitation have been
  made (together with O.V. Bogdankevich and A.N. Devyatkov); and
  somewhat later, lasers with optical excitation were constructed
  (together with A.Z. Grasiuk and V.A. Katulin). For these
  achievements a group of scientists of Lebedev Physical Institute
  was awarded the Lenin Prize for 1964.<br>
  <br>
  Beginning from 1961 Dr. Basov (together with V.S. Zuev, P.G.
  Krinkov, V.S. Lctokhov <i>et al.</i>) carried out theoretical and
  experimental research in the field of powerful lasers. There have
  been found the ways of obtaining powerful short laser pulses. The
  nature of appearance of such pulses in quantum oscillators and
  their propagation in quantum amplifiers have been investigated.
  This work resulted in the development of high-power single-pulse
  Nd-glass lasers with 30 J energy and 2*10<sup>-11</sup> sec pulse
  duration (in 1968 together with P.G. Krinkov, Yu.V. Senatsky
  <i>et al.</i>) and multichannel lasers with energy 103 J within
  10<sup>-9</sup> sec (in 1971 in collaboration with G.V. Sklizkov
  <i>et al.</i>).<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 N. Basov and O.N. Krokhin investigated the possibility of
  laser radiation usage for the obtaining of thermonuclear plasmas.
  In 1968 Basov and his associates (P.G. Kriukov, Yu.V. Senatsky,
  S.D. Zakharov) have succeeded in observing for the first time
  neutron emission in the laser-produced deuterium plasmas. The
  spectra of multicharged ions CaXVI, FeXXIII, K XIX and others
  have also been observed (together with O.N. Krokhin, S.L.
  Mandelshtam, G.V. Sklizkov). There has been developed a theory of
  picosecond pulse formation (together with V.S. Letokhov). In the
  same year Basov and his associate A.N. Oraevsky proposed a method
  of the thermal laser excitation. Further theoretical
  considerations of this method by Basov, A.N. Oraevsky and V.A.
  Sheglov encouraged the development of the socalled gasdynamic
  lasers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963 Dr. Basov and his colleagues (V.V. Nikitin, Yu.M. Popov,
  V.N. Morozov) began to work in the field of optoelectronics. They
  developed in 1967 a number of fast-operating logic elements on
  the basis of diode lasers. At present a logic structure of the
  multichannel optoelectronic systems producing 10<sup>10</sup>
  operations per second for the optical data processing is under
  the development.<br>
  <br>
  The studies of the radiation of the condensed rare gases under
  the action of a powerful electron beam have been initiated in
  1966 by Basov and his collaborators (V.A. Danilychev, Yu.M.
  Popov), and they were the first to obtain in 1970 the laser
  emission in the vacuum ultraviolet range.<br>
  <br>
  In 1968 Basov ( in cooperation with O.V. Bogdankevich and A.S.
  Nasibov) made a proposal for a laser projection TV. About the
  same time Dr. Basov (together with V.V. Nikitin) began the
  studies of the frequency standard in the optical range (on the
  basis of gas lasers). In 1970 they succeeded in realizing a gas
  laser stabilized in the methane absorption line with frequency
  stability 10<sup>-11</sup>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969 Basov (together with E.M. Belenov and V.V. Nikitin)
  hypothe sized that to obtain the frequency standard with the
  stability 10<sup>-12</sup>-10<sup>-13</sup> a ring laser can be
  used with a nonlinear absorption cell.<br>
  <br>
  A large contribution has been made by Dr. Basov to the field of
  chemical lasers. In 1970 under his guidance an original chemical
  laser was achieved which operates on a mixture of deuterium, F
  and CO<sub>2</sub> at the atmospheric pressure. In the same year
  Basov (in cooperation with E.M. Belenov, V.A. Danilychev and A.F.
  Suchkov) proposed and developed experimentally an elion
  (electrical pumping of ionized compressed gases) method of
  gaslaser excitation. Using this method for a CO<sub>2</sub> and
  N<sub>2</sub> mixture compressed to 25 atm., they achieved a
  great increase of power of the gas laser volume unit compared to
  the typical low pressure CO<sub>2</sub> lasers.<br>
  <br>
  In the end of 1970 Basov (together with E.P. Markin, A.N.
  Oraevsky, A.V. Pankratov) presented experimental evidence for the
  stimulation of chemical reactions by the infrared laser
  radiation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959 Dr. Basov was awarded the Lenin Prize together with A. M.
  Prochorov for the investigation leading to the creation of
  molecular oscillators and paramagnetic amplifiers. In 1962 Dr.
  Basov was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of
  Sciences of the U.S.S.R.; in 1966, a member of the Academy; in
  1967, a member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the
  U.S.S.R., and a foreign member of the German Academy of Sciences
  in Berlin; and in 1971, a foreign member of the German Academy
  "Leopoldina".<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Basov is Editor-in-chief of the Soviet scientific journals
  Priroda. (Nature) and "<i>Kvantovaya Elektornika</i>" (Quantum
  Electronics); he is also a member of the Editorial Board of "Il
  Nuovo Cimento".<br>
  <br>
  In 1970 Dr. Basov was awarded the rank of Hero of Socialist
  Labour. Dr. Basov is a member of the Soviet Committee of the
  Defence of Peace and a member of the World Peace Council.<br>
  <br>
  Nikolai Basov married in 1950. His wife, Ksenia Tikhonovna
  Basova, is also a physicist and is with the Department of General
  Physics of the Moscow Institute of Physical Engineers. They have
  two sons: Gennady (born 1954) and Dmitry (born 1963).</p>
