  <h1>Guglielmo Marconi - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="marconi.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Guglielmo Marconi</b> was born at Bologna, Italy, 
              on April 25, 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi, an Italian 
              country gentleman, and Annie Jameson, daughter of Andrew Jameson 
              of Daphne Castle in the County Wexford, Ireland. He was educated 
              privately at Bologna, Florence and Leghorn. Even as a boy he took 
              a keen interest in physical and electrical science and studied the 
              works of Maxwell, Hertz, Righi, Lodge and others. In 1895 he began 
              laboratory experiments at his father's country estate at Pontecchio 
              where he succeeded in sending wireless signals over a distance of 
              one and a half miles.<br>
  <br>
  In 1896 Marconi took his apparatus to England where he was
  introduced to Mr. (later Sir) William Preece, Engineer-in-Chief
  of the Post Office, and later that year was granted the world's
  first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy. He demonstrated
  his system successfully in London, on Salisbury Plain and across
  the Bristol Channel, and in July 1897 formed The Wireless
  Telegraph &amp; Signal Company Limited (in 1900 re-named
  Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company Limited). In the same year
  he gave a demonstration to the Italian Government at Spezia where
  wireless signals were sent over a distance of twelve miles. In
  1899 he established wireless communication between France and
  England across the English Channel. He erected permanent wireless
  stations at The Needles, Isle of Wight, at Bournemouth and later
  at the Haven Hotel, Poole, Dorset.<br>
  <br>
  In 1900 he took out his famous patent No. 7777 for "tuned or
  syntonic telegraphy" and, on an historic day in December 1901,
  determined to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the
  curvature of the Earth, he used his system for transmitting the
  first wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu,
  Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2100
  miles.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1902 and 1912 he patented several new inventions. In
  1902, during a voyage in the American liner "Philadelphia", he
  first demonstrated "daylight effect" relative to wireless
  communication and in the same year patented his magnetic detector
  which then became the standard wireless receiver for many years.
  In December 1902 he transmitted the first complete messages to
  Poldhu from stations at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and later Cape
  Cod, Massachusetts, these early tests culminating in 1907 in the
  opening of the first transatlantic commercial service between
  Glace Bay and Clifden, Ireland, after the first shorter-distance
  public service of wireless telegraphy had been established
  between Bari in Italy and Avidari in Montenegro. In 1905 he
  patented his horizontal directional aerial and in 1912 a "timed
  spark" system for generating continuous waves.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 he was commissioned in the Italian Army as a Lieutenant
  being later promoted to Captain, and in 1916 transferred to the
  Navy in the rank of Commander. He was a member of the Italian
  Government mission to the United States in 1917 and in 1919 was
  appointed Italian plenipotentiary delegate to the Paris Peace
  Conference. He was awarded the Italian Military Medal in 1919 in
  recognition of his war service.<br>
  <br>
  During his war service in Italy he returned to his investigation
  of short waves, which he had used in his first experiments. After
  further tests by his collaborators in England, an intensive
  series of trials was conducted in 1923 between experimental
  installations at the Poldhu Station and in Marconi's yacht
  "Elettra" cruising in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and this
  led to the establishment of the beam system for long distance
  communication. Proposals to use this system as a means of
  Imperial communications were accepted by the British Government
  and the first beam station, linking England and Canada, was
  opened in 1926, other stations being added the following
  year.<br>
  <br>
  In 1931 Marconi began research into the propagation
  characteristics of still shorter waves, resulting in the opening
  in 1932 of the world's first microwave radiotelephone link
  between the Vatican City and the Pope's summer residence at
  Castel Gandolfo. Two years later at Sestri Levante he
  demonstrated his microwave radio beacon for ship navigation and
  in 1935, again in Italy, gave a practical demonstration of the
  principles of radar, the coming of which he had first foretold in
  a lecture to the American Institute of Radio Engineers in New
  York in 1922.<br>
  <br>
  He has been the recipient of honorary doctorates of several
  universities and many other international honours and awards,
  among them the Nobel Prize for Physics, which in 1909 he shared
  with Professor Karl Braun, the Albert Medal of the Royal Society
  of Arts, the John Fritz Medal and the Kelvin Medal. He was
  decorated by the Tsar of Russia with the Order of St. Anne, the
  King of Italy created him Commander of the Order of St. Maurice
  and St. Lazarus, and awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of
  the Crown of Italy in 1902. Marconi also received the freedom of
  the City of Rome (1903), and was created Chevalier of the Civil
  Order of Savoy in 1905. Many other distinctions of this kind
  followed. In 1914 he was both created a Senatore in the Italian
  Senate and app ointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal
  Victorian Order in England. He received the hereditary title of
  Marchese in 1929.<br>
  <br>
  In 1905 he married the Hon. Beatrice O'Brien, daughter of the
  14th Baron Inchiquin, the marriage being annulled in 1927, in
  which year he married the Countess Bezzi-Scali of Rome. He had
  one son and two daughters by his first and one daughter by his
  second wife. His recreations were hunting, cycling and
  motoring.</p>

  <p>Marconi died in Rome on July 20, 1937.</p>
