  <h2>The Charter of Human Rights</h2>

  <p>In the course of the December tenth
  session, I had the privilege of paying tribute to the Norwegian
  nation in the person of its Ring, to Alfred Nobel, founder of the
  Peace Prize, who died on December 10, 1896, and to all the
  laureates honored since 1901 for their services to humanity. But
  I am aware of not having properly expressed my gratitude to the
  members of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee and in particular to
  its chairman, Mrs. Aase Lionaes, who represented Norway in 1948
  at the General Assembly of the United Nations whose [Third]
  Committee deliberated on the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.</p>

  <p>So before I begin, I should like to make
  amends for what must seem an unwarrantable omission. The
  independence and the rigorous impartiality which the Committee
  has consistently shown have steadily increased the worldwide
  prestige of the Nobel Peace Prize, and increased also for its
  recipient - institution or individual - the distinction of being
  selected. Furthermore, when public opinion and men representing
  the highest moral values concur in the Nobel Committee's choice,
  the goal sought by the founder of the prize is more closely
  approached.</p>

  <p>If it is the responsibility of the Nobel
  Committee to weigh carefully and to communicate to the public the
  reasons for its choice, the laureate has the obligation on his
  own part to set forth publicly the motives which have inspired
  his work for peace in general or on behalf of one or the other of
  its elements. It is only after having discharged that obligation
  of conscience that he has the right to cast a backward glance at
  the progress made to date, in the hope of convincing his
  listeners - and all others - of the necessity, as well as the
  possibility, of advancing toward the creation of a more humane
  world.</p>

  <p>I shall confess at the outset that it was
  only shortly after the beginning of this century that I entered
  active life - with a somewhat precocious capacity for
  involvement. To be sure, I was at an early age engrossed in
  education, interested in international affairs and in reading
  about social issues. And as a child I was filled with passionate
  admiration for acts of civic courage I had seen performed by an
  elderly military doctor, who was a friend of my family. I was
  likewise deeply moved a little later by the injurious injustice
  done not only to Captain Dreyfus<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>
  but also to persons less in the public eye. Nevertheless during
  the whole period of my preparation for a professorship through
  advanced studies in law and letters, because of a sort of
  reticence or even distrust of my impulses, I avoided dealing with
  subjects of an avowedly political nature, even though the
  technical law of contracts and obligations is of course dominated
  by moral principles, notably that of good faith. Similarly, the
  problem of the rights of the state in the disposition of
  inheritances left by individuals presents social aspects of the
  first importance.</p>

  <p>It was really the War of 1914-1918 which
  upset my temporarily comfortable moral equilibrium, or - to be
  less severe on myself - my carefully disciplined self-limitation.
  <i>That war put its indelible and unmistakable stump on me, as it
  did on many of my contemporaries.</i> But it wasn't so much the
  spectacular horror of the battlefields or the suffering in the
  hospitals that marked us, as it was the agonized perception of
  the lasting and wasteful consequences of the war: the disabled
  soldiers, the families deprived of their last supporting member -
  dead for the welfare of all. I was not able to accept the idea
  that national solidarity with those victims should limit itself
  to a kind of charitable alms. That is why I soon joined those who
  fought - and victoriously - for recognition of the right to
  compensation for personal damages incurred in the service of the
  national community. Human dignity and the general welfare of our
  country, then depleted in-manpower, demanded that, in addition to
  being given the traditional pensions, our numerous disabled
  veterans be reintegrated into society by such measures as
  artificial limb banks, professional retraining programs, and
  loans for establishing small businesses, and that our 800.000
  orphaned minors be brought up and educated under the special
  protection of the nation.</p>

  <p>It was as a result of that first
  undertaking that my most eminent colleagues and I <i>decided it
  was essential to go back to first principles and to foster
  respect for the supreme commitment</i> of those who had
  sacrificed themselves that this war might be "the last". As soon
  as the compensatory legislation was assured passage, we began to
  lay the groundwork for the future.</p>

  <p>Our first gesture was to support the
  creation of the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1969/index.html">International Labor
  Organization</a><a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> by bringing
  together, as early as 1921, representatives of the disabled
  veterans organizations from the two sides so recently enemies.
  Under the auspices of Albert Thomas<a href=
  "#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> we began to coordinate our social
  legislation, both that already in effect and that in the planning
  stage, and also to coordinate our needs for and our aspirations
  toward peace.</p>

  <p>We were thus led to organize ourselves, as
  men who had fought the war together, in order to support those
  statesmen who had truly understood the lessons of that World War,
  thus attempting to prevent its recurrence. The extent of our
  effort was vividly indicated by the massive enrollment of our
  French veterans groups into the French Association for the League
  of Nations in 1922 and by the founding during 1925-1926 of a
  Conf&eacute;rence internationale des associations des mutil&eacute;s
  et d'anciens combattants (CIAMAC) [International Confederation of
  Disabled Veterans], whose deeply sincere leaders risked their
  influence, their freedom, and often their lives when the
  hate-mongers and the champions of violence raised their heads
  once again and seized power in Germany and elsewhere. Personally,
  I have never forgotten the speech made at Munich in that black
  year of 1934 - on July 6, 1934, to be exact - by Rudolph
  Hess<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>, the friend of Hitler, in
  which he announced that the Nazi regime, already the abettor of
  widely publicized assassinations, was preparing to break down the
  morale of veterans in free countries; he was only too correct,
  alas! It was in vain that some of us attempted to ward off this
  preparatory maneuver toward future wars of aggression.</p>

  <p>The peacemaking efforts of the CIAMAC at
  that time were brought to the attention of the Nobel Peace Prize
  Committee. But the invasion of Poland had already begun to set
  Europe aflame. As a privileged survivor of the First World War, I
  hope I may be allowed to interject here a deeply felt tribute to
  those who were not fortunate enough to succeed, but who shared
  the signal honor of trying to the last to salvage peace.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, crucial problems began to assail the League of
  Nations itself.</p>

  <p>It had finally become necessary to exclude
  Japan. But Hitler's Germany was quite a different matter.
  Concerned over a complaint about violations of agreements on
  minorities, the Geneva Assembly of 1933 settled on a very
  moderate text which invited all states, "whether or not they were
  bound by special covenants", to respect the fundamental rights of
  all those over whom they had jurisdiction. Hitler was unable to
  tolerate such an affirmation. He made it an excuse for a
  clamorous break with the League of Nations and thus escaped any
  check on his then clandestine armament program, which he was
  subsequently to develop on a massive scale.</p>

  <p>I bring this event up not because it was
  the sole cause of the Second World War but because it illuminated
  from that moment on the true nature of all the heinous acts which
  precipitated a catastrophe in which seventy-two million people
  perished. For those peoples forced to fight in order to halt that
  immense machine geared for the destruction of human liberty and
  dignity, the Second World War constituted a genuine "crusade for
  human rights". I also mention it, alas, because today, barely a
  quarter of a century after that victorious crusade, we still hear
  too many national leaders expressing themselves on the subject of
  the absolute and exclusive sovereignty of the state over the
  human beings under its jurisdiction, enunciating principles which
  threaten again to lead the world into a state of anarchy and to
  plunge it into wars, supposedly local and limited in scope, but
  in reality damaging to all of humanity.</p>

  <p>When France resolved, along with England,
  to lend assistance in the legitimate defense of Poland, the
  realization burst on us that a conflict of awesome proportions
  was inevitable. As early as the winter of 1940, but simply as a
  professor, I denounced "the Leviathan State against man and the
  human community"<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and I ranked
  respect for human rights as one of the essential goals of the
  sacrifices to which we were all committed. The following year, in
  September of 1941, having become, after the temporary disaster in
  my country, the representative of Fighting France at the Allied
  Conference in London, I swelled the voices of the occupied
  countries as we joined those of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/index.html">Churchill</a> and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1906/index.html">Roosevelt</a> in
  proclaiming the need to establish all future peace on a basis of
  human rights<a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a>. How is it that,
  once victory took form and the horrible spectacle of the
  extermination camps was revealed, we could have shamelessly
  broken the promises given to the peoples in those years of
  ordeal?</p>

  <p><br>
  I have felt the need to describe - perhaps too lengthily - the
  stages through which my first international activities passed,
  between 1920 and the beginning of the Second World War, before
  going on to consider the importance for international peace of
  respecting the rights of all men, and before devoting myself more
  completely to this vast problem during the rest of my remarks.
  Since the Nobel Committee, through its chairman's speech, has
  fully reviewed the efforts I have been able to make in this
  domain during the last twenty-five years, I shall try to avoid
  chronicling them again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, and principally because
  I consider myself doubly privileged, not only to work in the area
  of human rights, but also to work within it on three separate
  planes - national, international, and regional - I would like to
  draw some conclusions and lessons from the experience I have
  acquired.</p>

  <p>Until 1940, the collective effort of the
  community of man in behalf of human rights had been devoted to
  the struggle against the scourge of slavery and slave-trading,
  with pacts of an humanitarian order ranging from the 1864 Charter
  of the International Red Cross<a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a>
  to the Hague Conventions on the laws of war<a href=
  "#note8"><sup>8</sup></a>. To this nucleus might be added certain
  covenants concerning contagious diseases or those intended to
  curb counterfeiting, the traffic in arms, white slavery, and,
  later, terrorism. Besides these matters, interventions "on behalf
  of humanity" were brought into play occasionally, but they either
  seemed to come too late - the Armenian massacres<a href=
  "#note9"><sup>9</sup></a> - or else they turned into colonialist
  exploitations.</p>

  <p>The Covenant of the League of Nations had
  envisaged sponsoring only the protection of certain categories of
  men: national minorities and populations of territories
  controlled by other countries. The International Labor
  Organization was the only agency with a broad mandate, limited
  moreover to the protection of the rights of workers as such.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, a world which had witnessed the
  serious, systematic, and innumerable violations that could be
  committed at the orders of a veritable gang found itself facing a
  problem of unsuspected amplitude: <i>to protect the whole man and
  to protect the rights of all men.</i> In this light we must not
  be surprised at the hesitation felt by the representatives of all
  nations convened at San Francisco in 1945 to adopt the Charter of
  the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United
  Nations</a>. To be sure, they included, as promised, the respect
  for and the promotion of human rights among the essential ends of
  the new organization, along with international peace. They
  conferred prerogatives in this domain on certain principal
  organs. But they were extremely cautious, if not timid. They did
  not dare to enact precise statements of purpose like those
  stipulated in the Statute of the International Labor
  Organization. They adopted phraseology that was rather weak or
  even equivocal - "to encourage human rights", for example.
  Article 2:7, on matters dealing essentially with the jurisdiction
  of the states, is in contradiction to Articles 13, 65, 56, and 62
  of the Charter. Finally, they did indeed create under Article 68
  a special body to assure the progress of human rights, namely,
  the Commission on Human Rights; but they failed to define its
  powers, with the result that from 1946 on, the Economic and
  Social Council of the United Nations accorded it a status
  identical to that of all the other commissions that are auxiliary
  organs of the United Nations.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of these hesitations and
  of the vague character of such innovations, the Commission on
  Human Rights itself had doubts from the beginning about its role
  and its functions in general. The single outstanding exception
  was the broad yet precise mandate communicated by the General
  Assembly in 1946 to prepare as soon as possible the Charter of
  Human Rights which the San Francisco Conference had not had the
  time or the courage to draw up.</p>

  <p>The Commission, originally composed of
  eighteen members of different nationalities and diverse
  occupations, was guided by an accurate instinct in its decision
  to work out before anything else an international Declaration
  having the character of a manifesto of organized mankind. In less
  than eighteen months, it prepared a first draft which it
  submitted to the General Assembly and which, at the end of one
  hundred sessions of elevated, often impassioned discussion, was
  adopted in the form of thirty articles on December 10, 1948.</p>

  <p>By its very existence this Declaration,
  which was thereafter called "Universal" and which does not have a
  juridically obligatory character, constituted a historical event
  of the first magnitude. It is the first document of an ethical
  sort that organized humanity has ever adopted, and precisely at a
  time when man's power over nature became vastly increased because
  of scientific discoveries and when it was essential to decide to
  what constructive ends these powers should be put. Its moral and
  political repercussions have been considerable. Of the eight
  states<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> abstaining, as against
  forty-eight voting, at the time of the ballot, six invoke the
  Declaration as if they had voted. All the states subsequently
  admitted to the United Nations have actively supported it, if not
  inserted parts of it in their constitutions.</p>

  <p>The Declaration loses none of its authority
  under close analysis. <i>It proclaims as principles the whole
  body of rights and options without whose exercise man cannot
  fully realize his physical, moral, and intellectual
  individuality.</i> After sometimes heated debates in the
  Commission, over which Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt presided from
  beginning to end, the Universal Declaration went even beyond the
  scope of the classic national declarations of England, North
  America, and France concerning corporal, judicial, religious, and
  political liberties. As corollaries to the right of every
  individual to life and to full participation in society, the
  Declaration incorporated in the list of human rights the right to
  work and a certain number of economic, social, and cultural
  rights. In short, thanks to formulas like that of Article 22
  covering the body of these latter rights, it established a
  careful balance between them and the old liberties, a balance
  difficult to establish and to maintain in practice when dependent
  on individual regimes, but a balance of principles set up as an
  ideal for all countries.</p>

  <p>The other salient characteristic of the
  Declaration is its <i>universality: it applies to all human
  beings without any discrimination whatever; it also applies to
  all territories,</i> whatever their economic or political regime.
  It expatiates on the position of the individual in the various
  social groups of which he is a part, especially on his duties to
  the community and the other members of society, but in terms
  postulating a democratic society and excluding the omnipotence of
  a totalitarian state.</p>

  <p>Although the composition and adoption of
  the Declaration were relatively easy and happily successful, it
  is common knowledge that the other two leaves of the triptych
  making up the Charter of Human Rights were much more difficult
  and time-consuming to work out. It was six years before the
  Commission on Human Rights could submit to the Assembly the
  drafts of the twin Covenants it had prepared: one concerning
  civil and political rights; the other concerning economic,
  social, and cultural rights. There were, as a matter of fact, two
  difficulties to surmount.</p>

  <p>The first to be favorably dealt with was
  the problem of deciding whether the right of peoples to
  self-determination, which had previously been considered a
  principle of a political and essentially collective nature,
  should be inserted in the Covenants intended to implement the
  rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration, which was
  concerned only with the rights exercised, separately or
  communally, by the individual. The solution arrived at can be
  explained historically by the movement toward decolonization and,
  more exactly, toward the political emancipation of territorial
  entities, which was a logical outcome of the victorious
  libertarian principles fostered in the course of the Second World
  War.</p>

  <p>Although seemingly of a simple
  methodological character, the second difficulty was resolved only
  after long deliberations at the end of which the General Assembly
  of the United Nations, after having gone on record in 1950 as
  favoring the drafting of a single Covenant embodying all the
  rights proclaimed by the Declaration, changed its mind in 1951
  and thereafter directed the Commission to prepare two separate
  Covenants, each to include substantive provisions on the
  obligations of the state and the respective measures of
  application. In the course of time it has been confirmed that
  this system best fits the peculiarities of each of the two
  categories of rights.</p>

  <p>The debates before the General Assembly of
  the United-Nations went on for eighteen years<a href=
  "#note11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Their slowness can be explained in
  part by the fact that each year the newly independent nations
  which entered the Third Committee of the General Assembly<a href=
  "#note12"><sup>12</sup></a> needed to form an opinion of the
  usefulness of the Covenants in general and of the eventual effect
  of these Covenants on their own institutions. But that
  explanation is only partially valid. The most powerful cause of
  this delay was the desire of certain powers to put off as long as
  possible discussion of the - paradoxically quite modest -
  enforcement measures voted by the Commission on Human Rights,
  which were considered encroachments on the sovereignty of the
  states. The final vote attained unanimity in 1966 only because it
  became inconceivable on the very eve of the International Human
  Rights Year to prolong the filibuster any further. Moreover, a
  heavy price has been paid. The implementation measures of both
  Covenants, but especially those of the Covenant concerning civil
  and political rights, were considerably weakened to the point
  where they assumed an optional character. The only compensation,
  gained through the influence of nongovernmental organizations,
  consisted in slightly broadening for private individuals the
  possibility of access and appeal to the agencies enforcing the
  Covenant concerned with civil and political rights.</p>

  <p>Thus, since the unanimous vote of the
  General Assembly, the Charter of Human Rights has become a
  unified whole. As Secretary-General U Thant stated, "It is
  completed."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Are we justified today, twenty years after
  the Universal Declaration, in declaring ourselves satisfied?</p>

  <p>When one considers the confusion, not to
  say anarchy, from which the nations of the world have just
  emerged, as well as the difficulties that have had to be
  surmounted one after the other, the adoption, however belated, of
  the Charter of Human Rights is a happy event which prepares the
  way for a veritable juridical revolution. Henceforth, there
  should be no doubt about the fundamental question, that of
  knowing whether the various sovereign states have retained or
  lost their traditionally exclusive sphere of authority over the
  manner of dealing with those under their jurisdiction. That
  jurisdiction of the states will always be a fundamental
  principle. It will remain basic. But it will no longer be
  exclusive. It will in some situations, as in the case of a
  complaint formulated under certain conditions and presented
  before certain international agencies, be possible to transfer it
  to these agencies, that is to say to the whole of juridically
  organized mankind. This will mean two things: first, the
  permanent accession of every human being to the rank of member of
  human society - in legal parlance one would say to the rank of
  subject of international law; second, it will mean that the
  states consent to exercise their sovereignty under the authority
  of international law, as Pope John XXIII<a href=
  "#note13"><sup>13</sup></a> pointed out in the Encyclical
  <i>Pacem in terris,</i> which is his testament.</p>

  <p>But is this result within reach? Here we
  must appeal to the sense of responsibility of leaders of peoples
  and at the same time to the aspirations of the common man who
  helps to shape public opinion.</p>

  <p>The delays which hampered the adoption of
  the draft Covenants and the completion of the Charter of Human
  Rights were on the whole very prejudicial to the progress of
  human rights guarantees. They allowed the administrations of all
  countries to revert to old ways of thinking - without formulating
  them in a necessarily threatening manner - very like the ones
  Hitler had expressed at Geneva in 1933 through Goebbels<a href=
  "#note14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, these delays have not
  been fatal for humanity, and their inauspicious effects have been
  mitigated to a certain extent. For one thing, when urgent
  questions were brought up and taken to heart by energetic groups,
  conventions of universal scope on limited areas of concern were
  speedily proposed or even ratified, and are now in force or soon
  will be. I cite as an example slavery, against which a convention
  was adopted in 1956 complementing the agreement of 1926. I might
  also mention several covenants aimed at improving the condition
  of women (with respect to nationality, political rights, freedom
  of consent to marriage, wages, etc.) and the struggle against
  discrimination in employment and job categories (ILO, 1958), and
  in education (UNESCO, 1960 and 1962), and, more recently, against
  racial discrimination, voted on in December, 1965, at the UN, and
  now about to become operative.</p>

  <p>As a valuable compensatory advantage of the
  delays, I call attention to the opportunity thus given to states
  recently come to or returned to independence, to discuss these
  Covenants and to make their contribution to them. No one can
  forget the very active initiative taken by certain delegates of
  these young nations in smoothing out difficulties and carrying
  the final vote.</p>

  <p>The third fact which I feel I should
  emphasize is that on November 4, 1950, the member states of the
  Council of Europe<a href="#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> adopted a
  so-called safeguard of human rights. This European Convention for
  the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which,
  along with its Additional Protocol<a href=
  "#note16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the European Social
  Charter<a href="#note17"><sup>17</sup></a>, aims at the effective
  application of the <i>Universal Declaration,</i> has been in
  force since 1953. It works. It has already had a twofold effect.
  On the one hand, its provisions have been made binding within the
  member nations, thus influencing their national law. On the other
  hand, its execution is under the supervision of European
  institutions created for that purpose: the European Commission of
  Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers, and the European Court
  of Human Rights. These agencies all function smoothly with regard
  to states and individuals. The number of cases submitted to them
  is already considerable. For the first time, one is confronted
  with the orders of a Court - few as they may be - which have
  conclusive authority and which the nations who are parties to the
  Convention find it important to observe punctually,. Despite what
  confirmed pessimists say about the matter, there is at least one
  continent where an impressive array of states has committed
  itself to heeding the lessons of the Second World War.
  Unfortunately it must be conceded that part of Europe remains
  outside the zone of influence of the Convention. Even among the
  members of the Council there is a disparity in the strength of
  their compliance. Eleven states have accepted the possibility of
  complaints being directed against them by individuals or by
  groups. But some have accepted the Convention only insofar as it
  binds them with respect to other states. Two others, including my
  own country, have not yet ratified. And finally, one member state
  is at the present moment the subject of petitions from other
  member states for not respecting the Convention.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At the point now reached, strengthened by
  the experience acquired through continued analysis of the
  situation on three planes - national, international, and regional
  - we are in a position to draw some conclusions.</p>

  <p>First of all, it is essential that a system
  of guarantees, and especially of due process before independent
  judiciaries, be organized within each state for the benefit of
  all individuals, without discrimination. The surest means by
  which <i>a state may avoid outside intervention is to recognize
  and itself insure respect for fundamental rights and liberties in
  the territories under its jurisdiction.</i></p>

  <p>Second, there must be no question of
  permitting any diminution of the universality of the
  <i>Declaration.</i> There are fundamental liberties and rights
  common to all human beings, without possible discrimination. It
  is the most oppressed, the weakest of these individuals who would
  be threatened by any attempts to fragmentize the effective scope
  of the Declaration.</p>

  <p>Third, the universality of the
  Declaration's principles creates no reasonable obstacles to the
  establishment of regional systems for applying those principles.
  Europe has really offered a good example after the turning point
  of 1948, and I, a determined universalist, was able to conclude
  that certain means of implementation are more readily accepted if
  they are organized among neighboring nations of similar culture.
  Communities of law and customs are not invented arbitrarily. It
  is to be hoped that the New World will also form regional
  associations. In Asia, Africa, and the socialist world these
  concepts are being discussed. But there are as yet no
  results.</p>

  <p>In the fourth place, it is extremely
  desirable that the Charter of Human Rights go into effect as soon
  as possible. To accomplish that, the ratification of thirty-five
  states of the world is necessary for each Covenant. At the
  present time, to my knowledge, not a single government has
  ratified, even with reservations. So let us not allow it to be
  said that the United Nations Organization is at fault and does
  nothing; the jurists have, for the moment, done their part. It is
  up to public opinion everywhere to persuade the various
  governments to do theirs.</p>

  <p>At this point I should like to address a
  special appeal to the European peoples. Despite the benefits
  received from most of the guarantees of the regional 1950
  Convention, the differences which separate this text from that of
  the Universal Covenant on civil and political rights are not, in
  the considered judgment of European governmental experts, so
  significant that they present serious obstacles to a ratification
  of this Covenant by the European states.</p>

  <p>It would be a magnificent example to give
  to all peoples if they acted in concert for such a ratification.
  It seems to me that they would insure a sorely needed future for
  human rights on the other continents. This Covenant's becoming
  operative constitutes, in my opinion, the most important advance
  for which we can hope in the immediate future.</p>

  <p>I have until now confined my conclusions to
  matters concerning the Universal Declaration and the Covenants in
  general, or to limited consequential objectives.</p>

  <p>Nongovernmental civic organizations should
  not cease studying projects for broader juridical reform - such
  as the creation of a High Commissioner of Human Rights, a freer
  access for individuals to the channels of international recourse,
  the establishment of an International Court of Criminal Law, and
  others - but I think it is essential that they concentrate their
  main effort for as long a time as necessary to bring about
  tangible results from this work already done by the United
  Nations. Then, when the mechanisms provided by the Covenants have
  been tested in practice, it will be time to coordinate and
  reinforce them. Not to implement the measures already worked out,
  even if they are insufficient, would be playing into the hands of
  those who wish to block any progress. I do not believe there will
  be any "nights of August fourth" in this tense and bitter world
  of uneasy transition. We must seize every opportunity to
  strengthen its unity.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in addition to this crucial
  problem of the implementation of the agreements, several others
  should be faced without delay.</p>

  <p>One of them is restating the role and the
  methods of the Commission on Human Rights. After the
  accomplishment of its mandate to draft the Declaration and the
  Covenants, this agency has very properly continued to work on the
  preparation of a whole series of conventions against
  discrimination of various kinds. But for the last two years it
  has been groping its way and has been tending to become an agency
  for providing information or advice on specific cases, a function
  which is not outside its theoretical role but which it is not
  equipped to handle efficiently. It is necessary, too, that the
  Commission stress its essentially significant role of examiner of
  the periodic reports which the states must file on the manner in
  which they respect human rights. It is the responsibility of the
  chairman of the Commission to see that their obligations are
  met.</p>

  <p>Other even more urgent measures must, it
  seems to me, be taken to protect the agents and the activities of
  the International Red Cross. Since the Geneva Conventions of
  1949, the role of the Red Cross has been expanded to include all
  cases of armed conflict, even those not designated as foreign
  wars. Now several times in the last few years and most recently
  in Biafra, it has been authenticated that agents of the Red Cross
  sent on humanitarian missions were molested, threatened, or even
  killed, and that it has sometimes been necessary to withdraw them
  to insure their safety.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to read or to hear
  such accounts without shame. In my opinion there is no task of
  safeguarding human rights more urgent than that of foreseeing
  such outrages and preventing them. Humanity owes it to itself to
  watch over, guard, and protect those who represent it and who
  devote their lives to beneficent activities. I have been able
  today to approach only a single, if vast, aspect of the
  conditions of international peace. It would be shortsighted of
  anyone to forget the others, such as education, disarmament,
  technical and financial cooperation.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, of course, the organizing of
  peace must be based on considerations of reason and concern. It
  presupposes tremendous efforts to modify through education some
  longstanding mental attitudes - to work toward limitation of
  armaments, to manifest solidarity with the hungry, to cooperate
  in the strengthening of family or societal units. But reason
  alone is not enough. Emotional factors and especially the sense
  of justice must not be left to those who pervert them to the
  service of hate and destruction.</p>

  <p>It is with great feeling that I take my
  leave of this country where peace and law are so highly esteemed.
  So perhaps you will permit a French citizen committed to the
  service of peace and law to recall, as indicative of faith in
  mankind, these two lines from a French poet who received one of
  the first prizes, the Nobel Prize in Literature<a href=
  "#note18"><sup>18</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <span class="quote">My country imbues me with a love that
    overflows its borders,<br>
    And the more French I am, the more I feel a part of
    mankind</span><a href="#note19"><sup>19</sup></a>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>During the years of anguish when the
  freedom of whole peoples was in jeopardy, they were asked to
  persevere to the last. The time has come to proclaim that, for
  the establishment of peace and human dignity, each of us must
  work and fight to the last.</p>
