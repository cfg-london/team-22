  <h1>George Wald - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wald.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George Wald</b> was born in New York
  City on November 18th, 1906, of immigrant parents, Isaac, who had
  come from a village near Przemysl, in what was then Austrian
  Poland, and Ernestine Rosenmann, from a small village near
  Munich, in Bavaria. After attending public primary and secondary
  I schools in Brooklyn, he received the degree of Bachelor of
  Science from Washington Square College of New York University in
  1927; and then took graduate work in zoology at Columbia
  University, from which he received the Ph.D. in 1932. During
  this graduate period he was a student and research assistant of
  Professor Selig Hecht.<br>
  <br>
  On receiving the Ph. D. he was awarded a National
  Research Council Fellowship in Biology (1932-1934). This was
  begun in the laboratory of <a href="../1931/index.html">Otto
  Warburg</a> in Berlin-Dahlem and it was there that Dr.Wald first
  identified vitamin A in the retina. Vitamin A had just been
  isolated in the laboratory of Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1937/index.html">Paul Karrer</a> in Zurich,
  and Dr. Wald went to Karrer's laboratory to complete the
  identification. That done, he spent a period in the laboratory of
  <a href="../1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a>, at the Kaiser
  Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg. The second year of the
  fellowship was spent in the laboratories of the Department of
  Physiology at the University of Chicago.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Wald came to Harvard in the fall of 1934 as a tutor in
  Biochemical Sciences and has been there ever since; as Instructor
  and Tutor in Biology (1935-1939); Faculty Instructor (1939-1944);
  Associate Professor (1944-1948); and Professor of Biology (since
  1948). He was visiting Professor of Biochemistry at the
  University of California for the summer term, 1956.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 Dr. Wald received the Eli Lilly Award for
  &laquo;Fundamental Research in Biochemistry&raquo; from the
  American Chemical Society. In 1952 he toured the Southwest as a
  National Sigma Xi lecturer. In 1953 he received the Lasker Award
  of the American Public Health Association &laquo;in recognition of
  his outstanding discoveries in biochemistry with special
  reference to the changes associated with vision and the function
  of vitamin A&raquo;.In 1955 he was awarded the Proctor Medal of
  the Association for Research in Ophthalmology, and in 1959 the
  Rumford Medal by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In
  1966 he was awarded the Ives Medal of the Optical Society of
  America; and in May, 1967, jointly with his wife Ruth Hubbard,
  the Paul Karrer Medal by the University of Zurich. In 1967 he was
  awarded the T. Duckett Jones Memorial Award from the Whitney
  Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Wald was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1950 and to the
  American Philosophical Society in 1958. He is a
  Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston, and
  of the Optical
  Society of America. In 1963-1964 he was a Guggenheim Fellow,
  spending the year at Cambridge University, England.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957 Dr. Wald received the honorary degree of M. D. from the
  University of
  Berne; in 1958 an honorary D. Sc. from Yale University; in
  1962 honorary D. Sc. from Wesleyan University; in 1965 honorary D. Sc.
  from New York
  University; in 1966 honorary D. Sc. from McGill Univ.; 1968 D.
  Sc. from Clark
  Univ. and from Amherst College.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Wald is a member of the American Society of Biological
  Chemists; the Optical Society of America; the Assoc. for Research in
  Ophthalmology; Sigma Xi; American Chemical Society; and the A.A.A.S.</p>
