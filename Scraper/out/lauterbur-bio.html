  <h1>Paul C. Lauterbur - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="lauterbur.jpg" class="bio-img">My 
                ancestors apparently emigrated from Europe in the middle of the 
                19th century; the Lauterburs probably from Luxembourg, and my 
                mother's people, Wagners and Weingartners, from Baden-Baden or 
                nearby. They settled in northern Ohio, where my mother's father, 
                Hans Christian Wagner, married Margaret (Maggie) Weingartner. 
                They lived in Tiffin, Ohio when I was a child, where they had 
                raised my mother, Gertrude Frieda Wagner, her twin brother Joseph, 
                and their youngest child, who became a nun with the name Mary 
                Monica. Nearby lived my grandfather Paul Lauterbur who married 
                a woman of Irish descent, Margaret Hillan. They eventually moved 
                south to Sidney, Ohio and had a number of children, of whom my 
                father, Edward Joseph Lauterbur, was the youngest. He later married 
                Gertrude Wagner (the families seem always to have been acquainted) 
                and they had four children, Thomas who died shortly after birth, 
                me, my younger brother Edward Joseph Lauterbur II (Joe) and my 
                sister Margaret.</p>
              <p>We grew up in a house in Sidney complete with 
                a series of dogs, and as the years went by, birds, turtles, newts, 
                fish, snakes, and other animals, and with interesting yards full 
                of trees, bushes and flowers, as well as a nearby park, open spaces 
                and neighbors, some of whom did not resent children trespassing 
                on their property. It was, in memory, an idyllic time. My father 
                worked in the town, as an engineer and part-owner of the Peerless 
                Bread Machinery Company, and my mother kept house with help of 
                a young woman who did some domestic chores and sometimes cared 
                for the children. Although I attended a parochial school, Holy 
                Angels School, I recall little of it except that the nuns who 
                taught there seemed to value order and discipline over all else, 
                which made it especially desirable to evade their control. More 
                influential in my later interests was, I believe, my aunt Anna 
                Lauterbur, who taught in the demonstration school at Ball State 
                Teachers College (now Ball State University) in Muncie, Indiana, 
                just west of the Ohio-Indiana border. She was fascinated by natural 
                history, always kept a terrarium in her elementary school classroom, 
                and gave me a subscription to Natural History magazine. A very 
                gentle person, always willing to listen to a child, she was my 
                favorite aunt.</p>
              <p>Because of my parents' hobby of horseback 
                riding, they had bought a farm just outside of town, and we moved 
                there just as I was transferring to the public high school. The 
                farm, with an old but remodeled house, a barn, various outbuildings, 
                fields, woods, and a little creek, was a small paradise to a teenage 
                boy, even though I acquired many duties, such as caring for the 
                horses, mowing the lawn, cultivating the garden, and helping with 
                harvesting. There was also time, of course, for hunting and fishing, 
                collecting snakes, turtles and caterpillars to raise to butterflies 
                or moths, and for general exploration. School was now more interesting 
                also. Not only did I take up the game of chess as a freshman, 
                but I beat the local champions at it, to their great disgust because 
                they were seniors, and then moved on to play a local adult expert, 
                one of the teachers. Classes were a mixture of pleasure and boredom. 
                One of my teachers, who taught biology and chemistry, had the 
                foresight to excuse me and some of my classmates, who were members 
                of the local science club, from his lectures, so that we were 
                free to use the time to do experiments, both standard and wild, 
                in the school lab. He also had the courage to intervene when some 
                of the dangerous ones came to the attention of the school authorities 
                and we could have been expelled.</p>
              <p>I met him again recently, and his son recalled 
                that when told of my Nobel Prize, he said, "I always knew he would 
                do something like that." After graduating from high school, I 
                went on to Case Institute of Technology, an engineering school 
                now part of Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, 
                about 200 miles north-east of Sidney. My father had recommended 
                it, because, as he observed, he didn't know what scientists did 
                for a living, but engineers could always get a job. But, given 
                a choice of majors, I chose chemistry.</p>
              <p>I had had so-called "chemistry sets" of simple 
                chemicals and apparatus since my earliest years (I particularly 
                liked the pungent smell of burning sulfur), and my own home laboratories 
                even before high school. The curriculum at Case was quite general, 
                including all forms of science (except biology) and engineering, 
                including civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical, and all 
                of the related technologies such as surveying, mechanical drawing, 
                as well as seemingly endless labs of all kinds, for which I have 
                always been grateful. In addition to the excitement and drudgery 
                of academics, there were also the pleasures and stresses of fraternity 
                life, girls, and culture, as well as new friends and foods. Continuing 
                my habit of doing things a little differently than expected, I 
                wrote a Senior Thesis on my attempt to make an organosilicon free 
                radical, but the advisor for it was an organic chemist who specialized 
                in natural products.</p>
              <p>When I graduated (with a B.S. in chemistry, 
                because I did not qualify for an engineering degree as I had replaced 
                a Unit Operations laboratory course with a graduate course in 
                Quantum Chemistry), I was tired of lectures and professors, and 
                determined to get back to lab work. I knew little about graduate 
                study and the structure of a scientific career, so I accepted 
                an offer to work for the Dow Corning Corporation in their Mellon 
                Institute laboratories, where the emphasis was more scientific 
                than technical. I was also told that I could take graduate courses 
                at the University of Pittsburgh free as an Institute employee. 
                There was much interesting work, I found, in our group at the 
                Institute. Organosilicon synthesis, theories of rubber elasticity, 
                techniques of vacuum distillation, elastomer testing, all were 
                new to me and endlessly stimulating. I was particularly fascinated 
                by the puzzle of how small particles strengthened rubber. I even 
                managed to overcome my distaste for academics and take a few courses.</p>
              <p>It had long been known that "carbon black" 
                dramatically improved the properties of natural or synthetic organic 
                rubbers, and it had been found that the same was true for silicone 
                elastomers if small particles of silica were used instead of carbon, 
                but not whether surface chemistry was involved or simply physical 
                properties. I addressed one aspect of the problem by substituting 
                phthalocyanine dyes for silica, and they worked perfectly, with 
                their effectiveness decreasing as predicted when the particle 
                size was increased by recrystalization from liquid hydrogen fluoride. 
                Unfortunately, I never achieved a theoretical understanding of 
                the effect, despite intense study of elastomer theory, but I had 
                bright blue rubber and skin.</p>
              <p>During that period, I also began to learn 
                about nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) from various visitors and 
                speakers, and to read a little about that new form of spectroscopy 
                as well. It seemed ideally suited, even at that early date, for 
                investigating the structures and electron distributions in molecules, 
                and various physical properties of materials. Therefore, as part 
                of my graduate education at the University of Pittsburgh, in addition 
                to a "literature seminar" on interstellar molecules, I gave one 
                on a paper describing NMR properties of rubber. Before I could 
                begin a planned collaboration on the hydrogen NMR spectroscopy 
                of silicon compounds, however, my deferments came to an end and 
                I was drafted into the Army and my eventual assignment was proposed 
                to be in the SPP (Scientific and Professional Personnel) program, 
                which my B.S. and two years of work experience qualified me for.</p>
              <p>First, however, I was assigned by mistake 
                to a tank battalion at Fort Knox, Kentucky. After hastily correcting 
                that error, I was given eight weeks of minimal basic training 
                and assigned to the SPP program, as planned, at the Army Chemical 
                Center in Edgewood, Maryland. My specific assignment there was 
                in the Medical Laboratories, where I learned to operate an electron 
                microscope to measure the properties of small aerosol particles 
                meant to carry chemical warfare agents deep into the lungs, and 
                I also proposed, and began to set up, a light scattering apparatus 
                to quantitate vapor absorption on aerosol particles. Another aspect 
                of my duties was to capture and weigh experimental animals meant 
                for chemical weapons testing, so that I became skilled, for example, 
                at catching goats in an open field, for which my farm experience 
                was useful. In time, I learned, from a fellow draftee in my barracks, 
                a Columbia Ph.D., that his unit had purchased an NMR machine, 
                but didn't know how to use it. I said, "Hey, I know all about 
                that!", and managed a transfer to help set it up, and arranged 
                for one of my science club buddies, Marlon Shepard, from high 
                school, who had also just been drafted, to join me in the lab, 
                where, among others, we had a drafted Harvard Ph.D. in physical 
                chemistry, Norbert Muller, later a professor at Purdue for many 
                years. We got to work enthusiastically, and I eventually published 
                four papers from our work there, which had turned into a rather 
                unusual opportunity for a young soldier. Perhaps, even more important 
                for my future, I received at least second-hand scraps of a Harvard 
                education, especially the attitudes, from Nobby Muller.</p>
              <p>When I was mustered out of the Army, I had 
                to decide where to go next. I even considered regular full-time 
                graduate school, but the appeal of Mellon Institute as a familiar 
                supportive working environment won out, especially after my group 
                agreed to buy me my own NMR machine. When I returned to the Institute 
                I arranged that requisition, tested the machine on a standard 
                organosilicon compound (polydimethylsiloxane) at the manufacturer's 
                laboratory and factory, and impatiently did the initial installation 
                itself when it was delivered. The first critical experiments I 
                did, however, were on 13-C NMR by retuning the instrument, as 
                I had calculated that, if 29-Si resonances could be seen, so could 
                those of 13-C, and a much larger variety of stable carbon compounds 
                existed than of silicon compounds.</p>
              <p>My first work in that area, a broad survey 
                of carbon compounds, led to many other publications on various 
                classes of organic chemicals, work that absorbed much of my attention 
                for several years and eventually provided the basis for my Ph.D. 
                dissertation. Finally completing those requirements was stimulated 
                in part by my learning of an academic job offer to me that was 
                planned but never made, because the department learned that I 
                did not yet have the degree, and I had begun to be dissatisfied 
                with Mellon Institute because of some restrictions they had placed 
                on my activities. After I obtained that degree, I looked at several 
                opportunities and selected one in academia, because, as I remarked, 
                "I wanted to be free to try any silly thing I decided to do." 
                One unexpected feature of the job offer, at the State University 
                of New York at Stony Brook, was that it was for the rank of associate 
                professor, so that I went directly to that level, and almost automatic 
                tenure soon after, without even a post-doctorate appointment. 
                I set up another new NMR lab there, and also began to learn the 
                duties and problems of university life while helping to build 
                the department and the institution, and especially, learning to 
                work with students, by that time having gotten over my own distaste 
                for professors by becoming one myself.</p>
              <p>During the academic year 1969-1970, I took 
                my first sabbatical leave, spending it in Palo Alto, California, 
                in the group of John Baldeschwieler in the Chemistry Department 
                at Stanford. In addition to the scientific opportunities and satisfactions, 
                there were personal activities as well. I had married Rose Mary 
                Caputo in 1962, and although she was not in good health, we sometimes 
                visited San Francisco and we had two children, Dan and Sharon 
                (who later renamed herself Sharyn) who enjoyed the nearly perpetual 
                summer there. I had an undergraduate student doing work back in 
                Stony Brook who began a new project in my lab there, calculating 
                hypothetical 13-C spectra of denatured proteins from data for 
                amino acid spectra. Two graduate students, José Ramirez and Skip 
                Hutton, also remained to continue their research, mostly of isotope 
                effects on NMR spectra, and I flew back to Stony Brook almost 
                once a month to stay in touch with these activities.</p>
              <p>Back in Stanford, I was trying some new NMR-related 
                things. I went up to the Syntex research labs nearby and began 
                research on 3-H NMR of tritriumlabeled pharmaceuticals. Only one 
                paper on tritrium NMR of organic compounds, by George Tiers, had 
                appeared, so our discovery that one of the "standards" provided 
                to us by Syntex was apparently not labeled in the position they 
                thought it was interfered with our publishing those observations 
                in the limited time we had available, but led to my later setting 
                up a lab, with a chemistry colleague at Stony Brook, to do more 
                such work. I also began collaborative studies at Varian Associates, 
                in that manufacturer's service labs, of natural abundance 13C 
                NMR spectroscopy of the protein lysozyme in their experimental 
                new superconducting spectrometer, and published the first paper 
                on that subject. I was also working in a lab in the Stanford Medical 
                Center to learn to label a protein, ribonuclease A, with 13C at 
                each of its four methionine residues for eventual NMR study. And, 
                I suppose just to keep busy, I was working with my host, John 
                Baldeschiwieler, and a previous visitor, Barry Shapiro, to his 
                group and friend of mine from Mellon Institute days, to commercialize 
                13C isotope-enrichment technology developed at Los Alamos National 
                Laboratories. We even started a company, "Kivatec," to use Los 
                Alamos underground distillation methods for that purpose.</p>
              <p>It is clear that I was actively beginning 
                to consider biomedical NMR as a new area for application of my 
                skills and knowledge of NMR, partly stimulated by the activities 
                of Oleg Jardetzky, a new member of the Stanford faculty. My intense 
                and detailed involvement in biomedical applications of NMR came, 
                however, from an entirely unexpected direction.</p>
              <p>After I returned to Stony Brook, by a long, 
                leisurely automobile drive from California with my family, and 
                settled in again to my department (where I found the same arguments 
                continuing that had been going on when I left) another unexpected 
                event occurred. It had its beginning several years earlier, when 
                a field service engineer for Varian, the leading NMR company, 
                saw an opportunity and asked for my opinion on his idea of starting 
                his own company to make or distribute specialized NMR equipment 
                and supplies. His business plan seemed reasonable, and I encouraged 
                him to go ahead. For a time the company thrived, and I was a member 
                of the Board of Directors.</p>
              <p>In May of 1971, however, some other members 
                of the board compared notes with the company's banker and found 
                that the company had engaged in some very dubious business practices 
                and was, in fact, bankrupt. At a hastily-called Board meeting, 
                appropriate actions were weighed, and the banker, there as a guest, 
                threatened to close the company that day unless someone he trusted 
                could be persuaded to take over as President, Chairman of the 
                Board, and Chief Executive Officer. I was the only academic on 
                the Board, the semester had just ended, and the others believed 
                that I was free for the summer, so that I was asked to take the 
                job. I agreed, flew to the company headquarters in New Kensington, 
                PA, near Pittsburgh, at the beginning of each week and back to 
                Stony Brook and my family and students for the weekend.</p>
              <p>The developments at the company could supply 
                the plot for a novel, but the incident that is important for my 
                purpose here is that a post-doc arrived with tumor-bearing rats 
                to check the proton NMR relaxation times of their tumors and normal 
                tissues and organs. I was there to observe the experiments, and 
                noted that large and consistent differences were observed for 
                specimens from all parts of the sacrificed animals and that the 
                experiments seemed well-done. Some individuals were speculating 
                that similar measurements might supplement or replace the observations 
                of cell structure in tissues by pathologists, but the invasive 
                nature of the animal procedure was distasteful to me, the data 
                too complex, and the sources of differences too obscure, to be 
                relied upon for medical decisions. As I pondered the problem that 
                evening, I realized that there might be a way to locate the precise 
                origins of NMR signals in complex objects, and hence to form an 
                image of their distributions in two or even three dimensions. 
                That story, and its consequences, is told more fully elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Shortly afterwards, I returned to my university 
                for the fall semester, and a colleague took over my company responsibilities. 
                The beginning of the new academic year was a very busy time, and 
                I found some quiet moments to test my ideas about a mathematical 
                approach to such imaging during attendance at seminars and then 
                to consider other practical aspects of the idea as the semester 
                proceeded. In the meantime, I began dropping in on the new medical 
                library of the university, which I passed each morning on the 
                way to work, to spend a few minutes reading, in journals and books, 
                about new developments, problems, and questions in medicine that 
                a new imaging method might address. As I became more confident 
                that these techniques could be both practical and useful, I gradually 
                reoriented most of my research in that direction, then spent almost 
                30 years on developing its techniques and applications, while 
                chemistry as such became mostly a subject to be taught to students.</p>
              <p>An exception, later to be significant, was 
                my general interest in evolution and the origin of life, a topic 
                that I addressed in guest lectures in my university and in selected 
                teaching experiments for undergraduate laboratories. During this 
                period, of course, my children were growing up, as they do, but 
                my marriage was disintegrating. I began to be recognized for my 
                imaging work, and my earlier scientific accomplishments began 
                to be overshadowed by this new direction. At the same time, my 
                efforts to expand the imaging studies, now named MRI by medical 
                doctors, began to be seriously inhibited by administrative and 
                political problems at Stony Brook. My marriage ended in divorce, 
                and I formed a new personal attachment with Joan Dawson, an American 
                physiologist, working at University College, London, whose field 
                was muscle biophysics and physiology, as studied mostly by NMR. 
                If we were to be together, either she needed a new position at 
                Stony Brook or we both needed new jobs elsewhere. After looking 
                at several possibilities, and getting married in 1984, we accepted 
                offers at the University of Illinois.</p>
              <p>We moved to Urbana in 1985, with a new baby 
                and high hopes for our professional lives, which were immediately 
                dashed. A plan to share our time between the Urbana and Chicago 
                campuses was foreclosed by technical and political problems in 
                Chicago, and my intended equipment in Urbana, a new whole-body 
                MRI machine associated with a hospital there, was unavailable 
                because of a legal dispute. That problem was never resolved. The 
                hospital eventually sold the machine, but I obtained a small animal-scale 
                machine from the university and began new experiments. My laboratory 
                was organized as the Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, 
                initially located in a rented building near campus. When the landlord, 
                a hospital, decided to demolish the building to further its own 
                plans, a small new building was built for my laboratory.</p>
              <p>In the late nineteen nineties, that building, 
                including my office, my laboratories, my staff, and all of my 
                equipment, including that provided from university funds in 1985 
                and those items purchased from external grants over the years, 
                were transferred to another university operation. My wife and 
                I considered looking for new positions, but, in addition to having 
                spent a great deal of time and money building a house, our daughter 
                was in a very good high school, so we stayed. I had a joint appointment 
                in the Department of Chemistry, and moved there, because I had 
                already begun to think about a new approach to the origin of biology 
                from chemistry and wanted to pursue that line of research. Thus, 
                by the time the long-awaited Nobel Prize for MRI was awarded, 
                I had left that field for another (and my daughter had entered 
                college). I am now not only actively pursuing my new research 
                interests, but learning the new skills in time management required 
                of a Nobel Laureate.</p>
