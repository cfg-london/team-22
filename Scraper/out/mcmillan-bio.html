  <h1>Edwin M. McMillan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mcmillan.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Edwin Mattison McMillan</b>
  was born on 18th September, 1907, at Redondo Beach, California.
  He is the son of Dr. Edwin Harbaugh McMillan, a physician, and
  his wife, Anne Marie McMillan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mattison, who both
  came from the State of Maryland and were both of English and
  Scottish descent. The boy spent his early years in Pasadena,
  California, and obtained his education in that state.<br>
  <br>
  McMillan attended the California Institute of Technology, obtaining a
  B.Sc. degree in 1928, and taking his M.Sc. degree a year later,
  then transferring to Princeton
  University for Ph.D. in 1932. The same year he entered the
  University of
  California at Berkeley as a National Research Fellow. The
  thesis he submitted for Ph.D. was in the field of molecular
  beams, and the problem he undertook as a National Research Fellow
  was the measurement of the magnetic moment of the proton by a
  molecular beam method. After two years on this work and one as a
  research associate he became a Staff Member of the Radiation
  Laboratory under Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1939/index.html">E.O. Lawrence</a>, studying
  nuclear reactions and their products, and helping in the design
  and construction of cyclotrons and other equipment, and a member
  of the Faculty in the Department of Physics at Berkely, being
  appointed Instructor in 1935, Assistant Professor in 1936,
  Associate Professor, 1941, and Professor in 1946.<br>
  <br>
  During the Second World War, McMillan was on leave from November,
  1940, to September, 1945, engaged on national defence research,
  serving (1940-1941) in the Radiation Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology; (1941-1942) U. S. Navy Radio and Sound
  Laboratory, San Diego; (1942-1945) Manhattan District, Los
  Alamos.<br>
  <br>
  It was during 1945 that he had the idea of "phase stability"
  which led to the development of the synchroton and
  synchro-cyclotron; these machines have already extended the
  energies of artificially accelerated particles into the region of
  hundreds of MeV and have made possible many important
  researches.<br>
  <br>
  McMillan returned to the University of California Radiation
  Laboratory as Associate Director from 1954-1958, when he was
  raised to Deputy Director and finally Director, in the same
  year.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951 he received the 1950 Research Corporation Scientific
  Award, and in 1963 he shared the Atoms for Peace Award with
  Professor V. I. Veksler.<br>
  <br>
  Professor McMillan is a Fellow of the American Physical Society
  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the
  National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical
  Society, and from 1954-1958 he served on the General Advisory
  Committee to the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1960 he was
  appointed to the Commission on High Energy Physics of the
  International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.<br>
  <br>
  An honorary doctorate in science was awarded to him by the
  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1961, and by Gustavus Adolphus
  College in 1963.<br>
  <br>
  While serving in the Faculty of Physics at Berkeley, McMillan
  married Elsie Walford Blumer, a daughter of Dr. George Blumer,
  Dean Emeritus of the Yale Medical School. There are three
  children of the marriage - Ann Bradford (1943), David Mattison
  (1945) and Stephen Walker (1949).</p>
