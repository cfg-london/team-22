  <h2>Inhibition as a Coordinative Factor</h2>

  <p>That a muscle on irritation of its nerve
  contracts had already long been familiar to physiology when the
  19th century found a nerve which when irritated prevented its
  muscle from contracting. This observation seemed for a time too
  strange to be believed. Its truth did not gain acceptance for ten
  years; but at last in 1848 the Webers accepted the fact at its
  face value and proclaimed the vagus nerve to be inhibitory of the
  heart muscle. Two hundred years earlier Descartes, in writing the
  <i>De Homine</i>, had assumed that muscle was supplied with
  nerves which caused muscular relaxation. An analogous suggestion
  was put forward by Charles Bell in 1819. The inhibition suggested
  was in each case "peripheral". "Peripheral" inhibition, despite
  its inherent probability, was however to prove void of the fact
  for skeletal muscle. As just said, it did in fact prove true for
  the heart; it was found somewhat later to hold good likewise for
  visceral muscle; and, somewhat later still, was found for the
  constrictor muscles of the blood vessels. Peripheral inhibition
  became thus by the sixties and seventies of the 19th century a
  recognized fact, save for the one important exception of the
  skeletal muscles.</p>

  <p>The first experimental indication of
  inhibition as a process working <i>within</i> the nervous system
  itself appeared in 1863. Setschenov then noted in the frog that
  the local reflexes of the limb are depressed by stimulation of
  the exposed midbrain. Later (1881), somewhat similarly,
  stimulation of the foot (dog) was found to restrain movements of
  the foot excited from the brain (Bubnoff and Heidenhain). Matters
  had, broadly put, reached and remained at that stage, when in the
  century's last decade experimental examination of mammalian
  reflexes detected (1892) examples of inhibition of surprising
  potency and machine-like regularity, readily obtainable from the
  mammalian spinal cord in its action on the extensors of the hind
  limb; the inhibitory relaxation of the extension was linked with
  concomitant reflex contraction of their antagonistic muscles, the
  flexors. This "reciprocal innervation" was quickly found to be of
  wide occurrence in reflex actions operating the skeletal
  musculature. Its openness to examination in preparations with
  "tonic" background (decerebrate rigidity) made it a welcome and
  immediate opportunity for the more precise study of inhibition as
  a central nervous process.</p>

  <p>The seat of this inhibition was soon shown
  to be central, e.g. for spinal reflexes, in the grey matter of
  the spinal cord. The resulting relaxation of the muscle was found
  to be both in range and nicety as amenable to grading as is
  reflex contraction itself. In other words the inhibitory process
  was found capable of no less delicate quantitative adjustment
  than is the excitatory process. In "reciprocal innervation" the
  two effects, excitation and inhibition, ran broadly <i>pari
  passu</i>; a weak stimulus evoked weak inhibitory relaxation
  along with weak excitatory contraction in the antagonist muscle;
  a strong stimulus evoked greater and quicker relaxation
  accompanying greater and speedier contraction of the antagonist.
  No evidence was forthcoming that the centripetal nervous impulses
  which on their central arrival give rise to inhibition differ in
  nature from nerve impulses giving rise centrally to "excitation",
  or indeed differ from the impulses travelling nerve fibres
  elsewhere. An "inhibitory" afferent nerve emerged simply as an
  afferent nerve whose impulses at certain central loci cause,
  directly or indirectly, inhibition, while at other central loci
  the same nerve, probably even the same nerve fibre can produce
  excitation. There was no satisfactory evidence that an afferent
  nerve fibre whose end-effect is inhibitory ever for its
  end-effect at that same locus evokes excitation or indeed any
  other effect than inhibition. That is to say its inhibitory
  influence never changes to an excitatory influence, or vice
  versa. Fixity of central effect, inhibitory or excitatory
  respectively, has to be accepted for the individual afferent
  fibre acting in a specified direction, i.e. on a specified
  individual effector unit. That does not of course exclude the
  contingency that an inhibitory influence on a given unit may
  under some circumstances be unable to produce effective
  inhibition there owing to its being too weak to overcome
  concurrent excitation.</p>

  <p>I will not dwell upon the features of
  reciprocal innervation; they are well known. I would only remark
  that owing to the wide occurrence of reciprocal innervation it
  was not unnatural to suppose at first that the entire scope of
  reflex inhibition lay within the ambit of the taxis of
  antagonistic muscles and antagonistic movements. Further study of
  central nervous action, however, finds central inhibition too
  extensive and ubiquitous to make it likely that it is confined
  solely to the taxis of antagonistic muscles.</p>

  <p>In instance let us take a reflex especially
  facile and regular to type, the well-known spinal flexion-reflex
  of the leg, evoked by stimulation of any afferent.280 1932 nerve
  of the leg itself Its experimental stimulus may be reduced to a
  single induction shock evoking a single volley of centripetal
  impulses in the bared afferent nerve. The reflex effect, observed
  in an isolated flexor muscle, e.g. of the ankle, is apart from
  exceptional circumstances, a single contraction wave indicating
  discharge of a single volley of motor impulses from the spinal
  centre. This "twitch-reflex", recorded isometrically by the
  myograph, exhibits a tension proportional to the number of motor
  units engaged, in other words to the size of the single
  centrifugal impulse volley. The contraction of each motor unit is
  on the all-or-nothing principle. The maximal contraction-tension
  for the reflex twitch will be reached only when all of the motor
  units composing the muscle are activated. The contraction-tension
  developed by the reflex being proportional to the number of motor
  units engaged, an average contraction-tension value for the
  individual motor unit can be found. The contraction developed by
  the reflex twitch is less the weaker the induction shock exciting
  the afferent nerve, in other words the fewer the afferent fibres
  excited, in short, the smaller the size of the centripetal
  impulse volley. With a given single-shock stimulus the tension
  developed by the reflex twitch remains closely constant when
  sampled at not too frequent intervals. In the case of the spinal
  flexion-reflex therefore, though with many other reflexes it is
  not so, a standard reflex twitch of desired size (tension) can be
  obtained at repeated intervals.</p>

  <p>The only index available at present for
  inhibition is its effect on excitation; thus, a standard
  twitch-reflex, representing a standard-sized volley of
  centrifugal discharge, can serve as a quantitative test for
  reflex inhibition. It serves for this with less ambiguity than
  does a reflex tetanus. In the tetanus the tension developed will
  depend within limits on the repetitive-frequency of the
  contraction waves forming the tetanus. Maximal tetanic
  contraction is reached only when the frequency reaches a rate
  which, in many reflex tetani, some of the units do not attain. In
  reflexes the rate of tetanic discharge can differ from unit to
  unit in one and the same muscle at one and the same time. The
  rate will differ too at different stages of the same reflex and
  according as the reflex is weak or strong. Reflex inhibition
  acting against a reflex titanic contraction may diminish the
  contraction in one or other or all of several different ways. In
  some units it may suppress the motor discharge altogether, in
  some it may merely slow the motor discharge thus lessening the
  wave frequency of the contraction and so the tension. The same
  aggregate diminution of tension may thus be brought about
  variously and by various combinations of ways, a result too
  equivocal for analysis. The same gross result might accrue
  <i>(a)</i> from total suppression of activity in some units or
  <i>(b)</i> from mere slackening of discharge in a larger number
  of units. These difficulties of interpretation are avoided by
  using as gauge for inhibition a standard reflex twitch. The
  deficit of contraction-tension then observed shows unequivocally
  the number of motor units inhibited out of the total activated
  for the standard. Since the direct maximal motor twitch compared
  with the standard reflex twitch can reveal the proportion of the
  whole muscle which the standard reflex twitch activates, we can
  find further what proportion of the whole muscle is reflexly
  inhibited. Of course subliminal excitation and subliminal
  inhibition are not revealed by the test and require other means
  for detection.</p>

  <p>A stable excitatory twitch-reflex as
  standard allows us to proceed further in our quantitative
  examination of inhibition. We then find that inhibition can be
  admixt in our simple-seeming flexion-reflex itself, and indeed
  usually is so. To detect it we have simply to add to the earlier
  excitation of the reflex a following one at not too long
  interval; we then find the response to the second stimulus-volley
  partly cut down by an inhibition latent in the first.</p>

  <p>This is usually evident with intervals
  between 300-1,200 sigma. The very shortest interval at which the
  inhibitory effect occurs is difficult to determine, for the
  reason that the excitatory effect has a subliminal fringe and the
  second stimulus repeats the subliminal effect of the first, and
  the two subliminal effects can sum to liminal. The second
  response is therefore enlarged by summation of subliminal fringe
  in some of the responsive motor units. This activation by the
  second stimulus of some motor units facilitated for it by the
  first though not activated by the first alone tends of course to
  obscure the inhibitory inactivation; the shrinkage due to the
  latter is offset by the increment due to the former. The
  inhibition is traceable only by the net diminution of the second
  reflex twitch. How quickly the inhibitory element in the stimulus
  develops centrally is not fully ascertainable, because the sooner
  the second reflex follows on the first the more the facilitation
  from it that it gets. This increment will conceal at least in
  part the decrement due to inhibition. Similarly the beginning of
  the inhibition may be concealed from observation by concomitant
  excitatory facilitation. This uncertainty does not attach to the
  longer intervals between the two stimuli because the central
  inhibitory process considerably outlasts the central excitatory
  facilitation.</p>

  <p>The reflex therefore, which at first sight
  seems a purely excitatory reaction, proves on closer examination
  to be in fact a commingled excitation and inhibition. Usually
  clearly demonstrable in the simple spinal condition of the
  reflex, this complexity of character is yet more evident in the
  decerebrate condition.</p>

  <p>We may hesitate to generalize from this
  example, because a stimulus applied to a bared afferent nerve is
  of course "artificial" in as much as it is applied to an
  anatomical collection of nerve fibres not homogeneous in
  function; and, we may suppose, not usually excited together. If
  cutaneous, its fibres will belong to such different species of
  sense as "touch" and "pain" which often provoke movements of
  opposite direction and are therefore in their effect on a given
  muscle opposed in effect. That a strong stimulus to such an
  afferent nerve, exciting most or all of its fibres, should in
  regard to a given muscle develop inhibition and excitation
  concurrently is not surprising.</p>

  <p>With weak stimuli the case is somewhat
  different. Such stimuli excite only a few of the constituent
  fibres of the afferent nerve, and those of similar calibre,
  presumably an indication of some functional likeness.
  Nevertheless, as shown above, the reflex result even then
  exhibits admixed excitatory and inhibitory influence on one and
  the same given muscle. And this admixture of excitation and
  inhibition persists when the stimulus is reduced in strength
  still further so as to be merely liminal. It still is so when the
  afferent nerve chosen is homogeneous in the sense that it is a
  purely muscular afferent, e.g. the afferent from one head of the
  gastrocnemius muscle. But we must remember that the afferent
  nerve from an extensor muscle has been shown to contain fibres
  which exert opposite reflex influences upon their own muscle,
  some exciting and some inhibiting that muscle's contraction. This
  brings with it the question whether admixture of exciting and
  inhibiting influence in the reflex effect obtains when instead of
  stimulation of a bared nerve some more "natural" stimulation is
  employed.</p>

  <p>For this the reflex evoked by passive
  flexion of knee in the decerebrate preparation has been taken.
  The single-joint extensor (vasto-crureus) of each knee is
  isolated; and nothing but that muscle pair thus retained is still
  innervated in the whole of the two limbs. The preparation thus
  obtained is a tonic preparation; one of the two muscles is then
  stretched by passively flexing a knee. This passive flexion
  excites in the extensor muscle which it stretches a reflex
  relaxation, i.e. the lengthening reaction; this relaxation at one
  knee is accompanied in the opposite fellow vasto-crureus by a
  reflex contraction enhancing the existing "tonic" contraction.
  The reflex contraction thus provoked is characteristically
  deliberate and smooth in performance and passes without overshoot
  into a maintained extension posture. Let however the manoeuvre be
  then repeated with the one difference of condition, that the
  muscle contralateral to that which is passively stretched has
  been deafferented. In the deafferented muscle contraction is
  still obtained, and more easily than before, but the deafferented
  condition of the muscle alters the course of its contraction in
  two respects. The course is no longer deliberate. The contraction
  is an abrupt rush, with overshoot of the succeeding postural
  contraction, and this latter is hardly maintained at all. The
  severance of the afferent nerve has removed a reflex
  self-restraint from the contracting muscle. Normally the
  proprioceptives of the contracting muscle put a brake on the
  speed of the contracting muscle (autogenous inhibition). The
  explosive rush and momentum of these deafferented extensor
  reflexes recall the ataxy of tabes. They recall also the
  abruptness and overshooting of the "willed" movements of a
  deafferented limb. In both cases a normal self-braking has been
  lost along with the deprivation of the muscle of its own
  proprioceptive afferents. These latter mediate both a
  self-braking and a self-exciting (autogenous excitation) reflex
  action of the muscle. Thus here again there is admixture of
  reflex inhibition and excitation, and in this case the admixture
  obtains in response to a "natural" stimulation. Here therefore
  the admixture of central inhibition with central excitation is a
  normal feature of a natural reflex.</p>

  <p>This makes it clear that for the study of
  normal nervous coordinations we require to know how central
  inhibition and excitation interact. As said above, the
  centripetal impulses which evoke inhibition do not differ in
  nature from those which evoke excitation. Inhibition like
  excitation can be induced in a "resting" centre. The only test we
  have for the inhibition is excitation. Existence of an excited
  state is not a prerequisite for the production of inhibition;
  inhibition can exist apart from excitation no less than, when
  called forth against an excitation already in progress, it can
  suppress or moderate it. The centripetal volley which excites a
  "centre" finds, if preceded by an inhibitory volley, the centre
  so treated is already irresponsive or partly so.</p>

  <p>A first question is, are there degrees of
  "central inhibitory state"; and are they, like central excitatory
  state, capable of summation. This can be examined in several
  ways. Thus: against the central inhibition caused by a given
  single volley of inhibitory impulses a standard single volley of
  excitatory impulses can be launched at an appropriate interval.
  The relatively long duration of the central inhibitory state
  allows a second inhibitory volley to be interpolated between the
  original inhibitory volley and the standard excitatory volley.
  The standard excitation is found to be then diminished (as shown
  by the twitch-contraction which it evokes) more than it is if
  subjected to either one inhibitory volley only. This holds even
  when the second inhibitory volley, launched from the same cathode
  as the first, is arranged to be clearly smaller than the first.
  Since the distribution of the effect of the smaller impulse
  volley (launched from the same cathode as the larger) among the
  motoneurones of the centre must lie completely included within
  that of the first, the added inhibition due to the second volley
  indicates that the combined influence of the two volleys prevents
  activation of some motoneurones which neither inhibitory volley
  acting alone was able to prevent from being activated. Evidently
  therefore central inhibition sums; consequently it is capable of
  subliminal existence. Also, successive subliminal degrees of
  inhibition can by temporal overlap sum to supraliminal degree. In
  these ways central inhibition presents analogy with its converse
  "central excitations"; both exhibit various degrees of intensity
  in respect to the individual motoneurone.</p>

  <p>Summation of inhibition is well exhibited
  when a given twitch-reflex is evoked at various times during and
  after a tetanic inhibition. The cutting down of the reflex twitch
  is progressively greater, as within limits, the inhibitory
  tetanus proceeds. After cessation of the tetanus the inhibitory
  state, similarly tested, passes off gradually, more quickly at
  first than later.</p>

  <p>The relatively long persistence of the
  central inhibitory state induced by a single centripetal impulse
  volley allows examination of the effect on it of two successive
  excitation volleys as compared with one of the two alone. An
  excitatory volley is interpolated between the inhibitory volley
  and a subsequent standard excitatory volley. The interpolated
  excitatory volley is found to lessen the inhibitory effect upon
  the final excitatory volley. The interpolated excitation volley
  neutralizes some of the inhibition which otherwise would have
  counteracted the final test excitation. Just as central
  inhibitory state (c.i.s.) counteracts central excitatory state
  (c.e.s.) so c.e.s. neutralizes c.i.s. The mutual inactivation is
  quantitative. There occurs at the individual neurone an algebraic
  summation of the values of the two opposed influences.</p>

  <p>It is still early to venture any definite
  view of the intimate nature of "central inhibition". It is
  commonly held that nerve excitation consists essentially in the
  local depolarization of a polarized membrane on the surface of
  the neurone. As to "central excitation", it is difficult to
  suppose such depolarization of the cell surface can be graded any
  more than can that of the fibre. But its antecedent step
  (facilitation) might be graded, e.g. subliminal. Local
  depolarization having occurred the difference of potential thus
  arisen gives a current which disrupts the adjacent polarization
  membrane, and so the "excitation&gt;. travels. As to inhibition
  the suggestion is made that it consists in the temporary
  stabilization of the surface membrane which excitation would
  break down. As tested against a standard excitation the
  inhibitory stabilization is found to present various degrees of
  stability. The inhibitory stabilization of the membrane might be
  pictured as a heightening of the "resting" polarization, somewhat
  on the lines of an electrotonus. Unlike the
  excitation-depolarization it would not travel; and, in fact, the
  inhibitory state does not travel.</p>

  <p>The quantitative character of the
  interaction between opposed inhibition and excitation is
  experimentally demonstrable. Thus: a given inhibitory tetanus
  exerted on a certain set of motoneurones fails to prevent their
  excitation in response to strong stimulation of a given afferent
  nerve; but when the stimulation of the excitatory afferent is
  weaker the given standard inhibitory tetanus does prevent the
  response of the motor neurones to the excitatory stimulation.
  With the weaker stimulation of the afferent nerve there are fewer
  of its fibres acting, and therefore fewer converge for central
  effect on some of the units. On these the standard c.i.s. has
  therefore less c.e.s. to counteract.</p>

  <p>Many features characteristic of reflex
  myographic records of various type become interpretable in light
  of the stimulus volley from a single afferent nerve trunk, even
  small, evoking an admixture of inhibition and excitation, with
  consequent central conflict and interaction between them.
  Features which find facile explanation in this way are the
  following. (A) The flexion-reflex (spinal) commonly has a
  <i>d'embl&eacute;e</i> opening; that is, a steep initial
  contraction passes abruptly into a plateau, giving an
  approximately rectangular beginning to the myogram. Here the
  initial reflex excitation is closely followed by an ensuing
  reflex inhibition commingled with and partially counter-acting
  the concurrent excitation. (B) Allied to this and of analogous
  explanation is the so-called "fountain"- form of flexion-reflex.
  After the first uprush of contraction a component of reflex
  inhibition grows relatively more potent and the
  contraction-tension drops low before continuing-level. Between
  these extreme forms there are intermediates. The key to the
  production of them all is admixture of central excitation with
  central inhibition; the excitation is prepotent earlier, and
  later suffers from encroaching inhibition.</p>

  <p>(C) Again, the typical opening of the
  crossed extensor reflex (decerebrate) "recruits". A variably long
  latent period precedes a contraction which climbs slowly, taking
  perhaps seconds to reach its plateau. Here, struggling with
  excitation, inhibition has the upper hand at first. The action
  currents of the muscle marking the serial stimuli to the afferent
  nerve are not choked by secondary waves of after-discharge. The
  concurrent inhibition cuts them out. The inhibition is traceable
  partly to the proprioceptive reflex mechanism attached to the
  contracting muscle itself; the progress of the reflex contraction
  is partly freed from inhibition by deafferenting the muscle, but
  still not wholly freed. A residuum of inhibition in the reflex is
  traceable to the crossed afferent nerve employed. This again
  illustrates the ubiquitous commingling of inhibition and
  excitation in the spinal and decerebrate reflexes evoked by
  direct stimulation of afferent nerves.</p>

  <p>An instance of combination of excitation
  and inhibition for coordinative effect is the rhythmic reflex of
  stepping. In the "spinal" cat and dog there occurs "stepping" of
  the hind limbs; it starts when the "spinal" hind limbs, lifted
  from the ground, hang freely, the animal being supported
  vertically from the shoulders. The extensor phase in one limb
  occurs with the flexor phase in the other. This "stepping" can
  also be evoked by a stigmatic electrode carrying a mild tetanic
  current to a point in the cross-face of the cut spinal-cord. The
  "stepping" then opens with Aexion in the ipsilateral hind limb
  accompanied by extension in the contralateral. To reproduce this
  stepping movement by appropriately timed repetitions of
  tetanization of, for instance, a flexion producing afferent of
  one limb or an extension-producing afferent of the other never
  succeeds even remotely in exciting the rhythmic stepping. In the
  true rhythmic movement itself, which has been examined
  particularly by Graham Brown, the contraction in each phase
  develops smoothly to a climax and then as smoothly declines,
  waxing and waning much as does the activity of the diaphragm in
  normal inspiration. But although this rhythmically intermittent
  tetanus affecting alternately the flexors and extensors of the
  limb and giving the reflex step cannot be copied reflexly by
  employing excitation alone, it can be easily and faithfully
  reproduced and with perfect alternation of phase and with its
  characteristic asymmetrical bilaterality, by employing a
  stimulation in which reflex excitation and reflex inhibition are
  admixt in approximately balanced intensity. The result is then a
  rhythmic sea-saw about a neutral point. The effect on the
  individual motor unit appears then to run its course thus: if we
  start to trace the cycle with the moment when c.e. and c.i. are
  so equal as to cancel out, the state of the motoneurone is a zero
  state, for which the term "rest", although often applied to it,
  is perhaps better avoided. With supervention of preponderance of
  c.e. over c.i. the motor neurone's discharge commences and under
  progressive increase of that preponderance the frequency of
  discharge increases in the individual motor neurone, and more
  motor neurones are "recruited" for action until in due course the
  preponderance of c.e. begins to fail and c.i. in its turn asserts
  itself more. The recruitment and frequency of discharge begin to
  wane, and then reach their lowest, and may cease, and an interval
  of zero state or quiescense may ensue. The quiescence may be
  inhibitory or merely lack of excitation. Which of these it were
  could be directly determined only by testing the threshold of
  excitation. However brought about, it is synchronous with the
  excitation-phase in the antagonistic muscle and with the
  excitation-phase in the symmetrical fellow muscles of the
  opposite limb. Since reciprocal innervation has been observed to
  obtain between these muscles, the phase of lapse of excitation is
  probably one of filer active inhibition. The rhythm induced by
  stimulation of the "stepping"-point in the cut face of the
  lateral column of the cord would seem to act therefore by evoking
  concurrently excitation and inhibition, and so playing them off
  one against the other as to induce alternate dominance of each.
  Intensifying the mild current applied to the point quickens the
  tempo of the rhythm, i.e. of the alternation.</p>

  <p>Another class of events revealing
  inhibition as a factor wide and decisive in the working of the
  central nervous system is presented by the "release" phenomenon
  of Hughlings Jackson. The depression of activity called "shock"
  supervenes on injury of a distant but related part; conversely
  there supervenes often an over-action due likewise to injury or
  destruction of some distant but related part. "Shock" is
  traceable to loss of excitatory influence, which, though perhaps
  commonly subliminal in itself, lowers the threshold for other
  excitation. The over-action conversely is traceable to loss of
  inhibitory influence, perhaps subliminal in itself and yet
  helping concurrent influences of like direction to maintain a
  normal restraint, the normal height of threshold against
  excitation. Where the relation between one group of muscles and
  another, e.g. between flexors and extensors, is reciprocal, the
  effect of removal (by trauma or disease) of some influence
  exerted by another part of the nervous system is commonly
  two-fold in direction. There is "shock", i.e. depression of
  excitability in one field of the double mechanism and "release",
  i.e. exaltation of excitability, in another. Thus spinal
  transection, cutting off the hind-limb spinal reflexes from
  prespinal centers inflicts "shocks" on the extensor half-centre
  and produces "release" of the flexor half-centre. In this case
  the direction both of the "shock" and of the "release" runs
  aborally ; but it can run the other way, as in the influence that
  the hind-limb centres have on the fore-limb. Which way it runs,
  of course, depends simply on the relative anatomical situation of
  the influencing and the influenced centres.</p>

  <p>The role of inhibition in the working of
  the central nervous system has proved to be more and more
  extensive and more and more fundamental as experiment has
  advanced in examining it. Reflex inhibition can no longer be
  regarded merely as a factor specially developed for dealing with
  the antagonism of opponent muscles acting at various
  hinge-joints. Its role as a coordinative factor comprises that,
  and goes beyond that. In the working of the central nervous
  machinery inhibition seems as ubiquitous and as frequent as is
  excitation itself. The whole quantitative grading of the
  operations of the spinal cord and brain appears to rest upon
  mutual interaction between the two central processes "excitation"
  and "inhibition", the one no less important than the other. For
  example, no operation can be more important as a basis of
  coordination for a motor act than adjustment of the quantity of
  contraction, e.g. of the number of motor units employed and the
  intensity of their individual tetanic activity. This now appears
  as the outcome of nice co-adjustment of excitation and inhibition
  upon each of all the individual units which cooperate in the
  act.</p>

  <p>In reflexes, even under simple spinal or
  decerebrate conditions, interplay between excitation and
  inhibition is commonly induced even by the simplest stimulus. It
  need not surprise us therefore that variability of reflex result
  is met by the experimenter. Indeed, that it troubles him by being
  partly beyond his control, need not surprise him in view of the
  multiplicity and complicity of the sources of the inhibition and
  of the excitation. This variability seems underestimated by those
  who regard reflex action as too rigid to provide a prototype for
  cerebral behaviour. It is in virtue of their containing
  inhibition and excitation admixt that, in accord with central
  conditions prevailing for the time being, a limb-reflex provoked
  by a given stimulus in the decerebrate preparation can on one
  occasion be opposite in direction to what it is on another, e.g.
  extension instead of Aexion ("reversal") Excitation and
  inhibition are both present from the very stimulus out-set and
  are pitted against one another. The central circumstances may
  favour one at one time, the other at another. Again, if the
  quantity of contraction needed normally for a given act be
  reached by algebraic summation of central excitation and
  inhibition, it can obviously be attained by variously compounded
  quantities of those two. Hence when disease or injury has caused
  a deficit of excitation, a readjustment of concurrent inhibition
  offers a means of arriving once more at the normal quantity
  required. The admixture of inhibition and excitation as a
  mechanism for coordination thus provides a means of understanding
  the remarkable "compensations" which restore in course of time,
  and even quickly, the muscular competence for execution of an act
  which has been damaged by central nervous lesions. More than one
  way for doing the same thing is provided by the natural
  constitution of the nervous system. This luxury of means of
  compassing a given combination seems to offer the means of
  restitution of an act after its impairment or loss in one of its
  several forms.</p>
