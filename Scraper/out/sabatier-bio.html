  <h1>Paul Sabatier - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sabatier.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Paul Sabatier</b> was born at
  Carcassonne in Southern France on November 5, 1854. He was
  educated at the local Lyc&eacute;e and then prepared at Toulouse
  for the entrance examinations to the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique and
  the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. He was accepted for both
  and chose the latter which he entered in 1874; three years later
  he graduated, first in his class. He taught physics for a year in
  a local school at N&icirc;mes before going to the Coll&egrave;ge de
  France in 1878 as assistant to Berthelot. He received the degree
  of Doctor of Science in 1880.<br>
  <br>
  Sabatier took charge of courses in physics in the Faculty of
  Sciences at Bordeaux until January, 1882, when he accepted a
  similar post at the University of Toulouse. He additionally
  became responsible for courses in chemistry in 1883 and was
  elected Professor of Chemistry in 1884, a post which he retained
  until his retirement in 1930. He became Dean of the Faculty of
  Science in 1905 and continued to lecture after his retirement
  until his death in 1941. He was ever faithful to Toulouse and
  turned down many offers of attractive positions elsewhere,
  notably the succession to <a href=

  <br>
  Sabatier's earliest researches concerned the thermochemistry of
  sulphur and metallic sulphates, the subject for his thesis
  leading to his doctorate, and, in Toulouse, he continued his
  physico-chemical investigations to sulphides, chlorides,
  chromates and copper compounds. He also studied the oxides of
  nitrogen and nitrosodisulphonic acid and its salts and carried
  out fundamental research on partition coefficients and absorption
  spectra.<br>
  <br>
  When he started his investigations into the phenomenon of
  catalysis, Sabatier soon pointed out anomalies in Faraday's
  physical theory and he in turn formulated his chemical theory
  which postulated the formation of unstable intermediaries. His
  subsequent painstaking work and discovery of the use of
  finely-divided metal hydrogenation catalysts subsequently formed
  the bases of the margarine, oil hydrogenation, and synthetic
  methanol industries. He demonstrated the selectivity of catalytic
  action and also the selectivity of catalysts to poisons, as well
  as introducing the use of supports and showing the resultant
  enhanced activity. He also made a close study of catalytic
  hydration and dehydration, examining carefully the feasibility of
  specific reactions and the general activity of various
  catalysts.<br>
  <br>
  Sabatier's work is accurately recorded in the publications of
  learned societies and his most important book, <i>La Catalyse en
  Chimie Orgarnique</i> (Catalysis in organic chemistry), was first
  published in 1913, with a second edition in 1920, of which an
  English translation by E.E. Reid was published in 1923.<br>
  <br>
  Sabatier was a Member of the French Academy of Sciences and
  Commander of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur. He was Doctor of Science,
  <i>honoris causa</i>, of the University of Philadelphia and
  honorary member of the Royal Society of London, of the Academy of
  Madrid, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the American
  Chemical Society, and many other foreign institutions. He was
  awarded the Prix Lacate (1897); the Prix Jecker (1905); the Davy
  Medal (1915) and Royal Medal (1918) of the Royal Society; and the
  Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute (1933). For his method
  of hydrogenating organic compounds in the presence of finely
  divided metals, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for
  1912, sharing the prize with Victor Grignard, who received it on
  account of his discovery of the so-called Grignard reagent.<br>
  <br>
  Paul Sabatier was a very reserved man. He married Mlle. Herail
  and they had four daughters, one of whom married the Italian
  chemist, Emilio Pomilio. He was fond of art and gardening.<br>
  <br>
  He died on August 14, 1941.</p>
