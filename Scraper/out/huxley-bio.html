  <h1>Andrew F. Huxley - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="huxley.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Andrew Fielding Huxley</b> was born in
  Hampstead, London, on 22nd November 1917. His father, Leonard
  Huxley, who was a son of the nineteenth - century scientist and
  writer Thomas Huxley, was for a time a classics master at
  Charterhouse School and later took up a literary career, writing
  a number of biographies and being editor of the
  &laquo;Cornhill&raquo; magazine. The children of his first marriage
  included Sir Julian Huxley the biologist and Aldous Huxley the
  writer. After his first wife's death, Andrew's father married
  Rosalind Bruce, and Andrew is the youngest of the two sons of
  this marriage. His father died in 1933.<br>
  <br>
  Andrew was educated at University College School (1925-1930) and
  Westminster School (1930-1935, King's Scholar); and went up to
  Trinity
  College, Cambridge in 1935 with a major entrance scholarship.
  He had turned over to science from classics in 1932, and went to
  Cambridge expecting that his career would be in the physical
  sciences: he has always been mechanically minded, and he was
  inspired at Westminster by the physics teaching of the late J. F.
  Rudwick. He naturally took physics, chemistry and mathematics in
  his Part I at Cambridge, but the rules required him to take
  another science and he picked physiology, largely on the
  recommendation of an old friend, B. Delisle Burns, now of the
  Physiology Department, McGill University. Huxley found physiology
  interesting, partly for its subject matter and partly through
  contact with <a href="../1932/index.html">Adrian</a>, Roughton,
  Rushton, <a href="index.html">Hodgkin</a> and the late G. A.
  Millikan (all Fellows of Trinity) and others in the department,
  and he decided to specialise in it. He spent 1937-1938 doing
  anatomy with the intention of qualifying in medicine, and
  1938-1939 doing the Part II course in physiology. In August 1939
  Huxley joined Hodgkin at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth for
  his first introduction to research, and they succeeded in
  recording electrically from the inside of the squid giant
  axon.<br>
  <br>
  For the first year of the war Huxley was a clinical student, but
  when medical teaching in London was stopped by air attacks, he
  changed to work of more immediate application, and spent the rest
  of the war on operational research in gunnery, first for
  Anti-Aircraft Command and later for the Admiralty.<br>
  <br>
  In 1941 Huxley was elected to a research fellowship at Trinity
  College, Cambridge, and he took this up at the beginning of 1946
  together with a teaching appointment in the Department of
  Physiology. He continued to hold college and university posts in
  Cambridge until 1960, when he became head of the Department of
  Physiology at University College London. In 1969 he was appointed
  to a Royal Society Research Professorship which he holds in the
  Department of Physiology at University College London.<br>
  <br>
  From 1946 to 1951 Huxley worked mostly in collaboration with
  Hodgkin on nerve conduction, but also with R. St&auml;mfli on
  myelinated nerve fibres. In 1952 he turned to muscle contraction,
  and developed an interference microscope for studying the
  striation pattern in isolated muscle fibres. This has continued
  to be his main line of work up to the present, though he has done
  some further computations on the generation of the action
  potential. Huxley has also developed a microtome for electron
  microscope sections, and a micromanipulator.<br>
  <br>
  Huxley was an Editor of the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> from
  1950-1957, he has also been an Editor of the <i>Journal of
  Molecular Biology</i>. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in
  1955, and served on its Council, 1960-1962. He worked at Woods
  Hole, Massachusetts, in 1953 as a Lalor Scholar; gave the Herter
  Lectures at Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1959; and the Jesup
  Lectures at Columbia University in 1964.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 Andrew Huxley married Jocelyn Richenda Gammell Pease,
  daughter of M. S. Pease, a geneticist, and the Hon. H. B. Pease
  (n&eacute;e Wedgwood). Mrs. Huxley is a Justice of the Peace, and
  is active in a variety of public work in Cambridgeshire. They
  have six children: Janet Rachel (born 20 April 1948), who read
  Biochemistry at Bristol University; Stewart Leonard (born 19
  December 1949), who read engineering at Cambridge University;
  Camilla Rosalind (born 12 March 1952), who entered Cambridge
  University in 1971; Eleanor Bruce (born 21 February 1959);
  Henrietta Catherine (born 25 December 1960); and Clare Marjory
  Pease (born 4 November 1962).</p>
