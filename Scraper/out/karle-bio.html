  <h1>Jerome Karle - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="karle.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in New York City in 1918 into
  a family that had a number of artistic people among its members.
  My father's brother and a sister's husband were probably the best
  known. The latter, Ivan Olinsky, taught for many years at the Art
  Students' League in New York City. I have been told that my
  paternal grandfather professionally made artistic decorations in
  peoples' homes. The propensity for artistic endeavors extended to
  my generation and beyond.<br>
  <br>
  My mother was an excellent pianist and organist and it was one of
  her hopes that I would become a professional pianist. As a youth
  I was entered into "Music Week" competitions in New York City. I
  had some modest success, but found at an early age that I had no
  taste for public performance. On the other hand, I was strongly
  attracted to science as a lifelong career at an early age.<br>
  <br>
  I had the privilege of attending schools in the New York City
  public school system. Their standards of education, character
  building and discipline were very high and I, most certainly,
  benefited from them. They separated out the more advanced
  students and permitted them to progress at their own pace. In my
  case, this occasionally led to some curious circumstances. In my
  senior year in high school (Abraham Lincoln), the girls would
  join the boys to practice dancing. I was 14 years old at the time
  and the girls were the usual 17-18 years old. The physical
  discrepancy between this 14 year old boy and 17-18 year old girls
  was considerable. Their first reaction was incredulity but after
  a while they got used to my presence and even danced with me. I
  took the chemistry and physics courses that were available, both
  taught by the same man. He recognized my interests and was very
  encouraging to me.<br>
  <br>
  I enjoyed a number of sports that I participated in at every
  opportunity, swimming in the ocean nearby, a game called
  single-wall handball, played with a little hard black ball and
  well-known mainly in some metropolitan areas, touch football
  whose rules eliminate the bruises from tackling and ice-skating
  that was facilitated by the flooding of a huge parking lot by the
  local fire department.<br>
  <br>
  I entered the City College of New York in 1933 and, at first,
  found it to be a bit of a struggle. Their academic standards were
  very high and they had a concentration of the best students in
  New York City. In addition, I spent three hours a day traveling
  on the subway system to and from home. This marked the end of
  piano practicing. City College had no tuition fee. The only
  financial requirement was one dollar per year for a library card.
  At the College, there were broad course requirements for all
  students that ranged through mathematics, the physical sciences,
  the social sciences and literature. There were even two years of
  compulsory public speaking courses. I studied, in addition to the
  requirements, some additional mathematics, some physics, and much
  chemistry and biology. The year after graduation from City
  College was spent at Harvard University in the study of biology, for
  which I received a master's degree, M.A., in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  After a brief hiatus, I went to work with the New York State
  Health Department in Albany. While there, I had the opportunity
  to spend some time again at the piano. At the time I was in
  Albany, the fluoridation of drinking water was getting underway.
  I developed a procedure for determining the amount of fluorine in
  water supplies that became a standard method. This was my first
  modest contribution to science.<br>
  <br>
  It was my intention to save enough money while at the Health
  Department to return to graduate school. This I did, and I
  entered the Chemistry Department of the University of
  Michigan in 1940 where I met my wife, Isabella Lugoski, whom
  I married in 1942, at an adjoining laboratory desk the first day
  that I went to physical chemistry class. We were both attracted
  to physical chemistry and took our degrees with Professor
  Lawrence O. Brockway whose speciality was the investigation of
  gas-phase molecular structure by means of electron diffraction.
  Although my Ph.D. degree was awarded in 1944, I had completed all
  my work for it during the summer of 1943 and went off to work on
  the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago. Isabella joined me on
  this project a few months later.<br>
  <br>
  In 1944, we returned to the University of Michigan, I went to
  work on a project of the Naval Research Laboratory and Isabella
  as an instructor in the Chemistry Department. While at the
  University of Michigan, I performed some experiments on the
  structure of monolayers of long-chain hydrocarbon films involved
  in the boundary lubrication of metallic surfaces. I also derived
  a theory that explained the electron diffraction patterns
  obtained from the oriented monolayers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 we both went to work permanently in Washington for the
  Naval Research Laboratory. Our interest continued in developing
  the quantitative aspects of gas electron diffraction analysis.
  The solution of a key problem that arose in such analyses had
  evident implications for crystal structure analysis and, in fact,
  other areas of structure determination. At about the time that
  these matters were developing, <a href="index.html">Herbert
  Hauptman</a> joined us at the Naval Research Laboratory and we
  decided to pursue the implications for crystal structures. This
  eventually led to the development of the direct methods for
  crystal structure analysis with the major part of the
  mathematical foundations and procedural insights established in
  the early 1950's.<br>
  <br>
  While all this was going on and with hardly missing a step from
  her research activities, Isabella mothered three children, Louise
  in 1946, Jean in 1950, and Madeleine in 1955. Louise is a
  theoretical chemist, Jean an organic chemist and Madeleine is a
  museum specialist trained in geology.<br>
  <br>
  The initial applications of the procedure for structure
  determination for centrosymmetric crystals involving probability
  measures and formulas derived from the joint probability
  distribution were performed in the middle 1950's in collaboration
  with colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey. Then, in the
  second half of the 1950's, through the efforts of Isabella Karle,
  an experimental X-ray diffraction facility was established in our
  own laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1960's, there was an intensive program in my
  laboratory to develop a procedure for crystal structure
  determination of broad applicability that would encompass
  noncentrosymmetric as well as centrosymmetric crystals. Largely
  through the efforts of Isabella Karle, such a procedure was
  developed and called the symbolic addition procedure. This
  procedure had its origins in the theoretical work and the
  experience in practical application of the 1950's, but it also
  required some new procedural insights and some additional
  theoretical work to make it efficient and broadly applicable and
  avoid the pitfalls that easily arise when optimal pathways
  through a procedure must be chosen on the basis of probability
  measures. The first application of the symbolic addition
  procedure was published in 1963 and the first essentially equal
  atom noncentrosymmetric crystal structure to be solved by direct
  phase determination was published in 1964. This was followed by a
  number of exciting applications and toward the end of the 1960's
  many laboratories started to become interested in the potential
  of the direct method for structure determination.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1960's, I collaborated with Isabella in some of her
  investigations and derived with her a variance formula that was
  the basis for applying probability measures to procedures for
  analyzing noncentrosymmetric crystals. In addition, I also
  carried out a number of theoretical investigations. Perhaps, the
  most useful one concerned a procedure for developing a fragment
  of a structure into a complete one by use of the so-called
  tangent formula for phase determination.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1950's and 1960's, I maintained an interest in gas
  electron diffraction and made some experimental and theoretical
  studies of internal rotation and coherent diffraction associated
  with excitation processes. The latter was especially interesting,
  but required extensive experimental development that the
  resources available to me did not permit.<br>
  <br>
  In the 1970's, I continued theoretical work in crystal structure
  analysis that included the derivation of a "tangent formula" for
  phase determination that was based on the more restrictive higher
  and higher order determinants from the determinantal
  inequalities. I showed how joint probability distributions
  relevant to crystallographic quantities could be put into an
  exponential form and thereby decrease considerably problems with
  asymptotic convergence. I also derived heuristic joint
  probability distributions based on the determinants involved in
  the determinantal inequalities and obtained from them formulas
  for evaluating triplet phase invariants and, later on, formulas
  for the expected values of phase invariants and embedded
  semi-invariants of any order, triplet, quartet, quintet, etc. The
  utility of phase invariants of high order in phase determination
  has so far been rather limited, except perhaps collectively in
  the high order determinants where they have been useful for
  refining the values of approximately determined phase
  values.<br>
  <br>
  I participated with Wayne Hendrickson of my laboratory in some
  refinements of macromolecular structure with the use of the
  tangent formula and also had some early participation with John
  Konnert and Wayne Hendrickson in the constrained refinement
  technique for macromolecules. In collaboration with John Konnert
  and Peter D'Antonio, procedures were developed for determining
  atomic arrangements in amorphous materials based on criteria
  similar to those applied to molecular vapors. Collaborations on
  structural problems also included Judith Flippen-Anderson,
  Clifford George, Richard Gilardi and Alfred Lowrey.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 1970's Wayne Hendrickson made some valuable
  advances in the application of anomalous dispersion to the
  determination of macromolecular structure that rekindled an
  interest that I formerly had in this subject. I developed an
  exact, linear algebraic theory that includes any number and type
  of anomalous scatterer and any number of wavelengths. It can also
  incorporate information from isomorphous replacement
  measurements. Exact data give exact values for the unknown
  quantities that include phase differences. I have also been
  investigating the evaluation of triplet phase invariants to see
  what their potential usefulness may be. This activity continues
  to the present and is greatly facilitated by Stephen Brenner who
  has performed my programming and computing for me since the early
  1960's.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to participating in the development of new analytical
  methods and their applications, I have taught from time to time,
  mathematics and physics in the University College of the University of Maryland,
  I have taken an active role in the affairs of crystallography
  over the years as, for example, President of the International
  Union of Crystallography (1981-1984) and have enjoyed having a
  laboratory that investigates a broad variety of subjects ranging
  over gaseous molecules, amorphous solids, fibers, crystals and
  crystalline macromolecules.<br>
  <br>
  During my entire married life I have had the strong support of my
  wife, both technical and spiritual. I also deeply appreciate the
  supportive atmosphere provided by the Naval Research Laboratory.
  This was especially helpful during the early 1950's when a large
  number of fellow-scientists did not believe a word we said.</p>
