  <h2>The Chemical Composition of the Cell Nucleus</h2>

  <p>The development of organic chemistry in the
  past century has been based chiefly on the building up of
  concepts as to the arrangement of the atoms in space. As you well
  know, the organic chemist is able to present both this knowledge
  of the composition of an organic substance and its chemical
  reactions, and his views on its position in the chemical system,
  with clarity and precision by constructing a picture which shows
  the distribution of a number of various kinds of atoms in
  space.</p>

  <p>When one uses these conceptions in the
  investigation of animal or vegetable tissues one is led to the
  picture of a <i>chemical structure</i> of these organic
  formations. The scientific domain which is opened up in this
  manner can in many ways be compared with the science of the
  <i>anatomical structure</i> of living beings.</p>

  <p>Both disciplines, the anatomical and the
  chemical, appear at first to strive only for the description of
  an organic formation, but in both cases this description is
  really not the true aim of the investigation. This knowledge of
  the anatomical as well as of the chemical structure is only
  valuable in our view because from it we hope to gain
  understanding of the function of the various parts, or of the
  mechanism of their development, or other questions of biological
  importance.</p>

  <p>Accordingly we can only evaluate experience
  on the composition of the cell and the protoplasm as preliminary
  steps to greater knowledge. The results of these obtained so far,
  which I shall attempt to report, are really more suitable to
  stimulate our thirst for knowledge rather than to gratify it.
  There is still a long way to go from a consideration of
  individual fragments of the apparatus to an understanding of its
  mode of action.</p>

  <p>Comparative observations have led to the
  conception that there are certain chemical vital processes common
  to animals and plants, that there is to some extent a chemical
  mechanism which acts <i>on common principles</i> in the various
  kinds of living matter. These basic physiological processes must
  be situated in that substance which appears everywhere to be the
  main focus of the physiological combustion processes, from which,
  at the same time, the remaining parts of the body proceed, i.e.
  the protoplasm.</p>

  <p>Obviously the chemical investigation of
  this structure must seem to be one of the most important problems
  of biochemistry, but the difficulties of such an investigation
  became apparent in the first analyses - first of all in the
  selection and preparation of the material for them. The living
  cell almost always contains, locked in its interior, the visible
  or invisible products of its physiological activity or its
  nourishment. The distinction between components and inclusions,
  between organized body substances and chemical metabolites is
  hard to define and results definite to some extent can only be
  expected on the basis of careful histological appraisal and
  comparative study. Thus the most varied cell structures and
  formless protoplasms have been investigated and individual groups
  of compounds defined which repeatedly emerge in the lists of
  these components, and since Hoppe-Seyler's work nucleins,
  lecithin, cholesterol, and finally potassium salts, in addition
  to proteins, have been added to the list.</p>

  <p>New prospects were opened up when attempts
  were made to bring the <i>cell nucleus</i> within the scope of
  these investigations. Here we have an organ of the cell whose
  structure and function must be associated with the <i>general</i>
  processes of life. This is already evident from structural
  conditions, and from the changes in form which precede and
  accompany the processes of cell-division, which recur in
  different regions of the animal and vegetable worlds and are
  fundamentally unrelated to species and group or to the position
  of the system in the organic world. Chemical characteristics have
  now been added to the morphological characteristics of this organ
  which define its peculiarities still more sharply because they
  can also be recognized in cells in which the structure of the
  nucleus is not defined. These chemical characteristics I shall
  now briefly attempt to outline.</p>

  <p>The first observations in this sphere were
  begun in Hoppe-Seyler's laboratory in the 1860's on the nuclei of
  pus cells. Miescher, a student of Hoppe-Seyler's, was able to
  isolate these nuclei and he found in them a substance very rich
  in phosphorus which he called "Nucle&iuml;n". A suitable object
  for the carrying further of this work was found in a structure
  which develops through the transformation of the cell nucleus and
  which retains its chemical constitution and apparently also an
  essential part of its physiological function - namely in the
  heads of spermatozoa. In the course of the next decades evidence
  accumulated to show that "Nucle&iuml;n" or "nucleic material" is
  indeed peculiar to the cell nucleus. Still other objects were
  found which to some extent permitted the isolation of the cell
  nuclei, e.g. the red blood cells of birds where the cell body is
  soluble in water. Here also chemical investigations could be
  carried out on adequate masses of nuclei thus isolated and again
  the distinguishing features of nucleic material were found, and
  microchemical tests confirmed this. They showed at the same time
  that the nucleic material belonged to a well-defined part of the
  nuclear substance which stood out in a very conspicuous manner
  during the transformation process, whose amount in various nuclei
  is variable and which because of its reaction to certain stains
  has received the name of "chromatin". There was only one
  difficulty about this which was the finding of "nucleic
  substances" in animal products which contained no cell nuclei,
  namely in the yolk sacs of eggs and in casein in milk, and indeed
  attempts were made to explain these facts by special hypotheses
  before more accurate chemical investigations brought
  clarification.</p>

  <p>The chemical structure of these nucleic
  substances shows some peculiarities which are found in many
  organic components of protoplasm, particularly in those which
  participate actively in metabolic processes. It has been observed
  that such components break down easily into a certain number of
  closed atom groups which have been compared to building blocks.
  Such "building blocks", fitted together in great number and
  variety and apparently according to a definite plan, form the
  molecule of proteins, and also of starch and glycogen, and in
  smaller numbers those of fats and phosphatides. The complicated
  organic components of nutrition are broken down into these
  building blocks when they are prepared by digestion for being
  taken up into the body, and from these building blocks the large
  molecules inside the organism can then again be fitted
  together.</p>

  <p>The nucleic substances show a composition
  of this sort also. Chemical analysis showed first that in many
  cases nucleic substances are broken down into two parts, one
  having the character of a protein. This part possesses no other
  atom groups than the usual proteins. The other part, however, is
  of characteristic structure; it has been given the name of
  "<i>nucleic acid</i>". From it I succeeded in obtaining a number
  of fragments which could be dissolved out of the molecule in part
  even by gentle chemical action and which were recognizable by a
  quite special concentration of nitrogen atoms. Here four
  nitrogen-containing groups are present together: <i>cytosine,
  thymine, adenine, guanine</i>.</p>

  <p>One of these four bodies, guanine, has been
  known for some time in various animal tissues and was found by
  Piccard for example in the spermatozoa of salmon, although indeed
  this investigator had no suspicion that it had any genetic
  relationship with the nucleins. Earlier it was generally accepted
  that guanine and other similar substances originated from the
  protein molecule and Miescher thought that these bodies perhaps
  arose from protamine, while Piccard put forward the idea that
  "they pre-existed along with it in the salmon sperm". Knowledge
  of their origin from nucleic acid, which was unexpected and, to
  start with, ran up against active opposition, gave at the same
  time an understanding of particular phenomena for which an
  explanation had been lacking; e.g. it had been noted that in
  leukaemia, guanine and related substances were present in large
  amounts in the blood. Now in this disease it is typical that the
  non-nucleated red cells are replaced by elements containing
  nuclei, but these latter break down in large numbers and
  accordingly the body fluids are overwhelmed with the
  decomposition products of nucleic material. Hence the bases just
  mentioned, or their very closely related transformation products,
  occur in large amounts in the body fluids. Also the contradiction
  mentioned previously, which appeared in the supposed presence of
  nucleic material in egg yolks and in milk, was now solved. A more
  accurate investigation showed that these elements, which because
  of their external behaviour and phosphorus content had previously
  been considered as nucleins, possess a chemical structure of
  different type. The nitrogen-rich building blocks as I have
  called them, are completely absent - thus they really do not
  belong to the group of the true nucleic substances and form a
  special class.</p>

  <p>The more the relationships of the
  nitrogen-rich substances to the cell nucleus were recognized the
  more the question of the arrangement of the nitrogen and carbon
  atoms in the molecule came to stand out. Two of the named four
  bodies, adenine and guanine, belong to a group of chemical
  compounds which today are usually included under the name of
  alloxan derivatives or purine derivatives. The discovery of the
  individual members of this group and the elucidation of their
  chemical nature is linked with the names of Scheele, and Torbern
  Bergmann, W&ouml;hler, Liebig, Strecker and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1905/index.html">Adolf Baeyer</a> and the
  brilliant series of these investigations was concluded with the
  work of <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/index.html">Emil
  Fischer</a> which led to the satisfactory final establishment of
  the formulae shown below. The two others, thymine and cytosine,
  showed a simpler composition; experiments of breakdown and
  synthesis led to the result that in thymine there must be a
  grouping of the carbon and nitrogen atoms corresponding to the
  following scheme:</p>

  <table width="350" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div align="left">
          <img src="fig1.gif" width="350" height="114" alt="Figure">

        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is evident from the formulae that in
  thymine and cytosine a ring-like system of carbon and nitrogen
  atoms must be assumed. The position of the atoms in cytosine
  could be determined, because under the action of an oxidizing
  agent this substance breaks down into biuret and oxalic acid, and
  this elucidation of its constitution was soon followed by its
  synthesis. In contrast to this simple ring which is known as a
  "pyrimidine ring", there is in the formulae for adenine and
  guanine a double ring, the so-called "purine ring" which shows a
  still greater concentration of nitrogen atoms.</p>

  <p>In these four fragments of the nucleic-acid
  molecule the carbon and nitrogen atoms are seen to fit together
  according to the same basic plan. The purine ring arises as it
  were as a result of a structural addition to the pyrimidine ring.
  If now the known four pyrimidine and purine derivatives are
  exposed to stronger chemical action or if their behaviour is
  followed in the body, it can be seen that those carbon and
  nitrogen atoms whose linkage permits the formation of the ring
  are rather difficult to separate from one another and that in
  contrast, other atoms which are additionally attached to the
  ring, for example the NH<sub>2</sub> group, can be detached by
  the introduction of the elements of water. In this manner
  derivatives develop which are called hypoxanthine, xanthine, and
  uracil and which at times are found alongside of adenine,
  guanine, and cytosine, and furthermore still other substances
  which appear as end products of animal metabolism.</p>

  <p>Hence now we are clear to a certain extent
  about a part of the nucleic-acid molecule - i.e. the
  nitrogen-containing portion; but there is still a remainder which
  is made up of two dissimilar components. One of these contains 6
  carbon atoms which are linked with oxygen and hydrogen in the
  manner characteristic of <i>carbohydrates</i>; the other which
  contains no carbon is <i>phosphoric</i> acid.</p>

  <p>If the nature of the individual building
  blocks in such a large molecular structure as is present in
  nucleic acid has been ascertained, two new questions arise: What
  are the relative amounts of each block, and how are they mutually
  arranged? The first of these questions has been answered by the
  investigations of H. Steudel. According to his analyses we have
  to assume that for each of the four nitrogen-rich groups there is
  1 carbohydrate molecule and 1 of phosphoric acid. At the present
  time the second question cannot yet be answered adequately. There
  is only one observation which allows the conclusion to be drawn
  of an association between the carbohydrate group and the
  nitrogen-rich bodies, i.e. both fragments, if the nucleic acid is
  carefully broken down, are still found linked together and also
  occur in this combination in the metabolism of plants.</p>

  <p>According to this fleeting survey of our
  present knowledge and opinions, nucleic acid appears as a complex
  of at least 12 building blocks, but in the living cell the
  structure is probably larger, because some observations suggest
  that in the organs several of these complexes are combined with
  each other.</p>

  <p>I have attempted to give a description of
  one nucleic acid, which is contained in certain cells of the
  animal organism, but this is not the sole form in which
  representatives of the nucleic-acid group appear. Investigations
  of various organisms and various organs of the same individual
  have demonstrated an important diversity in the structure of this
  class of substances. The same phenomenon is repeated in the
  nucleic acid which we know in proteins, fats, bile acids and many
  other biochemical products - the development of a whole series of
  various kinds of substances which show the same architectural
  idea carried out in many and varied ways.</p>

  <p>The structure I have outlined of the
  nucleic acids is repeated in other organs in a simpler manner.
  For example, a nucleic acid is found, in the cells of yeast,
  which lacks thymine, one of the four nitrogen-containing groups,
  and which instead of the 6-membered carbohydrate ring contains
  one with 5 members. The composition of <i>inosinic</i> and
  <i>guanylic</i> acids is still simpler. The first-named was
  already discovered by Liebig, though Haiser first recognized its
  chemical nature, and occurs in muscle and contains in the place
  of the four nitrogen-containing substances only a single one and
  this in a somewhat altered form, and also a carbohydrate with
  only 5 carbon atoms. A similar structure must be ascribed to
  <i>guanylic acid</i>, a substance which was first discovered by
  Olof Hammarsten and Ivar Bang. Here also there is only one
  nitrogen-containing group, in this case guanine, and here also
  there is a 5-membered chain of carbon atoms linked as a
  carbohydrate with guanine and phosphoric acid.</p>

  <p>It is quite understandable that the
  interest of biochemists has been drawn to these substances since
  they have become recognized as the simplest members of the
  nucleic-acid groups. This knowledge is still recent; research
  first of all made its way through forms intricate and difficult
  to recognize, before it succeeded in getting a hold on forms,
  which are simple and easy to grasp. We do not know whether
  inosinic and guanylic acids are of the same importance to the
  life of the cell as the complicated nucleic acids; at present in
  particular it has not been established if the site of the two
  last-named acids is to be sought in the chromatin of the cell
  nucleus.</p>

  <p>As I have previously mentioned the complex
  nucleic acids are found in this morphologically so important
  structure in combination with "proteins" and these combinations
  can occur in a large variety of ways. In some organs a loose
  combination of these two components is found which behaves like a
  salt, and from which both the acid and the protein can easily be
  isolated. In other cells there is a firm combination between them
  which is strongly resistant to the action of chemical separating
  agents. The salt-like form is found in the nuclei of erythrocytes
  in the blood of birds and as I have already stated these nuclei
  can be isolated if the red cells are dissolved in water. The
  substance of the cell nucleus then remains behind with some of
  the associated "stroma", as an insoluble mass. If this mass of
  nuclei is brought into contact with dilute acids the greater part
  of the protein is dissolved while the nucleic acid is left.
  Similar loose combinations are found also in cells of the
  glandular tissues: thymus, lymph glands, and the spleen, and in
  all these tissues it can also happen that one part of the
  proteins is present in a firm, another in a loose combination.
  The behaviour of the heads of spermatozoa, which in their origin
  and histological characters really belong to the cell nuclei, is
  note-worthy. It might be assumed that in an organ which possesses
  one and the same function in various animal species, similar
  chemical relationships will be found, but this is not the case as
  regards the protein-nucleic acid combination. In investigations,
  which however have so far only been performed on a small number
  of species of warm-blooded animals, it has been found that in the
  spermatozoa of warm-blooded animals there is a firm combination
  as against a loose one in invertebrates - possibly in many cases
  along with a firm one. Fish spermatozoa behave like the nuclei of
  erythrocytes in birds' blood in which so far only a loose
  combination has always been found, though whether a firm one is
  also present has not yet been decided.</p>

  <p>The nuclei in which there is a <i>loose</i>
  combination of nucleic acid show another notable phenomenon:
  namely, a special disposition of the proteins which are combined
  with the nucleic acid. These have the character of an organic
  base. The nuclei in which the protein is <i>firmly</i> combined
  are much less susceptible to chemical investigation and will be
  omitted in the following description.</p>

  <p>In order to make the transformation of the
  protein molecule to a base comprehensible, I shall try briefly to
  bring out the most essential peculiarities of the chemical
  structure of these class of substances which are so important for
  the organic world.</p>

  <p>Proteins, like the above-mentioned carbon
  compounds of the cell, are made up of a large number of connected
  groups, the so-called "building blocks", by which I mean here a
  complex of directly connected carbon atoms. Where the linkage of
  these carbon atoms is interrupted by other atoms, a detachment of
  these blocks usually occurs when the large molecules break down
  in or outside the organism. The number of carbon atoms which are
  encountered in direct and firm combination in these large
  building blocks of protein amounts - so far as has been
  ascertained with certainty hitherto - to a maximum of 9, possibly
  12, but in most cases the groups are smaller. The uniting of
  these groups with one another is usually induced by a nitrogen
  atom, which at the same time is linked with a hydrogen atom, and
  forms a so-called "imid" group. This method of linkage has been
  determined mainly by the work of Emil Fischer. In special cases
  other methods of linkage may well occur, e.g. the disulphide
  linkage discovered by E. Baumann in which the connection of two
  carbon chains is made by two interlinked sulphur atoms. This
  occurs in cystine, which is known from the work of Count K.A.H.
  M&ouml;rner as a component of the protein molecule. If now the
  protein molecule is broken down, this usually comes about with
  the introduction of the elements of water.</p>

  <p>At least 19 different species can be
  distinguished among the building blocks which thus release
  themselves from the structure of the whole molecule. The majority
  of these building blocks or fragments are dominated as far as the
  inner structure is concerned by one common principle. Nearly all
  these fragments have the characteristics of an "amino acid". As
  an example of such a substance one can put forward amino-valeric
  acid. This contains a chain of carbon atoms to which hydrogen,
  oxygen and nitrogen atoms are attached. The first characteristic
  of these substances is the COOH group which bestows on them the
  qualities of an acid, the second is the NH<sub>2</sub>group whose
  presence induces the qualities of a base. Now we know of amino
  acids which as in the example given of delta-amino-eta-valeric
  acid contain an equal number of COOH and NH<sub>2</sub>groups;
  also others in which there is one NH<sub>2</sub>group more, and
  still others which contain one COOH group more. In the latter the
  acid qualities, and in the former, the so-called diamino acids,
  the basic qualities predominate.</p>

  <table width="348" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="fig3.gif" width="348" height="153" alt=
      "Figure"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The multiplicity of the protein-forming amino acids is however
  not solely due to these variations in the number of the COOH and
  NH<sub>2</sub>groups, but also to the number of the carbon atoms
  which are linked in a chain. We can obtain chains with 2, 3, 5 or
  6 carbon atoms from the protein molecule, and further variations
  may be brought about by the separation of one of the hydrogen
  atoms from the carbon atom through introduction of an atom of
  oxygen or sulphur, or because a complicated organic group, for
  instance with 3C, 2N, and 3H, takes the place of one H atom.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="fig4.gif" width="350" height="115" alt=
      "Figure"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As well as these amino acids a quite different kind of atom
  group is found in the series of protein-forming building blocks,
  which contains one carbon atom and two nitrogen atoms and in the
  molecule this group is always in combination with the
  diaminovaleric acid mentioned previously. The combination of this
  "amidine group" with diaminovaleric acid, or omithine, which is
  named "arginine" was discovered by E. Schulze and demonstrated by
  S.G. Hedin to be a component of protein.</p>

  <table width="350" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thus the protein molecule is made up from such building
  blocks. We do not know how often each block is repeated in the
  whole structure but we are able to determine the relative
  proportion between the amounts of the variously formed building
  blocks. For example, we can determine how large the amount of the
  diamino acids is compared with the monoamino acids and what
  percentage of the total nitrogen is present in the form of
  diaminovaleric acid. Already these ratios, though they do not
  give any idea of the relative arrangement of the blocks, have
  shown quite important differences between the proteins
  investigated hitherto, and further they show that among them, the
  previously mentioned loosely bound proteins of the cell nucleus
  occupy a quite special place.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of these nuclear proteins
  depends on the fact that larger amounts of certain kinds of
  building blocks, namely the nitrogen-rich groups, are concerned
  in their construction. Thus for example in comparison with the
  remaining proteins they contain larger amounts of diamino acids,
  especially diaminovaleric acid, and the amidine groups attached
  to it; histidine can also occur in them in large amounts.</p>

  <p>The insertion of these nitrogen-containing
  group in the protein molecule is moreover such that strongly
  basic groups are present in the <i>freely reactive state</i>.</p>

  <p>A protein of this kind is found for example
  in the nuclei of birds' erythro-cytes and as I have already
  mentioned may be easily removed by dilute mineral acids. It is
  called "histone". Similar substances are widely distributed in
  the tissues of higher and lower animals in a salt-like
  combination with nucleic acid. They also occur in the spermatozoa
  of invertebrates, e.g. the sea-urchins, Cephalopoda, and also in
  the spermatozoa of certain fishes. As an example of this I can
  quote various kinds of cod, from the testicles of which we could
  obtain a histone which is very similar in its chemical qualities
  and composition to the histone obtained from the erythrocytes of
  birds or from the thymus.</p>

  <p>These histones, loosely combined with
  nucleic acid, thus show the nature of the usually complicated
  proteins and are only differentiated from them by one special
  quality, the prevalence of free <i>basic</i> groups.</p>

  <p>If the testicles of other fish are
  submitted to the same investigation, bodies of a much simpler
  composition are obtained which take the place of the histone in
  the heads of the sperms; these are <i>protamines</i>.</p>

  <p>The opinion has been formed from a whole
  series of observations which I shall not mention here that these
  basic proteins have arisen in the course of development through
  transformation of the ordinary proteins in that the groups poorer
  in nitrogen have gradually been dissolved out of them. This
  transformation can be more or less extensive. It leads from the
  ordinary proteins, first to the histones, and if the elimination
  process is carried on still further we arrive at the protamines.
  These are thus still poorer in monoamino acids and relatively
  richer in diamino acids than histone. But the protamines also
  differ from one another and are obviously linked by intermediate
  steps with the histones. The sturine obtained from sturgeon roe
  contains for ex-ample all four of the previously mentioned
  nitrogen-rich groups of the protein molecule: two diamino acids
  of which one is combined with the amidine groups, and in
  addition, histidine. Other protamines contain only two or three
  of the known basic groups. The variety in the composition of the
  protein molecule is notably reduced in the heads of sperms of
  certain Salmonidae, and here the whole molecule is limited to 5
  different kinds of building blocks. Two of these, diaminovaleric
  acid and the amidine group are the main carriers of the nitrogen
  and predominate in quantity over the remainder, carrying about
  88% of the total nitrogen.</p>

  <p>Thus in this peculiar transformation more
  and more of the long nitrogen-poor carbon chains which are so
  essential in the build-up of most proteins that they form the
  main part, disappear, and against this a group becomes evident
  which shows C and N in an alternating arrangement. This
  arrangement is present also in another component of the cell
  nucleus, namely nucleic acid, as we have seen.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If we now summarize the results of the
  investigations of loosely bound nuclein substances, the result is
  a follows: A composition of the chromatin substance of the cell
  nucleus from two components, the one rich in bound phosphoric
  acid and having the qualities of an acid; the second showing a
  protein with the qualities of a base. In their chemical structure
  both components show a notable similarity based on the remarkable
  accumulation of nitrogen atoms and because of this chemical
  structure the chromatin formations can be sharply differentiated
  from the remaining cell components; and this quality must
  obviously be associated with the function of the chromatin
  substances. These atom groups rich in nitrogen and containing
  phosphorus are those whose deposits in the chromosomes are first
  set in motion during cell division and whose transmission to
  other cells forms an essential part of the reproductive
  process.</p>

  <p>At this point we have arrived at problems
  the solution of which can only be attained by various methods of
  research working together. The representatives of morphological
  sciences see under the microscope a structure deposited in the
  cell and study the dependence of its form on the conditions of
  the elementary organism. The biochemist tries to define the
  composition of this structure, its position in the chemical
  system and at the same time its relation to other chemical
  components of the cell, but this task demands theories of
  structural chemistry and the aid of synthetic methods.</p>

  <p>Thus the results which I have attempted to
  portray today have originated from various research institutions,
  and the names of many people would have to be mentioned if the
  merits of all contributors were to be acknowledged.</p>
