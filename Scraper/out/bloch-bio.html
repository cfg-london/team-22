  <h1>Konrad Bloch - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bloch.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Konrad E.
  Bloch</b> was born on 21st January 1912, in Neisse, Upper
  Silesia, then Germany, the son of Fritz Bloch and his wife
  Hedwig, n&eacute;e Striemer. He attended the elementary school and
  the Real gymnasium in the same city and in 1930 went to Munich to
  study chemistry at the Technische Hochschule. He became soon
  attracted to organic chemistry, especially the structure of
  natural products, an interest which he owed in large measure to
  the inspired teaching of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1930/index.html">Hans Fischer</a>. Another
  influential experience was to attend the Sessions of the
  M&uuml;nchener Chemische Gesellschaft and to hear the great
  organic chemists of the time, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/index.html">Adolph Windaus</a>,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1927/index.html">Heinrich
  Wieland</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/index.html">Rudolf
  Willst&auml;tter</a> report their researches on steroids,
  porphyrins and enzymes.<br>
  <br>
  For racial reasons his studies in Munich ended in 1934 after he
  had obtained the degree of Diplom-Ingenieur in Chemistry. Leaving
  Germany Bloch was fortunate to find a temporary position at the
  Schweizerische Forschungsinstitut in Davos, Switzerland. His
  assignment there was to investigate the phospholipids of tubercle
  bacilli, his first exposure to biochemical research.<br>
  <br>
  In 1936 Bloch was able to immigrate to the United States as he
  had long hoped. On advice by the late Max Bergmann and with the
  generous support of the Wallerstein Foundation, he entered the
  Department of Biochemistry, College of
  Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, where he became
  a graduate student under Hans T. Clarke. Research leading to the
  Ph.D. degree was completed in 1938. Rudolf Schoenheimer then
  asked Bloch to join his research group. The first few years spent
  at Columbia with Schoenheimer and his associate David Rittenberg
  were certainly the most influential of his &laquo;Lehrjahre&raquo;.
  This period more than any other developed his lasting interest in
  intermediary metabolism and problems of biosynthesis. During that
  time (in 1942) Bloch in collaboration with David Rittenberg
  initiated the work on the biological synthesis of cholesterol
  which was to occupy his research interests for nearly twenty
  years.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 Bloch moved to the University of Chicago as Assistant Professor
  of Biochemistry. Appointments to Associate Professor and
  Professor followed in 1948 and 1950, respectively. At Chicago, in
  the Biochemistry Department headed by E. A. Evans Jr., the
  intellectual climate was stimulating and the conditions ideal for
  the development of young investigators. Work on cholesterol,
  biosynthesis was continued and progressed well with the aid of
  able and enthusiastic students. During the years at Chicago Bloch
  also investigated (with J. Snoke) the enzymatic synthesis of the
  tripeptide glutathione. As a Guggenheim fellow in 1953 he spent a highly
  rewarding year at the Organisch-Chemisches Institut, Eidgen&ouml;ssische
  Technische Hochschule in Zurich with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1939/index.html">L. Ruzicka</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1975/index.html">V. Prelog</a> and their
  colleagues. The biogenetic considerations on terpene-sterol
  relationships developed by the Swiss at that time provided rich
  inspiration for the experimental work in his own laboratory after
  his return to the United States.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 Bloch was appointed Higgins Professor of Biochemistry in
  the Department of Chemistry, Harvard University, and in 1968 he became
  Chairman of the Department. Apart from continuing research on
  various aspects of terpene and sterol biogenesis, he has become
  interested in the enzymatic formation of unsaturated fatty acids
  and more recently in various aspects of biochemical
  evolution.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Bloch is a member of the American Chemical Society, National Academy of Sciences U. S., American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences, American Society of Biological Chemists, Harvey
  Society, American Philosophical Society, a honorary member of
  the Lombardy Academy of Sciences, and a Senior Fellow of the
  Australian
  Academy of Science. He was President of the American Society
  of Biological Chemists (1967), Chairman of the Section of
  Biochemistry, National Academy of Sciences (1966-1969), and
  Chairman of the National Committee for the International Union of
  Biochemistry (1968).<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Bloch has been honored as recipient of the following medals
  and awards: Medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Chimie Biologique
  (1958), Fritzsche Award (American Chemical Society, 1964),
  Centennial Science Award (University of Notre Dame, 1965),
  Cardano Medal (Lombardy Academy of Sciences, 1965), Distinguished
  Service Award (University of Chicago School of Medicine, 1964),
  William Lloyd Evans Award (Ohio State University, 1968). He holds
  honorary doctor degrees from the universities of Uruguay (1966),
  Brazil (1966),
  Nancy (1966), Columbia University (1967), Technische Hochschule,
  Munich (1968), and Brandeis University (1970).<br>

  In 1941 Konrad Bloch married Lore Teutsch, a native of Munich.
  They have two children, Peter, and Susan.</p>
