  <h1>Frank B. Kellogg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kellogg.jpg" class="bio-img">The life of
  <b>Frank Billings Kellogg</b> (December 22, 1856-December 21,
  1937), a farm boy who rose to international preeminence as the
  co-author of a treaty to outlaw war, is a uniquely American
  story. Frank Kellogg was born in Potsdam, N.Y., but the Kellogg
  family, becoming part of the westward movement which gripped the
  country at the end of the Civil War in 1865, settled eventually
  on a wheat farm in Elgin, Olmsted County, Minnesota.<br>
  <br>
  Kellogg's formal education was sketchy. He attended school for a
  year or two in New York State and from his ninth to his
  fourteenth year went to a country school in Minnesota. After five
  years on the farm, he entered a law office in Rochester,
  Minnesota, supporting himself as a handyman for a Rochester
  farmer and teaching himself law, history, Latin, and German with
  the aid of borrowed textbooks. Having passed the state bar
  examination in 1877, he became the city attorney for Rochester
  and two years later the attorney for Olmsted County.<br>
  <br>
  A cousin, Cushman Kellogg Davis, the leading lawyer of St. Paul
  and later a United States senator, recognizing Frank Kellogg's
  energy, tenacity, and skill, invited him, in 1887, to join his
  law firm. In the next twenty years Kellogg earned a substantial
  fortune. He became counsel for some of the railroads, the iron
  mining companies, and the steel manufacturing firms that
  developed the rich Mesabi iron range in Minnesota and,
  consequently, a friend of some of the great business figures of
  the day, among them, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and James J.
  Hill.<br>
  <br>
  Despite such associations, Kellogg achieved national fame as a
  &laquo;trustbuster&raquo;. In 1904 he proffered his opinion to a
  St. Paul newspaper that the General Paper Company, a trust which
  was the marketing agency for a number of paper companies in
  Minnesota and Wisconsin, was a combination in restraint of trade.
  <a href="../1906/index.html">President Theodore Roosevelt</a>,
  whom Kellogg had come to know and to visit occasionally at the
  White House, then asked him to prosecute the company as a special
  attorney of the U.S. government. Kellogg's legal victory was
  complete. He won another antitrust victory against E. H. Harriman
  and the Union Pacific Railroad, and a third in 1911 against John
  D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company in one of the most
  dramatic legal battles of the pre-World War I era. In 1912 he was
  named president of the American Bar Association.<br>
  <br>
  Kellogg was a member of the National Committee of the Republican
  Party from 1904 to 1912 and a delegate to its national
  conventions in 1904, 1908, and 1912. In 1916 he was elected to
  the U.S. Senate, taking his seat on March 4, 1917, in time to
  vote for America's entry into World War I on April 6. In the
  course of his six-year term, he favored agricultural legislation,
  sought to find a balance between laissez-faire and governmental
  control of economic life, supported <a href=
  "../1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson</a> in all of his efforts,
  and tried hard to obtain senatorial ratification of the Treaty of
  Versailles and of the Covenant of the League of Nations, although
  he had some mild reservations about the Covenant.<br>
  <br>
  A poor campaigner, Kellogg lost his try in 1922 for a second term
  in the Senate. In March, 1923, President Harding sent him on his first diplomatic
  mission as a delegate to the fifth Pan-American Conference, which
  was held in Chile, and after his return, President Coolidge, who had succeeded to the
  presidency after Harding's death in August, 1923, named him as
  ambassador to the Court of St. James's - much to his surprise and
  that of a grumbling press. The most important diplomatic affair
  in which he figured in his fourteen months in England was the
  London Reparations Conference convened to accept the Dawes
  Committee report.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 Kellogg succeeded Charles Evans Hughes as secretary of
  state in Coolidge's cabinet, holding the position until 1929. His
  policy toward Mexico on critical problems of oil and land
  expropriation which were solved by legal rather than military
  means, toward Nicaragua despite armed intervention at one point,
  and toward the Caribbean and South American nations has been
  described as one of &laquo;retreat from
  imperialism&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_1">1</a></sup>; his policy
  toward China with whom relations were troubled by outbreaks
  against foreigners in Shanghai and Nanking and by problems of
  tariff autonomy and abolition of extraterritoriality was one of
  &laquo;goodwill&raquo;<sup><a href="#not_2">2</a></sup>; and, in
  general, his policy toward Europe was one of isolationism, in
  part because there were few significant diplomatic problems with
  European nations.<br>
  <br>
  In pursuance of his faith in the efficacy of the legal
  arbitration of international disputes, Kellogg arranged for the
  signing of bilateral treaties with nineteen foreign nations. Of
  the eighty treaties of various kinds which he signed while in
  office - a total breaking the record set by William Jennings
  Bryan from 1913 to 1915 - none was so important to him as the
  Pact of Paris, commonly called the Kellogg-Briand Pact.<br>
  <br>
  Negotiations for the pact originated with <a href=
  "../1926/index.html">Aristide Briand</a>, the French foreign
  minister, who released for publication on April 6, 1927, the
  tenth anniversary of America's entry into World War I, an open
  letter proposing a bilateral Franco-American treaty of perpetual
  friendship denouncing war between the two nations. Kellogg, at
  first cool to the proposal, countered on December 28, 1927, by
  suggesting to Briand the adoption of a multilateral treaty
  renouncing war as an instrument of national policy. Once he had
  made the suggestion, Kellogg devoted his prodigious energies to
  making it a reality. The Pact was signed on August 27, 1928, and
  proclaimed on July 24, 1929, with sixty-four signatories.<br>
  <br>
  Kellogg did not lose faith in the validity of the Pact in his
  remaining eight years of life even though it was characterized by
  one senator as an &laquo;international kiss&raquo; and was broken
  by armed conflict in Manchuria within months of its
  proclamation.<br>
  <br>
  Kellogg returned to St. Paul early in 1929 and during the months
  that followed traveled extensively in America and in Europe to
  receive many honors, among them the Nobel Peace Prize, the French
  Legion of Honor, and honorary degrees from many universities. In
  1930 he filled Hughes's unexpired term on the Permanent Court of
  International Justice and was then elected to a full term of his
  own. Because of failing health, however, he was forced to resign
  from the Court in 1935 and retired to his home in St. Paul where
  he died in 1937 on the eve of his eighty-first birthday of
  pneumonia, following a stroke.</p>
