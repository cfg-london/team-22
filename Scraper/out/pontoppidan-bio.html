  <h1>Henrik Pontoppidan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pontoppidan.jpg" class="bio-img">My father, Dines Pontoppidan, belonged to
  an old family of clergymen and was himself a minister. My mother,
  whose maiden name was Oxenb&oslash;l, was the daughter of a
  government official. They had sixteen children. One of the middle
  ones in the flock, I was born on July 24, 1857, in the small
  Jutland town of Fredericia. In 1863, my father was transferred to
  Randers, another Jutland town, where a year later, at the age of
  six, I experienced the invasion of the allied Prussian and
  Austrian armies. When I was seventeen I went to Copenhagen, where
  I was accepted at the Polytechnical College. After a summer trip
  to Switzerland, which was rich in experiences, I started writing.
  In the beginning I aimed at descriptions of nature and folk life
  until, as the years passed, the description of man became my
  chief interest.</p>
  
  <p>My first book was published in 1881. I began with a few volumes
  of smaller tales, among which was <i>Fra hytterne</i> (1887)
  [From the Cottages]. But the subjects which especially attracted
  me demanded a more spacious form and a broader style. I turned to
  the novel, an artistic form which had in former days been
  neglected and had thus acquired a bad reputation, but which
  during the nineteenth century had developed and elevated itself
  to the ranks occupied by drama and the ancient epic. In a
  trilogy, <i>Det forjaettede land</i> (1891-95) [The Promised
  Land], <i>Lykke-Per</i> (1898-1904) [Lucky Peter], and <i>De
  d&oslash;des rige</i> (1912-16) [The Kingdom of the Dead], I have
  attempted to give a continuous picture of the Denmark of today
  through descriptions of human minds and human fates which reflect
  the social, religious, and political struggles of the time. Aside
  from this, over the years I have produced a number of minor and
  more personal works, wherein imagination has been allowed to play
  more freely. I mention <i>Ung elskov</i> (1885) [Young Love],
  <i>Minder</i> (1893) [Memoirs], <i>Den gamle Adam</i> (1894) [The
  Old Adam], <i>H&oslash;jsang</i> (1896) [Song of Songs],
  <i>Borgmester Hoeck og hustru</i> (1905) [Mayor Hoeck and Wife],
  <i>Den kongelige gaest</i> (1908) [The Royal Guest], and <i>Hans
  Kvast og Melusine</i> (1907) [Hans Kvast and Melusine]. My
  collected works comprise approximately forty volumes.</p>
