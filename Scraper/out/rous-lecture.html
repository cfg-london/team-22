  <h2>The Challenge to Man of the Neoplastic Cell</h2>

  <p>Tumors destroy man in a unique and
  appalling way, as flesh of his own flesh which has somehow been
  rendered proliferative, rampant, predatory and ungovernable. They
  are the most concrete and formidable of human maladies, yet
  despite more than 70 years of experimental study they remain the
  least understood. This is the more remarkable because they can be
  evoked at will for scrutiny by any one of a myriad chemical and
  physical means which are left behind as the tumors grow. These
  had acted merely as initiation. Few situations are more
  exasperating to the inquirer than to watch a tiny nodule form on
  a rabbit's skin at a spot from which the chemical agent inducing
  it has long since been gone, and to follow the nodule as it
  grows, and only too often becomes a destructive epidermal cancer.
  What can be the why for these happenings?</p>

  <p>Every tumor is made up of cells that have
  been so singularly changed as no longer to obey the fundamental
  law whereby the cellular constituents of an organism exist in
  harmony and act together to maintain it. Instead the changed
  cells multiply at its expense and inflict damage which can be
  mortal. We term the lawless cells neoplastic because they form
  new tissue, and the growth itself a neoplasm; but on looking into
  medical dictionaries, hoping for more information, we are told,
  in effect, that <i>neoplastic</i> means "of or pertaining to a
  neoplasm", and turning to <i>neoplasm</i> learn that it is "a
  growth which consists of neoplastic cells". Ignorance could
  scarcely be more stark.</p>

  <p>The chemical and physical initiators are
  ordinarily called <i>carcinogens</i>; but this is a misleading
  term because they not only induce the malignant epithelial
  growths known as carcinomas but other neoplasms of widely various
  kinds. In the present paper the less used term <i>oncogens</i>
  will be employed, meaning thereby capable of producing a tumor.
  It hews precisely to the fact.</p>

  <p>Some may exclaim on reading what comes next
  that it consists mostly of truisms. This does not make these the
  less vital to my theme.</p>

  <p>Tumors occur in vertebrates of so many
  kinds that it would not be surprising if neoplastic changes took
  place in them all. Normal cells of any sort capable of
  multiplying in response to ordinary stimuli are liable to become
  neoplastic if acted upon by an initiator. It follows that the
  growths they form are almost incredibly multifarious, and this
  not only because of their widely various, cellular sources but
  because tumors of several kind may derive from a single one.
  Nevertheless the changed cells are all alike in the basic respect
  that they disobey the law of organism. Obviously what has to be
  understood is not the tumor but the neoplastic state of its
  cells. These are all animated by some principle exploiting their
  capabilities. In this respect the problem they present is a
  coherent entity.</p>

  <p>The range in effectiveness of neoplastic
  changes in tumors is exceedingly great. Often the obvious
  alterations undergone by tumor cells are so slight that they look
  scarcely different from the normal and function in a similar way,
  retaining the task of storing fat for example. Yet even such
  cells, when forming tumors possess an abnormal power to multiply,
  however slowly they divide. They are euphemistically termed
  "benign". The cells of some not only retain the normal ability to
  form hormones needed by the body but may produce these in such
  quantity as to disturb it greatly; and the hormones themselves
  are sometimes changed to a pathological extent.</p>

  <p>In proportion as neoplastic cells diverge
  from the normal they ordinarily function less well. As time goes
  on their ability to multiply usually increases, and often they
  undergo such alterations in their state as to render them lawless
  and a threat to life. For the tumors they produce we again use a
  humanistic term, "malignant". The changes for the worse undergone
  by their cells are not gradual but are the result of
  discontinuous steps according to their magnitude, sometimes
  several of them following one another at intervals, and they may
  take place in differing directions with result in heterogeneous
  growths. With each change in this <i>decensus averni</i> -
  "progression" as I've ventured to term it - the cells leave
  behind more of the specialized features which have distinguished
  them when normal, until at last they may have wholly lost all of
  their normal aspect, becoming so completely "anaplastic" that one
  cannot tell their source. As the consecutive changes go on they
  tend to lose their adherence to one another, and not infrequently
  they become a disorderly mob, penetrating the adjacent normal
  tissue in groups, or individually, and destroying it. They
  frequently enter blood vessels or lymph channels and, coming
  loose within, are borne along on their fluid, to lodge in distant
  organs and there form secondary tumors of the same sort,
  "metastases" Sometimes it's every cell for itself! Not
  infrequently a primary neoplastic change resulting in malignancy
  makes the affected cells so fatally ill that they would form no
  tumors did not their rate of division exceed that of their death.
  Here one is inclined to ask whether extreme neoplastic changes
  may not sometimes kill cells at once.</p>

  <p>Many of the chemical and physical
  initiators already mentioned must be brought to bear for quite a
  time before their oncogenic effect becomes perceptible. Often
  those of different kinds, when applied successively, have
  cumulative action. Since neoplastic change manifests itself by
  tumor formation as a culminating event the assumption is
  generally made that it occurs abruptly; but facts speak
  decisively against this view. Epidermal carcinomas of the penis
  almost never occur if circumcision has been done at birth,
  whereas if delayed until adolescence, in persons of the same
  race, penile cancers not infrequently arise when the man grows
  old, for no reason that is then perceptible. Evidently in these
  instances some initiating oncogen must have acted upon the
  epidermal cells prior to circumcision, though not sufficiently to
  bring about neoplastic changes at that time, but only what can be
  termed a preneoplastic condition that has persisted in the cells'
  descendants and at last has come to completion, or been brought
  to it by some imperceptible, new initiating actor then. Similar
  long-time culminating events have been observed in my laboratory
  during study of rabbit skin exposed many months previously to an
  initiating oncogen without any growth occurring in the
  interval.</p>

  <p>Tests have shown that single living cells,
  taken from notably vigorous tumors and transferred to other
  inbred animals of the same stock, will give rise to growths of
  the same sort; yet the traits of neoplastic cells cannot easily
  be discerned by studying them singly. When many are proliferating
  together in tumors though, much can be learnt about them.</p>

  <p>An exceedingly important trait of most
  neoplastic cells is their unnatural excitability which sometimes
  renders them extremely active on what seems slight encouragement.
  Infection with inflammatory bacteria often has this effect.
  Indeed merely the healing of a hole a centimeter across punched
  through a rabbit's ear that had been swabbed on its smooth inner
  surface with an oncogenic tar some weeks before may cause several
  tumors to start forth from the epidermal sheet that is extending
  in to close the hole, although elsewhere has arisen none. Some of
  the growths thus elicited actually behave as if malignant, their
  cells invading and replacing those of the new connective tissue
  underlying them. But this activity only lasts as long as they are
  exposed to reparative stimulation. When this ceases, on closure
  of the hole, the growths disappear leaving an epidermal layer
  which appears normal microscopically but is not, as shown by
  recurrence of the spurious malignancy when a new hole is punched
  inside the boundaries of the old. The hidden cells rendered
  neoplastic by the tar had not been altered one whit, merely
  exploited by the stimulus of healing. Many initiating chemicals
  possess the power to act in this way on the cells that they have
  caused to undergo neoplastic change but they do so only during
  the period of their application. Promotion, as Dr. Friedewald and
  I termed it, can have a great deal to do with the behavior of
  tumors.</p>

  <p>Neoplastic cells never get well if they are
  self-assertive, meaning thereby capable of forming a tumor
  without any extraneous help such as promotion. The great majority
  are of this kind, as is evident from their success of
  transplantation. Those that have got worse by steps never retrace
  these. Were this not the case, one would find at autopsy now and
  then residual nodules composed of cells to all appearance normal
  marking the place where once there was a tumor. Neoplasms
  occasionally get smaller for one intercurrent reason or another,
  and often they are forced to disappear when subjected to strong
  irradiation. Yet in both instances the cells languish and die as
  the same neoplastic elements that they previously were. They
  never revert to the normal and are potentially immortal by way of
  their progeny if transferred to compatible new hosts before they
  have slain the old. Not a few rat and mouse tumors have in this
  way been maintained for study throughout more than fifty
  years.</p>

  <p>A striking trait of actively multiplying,
  neoplastic cells is their ability to evoke from the adjacent
  tissue the blood vessels and structural support needed for the
  production and maintenance of the growths they are capable of
  forming. In proportion to the rate at which these latter enlarge,
  their demands of this sort become peremptory, unless indeed their
  cells have become capable of actively invading and replacing the
  normal tissue next them and hence are capable of "living off the
  country". One can perceive how crucial for most growths help of
  his kind is by scattering amidst the subcutaneous tissue of a
  mouse tiny fragments of a murine mammary carcinoma containing
  several mingled neoplastic components of widely differing
  capabilities. This can be done by rapidly injecting a suspension
  of the fragments in salt solution under the dorsal skin of
  another mouse, together with sufficient air to split the
  underlying connective tissue horizontally, thus "plating out" the
  tiny bits of tissue on its broad expanse, much as bacteria are
  purposely scattered for colony formation on an expanse of
  nutritive agar. Many of the fragments thus implanted soon give
  rise to tumors, because their cells call forth blood-vessels and
  stroma swiftly from the tissue on which they lie, whereas some
  others do no more than survive because their cells are devoid of
  such evocative powers. It is as if the normal tissue were acting
  as a school for iniquity and rapidly promoting its worst
  scholars.</p>

  <p>However slowly neoplastic cells divide,
  they must of course obtain additional food if they are to
  multiply; and however "benign" the growing tumors, their demands
  can be peremptory. During old times in China, when surgery was
  seldom done, benign tumors sometimes reached a prodigious size
  whereas the body serving them emaciated because of their first
  claim upon its food. One can witness the same course of events
  after implanting a small piece of benign mouse tumor at a
  subcutaneous spot in another mouse where it can grow big without
  damaging the adjacent tissue. The resulting growth gets huge,
  while the body wastes.</p>

  <p>With the sole exception of the tumor cells
  initiated and actuated by hormones and viruses - which have yet
  to be discussed - neoplastic cells neither give off any tell-tale
  substance indicative of their presence nor elicit any specific
  reaction from the body, whereby it can be certainly discerned;
  nor do they form any injurious substance characteristic of
  themselves even while flourishing in great number or undergoing
  necrosis. True, the body often reacts against them while they are
  small, as it does against grafts of incompatible normal tissue,
  destroying these; yet so rarely do established tumors disappear
  that such happenings seem miraculous. The generality of them,
  while growing, do away so completely with the initial resistance
  the body offers to strange cells that even grafts from animals of
  alien species may succeed. Pig skin has been known to flourish
  when transplanted to the skin of volunteers having inoperable
  lymphoid cancers.</p>

  <p>Confronted with the dire challenge offered
  by neoplastic cells the physician does what he can. Now he is
  fortunately sometimes aided, and to a life-saving extent, through
  the discoveries of Dr. Huggins, experimental oncologist and
  practicing surgeon, who has shown that the existence of not a few
  cancers in the human body, notably those of the prostatic gland,
  are initiated, actuated and promoted by hormones formed within
  the patient's body, and that many of them can be made to
  disappear by bringing other hormones or chemically related agents
  to bear upon them. Dr. Huggins will tell in his lecture about
  these actual "cures of cancer", unique achievements in this
  present day.</p>

  <p>Here one fact deserves strong stress,
  namely the tacit assumption of the medical consultant, based on
  the experience of his innumerable predecessors that the presence
  of a growth does not ordinarily imply any significant liability
  in the same individual to others of differing sorts, unless
  indeed his patient has tissues ultra-sensitive to initiating
  agents through inheritance, as in the case of those unfortunates
  who are albinos or who are subject to intestinal popyposis, both
  of which render the affected tissues abnormally susceptible to
  oncogenic changes. The physician's attitude in this relation
  signifies how dependent most neoplastic changes are on
  intercurrent, episodic initiation.</p>

  <p>What can be the nature of the generality of
  neoplastic changes, the reason for their persistence, their
  irreversibility, and for the discontinuous, steplike alterations
  that they frequently undergo? A favorite explanation has been
  that oncogens cause alterations in the genes of the cells of the
  body, somatic mutations as these are termed. But numerous facts,
  when taken together, decisively exclude this supposition<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The number of viruses now realized to cause
  disease has become great during the last half century, but
  relatively few have any connection with the production of
  neoplasms. Yet it should be said at once that what they are now
  known to do has surpassed all imagination.</p>

  <p>Two Danes, Ellermann and Bang, reported the
  first tumor virus in 1908<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
  It caused leukemia in chickens and they made six successive
  passages of it from fowl to fowl, producing the same disease each
  time. They studied it until 1923, meanwhile reporting upon a
  second virus causing a chicken leukemia of a different sort. Yet
  though their work was convincing its findings were written off
  because the leukemias were not then realized to be neoplastic
  diseases nor indeed until after 1930.</p>

  <p>In 1910 I described a malignant chicken
  sarcoma which could be propagated by transplanting its cells,
  these multiplying in their new hosts and forming new tumors of
  the same sort. In other ways the growth showed itself to be a
  neoplasm of a classical sort, yet, as reported in 1911, its cells
  yielded a causative virus. Numerous workers had already tried by
  then to get extraneous causes from transplanted mouse and rat
  tumors but the transferred cells had held their secret close.
  Hence the findings with the sarcoma were met with down-right
  disbelief, though soon several other, morphologically different,
  "spontaneous" chicken tumors were propagated by transplantation
  and from each a virus was got causing growths of its kind. Not
  until after some 15 years of disputation amongst oncologists were
  the findings with chickens deemed valid, and then they were
  relegated to a category distinct from that of mammals because
  from them no viruses could be obtained. Only in 1925, through the
  efforts of a British worker, W.E. Gye, was much attention given
  them by scientists.</p>

  <p>The virus causing the chicken sarcoma first
  studied, now generally termed the RSV, has been maintained for
  more than fifty-five years and is still studied in many
  countries. Throughout most of this time it would engender growths
  only in chickens and closely related fowls; but of late several
  extraneous, non-neoplastic viruses have become associated with
  it, during its passage in unusual avian hosts; and its scope has
  thus been so enlarged that now not at few mammals, including
  monkeys, have been found to develop tumors after inoculation with
  the enhanced material.</p>

  <p>After working out the complex relationship
  existing between the RSV, the cells it affects and their hosts, I
  tried for several years to get causative viruses from the
  transplantable tumors of rodents but with the same failures as
  previous investigators and hence quit the neoplastic problem for
  others in pathology which proved rewarding. Not until 1933 did a
  virus opportunity come my way again. Richard Shope of the
  Rockefeller Institute (a man already renowned for his discovery
  of animal diseases with human implications) reported then on a
  virus causing the giant warts often present on the skin of wild
  "cottontail" rabbits in the southwestern U.S.A. On inoculation
  this virus proved effective only in rabbits, and it produced far
  more vigorous warts on animals of domestic breeds than on its
  native host, the cottontail. When describing the growths of both
  species Shope remarked that they might be true tumors. He knew of
  my fruitless search for a mammalian tumor virus, and he and I had
  long been friends. Hence he asked me to determine the character
  of the warts, saying that he knew nothing about tumors and
  already had more than he could do, what with possessing four new
  viruses responsible for animal diseases of other sorts. Thus it
  came about that I experimented as his deputy throughout many
  later years. Now and again he reported on the peculiarities of
  the papilloma virus as such, but never concerned himself with its
  relationship to tumors until after the work in my laboratory had
  ended. He died - and of cancer - less than a year ago. One of his
  last papers, written while ill, ranks as a classic<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It is concerned with "the many sly
  and devious ways that viruses may behave in causing tumors"; and
  he stressed, as example, an extraordinary finding reported by him
  early, namely that the papilloma virus can rarely be recovered
  from the prodigiously active growths it yields in domestic
  rabbits although immunological tests show it to be present and it
  can regularly be got in quantity from the cottontail growths.</p>

  <p>Experimentation carried out in my
  laboratory together with Beard, Kidd, Friedewald and MacKenzie
  showed the "warts" produced by the virus to be genuine tumors,
  benign epidermal papillomas in which the virus persists although
  eliciting an antibody capable of neutralizing it on direct
  exposure. The same anomalous state of affairs had previously been
  found to exist in chickens carrying the first tumor that yielded
  a virus and experiments had disclosed the fact that the
  phagocytes of normal blood can protect ingested bacteria from
  antibodies present in the surrounding medium, as long as they
  themselves remain alive and will even shield from a markedly
  hemolytic serum the phagocyted red cells from a foreign species.
  Later work with Hudack and McMaster showed that rabbit
  fibroblasts separated from one another with trypsin and placed in
  a suspension containing vaccinia virus would, on becoming
  infected with this, protect it from a strong antibody placed in
  the surrounding fluid, but only so long as they remained
  alive.</p>

  <p>These findings enable one to understand why
  the Shope papilloma virus flourishes in the proliferating cells
  of cottontail growths despite the strong antibody that it
  engenders, and why it never causes the normal cells around it to
  become neoplastic but instead produces tumors which grow by
  intrinsic cell multiplication, "caus sich heraus", to use the
  German phrase, like the neoplasms of unknown cause.</p>

  <p>After some months carcinomas arose from
  most of the actively proliferating virus papillomas of both
  cottontail and domestic rabbits, owing to further changes in
  their cells resembling those that take place now and again in
  benign papillomas initiated in rabbits by chemical agents and
  actuated in some way unknown. Yet they are unlike in certain
  distinctive, cytological respects; and when the papilloma virus
  was injected into the blood stream of domestic rabbits carrying
  papillomas due to chemical initiation it localized in these and
  urged them on, rendering them much more vigorous, and altering
  the cells of some in such wise that they became mongrel growths
  exhibiting merged features referable to both agents, and making
  others carcinomatous forthwith. Furthermore when fragments of the
  epidermal carcinomas, arising from papillomas induced in
  cottontail rabbits by oncogenic hydrocarbons, were exposed to the
  Shope virus <i>in vitro</i> and reimplanted in the animals from
  which they had been procured, their cells, on proliferating anew,
  exhibited the mongrel aspect indicative of viral influence, and
  their malignancy was also greatly enhanced.</p>

  <p>Later tests showed that after the brief
  application of a hydrocarbon known to be a powerful oncogen, to
  the lightly scarified skin of domestic rabbits, into which the
  papilloma virus had just been rubbed, the "warts" that arose
  during the next few days looked and behaved like those induced as
  controls elsewhere on the scarified skin; and yet they underwent
  carcinomatous changes much earlier than did these latter,
  although the chemical previously applied was known to be devoid
  of "promotional" effect. The inference seemed justified that it
  had acted on the same cellular mechanism as the papilloma
  virus.</p>

  <p>Some of the carcinomas arising from the
  papillomas of domestic rabbits were serially transplanted, and
  one that soon became anaplastic and exceedingly malignant has now
  been maintained for 28 years by transfer from rabbit to rabbit.
  Never has it yielded a virus of any sort, and tests of the blood
  of its early successive hosts showed that the antigen inducing an
  antibody against the papilloma virus was gradually disappearing.
  Now it has been gone for many years. This cancer, known as the V
  x 2, is studied in many laboratories today because, like the
  generality of those due to other causes, it yields no sign of
  what actuates it. Obviously the Shope virus had been merely an
  initiator when producing the V x 2, though some antigenic remnant
  of it had persisted for a while. In this relation a remarkable
  recent discovery by the Kleins of the Royal Caroline Institute of
  Sweden deserves mention, namely that certain polycyclic
  hydrocarbons initiating mouse tumors put a specific, antigenic
  mark on these, which persists despite repeated transplantation of
  the growths.</p>

  <p>Nature sometimes seems possessed of a
  sardonic humor. In the 1930's a group of American geneticists,
  long concerned with the incidence of "spontaneous" tumors in
  rodents, undertook to determine how a pronounced liability of
  female mice of certain strains to develop mammary carcinomas as
  they grow old is inherited; and by breeding tests they came upon
  the astounding fact that this liability reaches the young from
  their mothers. How can this be? Was it passed on through the
  ovum, the placenta, or what? A member of their group made a
  revealing test soon afterwards. He arranged for some of the young
  of the strain under study to be suckled from birth by mice of a
  breed in which the cancers do not occur; and the mice thus
  wet-nursed never had any! His later work showed that the
  liability to these cancers had been due to a virus passed on to
  the young in their very first milk. This virus lay latent within
  them until they matured, and then it caused orderly, benign
  tumors in the breasts of the females; and from these growths
  carcinomas derived by steplike changes like those already
  described. To this day no virus directly responsible for the
  cancers has been obtained from these, but only the "milk virus"
  producing the benign growths. The problem of the actuating cause
  of the cancers remains unsolved like that of the V x 2 carcinoma
  of rabbits<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In both
  instances the virus causing the benign tumor was no more than an
  initiator of the malignant growth deriving from them.</p>

  <p>In 1953 Gross<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> discovered a neoplastic virus that
  has greatly widened knowledge. He obtained it from a carcinoma
  arising spontaneously in the parotid gland of a mouse and on
  inoculation into other mice it proved capable of producing tumors
  of more than 20 kinds, and some as well in rats, rabbits, guinea
  pigs, hamsters and ferrets. Because of these widely various
  neoplastic effects it has been aptly termed the polyoma virus.
  The growths it induces can be maintained indefinitely by
  transplantation, and nearly always the virus disappears from them
  as time goes on, yet the activity of the tumor does not lessen.
  Obviously in such instances its role is no more than that of an
  initiator, comparable in this respect to the chemical and
  physical oncogens. Very occasionally though, it is an actuating
  agent as well, persisting and multiplying in a parotid cancer
  like the one originally providing it, and from this favorable
  growth it can be recovered anew and started again on its
  polyomatous career. Under natural conditions the virus maintains
  itself as an infectious agent widely prevalent in mice but
  causing only a trivial, scarcely perceptible illness of
  non-neoplastic sort save in those rare instances in which it
  produces a tumor.</p>

  <p>No virus has as yet been found that
  indubitably actuates neoplasms in man. Yet this is not to say
  that viruses play no part in initiating them occasionally. Now
  and again a human cancer arises where a virus has persistently
  wreaked inflammatory injury. The virus causing "fever blisters"
  often next the mouth of persons who are notably susceptible to
  its action provides an instance in point, cancer sometimes
  arising after a while from the epidermal tissue long kept in a
  disturbed state. One sees the same course of events occasionally
  on skin where the severe virus causing herpes zoster ("shingles")
  has left tissue permanently damaged. Yet these instances tell no
  more, as concerns causation, than do the cancers that now and
  then arise on the skin of old people where it was burned in
  youth. Sunlight provides yet other examples, cancer arising from
  skin that it has kept inflamed instead of tanned. In all these
  instances the tumors have been merely initiated. No virus
  actuating any of them has been discovered.</p>

  <p>Of late many gifted investigators have
  sought new neogiastic viruses, with the aid of technics recently
  devised, and not a few of these agents have been disclosed in
  rodents. Certain adeno-viruses of man fail to cause any tumors in
  their human hosts yet do this in small mammals to which they are
  foreign. Some viruses of both chickens and mammals, which cause
  no tumors when acting alone, do it when they are inoculated
  together. The possibilities in both these directions are
  boundless, opening vistas of complexity. Yet they will not be
  dealt with here because a far greater problem presses, that of
  man's mortality from cancer today. About one person in six is now
  slain by neoplastic cells. Can nothing be done to combat
  these?</p>

  <p>During this present century we have learnt
  enough to take up the task. First there was the observation that
  the tumors of mammals closely resemble our own. Soon they were
  maintained by transplantation for study. Next came the
  realization that what one discovers by experimenting with the
  tumors of rodents throws light on what happens in man. And then
  in 1918 came the epoch-making discovery by Yamagiwa and Ichikawa
  that tarring rabbit skin will cause tumors to arise. This opened
  an era of rewarding search for other chemical agents - and
  physical as well - which do the same. It is an era so far from
  done as to have been the main theme a few months ago of the
  International Cancer Congress held in Japan; and it was chosen
  with good reason since some of man's habits, many of the
  occupations through which he earns his living, and the mischances
  taking place in his own body can prove fatal through the growths
  they induce unless something is done to ward them off. All of
  these oncogens are initiating in character, and some can be
  dangerous. promoters too, if the exposure to them is long. The
  wider and closer one looks the more clearly does one see that
  similar agents start off nearly all human tumors, and that these
  are occupational diseases resulting from the exceedingly
  hazardous occupation of living out a life in this world. Despite
  all preventive steps - and many are taken in civilized lands -
  deaths from cancer have scarcely been lessened.</p>

  <p>What can be the character of the alteration
  which renders a cell and its progeny permanently neoplastic, and
  so self-assertive in its behavior as to kill? On these matters we
  have as yet only the meager information provided by the
  neoplastic viruses of animals. Innumerable attempts have been
  made to obtain evidence of the action of such agents in human
  tumors and recently to discern them with the electron microscope.
  Yet such attempts have consistently drawn blanks save in a few
  highly dubious instances.</p>

  <p>In the enormity of our ignorance we have
  resorted to the tactic of "try-and-see" on a large scale,
  attempting to destroy the tumors of animals for what any success
  with these may imply for those of man. In all of the larger
  civilized countries efforts with this aim are made and they are
  amply supported with funds, in some instances governmental.
  Already in the U.S.A. more than half a million chemicals, and
  materials of biological origin have been tested. Several
  institutions exist for this special purpose and there is much
  cooperation by large manufacturing concerns. The most encouraging
  results thus far have been those of Dr. Huggins, first obtained
  by studying "on his own" the prostate gland of dogs. As a
  chemotherapeutic enterprise to save patients with prostatic
  cancer his discoveries have proved prodigiously effective. The
  leukemias of children have also been overcome by chemotherapy in
  some instances and the singular, highly malignant lymphomas in
  African children known as Burkitt's disease. Yet the successes
  thus far obtained have been episodic, and no inkling has been
  found, save in the case of the small group of viruses, of what
  happens in a cell when it becomes neoplastic, and how this state
  of affairs is passed on when it multiplies.</p>
