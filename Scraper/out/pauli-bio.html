  <h1>Wolfgang Pauli - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pauli.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Wolfgang Pauli</b> was born on April
  25th, 1900 in Vienna. He received his early education in Vienna
  before studying at the University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld.
  He obtained his doctor's degree in 1921 and spent a year at the
  University
  of G&ouml;ttingen as assistant to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/index.html">Max Born</a> and a further
  year with <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a> at
  Copenhagen. The years 1923-1928 were spent as a lecturer at the
  University of
  Hamburg before his appointment as Professor of Theoretical
  Physics at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. During
  1935-1936, he was visiting Professor at the Institute for Advanced
  Study, Princeton, New Jersey and he had similar appointments
  at the University
  of Michigan (1931 and 1941) and Purdue University
  (1942). He was elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at
  Princeton in 1940 but he returned to Zurich at the end of World
  War II.<br>

  Pauli was outstanding among the brilliant mid-twentieth century
  school of physicists. He was recognized as one of the leaders
  when, barely out of his teens and still a student, he published a
  masterly exposition of the theory of relativity. His exclusion
  principle, which is often quoted bearing his name, crystallized
  the existing knowledge of atomic structure at the time it was
  postulated and it led to the recognition of the two-valued
  variable required to characterize the state of an electron. Pauli
  was the first to recognize the existence of the neutrino, an
  uncharged and massless particle which carries off energy in
  radioactive &szlig;-disintegration; this came at the beginning of
  a great decade, prior to World War II, for his centre of research
  in theoretical physics at Zurich.<br>
  <br>
  Pauli helped to lay the foundations of the quantum theory of
  fields and he participated actively in the great advances made in
  this domain around 1945. Earlier, he had further consolidated
  field theory by giving proof of the relationship between spin
  and"statistics" of elementary particles. He has written many
  articles on problems of theoretical physics, mostly quantum
  mechanics, in scientific journals of many countries; his
  <i>Theory of Relativity</i> appears in the <i>Enzyklopaedie der
  Mathematischen Wissenschaften</i>, Volume 5, Part 2 (1920), his
  <i>Quantum Theory</i> in <i>Handbuch der Physik</i>, Vol. 23
  (1926), and his <i>Principles of Wave Mechanics</i> in
  <i>Handbuch der Physik</i>, Vol. 24 (1933).<br>
  <br>
  Pauli was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London and a
  member of the Swiss Physical Society, the American Physical
  Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
  He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1930.<br>
  <br>
  Wolfgang Pauli married Franciska Bertram on April 4th, 1934. He
  died in Zurich on December 15th, 1958.</p>
