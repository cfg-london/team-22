  <h2>The Development of Liver Therapy in Pernicious Anemia</h2>

  <p>The idea that something in food might be of
  advantage to patients with pernicious anemia was in my mind in
  1912, when I was a house officer at the Massachusetts General
  Hospital, as is noted in certain case records there. Ever since
  my student days, when I had the opportunity, in my father's wards
  at the Massachusetts General Hospital, to distinguish from
  pernicious anemia two cases of chronic hereditary hemolytic
  jaundice, I have taken a deep interest in this disease. I watched
  many patients pass through relapses and remissions, and observed
  that, despite treatment with arsenic, blood transfusions,
  splenectomy, and other procedures, all eventually died. Prolonged
  observation permitted me to become acquainted with the multiple
  variations and many aspects of the disease, and to realize that
  from a few cases it was difficult to determine the effect of
  therapeutic procedures.</p>

  <p>The study of the patients' diets was begun
  in 1915 in an attempt to determine if some sort 'of dietary
  deficiency could be found. The similarity of certain symptoms and
  signs of pernicious anemia to those in pellagra, sprue, and
  beriberi was appreciated, as was the fact that certain sorts of
  anemia were occasionally associated with a faulty diet. Elders,
  among others, suggested in 1922 that such a state of affairs
  existed in pernicious anemia. Furthermore, the almost constant
  occurrence of achlorhydria in pernicious anemia, which appears
  usually long before the anemia and remains in spite of liver
  therapy, led me to wonder if this disorder of the digestive
  system had something to do with the condition which might be in
  the nature of a dietary deficiency disease. Indeed, Fenwick,
  about 1880, suggested the possible primary role of the stomach,
  but it remained for Castle, in 1928, to demonstrate the part this
  organ plays in the causation of the disease.</p>

  <p>The possibility of an excess of fats in the
  diet leading to excessive blood destruction was considered, but
  therapy with low-fat diets was futile. Later the effects of
  high-caloric: feeding with an excess of protein, derived
  especially from meat, were studied at about the same time that
  other physicians, such as Barker, reported some benefit from this
  treatment. The results were not impressive 'but were perhaps
  suggestive.</p>

  <p>Although Pepper in 1875 and Cohnheim in
  1876 recognized that the bone marrow was abnormal, there was a
  prevailing opinion in the early part of this century that
  abnormal blood destruction played an important or primary role in
  the production of the disease. Nevertheless it was believed by
  many physicians, as I was taught, that the production of blood by
  the bone marrow was also deeply implicated. About 1919 the late
  Dr. James Homer Wright taught me to appreciate the character of
  the abnormality of the bone marrow in pernicious anemia, which
  led me to believe firmly that something was needed to make the
  primitive red cells that crowd the bone marrow in relapse grow to
  normal cells; and that it was of no particular value to aim
  treatment towards stopping what has been called excessive blood
  destruction in this disease. In 1922 Whipple suggested that in
  pernicious anemia there might be a scarcity of material from
  which the stroma of the red blood cells was formed, or that there
  existed a disease of the stroma-forming cells of the bone marrow.
  This concept fitted with the idea that there was a deficiency of
  something in the body and that dysfunction of pigments metabolism
  was resultant, or of secondary importance.</p>

  <p>'For centuries the concept that food bore a
  relationship to anemia had been vaguely expressed in the
  literature. It had been shown that liver and kidneys, rich in
  complete proteins, promoted the growth of animals, and that
  substances in liver could enhance cell division. It was likewise
  recognized that liver-feeding could benefit patients with sprue
  (Manson, 1883) and pellagra. These were among the reasons that
  led to the choice of liver as a substance likely to enhance blood
  formation. Of invaluable importance was Whipple's fundamental and
  classical work on hemoglobin regeneration by means of liver and
  other foods in anemia due to blood loss in dogs. He has now
  placed upon a secure quantitative basis the influence of food
  upon anemia.</p>

  <p>A few patients were fed relatively small
  amounts of liver during 1924 and early 1925. Although these first
  patients did better than expected, the results permitted no more
  than speculations. Then Dr. Murphy joined in the work and we
  pursued the study of these and subsequent cases. Liver had been
  fed by Gibson and Howard and other individuals to pernicious
  anemia patients but without persistence or definite results. It
  seemed to us that to accomplish our object a large weighed amount
  of liver should be fed daily with regularity. Likewise to
  determine the effect it was considered essential that data should
  be obtained in a large number of cases to be appropriately
  compared with controls. By May, 1926, we had fed liver
  intensively and daily to 45 patients. In many of these patients
  symptomatic improvement was obvious within about a week. Soon
  they craved food, and color appeared in their faces. Tongue and
  digestive symptoms rapidly lessened. Within about 60 days the red
  blood cells counts had risen on the average from low levels to
  approximately normal. Dr. Murphy will describe to you in more
  detail the improvement that takes place. I wish especially to
  call to your attention the fact that an objective measure of the
  effects upon blood production was the chief basis of our
  conclusions that by feeding liver, significant improvement had
  been obtained. I refer especially to counts of new adult and
  young red blood cells (reticulocytes) appearing, as Peabody's
  studies demonstrated later, as a result of the maturation of the
  immature cells crowding the bone marrow.</p>

  <p>The next step naturally was to attempt to
  determine the nature of the constituent in liver responsible for
  the effects, and to learn if an extract for therapeutic use could
  be obtained. Dr. Edwin J. Cohn, of the Department of Physical
  Chemistry in the Laboratories of Physiology of the Harvard
  Medical School, soon made a potent extract suitable for oral use.
  We tested on patients the preparations he prepared in an attempt
  to isolate the active principle. Although unsuccessful in this
  objective, as time passed we demonstrated (1929) that the potent
  material could be given intravenously, and produced maximal
  effects in very small quantities (0.15 g). These small
  experimental preparations were not practical for regular use, and
  it remained for G&auml;nsslen in Germany to produce the first
  practical extract for parenteral therapy. Since then numerous
  individuals have prepared and studied such preparations. Extracts
  for parenteral use can be easily made by dissolving in water a
  powdered extract (Fraction G of Cohn) commonly used in America.
  The exact nature of the potent substance remains unknown, but
  especially from the studies of Cohn and West it appears to be a
  relatively small nitrogenous compound.</p>

  <p>Extract given parenterally is at least 50
  and perhaps 100 times as potent as extract given by mouth and it
  assures the individual of receiving into his body proper the
  material he lacks. It thus permits one to give large amounts
  easily: e.g., a few cubic centimeters of fluid a week, instead of
  about 1,500 to 3,000 grams of liver. The physician must know what
  a given amount of a given preparation may be expected to
  accomplish under usual circumstances. He must recognize that
  extraction causes loss of potency and that the potency of a good
  preparation is usually no more than 70 per cent of that of raw
  liver. Because one preparation is three times as concentrated as
  another, it by no means follows that the amount of potent
  material contained is three times as great. It may actually be
  less potent. Active material is not confined to liver. It has
  been found to occur in stomach tissue by Sturgis and Isaacs, and
  is found in kidney, brain, placenta, and probably other organs.
  Castle has shown that a reaction between an unidentified
  substance in normal gastric juice and material in certain foods
  rich in the vitamin B complex yields potent material. By
  utilization of the principle described by Castle, Reimann has
  shown that liver may have its potency increased by incubation
  with gastric juice. This has resulted in the practical use of
  combinations of gastric and liver tissue.</p>

  <p>Since the presentation of our original
  work, the regular beneficial results of liver therapy have been
  confirmed in many parts of the world; for example, in Sweden by
  Strandell and in Copenhagen by Meulengracht. There have been
  differences of opinion regarding the value of one or another
  preparation, but these differences can largely be explained if a
  proper comparison of dosage is made. There are cases requiring
  much more potent material than others and in some cases there is
  difficulty of absorption, making parenteral therapy essential. As
  in other deficiency disorders there are factors, such as
  infections, arteriosclerosis and serious damage to vital organs,
  which inhibit the action of "liver extract" and when they are
  present it is often necessary to give unusually large amounts of
  the active principle. The results of treatment will be
  essentially the same if, irrespective of its source for the given
  case, enough potent material enters the body throughout life.
  Indeed, pernicious anemia, like other deficient states, should be
  treated on a quantitative basis. Failure of liver therapy in a
  case diagnosed pernicious anemia implies inadequate treatment, an
  incorrect diagnosis, or the existence of complication
  sufficiently serious in itself to be disastrous for the
  patient.</p>

  <p>The treatment should not consist in
  supplying enough material to remove only one symptom, such as
  anemia, but enough both to supply indefinitely all demands of the
  body for the substance and to fill it with an adequate reserve
  supply. The disease affects the gastro-intestinal and neural
  systems as well as the hemopoietic tissue. Probably more material
  is required to improve or inhibit the progress or development of
  neural lesions than to permit blood element to be maintained.
  With proper dosage, symptoms due to neural lesions usually
  lessen, sometimes strikingly, as Dr. Murphy and I originally
  noted. Unfavourable reports concerning the effects on the neural
  system can be attributed to failure to realize that there is no
  standard dose of "liver extract", and that there is great
  variation in the potency of different preparations; also that
  sepsis and other complications can inhibit the action of liver on
  the nervous tissue, as it does on blood formation. For proof of
  the effect of liver on neural lesions one must not so much study
  the degree of improvement, as seek for evidence of the arrest of
  the process. In my clinic this has been done especially by Dr.
  Strauss. There have been observed critically over from two to
  three years about 100 cases, including 26 cases with advanced
  combined system-disease, treated parenterally with liver extract.
  In no instance did a single objective neurologic sign become more
  marked nor did an abnormal sign develop. Abnormal signs sometimes
  decreased in intensity or became normal. There was thus objective
  arrest of the neural lesions in every case and subjective
  improvement in all. Indeed, certain patients who were originally
  unable to walk became sufficiently improved to return to their
  occupations. Failure to arrest the progress of neural lesions,
  like failure to restore the blood to normal and keep it there,
  usually means that more liver is required. Sometimes such severe
  infection or the like is present, that arrest cannot be achieved.
  One should not interpret parenteral therapy as acting in any
  fundamentally different manner from oral therapy. Certain cases
  treated for over eight years orally have had no progress of their
  neural lesions. Many cases can be adequately treated orally, but
  parenteral therapy is simple and permits suitable amounts of
  active principle easily and assuredly to enter the patient's
  body.</p>

  <p>Liver therapy has been shown to be of value
  in other anemias than the idiopathic pernicious anemia originally
  described by Addison in 1849. There are other substances in liver
  and in certain liver extracts potent for pernicious anemia
  besides the principle active in pernicious anemia. Dr. Whipple
  has demonstrated a factor in liver aiding blood regeneration in
  "secondary a anemia. This factor can affect blood formation in
  certain clinical cases but as yet has received little critical
  study in man. Liver extract potent for pernicious anemia is of
  value in such other macrocytic anemias as arise in sprue
  (Bloomfield and Wycoff, Ashford and others), pregnancy (Wills,
  Strauss, and Castle), coeliac disease (Vaughan <i>et al.</i>) and
  the like. Partly because we recognized in pernicious anemia that,
  in addition to improvement of the blood, the alimentary tract and
  nervous systems were benefited, a still wider application has
  resulted. The possibility of controlling the gastro-intestinal
  symptoms in sprue by the use of parenteral therapy with liver
  extract has been demonstrated by Castle and Rhoads. For this
  purpose it is of great value. Likewise in pellagra the
  gastro-intestinal symptoms are responsive. The improvement of the
  skin lesions in this disease, which also occurs, suggests the
  possibilities of a broader application to other conditions. It
  was suggested, in 1913, by Vogel and McCurdy, that determinations
  of the numbers of the young red blood cells (reticulocytes) might
  measure within a brief time the effect of therapy. Although I had
  studied these cells from my student days in many patients, it was
  not until Dr. Murphy's and my observations were well under way,
  that the significance of the reticulocyte reaction as an index of
  the effect of potent material was fully appreciated. It then
  became an important aid in the evaluation of therapy and in the
  subsequent development of effective liver extracts. It was soon
  recognized that, following the administration of effective doses
  of liver, the reticulocytes in pernicious anemia are increased
  for a few days, during which time their numbers follow a
  distinctive course. This reticulocyte reaction is orderly and
  simulates the curve for growth and death of organisms and their
  cells. Critical daily observation of these reactions and their
  proper interpretation thus gives useful information concerning
  both the state of the patient and the potency of the material
  administered.</p>

  <p>A reaction that does not conform in
  character to that due to liver and in proper time relation to the
  administration of the substance under test, should always be
  looked upon with suspicion. The reticulocyte reaction induced by
  liver indicates a bone marrow reaction to a physiological need
  and not to a stimulant: a normal reaction to the existing anemia.
  A reticulocyte response does not necessarily mean that specific
  material which the body lacks has been supplied, for there are
  other substances and conditions that cause reticulocytosis in
  pernicious anemia, which do not regularly promote normal blood
  formation. For example, responses may be induced by potassium
  arsenite (Fowler's solution), but they usually differ very much
  from the physiological responses to liver. Non-specific
  responses, however, may closely resemble those due to supplying
  the deficient substance. One must be particularly critical of the
  nature of responses caused by substances given parenterally,
  because non-specific responses of various sorts can arise more
  readily from parenteral injection than from feeding.</p>

  <p>It is important that the potency of
  products used in life-saving procedures be assured. The
  reticulocyte reaction is serviceable in yielding information
  regarding the strength of liver extracts and potent substitutes
  employed clinically. The factors which physiologically influence
  the reticulocyte reaction, also influence the rate of total red
  cell regeneration; but, as noted in 1927, the amount of material
  necessary to induce maximal reticulocyte rises is often less than
  the amount necessary for the maximal rate of increase of red
  cells. In testing products one must aim to give an amount
  expected to yield less than a maximal reticulocyte response,
  since otherwise considerable losses in potency may occur and
  remain undetected. The percentage of reticulocytes at the peak of
  their rise for a given red cell level has been used in
  comparative data. It is, of course, difficult to determine
  whether one agent is more effective than another, unless tests
  have been made in the same way. Very different types of curves
  for reticulocytes will be obtained from daily administration and
  from one relatively large parenteral injection, so that
  reticulocyte peaks cannot be compared directly. In either
  instance, however, the total number of young red cells poured
  forth during the reaction will be similar.</p>

  <p>Because of the considerable variation in
  the reactivity of cases, more information can undoubtedly be
  obtained by comparative tests of known and unknown material in
  the same patient. This can be accomplished by observing the
  reticulocyte responses in successive ten-day periods of uniform
  <i>daily</i> administration of each substance. The dosage of the
  substance of known potency given first must be such that a
  submaximal reticulocyte response will result. If so much material
  has been given that a maximal reticulocyte response has occurred,
  an increase of potent material in the second period cannot induce
  a second reticulocyte rise. In a properly conducted test the
  occurrence of any orderly reticulocyte response to a second
  substance means that it is of greater potency than the first
  material given.</p>

  <p>There is need for an animal or laboratory
  procedure to test the potency of products and to aid in
  determining the nature of the substance or substances effective
  in pernicious anemia. Numerous studies of this sort have been
  made; for example, by Vaughan on pigeons. Jacobson's recent
  report concerning the use of reticulocyte reactions in guinea
  pigs is suggestive of fruitful results.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the early days, as has been noted, it
  was thought that pernicious anemia might be a dietary deficiency
  disease. The demonstration of the effectiveness of liver therapy
  indicated that this was very probably the case and thus provided
  the proper orientation towards a study of its cause. Castle in my
  clinic, from work entirely his own, has shown that it is a
  deficiency disease of a special sort, one which may be spoken of
  as a conditioned dietary deficiency disease. He and his
  associates have demonstrated that because of a specific defect of
  the gastric secretion the patient with pernicious anemia is
  unable to carry out an essential reaction with certain
  constituents of food. In the normal individual this reaction is
  necessary for the production of the supply of "liver extract" and
  thus for the prevention of the disease. The material is absorbed
  and stored in the liver and certain other tissues, so that when
  such animal tissues are fed to human beings, they receive the
  material needed in pernicious anemia without the necessity of the
  special reaction within their stomachs. In pernicious anemia it
  has been shown (Ivy and others) that "liver extract" is absent in
  the patient's liver. The factor in the normal gastric secretion
  responsible for the reaction has not been identified with any of
  its recognized constituents. Meulengracht has shown from what
  portion of the stomach the gastric factor is formed in pigs.
  Strauss and Castle have demonstrated that the food factor is
  associated with a number of natural sources of vitamin B,
  although, from the work of Wills, Lassen and others, it is
  probable that it is not a portion of the vitamin B complex.</p>

  <p>As a logical consequence of this work
  Castle and his associates have postulated the significance of
  defects of the dietary factor, the gastric factor, and of
  difficulty in the absorption or utilization of substances
  promoting blood formation in the production of other types of
  macrocytic anemia responding to liver extract. Thus, in certain
  instances of the tropical macrocytic anemia of sprue (Castle and
  Rhoads) and in the anemia of pregnancy studied by Wills in India,
  a dietary defect seems of primary importance. The macro-cytic
  anemia resulting from total ablation of the stomach or its
  destruction by' cancer, like Addisonian pernicious anemia, is
  especially associated with loss of the gastric factor. In the
  macrocytic anemia of certain cases of late sprue, of coehac
  disease and of rare instances of intestinal stenosis or multiple
  anastomoses, difficulty in absorption plays a major role. In the
  anemia of fish-tapeworm infestation these factors may also be
  involved. Theoretically there could occur a disorder of the
  internal metabolism of "liver extract", and an occasional case of
  macrocytic anemia might be explained on such an assumption. Today
  we realize also that the participation of these factors may be
  variable and temporary, as occurs in the pernicious anemia of
  pregnancy of the temperate zone (Strauss and Castle). During
  pregnancy the gastric factor may be absent, only to reappear
  after delivery. Macrocytic anemia in animals has been produced by
  Wills, and by Rhoads and Miller as a result of dietary defects,
  and Bence has shown that the liver of gastrectomized pigs becomes
  deficient in "liver extract".</p>

  <p>In man, however, dietary deficiency is
  seldom confined strictly to one factor, nor are the results of
  disturbances of gastric secretion, of defects of intestinal
  absorption or of utilization necessarily concerned in only one
  type of metabolic process. Clearly such disturbances are involved
  in the production of iron deficiency resulting in certain types
  of hypochromic anemia. We have noted that combined deficiency of
  iron and "liver extract" is not rare in the same individual.
  Other double and even multiple deficiencies occur. In one rare
  and striking case I have seen the tongue and skin lesions of
  pellagra subside upon the oral administration of yeast, the edema
  from protein deficiency vanish when beefsteak was fed and finally
  the macrocytic anemia disappear rapidly when liver extract was
  given orally.</p>

  <p><br>
  Castle and his associates have shown that the gastric factor may
  return toward normal in pernicious anemia after treatment with
  liver extract. It is probable that the gastric reaction proceeds
  somewhat according to the law of mass action, so that very little
  of the intrinsic factor of the stomach might produce with a large
  amount of the extrinsic factor of the food, and vice versa,
  material for absorption sufficient to meet to a significant
  degree the demands of the body. Such a state of affairs could
  explain the responses in pernicious anemia obtained by feeding
  large amounts of autolyzed yeast-extract, as shown, for example,
  by Ungley. Here it is probable that traces of the intrinsic
  factor were present; and Isaacs, Goldhamer, and Sturgis have
  shown that traces, rather than complete absence, of this factor
  are apt to occur in Addisonian pernicious anemia. In this
  disease, however, it is almost always the gastric factor that is
  grossly deficient rather than the dietary factor; but both
  substances may be involved. We have seen patients who formerly
  had satisfactory diets, develop pernicious anemia lasting many
  months or a few years after partaking of distinctly undesirable
  diets. In such instances the poor diet probably precipitated the
  onset of the disease. It is thus not difficult, in the light of
  modern knowledge, to understand the probable causation of the
  "spontaneous" remissions and relapses in pernicious anemia.
  Probably in the natural course of the disease the gastric factor
  slowly declines but fluctuates in quantity from time to time. The
  extrinsic factor will also vary, and certain foods and rest may
  stimulate an increase of the intrinsic factor. Infection and
  severe gastritis could be responsible for temporary decrease of
  the gastric factor. The occasional patient who, after a relapse,
  remains without liver therapy in a state of complete remission
  for years, probably represents an instance of a temporary marked
  decline in the gastric factor, unless grossly deficient diet is
  shown to have existed.</p>

  <p>Patients undergoing liver therapy for
  pernicious anemia sometimes, of their own accord, omit treatment
  and may remain in apparent good health for many months, but many
  more of such individuals soon find they are sick again. The
  former perhaps have accumulated a considerable reserve supply of
  "liver extract" in their bodies and have probably been enabled by
  treatment to manufacture some potent material from an ordinary
  diet. Sooner or later a very large number of these patients will
  relapse, if proper treatment is not resumed. The grave error in
  treatment is to prescribe too little liver extract or potent
  substitute. When there is doubt, more rather than less should be
  given. It is essential that the individual receive into his body
  indefinitely and with regularity enough potent material for his
  given case. The physician, however, must do more for his patient
  than prescribe a proper amount of liver, stomach, or the like; he
  should attend to all aspects of the case and not neglect
  attention to the individual's manifold problems of thought and
  action.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have attempted to outline Dr. Murphy's
  and my contribution to the work for which the Caroline Institute
  has honored us. I have pointed out to you, also, some of the
  studies that have been made as the result of demonstrating with
  Dr. Murphy that liver feeding is dramatically effective for
  pernicious anemia patients. It seems to me that one may expect in
  the future more information to be obtained which, directly or
  indirectly, will follow as the result of these observations.
  Thus, upon the foundations laid by previous investigators, do
  medical art and science build a structure which will in its turn
  be the foundation of future knowledge.</p>
