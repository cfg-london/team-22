  <h1>Kurt Alder - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="alder.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Kurt Alder</b> was born in
  K&ouml;nigsh&uuml;tte, Upper Silesia, on the 10th of July 1902.
  His childhood and school years were spent in these industrial
  surroundings, but after the end of the First World War he was
  forced to leave his home, due to political circumstances.<br>
  <br>
  He started reading chemistry at Berlin University in 1922, and
  later continued these studies at Kiel, where he obtained his
  degree of Ph.D. in 1926. The thesis for the doctorate, on which
  Alder worked under O. Diels, was entitled: <i>&Uuml;ber die
  Ursachen der Azoester-reaktion</i> (On the causes of the azoester
  reaction).<br>
  <br>
  In 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry by the Faculty
  of Philosophy at Kiel University; promotion to lecturer followed in
  1934. Alder left Kiel in 1936 to take up the appointment as head
  of department in the science laboratories of the I. G.
  Farben-Industrie, at their works in Leverkusen, where he worked
  on the preparation and constitution of synthetic rubber ("Buna").
  By this work some of his earlier interests were reawakened and
  stimulated.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 Alder was appointed to the Chair for Experimental
  Chemistry and Chemical Technology at Cologne University and also became Principal of the
  Institute of Chemistry. He received invitations from Berlin
  University in 1944 and from the University of
  Marburg in 1950, but declined both.<br>
  <br>
  As early as 1927-1928, whilst at Kiel, Alder had studied problems
  of systematic organic chemistry in collaboration with his teacher
  O. Diels, and this lead to their joint discovery of the principle
  of the diene-synthesis, which they investigated and determined in
  all its aspects. At the same time Alder also worked in
  collaboration with younger colleagues on extensive stereochemical
  investigations, prompted by selection phenomena during organic
  chemical reactions, particularly in unsaturated systems. A series
  of other problems, such as the behaviour of double bonds in
  stressed carbon rings and the phenomena of intermolecular
  rearrangements, were investigated.<br>
  <br>
  Although conditions in Cologne during the 1940's were not
  favourable for scientific research, Alder was nevertheless able
  to continue his original work systematically and even discover
  relationships which were decisive for future developments. These
  are characterized by the transition from pure additive processes,
  of which the diene-synthesis is the most important, to processes
  of substitution. The purpose of these investigations was the
  analysis and the elimination of the dualism existing between
  addition and substitution. These studies covered a wide field and
  include also the reaction of molecular oxygen on unsaturated
  substrates.<br>
  <br>
  Kurt Alder's investigations have been described in about 150
  papers, which were published mainly in <i>Justus Liebig's Annalen
  der Chemie</i>, in the <i>Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen
  Gesellschaft</i> and in <i>Angewandte Chemie</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In recognition of his work, Alder received the Emil Fischer
  Memorial Medal from the Association of German Chemists, in 1938.
  In the same year he became a member of the Kaiserlich
  Leopold.-Karol.-Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher (Imperial
  Leopold.-Karol.-German Academy of Natural Philosophers) in Halle.
  The Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne conferred the
  honorary degree of M.D. on Alder in 1950, and in 1954 he received
  the honorary doctorate of the University of Salamanca.</p>
