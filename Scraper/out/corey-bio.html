  <h1>Elias James Corey - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="corey.jpg" class="bio-img">My birth in July 1928 in Methuen,
  Massachusetts was followed just eighteen months later by the
  death of my father, Elias, a successful business man in that
  community 30 miles north of Boston. My mother, Fatina (n&eacute;e
  Hasham), changed my name from William to Elias shortly after my
  father's passing. I do not remember my father, but all his
  friends and associates made it clear that he was a remarkably
  gifted and much admired person. I have always been guided by a
  desire to be a worthy son to the father I cannot remember and to
  the loving, courageous mother who raised me, my brother, and two
  sisters through the trials of the Depression and World War II. My
  grandparents on both sides, who emigrated from Lebanon to the
  United States, also knew how to cope with adversity, as
  Christians in a tragically torn country, under the grip of the
  Ottoman empire.<br>
  <br>
  In 1931, our family grew to include my mother's sister, Naciby,
  and her husband, John Saba, who had no children of their own. We
  all lived together in a spacious house in Methuen, still a
  gathering place for family reunions. My uncle and aunt were like
  second parents to us. As a youngster I was rather independent,
  preferring such sports as football, baseball and hiking to work.
  However, when my aunt, who was much stricter than my mother,
  assigned a household chore, it had to be taken seriously. From
  her I learned to be efficient and to take pleasure in a job well
  done, no matter how mundane. We were a very close, happy and
  hardworking family with everything that we needed, despite the
  loss of my father and the hard economic times. Uncle John died in
  1957, and too soon afterwards, in 1960, my aunt passed away. My
  mother died in 1970 at the age of seventy. They all lived to see
  each of the four children attain a measure of success.<br>
  <br>
  From the ages of five to twelve I attended the Saint Laurence
  O'Toole elementary school in Lawrence, a city next to Methuen,
  and was taught by sisters of the Catholic order of Notre Dame de
  Namour. I enjoyed all my subjects there. I do not remember ever
  learning any science, except for mathematics. I graduated from
  Lawrence Public High School at the age of sixteen and entered the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, just a few weeks later, in
  July, 1945, with excellent preparation, since most of my high
  school teachers had been dedicated and able. Although my favorite
  subject was mathematics, I had no plan for a career, except the
  notion that electronic engineering might be attractive, since it
  utilized mathematics at an interesting technological frontier. My
  first courses at M.I.T. were in the basic sciences: mathematics,
  physics and chemistry, all of which were wonderful. I became a
  convert to chemistry before even taking an engineering course
  because of the excellence and enthusiasm of my teachers, the
  central position of chemistry in the sciences and the joy of
  solving problems in the laboratory. Organic chemistry was
  especially fascinating with its intrinsic beauty and its great
  relevance to human health. I had many superb teachers at M.I.T.,
  including Arthur C. Cope, John C. Sheehan, John D. Roberts and
  Charles Gardner Swain. I graduated from M.I.T. after three years
  and, at the suggestion of Professor Sheehan, continued there as a
  graduate member of his pioneering program on synthetic
  penicillins. My doctoral work was completed by the end of 1950
  and, at the age of twenty-two, I joined the University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an Instructor in Chemistry under
  the distinguished chemists Roger Adams and Carl S. Marvel. I am
  forever grateful to them for giving me such a splendid
  opportunity, as well as for their help and friendship over many
  years.<br>
  <br>
  Because my interests in chemistry ranged from the theoretical and
  quantitative side to the biological end of the spectrum, I
  decided to maintain a broad program of teaching and research and
  to approach chemistry as a discipline without internal
  boundaries. My research in the first three years, which had to be
  done with my own hands and a few undergraduate students, was in
  physical organic chemistry. It had to do with the application of
  molecular orbital theory to the understanding of the transition
  states for various reactions in three dimensional (i.e.
  stereochemical) detail. The stereoelectronic ideas which emerged
  from this work are still widely used in chemistry and mechanistic
  enzymology. By 1954, as an Assistant Professor with a group of
  three graduate students, I was able to initiate more complex
  experimental projects, dealing with the structure,
  stereochemistry and synthesis of natural products. As a result of
  the success of this research, I was appointed in 1956, at age
  twenty-seven, as Professor of Chemistry. My research group grew
  and the scope of our work broadened to include other topics:
  enantioselective synthesis, metal complexes, new reactions for
  synthesis and enzyme chemistry. The pace of discovery
  accelerated.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1957, I received a Guggenheim fellowship and my
  first sabbatical leave. It was divided between Harvard, to which
  I had been invited by the late Prof. Robert B. Woodward, and
  Europe. The last four months of 1957 would prove eventful. In
  September, shortly after the beginning of my stay at Harvard, my
  uncle John passed away. At least I had been lucky enough to have
  seen him just two days before. I was deeply affected by the loss
  of this fine and generous man whom I loved as a real father. In
  solitude and sadness I returned to my work and a very deep
  immersion in studies which proved to be pivotal to my future
  research. In early October several of the key ideas for a logical
  and general way of thinking about chemical synthesis came to me.
  The application of these insights led to rapid and unusual
  solutions to several specific synthetic problems of interest to
  me at the time. I showed one such plan (for the molecule
  longifolene) to R. B. Woodward and was pleased by his
  enthusiastic response. Later in 1957 I visited Switzerland,
  London and Lund, the last as a guest of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/index.html">Prof. Karl Sune
  Bergstr&ouml;m</a>. It was at Lund, in Bergstr&ouml;m's
  Department, that I became intrigued by the prostaglandins. Our
  research in the mid 1960's led to the first chemical syntheses of
  prostaglandins and to involvement in the burgeoning field of
  eicosanoids ever since.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1959 I received an offer of a Professorship at
  Harvard, which I accepted with alacrity since I wanted to be near
  my family and since the Chemistry Department at Harvard was
  unsurpassed. The Harvard faculty in 1959 included Paul D.
  Bartlett, <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/index.html">Konrad
  Bloch</a>, Louis F. Fieser, George B. Kistiakowski, E. G. Rochow,
  Frank H. Westheimer, E. B. Wilson and <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">R. B. Woodward</a>, all giants in the field
  of Chemistry. Roger Adams, who was always very kind and
  encouraging to me, gave his blessing even though years before he
  had declined a professorial appointment at Harvard. I have always
  regarded the offer of a Professorship at Harvard as the most
  gratifying of my professional honors.<br>
  <br>
  At Harvard my research group grew in size and quality, and
  developed a spirit and dynamism which has been a continuing
  delight to me. I was able to start many new scientific projects
  and to teach an advanced graduate course on chemical synthesis.
  Using the concepts of retrosynthetic analysis under guidance of
  broad strategies, first-year graduate students could be taught in
  just three months to design sophisticated chemical syntheses. My
  research interests soon evolved to include the following areas:
  synthesis of complex, bioactive molecules; the logic of chemical
  synthesis; new methods of synthesis; molecular catalysts and
  robots; theoretical organic chemistry and reaction mechanisms;
  organometallic chemistry; bioorganic and enzyme chemistry;
  prostaglandins and other eicosanoids and their relevance to
  medicine; application of computers to organic chemical problems,
  especially to retrosynthetic analysis. My personal scientific
  aspirations can be similarly summarized: to be creative over a
  broad range of the chemical sciences; to sustain that creativity
  over many years; to raise the power of research in chemistry to a
  qualitatively higher level; and to develop new generations of
  outstanding chemists.<br>

  In September, 1961, I married Claire Higham, a graduate of the
  University of Illinois. We have three children. David Reid is a
  graduate of Harvard (A.B. 1985) and the University of California,
  Berkeley (Ph.D., 1990), who is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in
  Chemistry/Molecular Biology at the University of California
  Medical School at San Francisco. Our second son, John, graduated
  from Harvard (A.B. 1987) and the Paris Conservatory of Music
  (1990) and is now carrying out advanced studies in classical
  music composition at the latter institution. Our daughter, Susan,
  graduated from Harvard with a major in anthropology (A.B. 1990)
  and plans graduate work in Education. Claire and I live near the
  Harvard Campus in Cambridge, as we have for nearly thirty years.
  My leisure interests include outdoor activities and music.<br>
  <br>
  I am very proud of the many graduate students and postdoctoral
  fellows from all over the world who have worked in my research
  group. Their discoveries in my laboratory and their subsequent
  achievements in science have been a source of enormous
  satisfaction. The Corey research family now includes about one
  hundred fifty university professors and an even larger number of
  research scientists in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry.
  It has been my good fortune to have been involved in the
  education of scholars and leaders in every area of chemical
  research, and especially, to have contributed to the scientific
  development of many different countries. My research family has
  been an extraordinarily important part of my life. Much of the
  credit for what I have achieved belongs to that professional
  family, my wonderful teachers and faculty colleagues, and not
  least, to my own dear personal family.</p>
