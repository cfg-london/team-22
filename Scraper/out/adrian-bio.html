  <h1>Edgar Adrian - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="adrian.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Edgar
  Douglas Adrian</b> was born on November 30, 1889, in London. He
  was the second son of Alfred Douglas Adrian, C.B., K.C., legal
  adviser to the British Local Government Board. Adrian went to
  school at Westminster School, London, and in 1908 he went to
  Trinity
  College, Cambridge, at which College he had won a Scholarship
  in Science. At Cambridge University he studied physiology and the
  other subjects of the Natural Sciences Tripos and in 1911 he took
  his B.A. degree with first classes in five separate
  subjects.<br>
  <br>
  In 1913 he was elected to a Fellowship of Trinity College on
  account of his investigation of the &laquo;all or none&raquo;
  principle in nerve. He then studied medicine, doing his clinical
  work at St.
  Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and taking his medical degree
  in 1915. After working for a time on clinical neurology, he
  returned to Cambridge in 1919, to lecture on the nervous system.
  He was made Fellow of the Royal Society in 1923. In 1925 he began
  investigating the sense organs by electrical methods.<br>
  <br>
  In 1929 he was elected Foulerton Professor of the Royal Society.
  In 1937 he succeeded Sir Joseph Barcroft as Professor of
  Physiology at the University of Cambridge, a post which he held
  until 1951.<br>
  <br>
  In 1951 Adrian was elected Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
  a post which he still, at the time of writing, holds.<br>
  <br>
  When Adrian graduated at Cambridge, the Department of Physiology
  there included several distinguished research workers. Among them
  were J. N. Langley (1852-1925), who had succeeded Sir Michael
  Foster (1836-1907), W. H. Gaskeh (1847-1914), Sir Hugh K.
  Anderson (1865-1928), Sir Walter Morley Fletcher (1873-1933), Sir
  Joseph Barcroft (1872-1947), Keith Lucas (1879-1916) and <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Archibald Vivian Hill</a> (b. 1886) who was
  then beginning his work on heat production in muscle. <a href=
  "../1929/index.html">Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins</a>
  (1861-1947) was then doing his pioneer work on the
  vitamins.<br>
  <br>
  Adrian's first research work was done with Keith Lucas, who was
  working on the impulses transmitted by motor nerves; he showed
  that, when a muscle fibre contracts, the passage of the nerve
  impulse that causes the contractions leaves the motor nerve in a
  state of diminished excitability. Keith Lucas was, at the time of
  the First World War, thinking of improving the study of the
  electrical currents in nerves by amplifying them by means of
  valves, a method which Adrian was later to employ.<br>
  <br>
  First, however, Adrian went to London to take his medical degree
  and was, until the end of the First World War occupied with work
  on military patients suffering from nerve injuries or nervous
  disorders. Returning to Cambridge in 1919 to take over Keith
  Lucas's laboratory, he began the work with which his name will
  always be associated. In order to obtain a more sensitive
  detection of nerve impulses, he used the cathode ray tube, the
  capillary electrometer and amplification of the electrical
  impulses by means of thermionic valves, and was thus able to
  amplify them 5,000 times. He succeeded in setting up a
  preparation consisting of a single end organ in a muscle of the
  frog, together with the single nerve fibre related to it and he
  found that, when the end organ is stimulated, the nerve fibre
  showed regular impulses with a variable frequency.<br>
  <br>
  With this apparatus he was able to record the electrical
  discharges in single nerve fibres which were produced by tension
  on the muscle, pressure on it, touch, the movement of a hair and
  pricking with a needle. By 1928 he was able to publish his
  conclusion that a stimulus of constant intensity applied to the
  skin, immediately excites the end organ, but that this excitation
  progressively decreases for as long as the stimulation continues.
  At the same time sensory impulses of constant intensity pass
  along the nerve from the end organ. These sensory impulses are at
  first very frequent, but their frequency gradually decreases and
  as they decrease the sensation in the brain progressively
  diminishes. As A. V. Hill (The Ethical Dilemma of Science, 1960)
  has said, Adrian, by thus showing that the afferent effect in a
  given neurone depends on the pattern in time of the impulses
  travelling in it, has provided a new quantitative basis of
  nervous behaviour.<br>
  <br>
  Later Adrian extended his investigations to a study of the
  electrical impulses caused by stimuli likely to cause pain, he
  concluded that, as Sir Henry Head had postulated as a result of
  his clinical studies, the nerve fibres which conduct impulses
  excited by pain probably do not pass further into the brain than
  the optic thalamus, but that all other sensory impulses can be
  distinguished in the sensory area of the cortex of the brain and
  he showed that the part of the cerebral cortex devoted to any
  particular kind of end organ is related to the special needs of
  the animal concerned. Thus in man and the monkey the sensory area
  of the cerebral cortex devoted to the face and hand is relatively
  large, and relatively little is given to the trunk of the body.
  In the pony the area devoted to the nostrils is as large as that
  devoted to the rest of the body; in the pig almost the whole of
  the sensory area of the cerebral cortex devoted to the sense of
  touch is given to fibres from the snout, which the pig uses to
  explore its environment.<br>
  <br>
  Subsequently, Adrian studied the sense of smell and the
  electrical activity of the brain and the variations and
  abnormalities of waves shown in the encephalogram, which Hans
  Berger, of Jena, had described in 1929. This work opened up new
  fields of investigation in the study of epilepsy and other
  lesions of the brain.<br>
  <br>
  For his work about the functions of neurones Adrian was awarded,
  jointly with Sir Charles Sherrington, the Nobel Prize for
  1932.<br>
  <br>
  The results of Adrian's brilliant researches on the
  electrophysiology of the brain and nervous system were published
  in numerous scientific papers and in his three books, <i>The
  Basis of Sensation</i> (1927), <i>The Mechanism of Nervous
  Action</i> (1932) and <i>The Physical Basis of Perception</i>
  (1947). With others he wrote <i>Factors Determining Human
  Behaviour</i> (1937).<br>
  <br>
  Adrian had numerous honours bestowed upon him. During 1950-1955
  he was President of the Royal Society, and during 1960-1962 of
  the Royal
  Society of Medicine. In 1954, he was President of the British
  Association for the Advancement of Science. He is Chevalier of
  the French Legion of Honour and a trustee of the Rockefeller
  Institute. He holds honorary degrees, memberships, and
  fellowships of numerous universities and other learned bodies. He
  was knighted Baron of Cambridge in 1955.<br>
  <br>
  A man of tireless energy and continuous industry, Adrian has,
  throughout his busy life, and as a Member of the Medical Research
  Council and many other scientific advisory bodies, exerted great
  influence, not only on his pupils and collaborators, but also on
  the development of physiological research and the sciences in
  general.<br>
  <br>
  To the citizens of Cambridge he has long been familiar as a lean,
  small figure, dominated by the forward thrust of the nose and
  chin and the set expression of purpose, as he threads his way at
  high speed on a bicycle through the crowded streets of the city.
  An expert fencer, he is also an enthusiastic mountaineer, a
  recreation which he shares with Lady Adrian, who is a Justice of
  the Peace and does much social work in the City. Among Lord
  Adrian's other recreations are sailing and his great interest in
  the arts. A superb after-dinner speaker, all his lectures and
  speeches have been the result of very careful preparation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1923 Adrian married Hester Agnes Pinsent, daughter of the late
  Hume Pinsent of Birmingham, England, and a relative of the
  philosoper David Hume. They have one son and two daughters.</p>
