            <p><b>Biographical Note</b><br>
              Nelly Sachs (1891-1970), daughter of a wealthy manufacturer, grew 
              up in a fashionable area of Berlin. She studied music and dancing 
              and at an early age began writing poetry. After her escape to Sweden 
              in 1940, Miss Sachs took up the study of Swedish and devoted much 
              of her time to the translation of such Swedish poets as Gunnar Ekel&ouml;f, 
              Johannes Edfelt, and Karl Vennberg.<br>

  Nelly Sachs's career as a poet of note started only after her
  emigration, when she was nearly fifty years old. Her first volume
  of poetry, <i>In den Wohnungen des Todes</i> (In the Houses of
  Death), 1947, creates a cosmic frame for the suffering of her
  time, particularly that of the Jews. Although her poems are
  written in a keenly modern style, with an abundance of lucid
  metaphors, they also intone the prophetic language of the Old
  Testament. The collections <i>Sternverdunkelung</i> (Eclipse of
  Stars), 1949, <i>Und niemand weiss weiter</i> (And No One Knows
  Where to Go), 1957, and <i>Flucht und Verwandlung</i> (Flight and
  Metamorphosis), 1959, repeat, develop, and reinforce the cycle of
  suffering, persecution, exile, and death which characterizes the
  life of the Jewish people, and becomes transformed, in Nelly
  Sachs's powerful metaphorical language, into the terms of man's
  bitter, but not hopeless, destiny. Of her poetic dramas, the
  miracle play <i>Eli</i> (1950), broadcast in West Germany as a
  radio play, has been widely acclaimed. Nelly Sachs has received
  awards in Sweden and Germany, among them the Prize of the Swedish
  Poets Association (1958) and the "Friedenspreis des deutschen
  Buchhandels" (1965). In 1961 her collected poems were published
  under the title of <i>Fahrt ins Staublose</i> (Journey to the
  Beyond); her verse dramas in <i>Zeichen im Sand</i> (Signs in the
  Sand). <i>O the Chimneys</i>, English translations of some of her
  poetry and of her play <i>Eli</i>, appeared in 1967.</p>
