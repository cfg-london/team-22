  <h1>Hans Spemann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="spemann.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Hans
  Spemann</b> was born on June 27, 1869, at Stuttgart. He was the
  eldest son of the publisher, Wilhelm Spemann. From 1878 until
  1888 he went to the Eberhard-Ludwig School at Stuttgart and when
  he left school in 1888 he spent a year in his father's publishing
  business.<br>
  <br>
  From 1889-1890 he did his military service and then, after a
  period as a retail bookseller, he entered, in 1891, the University of Heidelberg. There, until he took his
  preliminary examination in 1893, he studied medicine, and was
  especially attracted by the work of the comparative anatomist
  there, Carl Gegenbaur.<br>
  <br>
  During the winter of 1893-1894 he studied at the University of Munich, where he became more closely
  acquainted with August Pauly - a fact of great importance to him.
  From the spring of 1894 to the end of 1908, he worked in the
  Zoological Institute at the University of W&uuml;rzburg. In 1895 he took his
  degree in zoology, botany, and physics (subjects to serve his
  anatomical studies), having worked under Theodor Boveri, Julius
  Sachs, and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/index.html">Wilhelm
  R&ouml;ntgen</a>, all of whom had the greatest influence on his
  scientific development.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 he qualified as a lecturer in zoology at the University
  of W&uuml;rzburg, and in 1908 he was asked to become Professor of
  Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Rostock, and in
  1914 he became Associate Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
  of Biology at Berlin-Dahlem. In 1919 he was appointed Professor
  of Zoology at the University of Freiburg-im-Breisgau, in succession to
  Hans Doflein, a post which he held until he retired and became
  Emeritus Professor in 1935.<br>
  <br>
  Spemann's name will always be associated with his work on
  experimental embryology. He made himself a master of
  micro-surgical technique and, working on the relatively large
  eggs of amphibians he discovered in 1924, together with Hilde
  Mangold, the existence of an area in the embryo, the portions of
  which, upon transplantation into an indifferent part of a second
  embryo there organized (induced) secondary embryonic primordia.
  The name &laquo;organizer centre&raquo; or &laquo;organizer&raquo;
  was therefore given by him to those parts. For this discovery of
  the organizer effect in embryonic development, he was awarded the
  Nobel Prize in 1935.<br>
  <br>
  Later Spemann showed that different parts of the organization
  centre produce different parts of the embryo. The anterior parts
  of it tend to produce parts of the head, and the posterior parts
  of it parts of the tail. Further, tail organizers, when they are
  grafted into the head region of another embryo, may produce heads
  instead of tails, the reason being that they are influenced by
  the head organizer in their new environment.<br>
  <br>
  Earlier Spemann had transplanted the optic cups of new embryos
  into the outermost layer of the region of the abdomen and had
  found that they induced the production, in this new situation, of
  a lens of the eye. This was interpreted as being evidence of the
  existence of secondary organizers which operate after the
  induction exerted by the primary organizer has been
  completed.<br>
  <br>
  By these and other experiments of a similar kind Spemann laid the
  foundations of the theory of embryonic induction by organizers,
  which led later to biochemical studies of this process and the
  ultimate development of the modern science of experimental
  morphogenesis. He described his researches in his book
  <i>Embryonic Development and Induction</i> (1938).<br>

  Spemann died at Freiburg on September 9, 1941.</p>
