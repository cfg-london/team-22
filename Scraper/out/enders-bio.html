  <h1>John F. Enders - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="enders.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John
  Franklin Enders</b> was born on February 10th, 1897, at West
  Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A. He is the son of John Ostrom
  Enders, a banker in Hartford, and Harriet Goulden Enders
  (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitmore).<br>
  <br>
  Enders was educated at the Noah Webster School at Hartford and
  St. Paul's
  School in Concord, New Hampshire. Finishing school in 1915,
  he went to Yale
  University, but in 1917 left his studies there to become, in
  1918, a pilot in the U.S. Air Force with the rank of Ensign.
  After the First World War he returned to Yale and was given, in
  1919, the degree of B.A. (<i>honoris causa</i>) and the normal
  degree in 1920.<br>
  <br>
  He then went into business in real estate in Hartford, but,
  becoming dissatisfied with this, he entered Harvard University.
  For four years he studied English literature and Germanic and
  Celtic languages with the idea of becoming a teacher of English,
  but he was not satisfied with this career either. He had been for
  a long time interested in biology and this interest was
  reawakened by his friendships with medical students at Harvard,
  with the result that he decided to enter as a candidate for the
  Ph.D. degree in bacteriology and immunology. In coming to this
  decision he was influenced by the late Professor Hans Zinsser,
  who was then Head of the Department of Bacteriology and
  Immunology at Harvard and by Dr. H. K. Ward, who later became
  Professor of Bacteriology at the University of
  Sidney, Australia.<br>
  <br>
  In 1930, Enders received the degree of Ph.D. at Harvard for a
  thesis which presented evidence that bacterial anaphylaxis and
  hypersensitivity of the tuberculin type are distinct
  phenomena.<br>
  <br>
  From 1930 until 1946, Enders remained at Harvard as a member of
  the teaching staff. During this period he studied, first, the
  elucidation of certain factors related to bacterial virulence and
  the resistance of the host organism. He then clarified, in
  collaboration with Ward, Shaffer, Wu, and others the inhibitory
  effect of the type specific capsular polysaccharides of
  <i>Pneumococcus</i> upon the phagocytic process. This work
  discovered a new form of Type I polysaccharide and produced
  evidence that complement played a catalytic-like part in the
  opsonization of bacteria by specific antibody.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938, Enders began the study of some of the mammalian viruses,
  and undertook, in 1941, in collaboration with Cohen, Kane,
  Levens, Stokes and others, a study of the virus of mumps. This
  work provided serological tests for the diagnosis of this disease
  and a skin test for susceptibility to it, and demonstrated the
  immunizing effect of inactivated mumps virus and the possibility
  of attenuating the virulence of this virus by passing it through
  chick embryos. It was shown that mumps often occurs in a form
  that is not apparent, but nevertheless confers a resistance which
  is as effective as that conferred by the visible disease.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946, Enders was asked to establish a laboratory for research
  in infectious diseases at the Children's Medical Center at
  Boston. In this laboratory much outstanding work on the viral
  diseases of man has been done under his direction and it was here
  that the work was done on the cultivation of the poliomyelitis
  viruses for which Enders was awarded, together with <a href=
  "index.html">T. H. Weller</a> and <a href="index.html">F. C.
  Robbins</a>, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in
  1954.<br>
  <br>
  Since this time Enders has returned, in collaboration with
  Peebles, to his earlier work on measles. He is now Higgins
  University Professor at Harvard University and Chief of the
  Research Division of Infectious Diseases of the Children's
  Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.<br>
  <br>
  Enders is a member of a great number of American learned
  societies, the Society for General Microbiology and the
  Royal Society for the Promotion of Health in Great Britain, the
  Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher (Leopoldina),
  and is Foreign Corresponding Member of the British Medical
  Association and the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de M&eacute;dicine de
  Belgique.<br>
  <br>
  He married Sarah Frances Bennett, of Brookline, Massachusetts, in
  1927. She died in 1943, and in 1951 Enders married Carolyn B.
  Keane of Newton Center, Massachusetts. He has one son John Ostrom
  Enders II, one daughter, Sarah Enders, and a stepson, William
  Edmund Keane.</p>
