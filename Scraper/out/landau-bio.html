  <h1>Lev Landau - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="landau.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Lev Davidovic Landau</b> was born in
  Baku on January 22, 1908, as the son of an engineer and a
  physician.<br>
  <br>
  After graduating from the Physical Department of Leningrad
  University at the age of 19, he began his scientific career at
  the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute. The years 1929 - 1931
  he spent abroad, partly as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow,
  working in Germany, Switzerland, England and, especially, in
  Copenhagen under <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels
  Bohr</a>.<br>
  <br>
  During 1932 - 1937 he was head of the Theoretical Department of
  the Ukrainian Physico-Technical Institute at Kharkov, and since
  1937 he has been the head of the Theoretical Department of the
  Institute for Physical Problems of the Academy of Sciences of the
  U.S.S.R. in Moscow. Simultaneously he taught constantly as a
  professor of theoretical physics in the Kharkov and Moscow State
  Universities.<br>
  <br>
  Landau's work covers all branches of theoretical physics, ranging
  from fluid mechanics to quantum field theory. A large portion of
  his papers refers to the theory of the condensed state. They
  started in 1936 with a formulation of a general thermodynamical
  theory of the phase transitions of the second order. After P.L.
  Kapitsa's discovery, in 1938, of the superfluidity of liquid
  helium, Landau began extensive research which led him to the
  construction of the complete theory of the "quantum liquids" at
  very low temperatures. His papers of 1941 - 1947 are devoted to
  the theory of the quantum liquids of the "Bose type", to which
  the superfluid liquid helium (the usual isotope <sup>4</sup>He)
  refers. During 1956-1958 he formulated the theory of the quantum
  liquids of the "Fermi type", to which liquid helium of isotope
  <sup>3</sup>He refers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946 he was elected to the membership of the Academy of
  Sciences of the U.S.S.R. The U.S.S.R. State Prize was awarded to
  him several times, and in 1962 he received, jointly with E.M.
  Lifshitz, the Lenin Science Prize for their <i>Course of
  Theoretical Physics</i>.<br>

  Landau is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (London), of the
  Danish Royal Academy of Sciences, of the Netherlands Royal
  Academy of Sciences, Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
  Sciences of the U.S.A., Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences, of the Physical Society (London), and of the
  Physical Society of France. In 1961, he received the Max Planck
  Medal and the Fritz London Prize.</p>
