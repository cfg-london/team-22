 <h2>On the Pathetic and Lyrical State of Mind</h2>

 <p>I am often asked, particularly by
 foreigners, how one can explain the great love of poetry in my
 country: why there exists among us not only an interest in poems
 but even a need for poetry. Perhaps that means my countrymen also
 possess a greater ability to understand poetry than any other
 people.<br>
 <br>
 To my way of thinking, this is a result of the history of the
 Czech people over the past 400 years - and particularly of our
 national rebirth in the early 19th Century. The loss of our
 political independence during the Thirty Years' War deprived us
 of our spiritual and political elite. Its members - those who
 were not executed - were silenced or forced to leave the country.
 That resulted not only in an interruption of our cultural
 development, but also ih a deterioration of our language. Not
 only was Catholicism reinstituted by force, but Germanization was
 imposed by force as well.<br>
 <br>
 By the early 19th Century, however, the French Revolution and the
 Romantic period were exposing us to new impulses and producing in
 us a new interest in democratic ideals, our own language, and our
 national culture. Our language became our most important means of
 expressing our national identity.<br>
 <br>
 Poetry was one of the first of our literary genres to be brought
 to life. It became a vital factor in our cultural and political
 awakening. And already at that early stage, attempts to create a
 Czech tradition of belles-lettres were received with vast
 gratitude by the people. The Czech people, who had lost their
 political representation and had been deprived of their political
 spokesmen, now sought a substitute for that representation, and
 they chose it from among the spiritual forces that still
 remained.<br>
 <br>
 From that comes the relatively great importance of poetry in our
 cultural life. There lies the explanation of our cult of poetry
 and of the high prestige it was already being accorded during the
 last century. But it was not only then that poetry played an
 important role. It burst into sumptuous blossom in the beginning
 of this century as well and between the two world wars -
 subsequently becoming our most important mode of expressing our
 national culture during World War II, a time of suffering for the
 people and of threat to the very existence of the nation. Despite
 all external restrictions and censorship, poetry succeeded in
 creating values that gave people hope and strength. Since the
 war, too - for the past 40 years - poetry has occupied a very
 important position in our cultural life. It is as though poetry,
 lyrics were predestined not only to speak to people very closely,
 extremely intimately, but also to be our deepest and safest
 refuge, where we seek succor in adversities we sometimes dare not
 even name.<br>
 <br>
 There are countries where this function of refuge is filled
 primarily by religion and its clergy. There are countries where
 the people see their image and their fate depicted in the
 catharsis of drama or hear them in the words of their political
 leaders. There are countries and nations that find their
 questions and the answers to them expressed by wise and
 perceptive thinkers. Sometimes, journalists and mass media
 perform that role. With us, it is as though our national spirit,
 in attempting to find embodiment, chose poets and made them its
 spokesmen. Poets, lyrists shaped our national consciousness and
 gave expression to our national aspirations in bygone times - and
 they are continuing to shape that consciousness to this very day.
 Our people have become accustomed to understanding things as
 presented to them by their poets.<br>
 <br>
 Seen with the poet's eyes, this is something wonderful. But ...
 is there not a dark side to this phenomenon as well? Does not a
 surfeit of poetry mean a perturbation in the equilibrium of
 culture? I admit that periods can exist in the histories of
 peoples, or circumstances can arise, in which the poetic
 rendering is the most suitable, the most simple, or perhaps even
 the only possible - with its ability to merely suggest, to use
 allusion, metaphor, to express what is central in a veiled
 manner, to conceal from unauthorized eyes. I admit that the
 language of poetry has often been, even with us - particularly in
 times of political restriction - a deputy language, a substitute
 language, a language of necessity, in as much as it has been the
 best means of expressing what could not be said in any other way.
 But even so, the dominant position of poetry in our country has
 long been on my mind - all the more so because I myself was born
 to be a poet and have remained a poet all my life.<br>
 <br>
 I am worried by the suspicion that this inclination toward, and
 love of, poetry, lyrics may not be an expression of anything
 other than what might be described as a state of mind. However
 deeply lyricism might be able to penetrate in reality, however
 rich and multifaceted its ability to see things, and however
 prodigiously it can reveal and at the same time create inner
 dimensions of human nature, it remains nevertheless a concern of
 the senses and the emotions; senses and emotions nourish its
 imagination - and vice versa: it speaks to senses and
 emotions.<br>
 <br>
 Doesn't a dominant position for lyricism, with its emphasis on
 sense and emotion, mean that the sphere of reason, with its
 emphasis on analysis, its skepticism and criticism, is pushed
 into the background? Doesn't it mean, moreover, that the will,
 with its dynamism and pathos, cannot achieve its full
 expression?<br>
 <br>
 Isn't a culture of such one-sided orientation in danger of being
 unable to fulfil its responsibility completely? Can a society
 that mainly, or primarily, inclines toward lyricism always have
 strength enough to defend itself and ensure its continued
 existence?<br>
 <br>
 I am not really very worried about the danger of possibly
 neglecting that element of culture that is based on our rational
 powers, that arises from reflection and finds expression in the
 most objective possible depiction of the essences and
 interrelations of things. That rational element - which is
 characterized by its distance to things, by mental balance, for
 it is programmatically not dependent on either the moods and
 feelings of the lyrical state of mind or on the passions of the
 state of pathos - that rational element does not allow itself to
 be lulled into tranquillity; but neither does it hurl itself
 impatiently at any moral target: in our rationalistically
 utilitarian, practical civilization, it is sufficiently strongly
 rooted in our need to know, to acquire knowledge and use it. This
 rational element has evolved continuously and spontaneously ever
 since the Renaissance. Admittedly, it is also unsympathetically
 received sometimes and now and then encounters external
 obstacles, but its position in our modern culture is nevertheless
 dominant even so - despite the fact that it faces great problems,
 for it must seek a new way of reincorporating its conceptual
 thinking into our culture and of giving reason a new form, since
 it cannot remain the reason of pre-technological times. I am
 aware that this element is just as important as both the others I
 have already mentioned. Despite that, however, I do not wish to
 devote to it here the same degree of attention, since its way of
 thinking - conceptual thinking - is not essential to art or
 literature. I wish to confine myself to the two extreme states of
 mind from which an author can commence creating. They have their
 counterparts in the readers' and spectators' attitudes and,
 through them, affect in their turn the character of our entire
 national culture.<br>
 <br>
 What worries me is a possible or real lack of pathos. These days,
 we do not encounter that word very often. And if we use it now
 and then, we do so almost with a certain timidity. It strikes us
 as old and moth-eaten, like old sets from a theater of the
 Romantic era - out of date, as though it only stood for poor,
 superficial, and emotionless declamation. It is almost as though
 we had forgotten it describes a dramatic state of tension, a
 purposeful, energetic, and resolute will, a yearning - not for
 any material possessions or even consumer goods, of course, but
 rather for justice, for truth. Pathos is a characteristic of
 heroism, and heroism is willing to endure torment and suffering,
 prepared to sacrifice itself if necessary. If I use the word
 heroism, I am not, of course, referring to the old heroism of the
 history books and school readers, heroism in war, but rather to
 its contemporary form: a heroism that does not brandish weapons,
 a heroism without ostentatiousness, discreet, often utterly
 silent, civil, indeed civilized, a heroism that has become
 civic.<br>
 <br>
 I believe that a culture is complete, mature, and capable of
 enduring and developing only if pathos has a place in it, if we
 understand pathos and can appreciate it - and especially if we
 are capable of it.<br>
 <br>
 What leads me to these thoughts? Pathos with its heroism is,
 above all, unthinkable and would not be what it is if it were not
 accompanied by a profound understanding of the essences of
 things, a critical and all-round understanding, an understanding
 quite other than that which even the most sensitive poetry is
 capable of; poetry - lyrics - is necessarily uncritical, for it
 lacks distance, speaking as it does actually only about its own
 subject - a subject, moreover, that flows with its time, a
 subject that forms a unity with its object. Pathos would not be
 pathos if it did not derive from an insight into the character of
 the conflict between that which is and that which ought to be.
 For society to be capable of pathos and for its culture to be
 complete, it must also understand its time in another manner
 besides the lyrical. And if it is not capable of pathos, then it
 is not prepared either for struggle or for sacrifice.<br>
 <br>
 Only literature - which, in addition to its conceptual-thinking
 culture, its culture of reason, not only has its lyrics but also
 its pathos, its drama, its living tragedy - can provide
 sufficient spiritual and moral strength to overcome the problems
 that society is constantly having to confront. Only in the art of
 tragedy does society create and find patterns for its attitudes
 in essential moral and political issues; it learns there how to
 deal with them consistently, without halting halfway. Only the
 art of tragedy, with its violent conflicts between interests and
 values, awakens, develops, and cultivates within us the social
 aspect of our essence; it makes us members of the community and
 gives us the opportunity to leave our solitude. Only the art of
 tragedy - which, unlike Iyrics, that "art of solitude," refines
 our ability to discriminate between that which is essential and
 that which is inessential from a societal viewpoint - only the
 art of tragedy teaches us to see victories in defeats and defeats
 in victories.<br>
 <br>
 Therefore, as I look around me and warm myself in the good will
 of poetry lovers, I would like to bear witness, not to the death
 of tragedy, but to its rebirth as a result of its pathetic state
 of mind, its state of powerful emotions, since something has been
 set into motion within us, and we are beginning to want that
 which we regard as just and to oppose that which exists though it
 should not.<br>
 <br>
 While the lyrical state of the mind is a state in an independent
 individual, which testifies to its own innermost self, which
 agrees and coincides with the object, the pathetic state does not
 sense this unity between subject and object. It is born of a
 tension between reality and the ego, my conception of how this
 reality ought to be - and thus of a tension between power and
 reason, between politics and morals. The lyrical state does not
 discriminate between that which is and that which ought to be. It
 is indifferent to the lyrical subject, whether its imagination is
 fired by reality or by fiction, by truth or by figments of the
 imagination; the illusion is as real to the imagination as
 reality can be illusory to the imagination. The lyrical state is
 not interested in these differences; it neither confronts them
 with each other nor regards itself as confronted by them. The
 pathetic ego not only sees these differences, but also perceives
 itself as confronted by them; it sees how two alternatives, two
 possibilities, stand arrayed against each other, and it sees
 itself as drawn into the tension between them. This very tension
 sets the ego into motion. That motion is initiated by worry,
 discontentment, vexation; its goal is to achieve or to introduce
 a state that appears rational, natural, pleasant - and that bears
 the form of right, justice, freedom, and human dignity.<br>
 <br>
 The moral greatness and meaningfulness of this motion of pathos
 in no way alters the fact that its goal is constantly and
 continuously becoming more distant and that no chord in the
 harmony so heatedly sought after by pathos is final. The motion
 of pathos is a counterpart to our esthetic emotion's intentions
 when we experience a work of art. This emotion, too, constantly
 strives, in vain, to achieve a broad and exhaustive understanding
 of the values of the work in all their richness and to enjoy the
 thought structure and form of the work; it attempts to achieve a
 state in which one's satisfaction with the work of art and one's
 joy in experiencing it are simultaneously maximal and
 lasting.<br>
 <br>
 Pathos is always one step ahead; it does not stand on today's
 ground; it feeds on other nourishment than the nectar of the
 present moment; that, it can forego. It can control itself, be
 disciplined, ascetic in the proper sense of the word - by no
 means because it must, but rather on the basis of its own free
 decision; it knows why it does so. Nothing in this is difficult
 for it. It is quite simply incapable of being indifferent and
 cold. And thank goodness for that. For otherwise society would
 become deadlocked, find itself in a cul-de-sac; truth would
 become handmaiden to power, right the tool of brute strength -
 or, rather, it would become rightlessness and injustice. Truth
 has not prevailed, does not prevail, and will not prevail without
 pathos. Sometimes, it does not prevail even at that price. But in
 that case, pathos does transform even a failure - that which
 would otherwise look like a natural calamity, a fateful event,
 the end - into something more. Of a defeat it makes a sacrifice;
 it elevates the failure and makes it an event that is a component
 of a larger entity, an event that had and that retains its
 meaning and fulfil its task as a partial movement toward the
 goal that was to be achieved and that, perhaps, one day will be
 achieved. So long as we retain our pathos, we retain our hope.
 Pathos cannot be finally conquered; it survives its setbacks.
 Both the pathos of the individual and the pathos of the nations
 survive setbacks, with seriousness, pride, and dignity. It is
 above failure. Thus, it is simultaneously elevated and elevating.
 Above, elevated, and elevating even where, without pathos, there
 would be scope only for discouragement and grief.<br>
 <br>
 But now that I have said that, which has been on my mind for a
 long time, and been freed of my concerns, I feel not only
 compelled but also entitled to return to the matter of lyricism
 and the lyrical state of mind.<br>
 <br>
 I have several reasons for doing so. I was born to be a lyrist,
 and I have always remained one. All my life, I have enjoyed my
 lyrical frame of mind, and it would be ungracious of me not to
 admit it. I have a need to justify and defend to myself this
 basic attitude of mine, despite the fact that I know my poems
 have often sounded tones that have borne their own pathos. After
 all, even tenderness can have pathos; my grief has had it; my
 anxiety and fear likewise.<br>
 <br>
 But I want to do something more. I want to deal with the lyrical
 state of mind. I want to defend this attitude toward life,
 emphasize its advantages, too, now that I have professed my
 respect for pathos. To do so seems to me not only just, but also
 downright necessary. And here I am referring not merely to the
 altogether excessive emphasis that, ever since the Enlightenment,
 our traditional culture has accorded rational conceptual
 thinking, which (together with the development of our will) has
 brought us to the unsatisfactory societal state of today, where
 we feel it necessary to have change and necessary to seek new
 ways of understanding our problems - primarily in light of the
 vast exertion of will and tendency toward an exacerbation of
 disputes into dramatic conflicts that we are witnessing. This
 seems to me necessary in view of the increasing behavioral
 aggressiveness present in interrelationships within society -
 whether it is aggressiveness still borne by some manner of pathos
 or the kind that is merely destructive in itself and incapable of
 any pathos at all. I want to elucidate the special advantages of
 Iyricism under these very circumstances in our time.<br>
 <br>
 For while the mind in a state of pathos burns with impatience and
 seethes with fervor in its endeavor to master an unsatisfactory
 situation and often succeeds in so doing with a well-intentioned
 but nevertheless one-sided straightforwardness, the lyrical state
 is a state without exertion of will or determination; it is a
 state of serenity that is neither patient nor impatient, a state
 of quiet experiencing of those values upon which man bases the
 most profound, the most fundamental, and the most essential
 foundations of his equilibrium and of his ability to inhabit this
 world, to inhabit it in the only possible manner, i.e.,
 poetically, lyrically, to borrow from H&ouml;lderlin.<br>
 <br>
 Pathos incites us and corrodes us; it is capable - in our anxiety
 and in our longing to realize ideals - of driving us to sacrifice
 and to self-destruction. Lyricism keeps us in its affectionate
 embrace. Instead of perceiving a conflict between forces, we feel
 a pleasurable joy in their equilibrium, which pushes them away
 from our horizon and results in our not feeling their weight.
 Instead of bumping into the edges of the world around us, we flow
 along with it to unity and identification.<br>
 <br>
 Pathos always has its opponents: it is aggressive. In his lyrical
 state, man needs no one else. And if, in his loneliness, he does
 turn to someone and speaks to him, that other person is not his
 enemy. Under these circumstances, it is as though one's
 counterpart - whether nature, society, or another human being -
 were a part of himself, merely another participant in the lyrical
 monologue. That which otherwise would oppose us we let suffuse
 us, while at the same time we ourselves suffuse it, too. We
 listen intently to that which is around us, and in that very way,
 we find ourselves. And thereby we achieve our most genuine
 identity and most complete integrity. And it is in this very
 surrendering of ourselves that we find our security.<br>
 <br>
 Pathos is active: it strives to reach a set goal. In our lyrical
 state, we do not want to achieve anything; we experience what we
 already have and we devote ourselves to the present and the
 existing, even if the existing can also consist of an evocation
 of the past. This is not a result of moral indifference. We
 merely move on - or, rather, at present occupy - a different
 plane; we are in a different position in regard to thinking,
 feeling, and wishing: a position in which the will is not
 committed. It is by no means absent, mind you just not interested
 in achieving results.<br>
 <br>
 While pathos must put strength into its gestures and has the
 capability of being violent, dynamic as it is, its counterpart -
 poetry, lyrics - does not employ strength. It is non-violent and
 does not need to force itself into placidity. It opens its
 defenceless embrace, and that gesture is one of love. It is
 harried neither by the concerns of the intellect nor by those of
 the passions; it does not compete with time. It has the ability
 to contest, as it were, the passage of time and in its best
 moments, conjoin with time in a sort of motionlessness where only
 one thing matters: that it be lasting.<br>
 <br>
 The lyrical attitude has no desire to convince others. It merely
 offers them an opportunity to partake of that which it feels and
 experiences itself. No more and no less. It does not even go so
 far as to take a stand. It lacks distance; it conjoins, after
 all, with the flow of life. And if it takes no stand, it is all
 the less capable of becoming involved in disputes.<br>
 <br>
 But perhaps one might dare take yet another step and pose a
 question concerning the possible influence of the lyrical state
 of mind on economy, ecology, or politics, for example.
 Additionally, one might ask about the participation of the
 lyrical state of mind in the upheaval in human consciousness in
 general, in possible changes in mankind's ways of seeing and
 perceiving (changes generally regarded as necessary); one might
 ask whether traditional patterns of behavior (considering that
 they are not equal to the problems of today) should be replaced
 by other ones. One might pose the question of lyricism's role in
 a possible shift from conceptual thinking (das begriff liche
 Denken) to rational perception (vern&uuml;nftige Wahrnehmung,
 Vernunft-Wahrnehmung) now that we have entered that state that
 C.F. Weizs&auml;cker (<i>Wege in der Gefahr</i>, p 258)
 characterizes thus: "Wir haben unsere Gesellschaft in einer Weise
 stilisiert, die weder der Wahrnehmung der Affekte noch der
 Wahrnehmung der Vernunft entspricht. Die Folge ist eine
 Desintegration der Affekte und ein Verstummen der
 Vernunft."<br>
 <br>
 The lyrical state of mind is capable, however paradoxical it may
 seem, of contributing as one of several forces to the return of
 wisdom to our civilization - capable, for example, of
 contributing to technology's being guided anew by reason: a
 reason that, naturally, is united with life and with nature in
 ways other than through rational abstractions - in other words, a
 reason that would differ from our present, rational, utilitarian
 reason and its conceptual thinking.<br>
 <br>
 It also presents itself as a moderating factor in our aggressive
 and dynamic spirit, in our so highly self-assertive will.
 Admittedly, our dynamism and will - in the context of our
 conceptual-thinking culture - were the sources of our
 technological and economic advancement, of our industrial
 revolutions, and thereby also of our power and influence in the
 world. But that spirit has also brought with it the problems and
 other negative aspects of our time, which, the greater the
 successes achieved by that dynamic and aggressive spirit, move
 more and more into the foreground. It is a spirit of subjugation
 and conquest, a spirit desirous of ruling over nature as well as
 over men, nations, and entire civilizations, a spirit of
 rationalized will to power over nature and people. It is a state
 of mind in which our will strives to become lord over everything
 it can, to gain riches and possessions, instead of allowing us to
 find joy in things without bringing them under our sway. This
 far-too-powerful will can be balanced and bridled and led to
 other attitudes than the aggressively rapacious precisely through
 the agency of the Iyrical state of the non-committed will. As E.
 F. Schumacher wrote (in his book <i>Small Is Beautiful</i>, p
 27): "A man driven by greed or envy loses the power of seeing
 things as they really are, or seeing things in their roundness
 and wholeness, and his very successes become failures. If whole
 societies become infected by these vices, they may indeed achieve
 astonishing things, but they become increasingly incapable of
 solving the most elementary problems of everyday
 existence."<br>
 <br>
 Is it not so that, in addition to the need for new values that
 various writers speak of, the lyrical state of mind, which is
 rooted in identification with nature and the world around us, is
 also one of the possible sources of an inner change in man and
 thereby, too, one of the ways that can lead man out of his
 untenable position as a self-designated ruler who places himself
 outside nature, above it and against it? Is not the Iyrical state
 of mind a possible instrument for overcoming the idea that nature
 is something that has been given to man, given to man's strength
 and competence so that he may make himself lord over nature,
 treating it as his prey and using it to satisfy his insatiable
 possessive instinct? And is not the lyrical state of mind
 ultimately the change in our relationship to life demanded by
 Heidegger? A change that means we allow life to be what it is so
 that, in the end, it will speak to us itself and reveal itself to
 us in its meaningful essence in such a manner as to make it
 comprehensible to us?<br>
 <br>
 Can one fail to see that lyricism is the diametric opposite to
 the cult of strength and power and, in an utterly natural manner,
 offers itself as a corrective to our tendency to resolve
 society's problems by forcible means and through power struggles,
 through technological, financial, organizational, political, and
 physical power - power that, in any case, is ultimately merely a
 product of incomplete insight (&laquo;ein Produkt
 unvollst&auml;ndiger Einsicht&raquo;)? And in precisely the same
 way, one can place it in contrast to our worship of work and
 performance, to our obsession with the idea of ruling and
 exploiting nature and people, particularly since power often
 elevates the efficiency and gradual perfecting of its power
 systems to issues of the greatest importance, even when what is
 involved are systems that, from the most exaltedly objective
 viewpoint, are not at all functional and that achieve their tasks
 only at the cost of losses in human dignity and losses not only
 in material but also in moral terms - and at the cost of loss of
 harmony within man himself and of harmonious relationships among
 people.<br>
 <br>
 Many people are well aware that this ever more powerful
 possessive instinct, this ever stronger emphasis on conquest,
 expansion, and exploitation, must be fettered and bridled in
 order that the damage resulting as its negative social product
 does not become greater than the advantages. But it is not enough
 to be aware of these circumstances, to know of their existence.
 If there is to be a fundamental change - and a fundamental
 change, of course, away from our striving to increase our power
 and develop it in every direction - to man's detriment - then a
 change in our consciousness is called for, a change in our mental
 set. As it was once expressed so beautifully, what is needed is a
 "revolution of the mind and the heart".<br>
 <br>
 I do not wish to try making lyricism, or more over lyrics, into a
 political force or a political tool and deprive poetry - or art
 generally, for that matter - of its true, specific, and
 irreplaceable purview, nor do I wish to subordinate that purview
 to other interests. Nevertheless, I feel - and I make so bold as
 to state - that the lyrical state of mind is something that far
 transcends the boundaries of lyrics and poetry - or, indeed, of
 art itself. Where it could manifest itself actively, it would be
 able - in a new and positive manner - to make its mark on culture
 and on all societal organizations in general. It would contribute
 to a necessary, thoroughgoing transformation of the
 consciousness, a process already underway in many people today,
 most in artists, least in those who have allowed themselves to be
 drawn into the power game of politics. In its way, it would be
 able to fill a function akin to that of mystical meditation -
 which, incidentally, has always been close to lyrics, but, which,
 compared to lyrics, is too exclusive a means or instrument. It
 would contribute to people's acquiring the ability and the desire
 to "den Willen still werden zu lassen und das Licht zu sehen, das
 sich erst bei still gewordenem Willen zeigt." Like mystical
 meditation, it would be "eine Schule der Wahrnehmung, des
 Kommenlassens der Wirklichkeit" (C.F. Weizs&auml;cker).<br>
 <br>
 Not all cultures can manage this task. Pinning one's hopes on
 culture, as such, alone - culture in the sense of cultivating and
 further refining that which we have taken over from the past -
 would lead to disappointment. It would still be the same,
 traditional culture of the will and the old reason. Even if we
 were to forget that our culture could have been not merely
 intolerant (despite the fact that there reigns in it a conviction
 that tolerance also belongs to culture), that it could have been
 repressive, arrogant, and messianic, that it could have been
 insensitive to numerous important values, lack understanding for
 many values, and, on the other hand, impose upon people a great
 deal that is of no value at all, we could not help but see that
 the legitimacy of this culture's traditional values has been more
 than undermined.<br>
 <br>
 Today, this task can be achieved only by a culture whose point of
 departure is an essentially modified state of consciousness,
 another state of mind. And right here, I see a great opportunity
 and a great task for lyricism and lyrics, for this state of mind,
 which is distinguished by identification with the world, by
 empathy, by sympathy, and by an uncommitted will. Despite the
 fact that so irrational an element as love would play an
 essential role in such a culture, the wisdom in that culture
 would in no way have to be less than the wisdom in the culture we
 have to cope with today.<br>
 <br>
 I would even like to declare that only then would it become the
 happy culture, truly rich in blessings, that it ought to
 be.<br>
 <br>
 And now, as I say that, yet another question comes to my mind - a
 question that, at this moment, strikes me as merely rhetorical:
 is it not true that pathos lives on, and is fueled by, precisely
 the vision of this happy understanding of things and of how
 wisely they are ordered on the basis of mutual sympathies? In a
 spirit of "love as the seeing state of mind that abolishes the
 struggle for existence," as C.F. Weizs&auml;cker formulated it?
 Is not pathos an attempt to reach outside one's own shadow and an
 attempt to return to Arcadia, where the rational, the just, and
 the natural are identical to reality? Is not pathos merely an
 attempt to return to the idyll - that is, to a state in which we
 know no foreign power over us and where the conflict between that
 which is and that which ought to be disappears, a state where
 reason and power, morals and politics, can sit down at the same
 table together? And finally, is the lost paradise sought by
 pathos not the world of lyricism? Is not poetry itself, lyrics,
 one of the foremost creators and interpreters of the vision of
 that paradise?<br>
 <br>
 As I write this, I am tempted to wish that, instead of having
 been a lyrist by birth, I could become one by conviction: a
 lyrist by my own choice.</p>
