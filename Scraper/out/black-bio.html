  <h1>Sir James W. Black - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="black.jpg" class="bio-img">I have never wanted to check out the family
  folklore that we could be traced back to a dominie at the hamlet
  of Balquhidder in the Scottish highlands. The romantic notion
  that I might have tenuous roots with two great traditions - with
  the political rebelliousness of Rob Roy McGregor and with the
  Scottish tradition of rural education, arguably one of the best
  anywhere - was too enjoyable to be seriously tested. The outcome,
  the fourth in an issue of five boys born into a staunch Baptist
  home, meant that from the beginning I was taught to be respectful
  of others no less than myself, influencing ever since both my
  political and administrative attitudes. My father, a mining
  engineer and colliery manager, gave his brood many advantages not
  least of which, for me, was his love of singing which gave music
  a central place in our lives.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from two periods of intense study, of music between the
  ages of 12 and 14 and of mathematics between the ages of 14 and
  16, I coasted, daydreaming, through most of my school years. The
  imprinting mathematical influence was Dr Waterson at Beath High
  School, a brilliant and rumbustious teacher, who more or less
  man-handled me into sitting the competitive entrance examination
  for St Andrews University. This led to an interview with the
  Vice-Chancellor, the redoubtable Sir James Irvine, flanked by
  elderly academic worthies, all poking into the mind of a nervous
  15 year old boy. I was awarded the Patrick Hamilton Residential
  Scholarship, mercifully unaware at the time that the family
  budget couldn't otherwise have stretched to yet another
  university student.<br>
  <br>
  As a condition of the Patrick Hamilton Residential Scholarship I
  spent my undergraduate years in St Salvator's Hall, a fine new
  building modelled on the Oxbridge colleges. The young aficionados
  of St Salvator's Hall in my day were culled from every imaginable
  class and state from the United Kingdom and overseas. The few
  intimate years I spent in this company were an extraordinarily
  mind-broadening experience for the country boy from the
  coalfields of Fife, no doubt much as the scholarship architects
  had intended.<br>
  <br>
  I chose to study Medicine mainly under the influence of an elder
  brother, William, a graduate in Medicine at St Andrews some
  years earlier. In the cold, forbidding, greyness of St Andrews -
  with its dedication to "causes purely spiritual and intellectual,
  to religion and learning" (Andrew Lang) - I learned, for the
  first time, the joys of substituting hard, disciplined study for
  the indulgence of day-dreaming. Undergraduate prizes seemed to
  confirm that I was working harder than my colleagues in a
  new-found love affair with knowledge. An important catalyst in my
  conversion to scholarship was my first year encounter with
  Professor D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, last of the great Victorian
  polymaths, author inter alia of the classic allometric study "On
  Growth and Form", and an intellectual giant if ever there was
  one.<br>
  <br>
  I met Hilary Vaughan at a Student Ball in 1944 and we married in
  the summer of 1946, as soon as I graduated. I joined the
  Physiology Department under Professor R.C. Garry in October 1946
  and Hilary, completing her degree in Biochemistry, was the best
  student I ever had. Had she chosen a sectarian approach to study
  she would have become a visible star but her eclectic pursuit of
  knowledge and her unwavering support for her family led her to
  study law and choose poetry as a distillate of her wisdom.
  Intellectually she was the most exciting person I have ever known
  and, quite simply, the mainspring of my life until she died in
  1986.<br>
  <br>
  My first year of research in Garry's laboratory introduced me to
  some simple ideas which, in a variety of ways, have dominated my
  thinking ever since. Garry was trying to find out how the
  intestine was able to absorb sugars selectively. Na iodoacetate
  treatment eliminated selective absorption and Verzar had deduced
  that the selectivity was based on phosphorylation. Learning that
  Garry's research student was showing that iodoacetate destroyed
  the intestinal epithelium, I wondered if iodoacetate was a
  general poison. What did it do to blood pressure, for example?
  When I developed the technology to show that, in rats,
  iodoacetate rapidly and irreversibly reduced the blood pressure
  to about 40 mm Hg, I was faced with the question which has
  influenced my thinking ever since: when and to what extent does
  local blood flow act as a metabolic throttle?<br>
  <br>
  We went to Singapore at the end of 1947 - an inevitable result of
  marriage, debts accumulated to pay for the completion of my
  medical studies, and pitiful academic prospects. As a Lecturer at
  the King Edward VII College of Medicine I experimented with
  learning how to teach Physiology; and I learned that
  experimenting in Physiology was too difficult if the inspiration
  was no more than wishful thinking. Nevertheless, I made some
  progress in relating mucosal blood flow to rates of intestinal
  absorption to use in my carpet-bagging efforts later in
  London.<br>
  <br>
  We paid off our debts, we learned some, made friends and returned
  in 1950 with a larger view of life. I had, however, no home, no
  income of any kind and no prospects whatsoever. I knocked on the
  doors of Physiology Departments all over London and met more
  sympathy than I expected; then a chance encounter with Professor
  Garry in Oxford Street led me to William Weipers, subsequently
  knighted, Director of the newly "nationalised" University of
  Glasgow Veterinary School. He gave me the opportunity to start a
  new Physiology Department, and during the next eight years I
  built a state-of-the-art physiology teaching laboratory based on
  my enduring belief that our brains work best when doing focuses
  our thinking. We had a daughter, Stephanie, born in 1951; I built
  a workshop-coupled research laboratory providing the most
  advanced cardiovascular technology I knew; and persuaded George
  Smith and Adam Smith, academic surgeons, to join me.<br>
  <br>
  As I slowly learned, like a primitive painter, how to be an
  effective experimenter, ideas began to ferment. Work with Adam
  Smith on the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine on gastric acid
  secretion was to surface again later on in my interest in the
  pharmacology of histamine-stimulated acid secretion. Work with
  George Smith, concerned with finding ways of increasing the
  supply of oxygen to the heart in patients with narrowed coronary
  arteries, led me to propose that reducing myocardial demand for
  oxygen by annulling cardiac sympathetic drive might be equally
  effective. By 1956, I had clearly formulated the aim, based on
  Ahlqvist's dual adrenoceptor hypothesis, of finding a specific
  adrenaline receptor antagonist. Egged on by their local
  representative, I successfully approached I.C.I. Pharmaceuticals
  Division for help and ended up being employed by them at their
  exciting new laboratories at Alderley Park, Cheshire. During my
  six years with them Dr Garnet Davey (subsequently Research
  Director) constantly supported me and, I have no doubt, fought
  many battles on my behalf to keep the initially controversial
  programme going. All I ever promised was that I was sure I could
  develop a new pharmacological agent which might answer a
  physiological question. Any utility would be implicit in that
  answer.<br>
  <br>
  My years at I.C.I., between 1958-1964, were some of the most
  exciting of my life. I was assigned a brilliant chemist, John
  Stephenson. He taught me about modern deductive organic
  chemistry; how to be more than merely curious about a molecule
  with an interesting biological effect: how to ask questions about
  it. He converted me to pharmacology. Indeed, my whole experience
  at I.C.I. was an educational tour de force. I had to learn how to
  collaborate across disciplines, how to change gears when changing
  from research to development, how to make industry work - in
  short, how to be both effective and productive.<br>
  <br>
  Among the numerous people who were involved in bringing the first
  beta-receptor antagonist to the marketplace, three played crucial
  roles. Bert Crowther masterminded the medicinal chemistry
  development. Genial, enthusiastic and highly experienced he was a
  splendid colleague. Bill Duncan, biochemist, brilliantly
  controlled the linchpin between research and development. He
  illuminated the black box between drug delivery and effect,
  developing analytical methods for estimating the levels and
  tissue distribution of a drug and its metabolites which allowed
  us to monitor and control toxicity tests, human pharmacology and
  clinical trials. Duncan brings brio and bravura to everything he
  does; and he is reliably my severest critic. Without him I would
  have made many more mistakes than I did. Brian Pritchard,
  clinical pharmacologist at University College, London, spearheaded the clinical
  development of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and crusaded on
  their behalf - as well as revolutionising their use by his
  discovery of their antihypertensive effect.<br>
  <br>
  By 1963, I faced opposing pressures. I saw that the success of
  the beta-receptor antagonist programme would suck me more and
  more into the role of giving the young propranolol technical
  support and promotion - just as I was itching to start a new
  programme. I was convinced that the histamine antagonists of the
  day were analogous to the alpha-receptor antagonists and that the
  equivalent of a beta-receptor antagonist was needed to block, for
  example, histamine-stimulated acid secretion. Then Edward Paget,
  Head of Pathology at I.C.I., who had accepted the Research
  Directorship at Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories asked my
  advice about finding a pharmacologist to run the biological
  research there. Half-jokingly, I asked what was wrong with me. So
  we made a deal: I would run his biological research provided I
  had a free hand to run my new project. Bill Duncan joined me to
  run the Biochemistry Department, so maintaining a tremendously
  successful partnership which lasted 15 years.<br>
  <br>
  The histamine project, modelled by analogy with the
  beta-adrenoceptor project, was also somewhat controversial at the
  beginning. It succeeded because of the faith of my managers and
  the scientific skill and devotion of my colleagues. When I was
  struggling at the front, Bill Duncan was defending the rear. Mike
  Parsons adopted the new pharmacology with rare enthusiasm and
  commitment and became one of the doughtiest colleagues I have
  ever had. I think we made a good team. Graham Durant made the
  initial breakthrough with a partial agonist, and Robin Ganellin
  exploited that lead by brilliant, deductive, medicinal chemistry.
  The years I spent working with Ganellin were the most sustained,
  intellectually exciting and productive period of medicinal
  chemistry I have ever experienced. John Wyllie, surgeon from
  University College London, contributed the last critical piece in
  a successful mission.<br>
  <br>
  By 1972, the H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist programme was
  launched, cimetidine was in development and I was looking for a
  new project. I was now totally committed to arranging marriages
  between bioassay and medicinal chemistry. Obvious candidates
  existed, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, but other shadowy ideas
  were lurking about in my imagination.<br>
  <br>
  The potential freedom from commercial constraints in academia was
  looking more and more attractive. Yet, when I was eventually
  offered the Chair in Pharmacology at University College, London,
  I was apprehensive about my ability to achieve my new goals. I
  had developed two ambitions. In research, I wanted to establish
  the medicinal chemistry/bioassay conjugation as an academic
  pursuit, as exciting to the imagination as astrophysics or
  molecular biology. In teaching, I wanted to offer a general
  pharmacology course based on chemical principles, biochemical
  classification and mathematical modelling. In the event I
  achieved neither of my ambitions. I failed to raise support for
  my medicinal chemistry project - by academic peerreview standards
  my proposals were altogether too wispy and expensive. My ideas
  about teaching based on a catechismal approach to drugs in
  general, rather than cataloguing drugs in particular, turned out
  to have too many curricular difficulties. I did help to set up an
  undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry and made progress in
  modelling and analysing pharmacological activity at the tissue
  level, my new passion. But after four years, I was suffering from
  withdrawal symptoms from lack of a chemical collaboration. Thus,
  I eagerly accepted <a href="../1982/index.html">John Vane's</a>
  invitation to join the Wellcome Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  My years at the Foundation (from 1977 to 1984) were an emotional
  roller-coaster. I wanted to make use of ideas I had been
  chiselling out, over the years, about the differences between
  successful and failed industrial projects. The division I took
  over at Wellcome, however, was remarkable for its traditional,
  conservative, ways and feudal structures. Entrenched attitudes
  can absorb reformist efforts like a punch bag. Yet despite
  disappointment in my managerial role, I made great progress in my
  own research. Working with brilliant young investigators such as
  Paul Leff, I began to see analytical pharmacology as a viable
  discipline. I had found myself a new mission - and once more my
  recurring dilemma between corporate commercial needs and personal
  scientific ambitions was solved unexpectedly. The Wellcome
  Foundation offered me the chance to establish a small academic
  research unit, modestly funded, but with total independence. The
  real opportunity, however, came from King's College,
  London. The College and Medical School between them have not only
  solved problems and smoothed diffficulties they have positively
  welcomed and supported my small unit. In intellectual terms the
  last five years at King's have been the most productive in my
  life. Surrounded by talented researchers and PhD students, I feel
  I have found my niche at last.</p>
