  <h1>James Franck - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="franck.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>James Franck</b> was born on August
  26, 1882, in Hamburg, Germany. After attending the Wilhelm
  Gymnasium there, he studied mainly chemistry for a year at the
  University
  of Heidelberg, and then studied physics at the University of
  Berlin, where his principal tutors were Emil Warburg and Paul
  Drude. He received his Ph.D. at Berlin in 1906 under Warburg, and
  after a short period as an assistant in Frankfurt-am-Main, he
  returned to Berlin to become assistant to Heinrich Rubens. In
  1911, he obtained the "venia legendi" for physics to lecture at
  the University of Berlin, and remained there until 1918 (with
  time out for the war in which he was awarded the Iron Cross,
  first class) as a member of the physics faculty having achieved
  the rank of associate professor.<br>
  <br>
  After World War I, he was appointed member and Head of the
  Physics Division in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical
  Chemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, which was at that time under the
  chairmanship of Fritz Haber. In 1920, Franck became Professor of
  Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for
  Experimental Physics at the University of G&ouml;ttingen. During
  the period 1920-1933, when G&ouml;ttingen became an important
  center for quantum physics, Franck was closely cooperating with
  <a href="../1954/index.html">Max Born</a>, who then headed the
  Institute for Theoretical Physics. It was in G&ouml;ttingen that
  Franck revealed himself as a highly gifted tutor, gathering
  around him and inspiring a circle of students and collaborators
  (among them: <a href="../1948/index.html">Blackett</a>, Condon, Kopfermann, Kroebel,
  Maier-Leibnitz, Oppenheimer, and Rabinovich, to mention some of
  them), who in later years were to be renowned in their own
  fields.<br>
  <br>
  After the Nazi regime assumed power in Germany, Franck and his
  family moved to Baltimore, U.S.A., where he had been invited to
  lecture as Speyer Professor at Johns Hopkins University. He then went to
  Copenhagen, Denmark, as a guest professor for a year. In 1935, he
  returned to the United States as Professor of Physics at Johns
  Hopkins University, leaving there in 1938 to accept a
  professorship in physical chemistry at the University of
  Chicago. During World War II Franck served as Director of the
  Chemistry Division of The Metallurgical Laboratory at the
  University of Chicago, which was the center of the Manhattan
  District's Project.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947, at the age of 65, Franck was named professor emeritus at
  the University of Chicago, but he continued to work at the
  University as Head of the Photosynthesis Research Group until
  1956.<br>
  <br>
  While in Berlin Professor Franck's main field of investigation
  was the kinetics of electrons, atoms, and molecules. His initial
  researches dealt with the conduction of electricity through gases
  (the mobility of ions in gases). Later, together with Hertz, he
  investigated the behaviour of free electrons in various gases -
  in particular the inelastic impacts of electrons upon atomswork
  which ultimately led to the experimental proof of some of the
  basic concepts of Bohr's atomic theory, and for which they were
  awarded the Nobel Prize, for 1925. Franck's other investigations,
  many of which were carried out with collaborators and students,
  were also dedicated to problems of atomic physics - those on the
  exchange of energy of excited atoms (impacts of the second type,
  photochemical researches), and optical problems connected with
  elementary processes during chemical reactions.<br>
  <br>
  During his period at G&ouml;ttingen most of his studies were
  dedicated to the fluorescence of gases and vapours. In 1925, he
  proposed a mechanism to explain his observations of the
  photochemical dissociation of iodine molecules. Electronic
  transitions from a normal to a higher vibrational state occur so
  rapidly, he suggested, that the position and momenta of the
  nuclei undergo no appreciable change in the process. This
  proposed mechanism was later expanded by E. U. Condon to a theory
  permitting the prediction of mostfavoured vibrational transitions
  in a band system, and the concept has since been known as the
  Franck-Condon principle.<br>
  <br>
  Mention should be made of Professor Franck's courage in following
  what was morally right. He was one of the first who openly
  demonstrated against the issue of racial laws in Germany, and he
  resigned from the University of G&ouml;ttingen in 1933 as a personal
  protest against the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler. Later, in his
  second homeland, his moral courage was again evident when in 1945
  (two months before Hiroshima) he joined with a group of atomic
  scientists in preparing the so-called "Franck Report" to the War
  Department, urging an open demonstration of the atomic bomb in
  some uninhabited locality as an alternative to the military
  decision to use the weapon without warning in the war against
  Japan. This report, although failing to attain its main
  objective, still stands as a monument to the rejection by
  scientists of the use of science in works of destruction.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the Nobel Prize, Professor Franck received the
  1951 Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society, and he was
  honoured, in 1953, by the university town of G&ouml;ttingen,
  which named him an honorary citizen. In 1955, he received the
  Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work
  on photosynthesis, a subject with which he had become
  increasingly preoccupied during his years in the United States.
  In 1964, Professor Franck was elected as a Foreign Member of the
  Royal Society, London, for his contribution to the understanding
  of exchanges of energy in electron collisions, to the
  interpretation of molecular spectra, and to problems of
  photosynthesis.<br>
  <br>
  Franck was first married (1911) to Ingrid Josefson, of
  G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, and had two daughters, Dagmar and Lisa.
  Some years after the death of his first wife, he was married
  (1946) to Hertha Sponer, Professor of Physics at Duke University
  in Durham, North Carolina (U.S.A.).<br>
  <br>
  Professor Franck died in Germany on May 21, 1964, while visiting
  in G&ouml;ttingen.</p>
