  <h1>Thomas H. Morgan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="morgan.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Thomas Hunt
  Morgan</b> was born on September 25, 1866, at Lexington,
  Kentucky, U.S.A. He was the eldest son of Charlton Hunt
  Morgan.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at the University of Kentucky, where he took his B.S.
  degree in 1886, subsequently doing postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins
  University, where he studied morphology with W. K. Brooks,
  and physiology with H. Newell Martin.<br>
  <br>
  As a child he had shown an immense interest in natural history
  and even at the age of ten, he collected birds, birds' eggs, and
  fossils during his life in the country; and in 1887, the year
  after his graduation, he spent some time at the seashore
  laboratory of Alphaeus Hyatt at Annisquam, Mass. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">During the summer of 1888, he was engaged in research for the  United States Fish Commission at Woods Hole. In 1890 he spent the summer at the  Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, thus  beginning a long-term association with the MBL as a  summer investigator and trustee.</span> In 1890 he obtained his Ph.D. degree at
  Johns Hopkins University. ln that same year he was awarded the
  Adam Bruce Fellowship and visited Europe, working especially at
  the Marine Zoological Laboratory at Naples which he visited again
  in 1895 and 1900. At Naples he met Hans Driesch and Curt Herbst.
  The influence of Driesch with whom he later collaborated, no
  doubt turned his mind in the direction of experimental
  embryology.<br>
  <br>
  In 1891 he became Associate Professor of Biology at Bryn Mawr College
  for Women, where he stayed until 1904, when he became Professor
  of Experimental Zoology at Columbia University, New York. He remained
  there until 1928, when he was appointed Professor of Biology and
  Director of the G. Kerckhoff Laboratories at the California Institute of
  Technology, at Pasadena. Here he remained until 1945. During
  his later years he had his private laboratory at Corona del Mar,
  California.<br>
  <br>
  During Morgan's 24-years period at Columbia University his
  attention was drawn toward the bearing of cytology on the broader
  aspects of biological interpretation. His close contact with E.
  B. Wilson offered exceptional opportunities to come into more
  direct contact with the kind of work which was being actively
  carried out in the zoological department, at that time.<br>
  <br>
  Morgan was a many-sided character who was, as a student, critical
  and independent. His early published work showed him to be
  critical of Mendelian conceptions of heredity, and in 1905 he
  challenged the assumption then current that the germ cells are
  pure and uncrossed and, like Bateson was sceptical of the view
  that species arise by natural selection. &laquo;Nature&raquo;, he
  said, &laquo;makes new species outright.&raquo; In 1909 he began
  the work on the fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> with
  which his name will always be associated.<br>
  <br>
  It appears that Drosophila was first bred in quantity by C. W.
  Woodworth, who was working from 1900-1901, at Harvard University,
  and Woodworth there suggested to W. E. Castle that Drosophila
  might be used for genetical work. Castle and his associates used
  it for their work on the effects of inbreeding, and through them
  F. E. Lutz became interested in it and the latter introduced it
  to Morgan, who was looking for less expensive material that could
  be bred in the very limited space at his command. Shortly after
  he commenced work with this new material (1909), a number of
  striking mutants turned up. His subsequent studies on this
  phenomenon ultimately enabled him to determine the precise
  behaviour and exact localization of genes.<br>
  <br>
  The importance of Morgan's earlier work with Drosophila was that
  it demonstrated that the associations known as <i>coupling</i>
  and <i>repulsion</i>, discovered by English workers in 1909 and
  1910 using the Sweet Pea, are in reality the obverse and reverse
  of the same phenomenon, which was later called <i>linkage</i>.
  Morgan's first papers dealt with the demonstration of sex linkage
  of the gene for white eyes in the fly, the male fly being
  heterogametic. His work also showed that very large progenies of
  Drosophila could be bred. The flies were, in fact, bred by the
  million, and all the material thus obtained was carefully
  analysed. His work also demonstrated the important fact that
  spontaneous mutations frequently appeared in the cultures of the
  flies. On the basis of the analysis of the large body of facts
  thus obtained, Morgan put forward a theory of the <i>linear
  arrangement</i> of the genes in the chromosomes, expanding this
  theory in his book, <i>Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity</i>
  (1915).<br>
  <br>
  In addition to this genetical work, however, Morgan made
  contributions of great importance to experimental embryology and
  to regeneration. So far as embryology is concerned, he refuted by
  a simple experiment the theory of Roux and Weismann that, when
  the embryo of the frog is in the two-cell stage, the blastomeres
  receive unequal contributions from the parent blastoderm, so that
  a &laquo;mosaic&raquo; results. Among his other embryological
  discoveries was the demonstration that gravity is not, as Roux's
  work had suggested, important in the early development of the
  egg.<br>
  <br>
  Although so much of his time and effort was given to genetical
  work, Morgan never lost his interest in experimental embryology
  and he gave it, during his last years increasing attention.<br>
  <br>
  To the study of regeneration he made several important
  contributions, an outstanding one being his demonstration that
  parts of the organism which are not subject to injury, such as
  the abdominal appendages of the hermit crab, will nevertheless
  regenerate, so that regeneration is not an adaptation evolved to
  meet the risks of loss of parts of the body. On this part of his
  work he wrote his book <i>Regeneration</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from the books previously mentioned Morgan wrote:
  <i>Heredity and Sex</i> (1913), <i>The Physical Basis of
  Heredity</i>(1919), <i>Embryology and Genetics</i> (1924),
  <i>Evolution and Genetics</i> (1925), <i>The Theory of the
  Gene</i> (1926), <i>Experimental Embryology</i> (1927), <i>The
  Scientifc Basis of Evolution</i> (2nd. ed., 1935), all of them
  classics in the literature of genetics.<br>
  <br>
  Morgan was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1919,
  where he delivered the Croonian Lecture in 1922. In 1924, he was
  awarded the Darwin Medal, and in 1939 the Copley Medal of the
  Society.<br>
  <br>
  For his discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome
  in heredity, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1933.<br>
  <br>
  Among his collaborators at Columbia may be mentioned <a href=
  "../1946/index.html">H. J. Muller</a>, who was awarded the Nobel
  Prize in 1946 for his production of mutations by means of
  X-rays.<br>
  <br>
  Morgan married Lilian Vaughan Sampson, in 1904, who had been a
  student at Bryn Mawr College, and who often assisted him in his
  research. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Morgan died in 1945.</p>
