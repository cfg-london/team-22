  <h1>Riccardo Giacconi - Biographical</h1>

  <p><img src="giacconi.jpg" class="bio-img"><i>In Memory of Marc Antonio Giacconi and
  dedicated to my wife, Mirella, and to our daughters, Anna and
  Guia.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Early
  years</b><br>
  I was born in Genoa, Italy, on October 6, 1931, but I spent most
  of my life until 1956 in Milano. I was the only child. My mother,
  Elsa Canni Giacconi, was a teacher of Mathematics and Physics at
  the high school level. She was the co-author of many textbooks on
  geometry which were widely adopted in Italy. She held that God
  made geometry. My father, Antonio Giacconi, owned a small
  business. He had a knack of seeing historical developments
  clearly and to perceive when the King was naked. He was an
  anti-fascist and suffered for it. My mother and father were
  legally separated when I was eight years old.</p>

  <p>I experienced World War II as a young
  teenager. I was sent to live with my aunts, Giulia and Elisa
  Canni, in Cremona following the 1942 bombings of Milano. The son
  of Giulia, Giovanni Benini, of my same age, became the only
  brother I ever had. I had access to a large library, including
  classics, and I read copiously.</p>

  <p>I returned to Milano in 1944 and lived there
  through 1956. My schooling was not completely conventional. I
  went to a German kindergarten, then first year elementary school
  in a Military College, then third year in Genoa, then again third
  year in Milano. I cut school frequently in Genoa and I was a
  discipline problem in Milano. I had my best learning in Cremona.
  I jumped last year of high school directly to the University of
  Milano. I obtained the doctorate in Physics in four years.
  Outside of school I loved climbing, hiking, and skiing. I
  traveled throughout Europe and I enlisted for two weeks as a
  trimmer on an English trawler out of Grimsby.</p>

  <p><b>II. Education</b><br>
  Up to and including university my interaction with the
  educational system was always difficult. In high school I loved
  to point out the mistakes by our mathematics teachers. At the
  university, I had difficulties following the heavy burden of
  lectures although I was able to pass all tests with relatively
  high grades. My salvation was to start doing research in the very
  first year of university. At the University of
  Milano there was at the time an active group of cosmic ray
  researchers interested in studying muons, lambda particles, and
  proton interactions. A very kind and bright young professor,
  Antonio Mura, put me to work doing literature searches and
  summaries, while Carlo Succi put me in the laboratory building
  power supplies with surplus U.S. parts and building and operating
  cloud chambers.</p>

  <p>This training was in stark contrast to the
  pedantic approach of many of the older teachers. The lectures in
  physics, chemistry, physical chemistry, and theory were of little
  use to me. I still loved geometry, analysis, and physics as I saw
  it from a researcher's point of view.</p>

  <p>I did my thesis work on the development of
  nuclear interactions by protons in the lead plates of a cloud
  chamber at the laboratory of Testa Grigia (3500 m). It took me
  two years to collect 80 proton interactions. I prepared a modest
  thesis confirming <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Fermi</a>'s model and I was
  finally out of formal schooling. I was hired as an assistant
  professor in the Physics Department and just before this time I
  met Giuseppe Occhialini. He was an extraordinary figure in
  Milano. His work was at an extremely high level and widely
  recognized internationally.</p>

  <p>To my knowledge he never gave a lecture. He
  took a liking to me and I to him. I was able to follow his
  multiplexed way of thinking and talking, and I was able to
  moderate some of his flights of imagination by sober use of first
  principles. He approved of my choice of working with cloud
  chambers, though most of the young people worked with emulsions,
  with the remark that at least I would learn plumbing. He
  suggested I go the United States to work with R.W. Thompson for
  whom he and I had the most profound esteem. I obtained a
  Fulbright Fellowship and sailed for the U.S. in 1956 and have
  lived here until now, except for a seven-year period (1992-1999)
  in Munich.</p>

  <p><b>III. Fellowships</b><br>
  I spent 1956 to 1958 in Bloomington, Indiana, working on the
  analysis of data previously obtained by Thompson and on the
  construction of a new and bigger cloud chamber for cosmic ray
  research. Thompson was a painstaking experimentalist as well as
  brilliant in data analysis and theory. He was the closest in the
  U.S. to the ideal of the Italian school of physics as embodied by
  Fermi, who was both a great experimentalist and theoretical
  thinker. Thompson had committed a blunder in research when young
  and this fact haunted him for the rest of his life. He never
  received the recognition he deserved for his discovery of the
  <font face="Symbol">q<sub>o</sub></font> mass and this troubled
  him greatly.</p>

  <p>It became quickly apparent that Thompson's
  group was not the place for me. The search for the anti-lambda
  particle was unsuccessful and the new cloud chamber would take 10
  years to build. I moved to Princeton University in 1958 to work in G.
  Reynolds' laboratory. There I conducted research in <font face=
  "Symbol">m</font> mesons and carried out an unsuccessful search
  for a new type of particle whose discovery had been claimed by
  Russian scientists. This search was a collaboration between Fred
  Hendel (a senior Austrian scientist), Herbert Gursky (a post
  doc), and myself. We built equipment, worked like fiends,
  analyzed data, and declared failure. In the meanwhile I had
  learned a lot about scintillation counters and image intensifiers
  to be used for elementary particle research at the then-envisaged
  Princeton-Penn accelerator.</p>

  <p>This put me in contact with the MIT group led by
  Herbert Bridge. Also with American Science and Engineering
  (AS&amp;E), led by Martin Annis, an excosmic ray physicist. Both
  Bridge and Annis had been students of Bruno Rossi of MIT, who was
  chairman of the Board of AS&amp;E.</p>

  <p>My fellowship at Princeton expired in 1959.
  I went to visit Occhialini at CERN. He
  seemed to be in one of his emotional downturns seeing
  conspirators everywhere. CERN felt like an impersonal huge
  machine and offered me no prospects. I was therefore quite happy
  to receive an offer from AS&amp;E to initiate for the 28-man
  corporation a program of space sciences. I joined the Corporation
  in September 1959 and I started a serious career in science.</p>

  <p><b>IV. Outlook and personal
  considerations</b><br>
  Cosmic ray research as a tool to study elementary particles was
  ending just as I was doing my thesis. The work by Thompson was
  destined to a dead end. The MIT cosmic ray research group led by
  Rossi had decided to abandon almost completely cosmic ray
  research and to start utilizing space to study plasmas and gamma
  rays from celestial objects. In particular, W. Kraushaar and
  George Clark carried out one of the first surveys in gamma
  rays.</p>

  <p>For me the problem was much more personal. I
  felt I had not learned any useful skills while working in Milano,
  Indiana, and Princeton. I desperately wanted some kind of
  permanent position where I could learn a trade and, moreover, I
  felt I owed this to my family. I had married Mirella, whom I had
  known in Milano since the age of 16. Guia and Anna, our two
  daughters, needed stability and a home. The influence of Mirella
  on my life has been greater than that of any other person. She
  brought love, calm, and stability where none had existed before.
  She created a home for us full of beauty and tenderness. She is
  brighter than I am, translated many books for the MIT press, and
  has an uncompromising view of reality. Through thick and thin we
  are still together today.</p>

  <p><b>V. Early years at AS&amp;E</b><br>
  Given the task of creating a space program for the company, I
  started discussions with George Clark, an MIT professor and
  consultant and shareholder in AS&amp;E. We discussed the
  possibility of searching for the ratio between alpha particles
  and protons in the trapped radiation belts just recently
  discovered by Van Allen. Another suggestion came from Bruno Rossi
  at a party in his house. He reported discussions at the Space
  Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences about the potential for
  x-ray astronomy and suggested AS&amp;E might undertake it. I have
  always been grateful for that initial suggestion.</p>

  <p>1959 to 1962 were among the most productive
  years of my life. I was involved in classified research: 19
  rocket payloads, six satellite payloads, one entire satellite,
  and an aircraft payload, as well as four rocket payloads for
  geophysical research. Also in this period I produced instruments
  for alpha - proton ratio experiments, as well as the initial
  development of the x-ray telescope and the first few flights of
  rocket payloads for x-ray astronomy. This was a tremendous
  challenge. My group at AS&amp;E went from 3 people (myself and
  two technicians) to 70 people in two and a half years. Frank
  Paolini and Herbert Gursky joined the group. Frank was a great
  instrumentalist. Without his contributions the successful 1962
  x-ray payload could not have happened. Herbert Gursky, though
  quite valiant in the laboratory and in the field (he actually
  launched the June 12, 1962, rocket), was always more of a natural
  scientist. The fundamental steps in the dawn of x-ray astronomy
  remain in my mind: the first brief review, theoretical and
  experimental, of x-ray astronomy (1960), the invention of the
  x-ray telescope (1960), and the 1963 plan for xray astronomy by
  Gursky and me. This plan laid out a program of experiments which
  went from rockets to UHURU, "Einstein," and Chandra. We thought then it could be done in
  five years, but it was not accomplished until the year 2000.</p>

  <p>Much of the history of the development of
  x-ray astronomy has been told by Richard Hirsh, by Wally Tucker
  and me, and by others in books and articles and I will not repeat
  it here. But my scientific life took an unexpected turn after
  1980 and I will devote some space to my growing interest in the
  direction of scientific enterprises outside of x-ray
  astronomy.</p>

  <p><b>VI. Center for astrophysics</b><br>
  I had decided by 1973 that I actually loved astronomy, at least
  as I was practicing it. The success of UHURU gave the members of
  my group (Gorenstein, Gursky, Kellog, Murray, Schreier,
  Tananbaum, Tucker, and Van Speybroeck) a feeling of awe and
  gratitude at the richness and beauty of nature. We had won the
  NASA contract to build the Large Orbiting X-Ray Observatory
  (1970-1973). The contract was canceled due to cost overruns in
  the NASA Viking Program in 1973 and restarted the same year for
  what became "Einstein," at one-half the size. We felt that we
  wanted to operate "Einstein" as a national observatory open to
  astronomers of all disciplines. AS&amp;E did not seem to be the
  right place to do this. Thus the move to Harvard (where I was
  named a full professor) with eight of my group. We were looking
  for a closer involvement with the rest of astronomy and we
  thought the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) might provide the
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, hardly anybody at CfA
  cared about what we were doing and there was less support for
  research than we had at AS&amp;E. (In retrospect I have often
  wondered if we could have been successful at all had we started
  our work at Harvard). When I proposed to NASA an x-ray astronomy
  institute to direct the construction and operation of the
  "Einstein" successor in 1976 (then called AXAF and now Chandra),
  there was little support from CfA itself, where the institute
  would have been located. The proposal for AXAF was written by
  Harvey Tananbaum and me in 1976 and started the process which led
  to Chandra. Harvey was the project scientist for UHURU, the
  scientific manager for "Einstein," and took on the leadership
  role in Chandra. His contributions to x-ray astronomy have never
  been sufficiently recognized. It took perseverance over almost 20
  years to turn Chandra into reality. For me the delay between
  conception and execution was becoming too long. Also, after the
  glory of discoveries with UHURU, "Einstein" seemed relatively
  tame. I was ready for a change, which came with the unsought
  offer by Margaret Burbidge to become the first director of the
  Space
  Telescope Science Institute (STScI).</p>

  <p><b>VII. Hubble space telescope</b><br>
  The effort at CfA to make x-ray astronomy useful to astronomers
  of all disciplines spurred us to provide the user with calibrated
  data out of a software pipeline. The development of end-to-end
  data management systems stems from that beginning. As the first
  Director of STScI, I was able to transfer my methodology for
  doing science in the planning and execution of science operations
  of Hubble.</p>

  <p>Every aspect of the mission was examined by
  myself and the distinguished staff we were able to attract to the
  Institute. Ethan Schreier, my comrade of UHURU and "Einstein"
  days, and Rodger Doxey brought the physics-oriented mentality of
  x-ray astronomers to the new project.</p>

  <p>Although we were quite ignorant in optical
  astronomy, we quickly found that operational planning for Hubble
  was a disaster. Guide stars could not be found on the fly as
  planned, the telescope could not point to planets, simultaneous
  reception of data from two instruments could not be achieved, and
  on and on.</p>

  <p>Even more serious was the lack of tools to
  schedule the complex operations of Hubble and the absence of a
  data reduction system capable of ingesting the very high data
  rates. Both were accomplished by STScI. This meant developing
  models for the instrument defined by parameters measured on the
  ground and continuously verified in orbit, determining modes of
  instrument operations, and defining calibration routines. We also
  developed a software pipeline capable of analyzing data in real
  time and constructed an archive of calibrated data suitable for
  reuse by scientists other than those who built the instruments or
  used the Hubble through the competitive research program. We
  instituted, with NASA's consent, data analysis grants and the
  Hubble Fellowship program. We developed an outstanding outreach
  program to reach the general public as well as colleagues and
  students.</p>

  <p>We took responsibility for Hubble beyond the
  construction of glass and metal to turn it into an outstanding
  scientific tool.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to credit all of the
  scientists involved in creating and running the STScI and to name
  only a few seems unfair to the others. Many of them have
  continued at the Institute until today and many have gone on to
  prestigious positions at outstanding research institutions.</p>

  <p>In 1991 my son Marc died in an automobile
  accident. STScI, Hubble, and Baltimore were continued and painful
  reminders of devastating grief. When the offer came to become
  Director General of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), Mirella and I
  jumped at the opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>VIII. ESO and the VLT</b><br>
  When I joined ESO in January 1993, ESO was beginning to execute
  the Very Large Telescope (VLT) program. Quite a bit of progress
  had already occurred but the program was of such a size as to
  equal eight times the yearly budget of ESO and was 30 times
  larger than the previously built New Technology Telescope.</p>

  <p>Massimo Tarenghi, an excellent scientist and
  an energetic manager, needed support from the rest of ESO to
  carry the project through. To help him in his task we had to
  fully reorganize ESO and introduce modern management techniques
  suitable for large programs. This was reasonably straightforward.
  More difficult was the introduction at ESO of the concept of a
  single observatory in which quality rather than quantity mattered
  and the introduction of end-toend software systems, calibration,
  and archiving, whose validity was proven on Hubble but had not
  yet been used in ground-based optical astronomy.</p>

  <p>VLT became a machine to do science in which
  efficiency of operations and ability to use the data were as
  important as telescope and instrumentation performance.</p>

  <p>Keck had the fortune of being the first to
  provide a 10 meter class telescope and reaped the early reward.
  But in a certain sense, it is operated as an old telescope for
  use by a restricted community. The success of VLT has placed
  European optical ground-based astronomy in the position to
  compete worldwide.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of my stay at ESO we
  initiated a new cooperative program with the United States and
  Canada to build a large submillimeter and millimeter wave array
  of antennas to be placed in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile.
  At the expiration of my tenure as Director General in 1999, I
  returned to the United States where now, as President of Associated Universities,
  Inc., I am working with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory as the
  Executive for the North American portion of the project, called
  the Atacama
  Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The same principles and the
  same methods used in "Einstein," Hubble, VLT, and Chandra are
  being utilized.</p>
