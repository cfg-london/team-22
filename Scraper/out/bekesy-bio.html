  <h1>Georg von B&eacute;k&eacute;sy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bekesy.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Georg von B&eacute;k&eacute;sy</b> was born
  in Budapest, Hungary, on June 3, 1899, the son of Alexander von
  B&eacute;k&eacute;sy, a diplomat, and his wife, Paula. He received
  his early education in Munich, Constantinople, Budapest, and in a
  private school in Zurich. Having passed the Swiss
  &laquo;Maturit&auml;tspr&uuml;fung&raquo; he studied chemistry at
  the University of
  Berne. After a short military service he received his Ph.D.
  in Physics in 1923 from the University of Budapest. Later on he
  entered the services of the Hungarian Post Office in Budapest
  where he stayed until 1946. He worked one year at the Central
  Laboratory of Siemens and Halske A.G. in Berlin, at that time one
  of the centers in the development of telecommunication. During
  vacations he spent his free time in different workshops learning
  how to use a file for many hours without hurting the hands.<br>
  <br>
  His work in the research laboratory of the Hungarian Post Offce
  was concerned mainly with problems of long-distance telephone
  transmission. The friendly and efficient atmosphere of this
  laboratory made it possible for him to spend considerable time in
  the study of the ear as a main component of the transmission
  system. Soon he became a nuisance to the autopsy rooms of the
  hospitals and the mechanical workshops of the Post Office. There
  they did not like to find their drill press full of human-bone
  dust in the morning. But the wonderful laboratory spirit helped
  to overcome all difficulties, except those produced by the
  destructions of World War II.<br>
  <br>
  During the years 1939-1946 he was also Professor of Experimental
  Physics at the University of Budapest. He left Hungary in 1946
  for Sweden, where he was a guest of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1961/bekesy-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Karolinska Institute</a> and
  did research at the Technical Institute in Stockholm. It was
  during this period that he developed a new type of audiometer
  which is operated by the patient and has applications outside the
  field of hearing. For instance, it has permitted the
  determination of the change in sensitivity of the eye of pigeons
  during dark adaptation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947 he went to the United States and has worked since then at
  Harvard
  University in the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory. Lately he has
  been interested in developing a mechanical model of the inner ear
  with nerve supply, the nerve supply being represented by the skin
  of the arm. This model shows such close similarity to phenomena
  in hearing that it has become a useful tool in the investigation
  of some specific problems that have been pursued for many
  years.<br>
  <br>
  His honours include the Denker Prize in Otology (1931), the Guyot
  Prize for Speech and Otology of Groningen University (1939) and
  the Shambaugh Prize in Otology (1950). He was the recipient of
  the Leibnitz Medal of the Berlin Academy of Sciences (1937), the
  Academy Award of the Budapest Academy of Science (1946), the
  Howard Crosby Warren Medal of the Society of Experimental
  Psychologists (1955), and the Gold Medals of the American
  Otological Society (1957) and the Acoustical Society of America
  (1961). Honorary doctorates (M.D.) were conferred on him by the
  Universities of Munster (1955) and Berne (1959).</p>
