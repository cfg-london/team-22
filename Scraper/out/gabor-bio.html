  <h1>Dennis Gabor - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gabor.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Budapest, Hungary, on June
  5, 1900, the oldest son of Bertalan Gabor, director of a mining
  company, and his wife Adrienne. My life-long love of physics
  started suddenly at the age of 15. I could not wait until I got
  to the university, I learned the calculus and worked through the
  textbook of Chwolson, the largest at that time, in the next two
  years. I remember how fascinated I was by Abbe's theory of the
  microscope and by Gabriel Lippmann's method of colour
  photography, which played such a great part in my work, 30 years
  later. Also, with my late brother George, we built up a little
  laboratory in our home, where we could repeat most experiments
  which were modern at that time, such as wireless X-rays and
  radioactivity. Yet, when I reached university age, I opted for
  engineering instead of physics. Physics was not yet a profession
  in Hungary, with a total of half-a-dozen university chairs - and
  who could have been presumptuous enough to aspire to one of
  these?<br>
  <br>
  So I acquired my degrees, (Diploma at the Technische Hochschule
  Berlin, 1924, Dr-Ing. in 1927), in electrical engineering,
  though I sneaked over from the TH as often as possible to the
  University of Berlin, where physics at that time was at its
  apogee, with Einstein, Planck, Nernst and v. Laue. Though
  electrical engineering remained my profession, my work was almost
  always in applied physics. My doctorate work was the development
  of one of the first high speed cathode ray oscillographs and in
  the course of this I made the first iron-shrouded magnetic
  electron lens. In 1927 I joined the Siemens &amp; Halske AG where
  I made my first of my successful inventions; the high pressure
  quartz mercury lamp with superheated vapour and the molybdenum
  tape seal, since used in millions of street lamps. This was also
  my first exercise in serendipity, (the art of looking for
  something and finding something else), because I was not after a
  mercury lamp but after a cadmium lamp, and that was not a
  success.<br>
  <br>
  In 1933, when Hitler came to power, I left Germany and after a
  short period in Hungary went to England. At that time, in 1934,
  England was still in the depths of the depression, and jobs for
  foreigners were very difficult. I obtained employment with the
  British Thomson-Houston Co., Rugby, on an inventor's agreement.
  The invention was a gas discharge tube with a positive
  characteristic, which could be operated on the mains.
  Unfortunately, most of its light emission was in the short
  ultraviolet, so that it failed to give good efficiency with the
  available fluorescent powders, but at least it gave me a foothold
  in the BTH Research Laboratory, where I remained until the end of
  1948. The years after the war were the most fruitful. I wrote,
  among many others, my first papers on communication theory, I
  developed a system of stereoscopic cinematography, and in the
  last year, 1948 I carried out the basic experiments in
  holography, at that time called "wavefront reconstruction". This
  again was an exercise in serendipity. The original objective was
  an improved electron microscope, capable of resolving atomic
  lattices and seeing single atoms. Three year's work, 1950-53,
  carried out in collaboration with the AEI Research Laboratory in
  Aldermaston, led to some respectable results, but still far from
  the goal. We had started 20 years too early. Only in recent years
  have certain auxiliary techniques developed to the point when
  electron holography could become a success. On the other hand,
  optical holography has become a world success after the invention
  and introduction of the laser, and acoustical holography has now
  also made a promising start.<br>
  <br>
  On January 1, 1949 I joined the Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology
  in London, first as a Reader in Electronics, later as Professor
  of Applied Electron Physics, until my retirement in 1967. This
  was a happy time. With my young doctorands as collaborators I
  attacked many problems, almost always difficult ones. The first
  was the elucidation of Langmuir's Paradox, the inexplicably
  intense apparent electron interaction, in low pressure mercury
  arcs. The explanation was that the electrons exchanged energy not
  with one another, by collisions, but by interaction with an
  oscillating boundary layer at the wall of the discharge vessel.
  We made also a Wilson cloud chamber, in which the velocity of
  particles became measurable by impressing on them a high
  frequency, critical field, which produced time marks on the
  paths, at the points of maximum ionisation. Other developments
  were: a holographic microscope, a new electron-velocity
  spectroscope an analogue computer which was a universal,
  non-linear "learning" predictor, recognizer and simulator of time
  series, a flat thin colour television tube, and a new type of
  thermionic converter. Theoretical work included communication
  theory, plasma theory, magnetron theory and I spent several years
  on a scheme of fusion, in which a critical high temperature
  plasma would have been established by a 1000 ampere space
  charge-compensated ion beam, fast enough to run over the many
  unstable modes which arise during its formation. Fortunately the
  theory showed that at least one unstable mode always remained, so
  that no money had to be spent on its development.<br>
  <br>
  After my retirement in 1967 I remained connected with the
  Imperial College as a Senior Research Fellow and I became Staff
  Scientist of CBS Laboratories, Stamford, Conn. where I have
  collaborated with the President, my life-long friend, Dr. Peter
  C. Goldmark in many new schemes of communication and display.
  This kept me happily occupied as an inventor, but meanwhile, ever
  since 1958, I have spent much time on a new interest; the future
  of our industrial civilisation. I became more and more convinced
  that a serious mismatch has developed between technology and our
  social institutions, and that inventive minds ought to consider
  social inventions as their first priority. This conviction has
  found expression in three books, <i>Inventing the Future</i>,
  1963, <i>Innovations</i>, 1970, and <i>The Mature Society</i>,
  1972. Though I still have much unfinished technological work on
  my hands, I consider this as my first priority in my remaining
  years.</p>
