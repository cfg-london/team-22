<h1>Michael S. Brown - Biographical</h1>
 
<p><img src="brown.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Michael S. Brown</b> was born on April
 13, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, the eldest child of Harvey
 Brown, a textile salesman, and Evelyn Brown, a housewife. His
 sister Susan was born three years later. When Brown was 11 years
 old the family moved to Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, a suburb of
 Philadelphia, where Brown attended Cheltenham High School. An
 amateur radio operating license obtained at age 13 led to a
 life-long fascination with science. A serious interest in
 journalism also developed early. These two passions, science and
 writing, have remained paramount ever since.<br>
 <br>
 Brown graduated in 1962 from the College of Arts and Sciences of
 the University of Pennsylvania, with chemistry as his major
 subject. He spent most of his time at the headquarters of the
 student newspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian, where he served as
 features editor and briefly as editor-in-chief. In 1966 Brown
 received his M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania
 School of Medicine. In 1964 he married Alice Lapin, a companion
 from childhood. The next two years were spent as intern and
 resident in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts
 General Hospital in Boston. Here Brown met <a href=

 two established the friendship and mutual respect that led to
 their long-term scientific collaboration.<br>
 <br>
 The years 1968-1971 were spent at the National Institutes of
 Health where Brown served initially as Clinical Associate in
 gastroenterology and hereditary disease. He then joined the
 Laboratory of Biochemistry, headed by Earl R. Stadtman, a pioneer
 in the disclosure of the mechanisms by which enzymes are
 regulated. Here Brown learned the techniques of enzymology and
 the fundamental principles of metabolic regulation. Brown made an
 important contribution to the Stadtman effort when he and a
 colleague discovered that a regulatory enzyme in the glutamine
 synthetic pathway was controlled by covalent attachment of a
 nucleotide, uridine.<br>
 <br>
 In 1971 Brown joined the division of Gastroenterology in the
 Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
   School in Dallas. His selection of Dallas was strongly
   motivated by his friendship with Goldstein, who had graduated
   from the Southwestern Medical School. In Dallas, Brown came
   under the influence of Donald W. Seldin, Chairman of the
   Department of Internal Medicine, an inspirational figure whose
   passion for medical science shaped the lives of a generation
   of Texas students.<br>
 <br>
 Soon after his arrival in Dallas, Brown succeeded in solubilizing
 and partially purifying 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
 reductase, a previously enigmatic enzyme that catalyzes the
 rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. He and
 Goldstein had developed the hypothesis that abnormalities in the
 regulation of this enzyme were the cause of familial
 hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disease in which excess
 cholesterol accumulates in blood and tissues. The formal
 scientific collaboration with Goldstein began one year later, in
 1972, just after Goldstein returned to Dallas from a postdoctoral
 fellowship in Seattle. The two young physicians initially
 maintained separate laboratories, but by 1974 the laboratories
 had been formally joined.<br>
 <br>
 Throughout the decade of the 1970's, when their scientific work
 was most intensive, Brown and Goldstein continued to function as
 academic physicians, each performing clinical attending rounds on
 the general medicine wards of Parkland Memorial Hospital for six
 to twelve weeks per year. They also conducted frequent teaching
 rounds in medical genetics. Their research efforts were aided by
 a number of talented senior collaborators and junior associates,
 as well as by frequent interchange with interested members of the
 Department of Internal Medicine.<br>
 <br>
 In 1974, Brown was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor of
 Internal Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
 School. He became a Professor in 1976. In 1977 he was appointed
 Paul J. Thomas Professor of Medicine and Genetics, and Director
 of the Center for Genetic Disease at the same institution. In
 1985, Brown was appointed Regental Professor of the University of
 Texas.<br>
 <br>
 Brown was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences of the United States in
 1980. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and
 Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the
 Association of American Physicians, the American Society of
 Biological Chemists, and the American Society for Cell Biology.
 He is a Diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine and
 a Fellow of the American College of Physicians.<br>
 <br>
 Brown received several student awards at the University of
 Pennsylvania, including a Proctor and Gamble Scholarship
 (1958-1962), the David L. Drabkin Prize in Biochemistry (1962),
 and the Frederick L. Packard Prize in Internal Medicine (1966).
 He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha. From 1974
 to 1977 he was an Established Investigator of the American Heart
 Association. He has served on several review boards including the
 Molecular Cytology Study Section of the National Institutes of
 Health (1974-77) and the editorial boards of the <i>Journal of
 Lipid Research</i>, the <i>Journal of Cell Biology</i>,
 <i>Arteriosclerosis</i> and <i>Science</i>. He has been a member
 of the Board of Scientific Advisors of the Jane Coffin Childs
 Fund since 1980.<br>
 <br>
 Brown received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the
 University of Chicago (1982) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
 (1982). With his colleague, Goldstein, Brown has shared the
 following awards: Heinrich Wieland Prize for Research in Lipid
 Metabolism (1974); Pfizer Award for Enzyme Chemistry of the
 American Chemical Society (1976); Albion O. Bernstein Award of
 the New York State Medical Society (1977); Passano Award (1978);
 Lounsbery Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1979);
 Gairdner Foundation International Award (1981); New York Academy
 of Sciences Award in Biological and Medical Sciences (1981); Lita
 Annenberg Hazen Award (1982); V.D. Mattia Award of the Roche
 Institute of Molecular Biology (1984); Distinguished Research
 Award of the Association of American Medical Colleges (1984);
 Research Achievement Award of the American Heart Association
 (1984); Louisa Gross Horwitz Award (1984); 3M Life Sciences Award
 of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
 (1985); William Allan Award of the American Society of Human
 Genetics (1985); and the Albert D. Lasker Award in Basic Medical
 Research (1985).<br>
 <br>
 Brown and Goldstein jointly delivered the following lectures:
 Harvey Lecture (1977); Christian A. Herter Lectures at Johns
 Hopkins University (1979); Harry Steenboch Lectures at the
 University of Wisconsin at Madison (1980); Smith, Kline, and
 French Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley (1981);
 Duff Memorial Lecture of the American Heart Association (1981);
 Doisy Lectures at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
 (1983); the first Pfizer Lecture in Honor of Konrad Bloch at
 Harvard University (1985); and the Berzelius Lecture at the
 Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm (1985).<br>

 Brown and his wife, Alice, have two daughters: Elizabeth (born in
 1973) and Sara (born in 1977).</p>
