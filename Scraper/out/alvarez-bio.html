  <h1>Luis Alvarez - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="alvarez.jpg" class="bio-img"> 
  <b>Luis W. Alvarez</b> was born in San
  Francisco, Calif., on June 13, 1911. He received his B.Sc. from
  the University
  of Chicago in 1932, a M.Sc. in 1934, and his Ph.D. in 1936.
  Dr. Alvarez joined the Radiation Laboratory of the University of
  California, where he is now a professor, as a research fellow in
  1936. He was on leave at the Radiation Laboratory of the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1940 to 1943, at the
  Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago in
  1943-1944, and at the Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan
  District from 1944 to 1945.<br>

  Early in his scientific career, Dr. Alvarez worked concurrently
  in the fields of optics and cosmic rays. He is co-discoverer of
  the "East-West effect" in cosmic rays. For several years he
  concentrated his work in the field of nuclear physics. In 1937 he
  gave the first experimental demonstration of the existence of the
  phenomenon of <i>K</i>-electron capture by nuclei. Another early
  development was a method for producing beams of very slow
  neutrons. This method subsequently led to a fundamental
  investigation of neutron scattering in ortho- and para-hydrogen,
  with Pitzer, and to the first measurement, with Bloch, of the
  magnetic moment of the neutron. With Wiens, he was responsible
  for the production of the first <sup>198</sup>Hg lamp; this
  device was developed by the Bureau of Standards into its present
  form as the universal standard of length. Just before the war,
  Alvarez and Cornog discovered the radioactivity of <sup>3</sup>H
  (tritium) and showed that <sup>3</sup>He was a stable constituent
  of ordinary helium. (Tritium is best known as a source of
  thermonuclear energy, and <sup>3</sup>He has become of importance
  in low temperature research.)<br>
  <br>
  During the war (at M.I.T.) he was responsible for three important
  radar systems - the microwave early warning system, the Eagle
  high altitude bombing system, and a blind landing system of
  civilian as well as military value (GCA, or Ground-Controlled
  Approach). While at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Professor Alvarez
  developed the detonators for setting off the plutonium bomb. He
  flew as a scientific observer at both the Almagordo and Hiroshima
  explosions.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Alvarez is responsible for the design and construction of the
  Berkeley 40-foot proton linear accelerator, which was completed
  in 1947. In 1951 he published the first suggestion for charge
  exchange acceleration that quickly led to the development of the
  "Tandem Van de Graaf accelerator". Since that time, he has
  engaged in high-energy physics, using the 6 billion electron volt
  Bevatron at the University of California Radiation Laboratory.
  His main efforts have been concentrated on the development and
  use of large liquid hydrogen bubble chambers, and on the
  development of high-speed devices to measure and analyze the
  millions of photographs produced each year by the bubble-chamber
  complex. The net result of this work has been the discovery by
  Dr. Alvarez' research group, of a large number of previously
  unknown efundamental particle resonances.. Since 1967 Dr. Alvarez
  has devoted most of this time to the study of cosmic rays, using
  balloons and superconducting magnets.<br>

  Professor Alvarez is a member of the following societies:
  National Academy of
  Sciences, American Philosophical Society, American Physical
  Society (President 1969), American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and National
  Academy of Engineering. In 1946 he was awarded the Collier Trophy
  by the National Aeronautical Association for the development of
  Ground - Controlled Approach. In 1953 he was awarded the John
  Scott Medaland Prize, by the city of Philadelphia, for the same
  work. In 1947 he was awarded the Medal for Merit. In 1960 he was
  named "California Scientist of the Year" for his research work on
  high-energy physics. In 1961 he was awarded the Einstein Medal
  for his contribution to the physical sciences. In 1963 he was
  awarded the Pioneer Award of the AIEEE; in 1964 he was awarded
  the National Medal of Science for contributions to high-energy
  physics, and in 1965 he received the Michelson Award. He has
  received the following honorary de grees: Sc.D., University of
  Chicago, 1967; Sc.D., Carnegie-Mellon University, 1968; Sc.D., Kenyon College,
  1969.</p>
