  <h2>The Green Revolution, Peace, and Humanity</h2>

  <p>Civilization as it is known today could not
  have evolved, nor can it survive, without an adequate food
  supply. Yet food is something that is taken for granted by most
  world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the
  population of the world is hungry. Man seems to insist on
  ignoring the lessons available from history.</p>

  <p>Man's survival, from the time of Adam and
  Eve until the invention of agriculture, must have been precarious
  because of his inability to ensure his food supply. During the
  long, obscure, dimly defined prehistoric period when man lived as
  a wandering hunter and food gatherer, frequent food shortages
  must have prevented the development of village civilizations.
  Under these conditions the growth of human population was also
  automatically limited by the limitations of food supplies.</p>

  <p>In the misty, hazy past, as the Mesolithic
  Age gave way to the Neolithic, there suddenly appeared in widely
  separated geographic areas the most highly successful group of
  inventors and revolutionaries that the world has ever known. This
  group of Neolithic men and women, and in all probability largely
  the latter, domesticated all the major cereals, legumes, and root
  crops, as well as all of the most important animals that to this
  day remain man's principal source of food. Apparently, nine
  thousand years ago, in the foothills of the Zagros
  Mountains<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>, man had already
  become both agriculturist and animal husbandry-man, which, in
  turn, soon led to the specialization of labor and the development
  of village life. Similar discoveries and developments elsewhere
  soon laid the groundwork from which all modern agriculture and
  animal industry and, indeed, all of the world's subsequent
  civilizations have evolved. Despite the tremendous value of their
  contributions, we know none of these benefactors of mankind by
  name. In fact, it has only been within the past century, and
  especially within the last fifteen years - since the development
  of the effective radio-carbon dating system - that we have begun
  even vaguely to understand the timing of these epochal events
  which have shaped the world's destiny.</p>

  <p>The invention of agriculture, however, did
  not permanently emancipate man from the fear of food shortages,
  hunger, and famine. Even in prehistoric times population growth
  often must have threatened or exceeded man's ability to produce
  enough food. Then, when droughts or outbreaks of diseases and
  insect pests ravaged crops, famine resulted.</p>

  <p>That such catastrophes occurred
  periodically in ancient times is amply clear from numerous
  biblical references. Thus, the Lord said: "I have smitten you
  with blasting and mildew."<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> "The
  seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate,
  the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered... The beasts
  of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are
  dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the
  wilderness."<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <p>Plant diseases, drought, desolation,
  despair were recurrent catastrophes during the ages - and the
  ancient remedies: supplications to supernatural spirits or gods.
  And yet, the concept of the "ever-normal granary" appeared in
  elementary form, as is clear from Pharaoh's dreams and Joseph's
  interpretation of imminent famine and his preparation for it, as
  indicated by this quotation from Genesis: "...And the seven years
  of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the
  dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was
  bread..."<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> For his time, Joseph
  was wise, with the help of his God.</p>

  <p>But today we should be far wiser; with the
  help of our Gods and our science, we must not only increase our
  food supplies but also insure them against biological and
  physical catastrophes by international efforts to provide
  international granaries of reserve food for use in case of need.
  And these food reserves must be made available to all who need
  them - and before famine strikes, not afterwards. Man can and
  must prevent the tragedy of famine in the future instead of
  merely trying with pious regret to salvage the human wreckage of
  the famine, as he has so often done in the past. We will be
  guilty of criminal negligence, without extenuation, if we permit
  future famines. Humanity cannot tolerate that guilt.</p>

  <p>Alfred Nobel was also very conscious of the
  importance of food, for he once wrote: "I would rather take care
  of the stomachs of the living than the glory of the departed in
  the form of monuments."</p>

  <p>The destiny of world civilization depends
  upon providing a decent standard of living for all mankind. The
  guiding principles of the recipient of the 1969 Nobel Peace
  Prize, the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1969/index.html">International Labor
  Organization</a>, are expressed in its charter words, "Universal
  and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon
  social justice. If you desire peace, cultivate justice." This is
  magnificent; no one can disagree with this lofty principle.</p>

  <p>Almost certainly, however, the first
  essential component of social justice is adequate food for all
  mankind. Food is the moral right of all who are born into this
  world. Yet today fifty percent of the world's population goes
  hungry. Without food, man can live at most but a few weeks;
  without it, all other components of social justice are
  meaningless. Therefore I feel that the aforementioned guiding
  principle must be modified to read: If you desire peace,
  cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to
  produce more bread; otherwise there will be no peace.</p>

  <p>The recognition that hunger and social
  strife are linked is not new, for it is evidenced by the Old
  Testament passage, "...and it shall come to pass, that when they
  shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their King
  and their God..."<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  <p>Perhaps no one in recent times has more
  pungently expressed the interrelationship of food and peace than
  Nobel Laureate <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1949/index.html">Lord
  John Boyd Orr</a><a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a>, the great
  crusader against hunger and the first director-general of the
  Food and Agriculture Organization, with his famous words, "You
  can't build peace on empty stomachs." These simple words of
  wisdom spoken twenty-one years ago are as valid today as when
  they were spoken. They will become even more meaningful in the
  future as world population skyrockets and as crowding, social
  pressures, and stresses increase. To ignore Lord Orr's admonition
  would result in worldwide disorders and social chaos, for it is a
  fundamental biological law that when the life of living organisms
  is threatened by shortage of food they tend to swarm and use
  violence to obtain their means of sustenance.</p>

  <p>It is a sad fact that on this earth at this
  late date there are still two worlds, "the privileged world" and
  "the forgotten world". The privileged world consists of the
  affluent, developed nations, comprising twenty-five to thirty
  percent of the world population, in which most of the people live
  in a luxury never before experienced by man outside the Garden of
  Eden. The forgotten world is made up primarily of the developing
  nations, where most of the people, comprising more than fifty
  percent of the total world population, live in poverty, with
  hunger as a constant companion and fear of famine a continual
  menace.</p>

  <p>When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee
  designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution
  to the "green revolution", they were in effect, I believe,
  selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of
  agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both
  for bread and for peace. I am but one member of a vast team made
  up of many organizations, officials, thousands of scientists, and
  millions of farmers - mostly small and humble - who for many
  years have been fighting a quiet, oftentimes losing war on the
  food production front.</p>

  <p>During the past three years spectacular
  progress has been made in increasing wheat, rice, and maize
  production in several of the most populous developing countries
  of southern Asia, where widespread famine appeared inevitable
  only five years ago. Most of the increase in production has
  resulted from increased yields of grain per hectare, a
  particularly important development because there is little
  possibility of expanding the cultivated area in the densely
  populated areas of Asia.</p>

  <p>The term "The Green Revolution" has been
  used by the popular press to describe the spectacular increase in
  cereal-grain production during the past three years. Perhaps the
  term "green revolution", as commonly used, is premature, too
  optimistic, or too broad in scope. Too often it seems to convey
  the impression of a general revolution in yields per hectare and
  in total production of all crops throughout vast areas comprising
  many countries. Sometimes it also implies that all farmers are
  uniformly benefited by the breakthrough in production.</p>

  <p>These implications both oversimplify and
  distort the facts. The only crops which have been appreciably
  affected up to the present time are wheat, rice, and maize.
  Yields of other important cereals, such as sorghums, millets, and
  barley, have been only slightly affected; nor has there been any
  appreciable increase in yield or production of the pulse or
  legume crops, which are essential in the diets of
  cereal-consuming populations. Moreover, it must be emphasized
  that thus far the great increase in production has been in
  irrigated areas. Nor have all cereal farmers in the irrigated
  areas adopted and benefited from the use of the new seed and the
  new technology. Nevertheless, the number of farmers, small as
  well as large, who are adopting the new seeds and new technology
  is increasing very rapidly, and the increase in numbers during
  the past three years has been phenomenal. Cereal production in
  the rain-fed areas still remains relatively unaffected by the
  impact of the green revolution, but significant change and
  progress are now becoming evident in several countries.</p>

  <p>Despite these qualifications, however,
  tremendous progress has been made in increasing cereal production
  in India, Pakistan, and the Philippines during the past three
  years. Other countries that are beginning to show significant
  increases in production include Afghanistan, Ceylon, Indonesia,
  Iran, Kenya, Malaya, Morocco, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey.</p>

  <p>Before attempting to evaluate the
  significance of the green revolution one must establish the point
  of view of the appraiser. The green revolution has an entirely
  different meaning to most people in the affluent nations of the
  privileged world than to those in the developing nations of the
  forgotten world. In the affluent, industrialized nations giant
  surpluses of wheat, maize, and sorghum are commonplace; cattle,
  swine, and poultry are fed and fattened on cereal grains; meat,
  milk, eggs, fruits, and vegetables are within the economic reach
  of most of the population; well-balanced diets are more or less
  automatically achieved, and cereal products constitute only a
  modest portion of the "daily bread". Consequently, most of the
  people in such societies have difficulty in comprehending and
  appreciating the vital significance of providing high-yielding
  strains of wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, and millet for the people
  of the developing nations. Understandably then, the majority of
  the urbanites in the industrialized nations have forgotten the
  significance of the words they learned as youngsters, "Give us
  this day our daily bread". They know that food comes from the
  supermarket, but only a few see beyond to the necessary
  investments, the toil, struggle, and frustrations on the farms
  and ranches that provide their daily bread. Since the urbanites
  have lost their contact with the soil, they take food for granted
  and fail to appreciate the tremendous efficiency of their farmers
  and ranchers, who, although constituting only five percent of the
  labor force in a country such as the United States, produce more
  than enough food for their nation.</p>

  <p>Even worse, urbanites often vociferously
  criticize their government for attempting to bring into balance
  the agricultural production of its farmers with the domestic and
  foreign market demands for farm products, and attempting thereby
  to provide the consumer an abundant food supply at reasonable
  cost and also to assure a reasonable return to the farmer and
  rancher.</p>

  <p>Contrasting sharply, in the developing
  countries represented by India, Pakistan, and most of the
  countries in Asia and Africa, seventy to eighty percent of the
  population is engaged in agriculture, mostly at the subsistence
  level. The land is tired, worn out, depleted of plant nutrients,
  and often eroded; crop yields have been low, near starvation
  level, and stagnant for centuries. Hunger prevails, and survival
  depends largely upon the annual success or failure of the cereal
  crops. In these nations both under-nutrition and malnutrition are
  widespread and are a constant threat to survival and to the
  attainment of the genetic potential for mental and physical
  development. The diet consists primarily of cereals, which
  provide from seventy to eighty percent of the calories and
  sixty-five to seventy percent of the protein intake. Animal
  proteins are so scarce and expensive as to be beyond the economic
  reach of the vast majority of the population. Although many of
  these nations were self-sufficient and some were exporters of
  cereals before the Second World War, they are now net importers,
  victims of population growth's outrunning agricultural
  production. There is little possibility in these countries of
  expanding the cultivated area to cope with the growing demand.
  The situation worsens as crop yields remain stagnant while human
  numbers continue to increase at frightening rates.</p>

  <p>For the underprivileged billions in the
  forgotten world, hunger has been a constant companion, and
  starvation has all too often lurked in the nearby shadows. To
  millions of these unfortunates, who have long lived in despair,
  the green revolution seems like a miracle that has generated new
  hope for the future.</p>

  <p>The significance and magnitude of the
  impact of the so-called green revolution are best illustrated by
  changes in cereal production in India, Pakistan, and the
  Philippines. In both India and Pakistan the rapid increase in
  yields per hectare of wheat has been the major thrust of the
  green revolution. Increases in rice yield also have played a
  major role in West Pakistan, but hitherto only a minor role in
  India. Increases in maize production have played a modest but
  significant role in expanded cereal production in both India and
  Pakistan; and increases in rice yields and production have been
  largely responsible for the change in cereal production up to now
  in the Philippines, Ceylon, and Indonesia.</p>

  <p>The green revolution in India and Pakistan,
  which is still largely the result of a breakthrough in wheat
  production, is neither a stroke of luck nor an accident of
  nature. Its success is based on sound research, the importance of
  which is not self-evident at first glance. For, behind the
  scenes, halfway around the world in Mexico, were two decades of
  aggressive research on wheat that not only enabled Mexico to
  become self-sufficient with respect to wheat production but also
  paved the way to rapid increase in its production in other
  countries. It was in Mexico that the high-yielding Mexican dwarf
  varieties were designed, bred, and developed. There, also, was
  developed the new production technology which permits these
  varieties, when properly cultivated, to express their high
  genetic grain-yield potential - in general, double or triple that
  of the best yielders among older, tall-strawed varieties.</p>

  <p>There are no miracles in agricultural
  production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of
  wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all
  ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture. Nevertheless, it is
  the Mexican dwarf wheat varieties, and their more recent Indian
  and Pakistani derivatives, that have been the principal catalyst
  in triggering off the green revolution. It is the unusual breadth
  of adaption combined with high genetic yield potential, short
  straw, a strong responsiveness and high efficiency in the use of
  heavy doses of fertilizers, and a broad spectrum of disease
  resistance that has made the Mexican dwarf varieties the powerful
  catalyst that they have become in launching the green revolution.
  They have caught the farmers' fancy, and during the 1969-1970
  crop season, fifty-five percent of the six million hectares sown
  to wheat in Pakistan and thirty-five percent of the fourteen
  million hectares in India were sown to Mexican varieties or their
  derivatives. This rapid increase in wheat production was not
  based solely on the use of Mexican dwarf varieties; it involved
  the transfer from Mexico to Pakistan and India of a whole new
  production technology that enables these varieties to attain
  their high-yield potential. Perhaps seventy-five percent of the
  results of research done in Mexico in developing the package of
  recommended cultural practices, including fertilizer
  recommendations, were directly applicable in Pakistan and India.
  As concerns the remaining twenty-five percent, the excellent
  adaptive research done in India and Pakistan by Indian and
  Pakistani scientists while the imported seed was being
  multiplied, provided the necessary information for modifying the
  Mexican procedures to suit Pakistani and Indian conditions more
  precisely.</p>

  <p>Equally as important as the transfer of the
  new seed and new technology from Mexico to India and Pakistan was
  the introduction from Mexico of a crop-production campaign
  strategy. This strategy harnessed the high grain-yield potential
  of the new seed and new technology to sound governmental economic
  policy which would assure the farmer a fair price for his grain,
  the availability of the necessary inputs - seed, fertilizers,
  insecticides, weed killers, and machinery - and the credit with
  which to buy them. Collectively these inputs and strategy became
  the base from which the green revolution evolved.</p>

  <p>Never before in the history of agriculture
  has a transplantation of high-yielding varieties coupled with an
  entirely new technology and strategy been achieved on such a
  massive scale, in so short a period of time, and with such great
  success. The success of this transplantation is an event of both
  great scientific and social significance. Its success depended
  upon good organization of the production program combined with
  skillful execution by courageous and experienced scientific
  leaders.</p>

  <p>Experimentation with dwarf Mexican
  varieties was initiated in both India and Pakistan in 1963 and
  continued in 1964. Results in both countries were highly
  promising. Consequently, in 1965, 350 and 250 tons of seed of the
  Mexican dwarf wheat varieties were imported into Pakistan and
  India, respectively, for wide-scale testing on farms. Again, the
  results were highly promising, and India reacted by importing
  eighteen thousand tons during 1966. A year later Pakistan
  imported forty-two thousand tons. With these importations, the
  revolution in wheat production got under way in both countries.
  It was the first time in history that such huge quantities of
  seed had been imported from distant lands and grown successfully
  in their new home. These importations saved from three to five
  years' time in reaping the benefits from the green
  revolution.</p>

  <p>During the past three years, wheat
  production has risen spectacularly in both countries. Using as a
  base the pre-green revolution crop year 1964-1965, which produced
  an all-time record harvest in both countries, the production in
  Pakistan increased from the 1965 base figure of 4.6 million tons
  to 6.7, 7.2, and 8.4 millions of tons, respectively, in 1968,
  1969, and 1970. West Pakistan became self-sufficient in wheat
  production for the first time in the 1968 harvest season, two
  years ahead of our predictions. Indian wheat production has risen
  from the 1964-1965 pre-green revolution record crop of 12.3
  million tons to 16.5, 18.7, and 20.0 million tons during 1968,
  1969, and 1970 harvests, respectively. India is approaching
  self-sufficiency and probably would have attained it by now if
  rice production had risen more rapidly, because, with a
  continuing shortage of rice, considerable wheat is being
  substituted for it.</p>

  <p>The introduction into West Pakistan of the
  high-yielding dwarf rice variety IR 8, developed by the
  International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines,
  together with the new technology that makes it highly productive,
  has also resulted in phenomenal increases in yield and production
  during the past two years. Unfortunately, this variety has been
  less well adapted to climatic conditions in the monsoon areas of
  India and in East Pakistan, and therefore has had only a modest
  and occasional impact there. Newer varieties which are now being
  multiplied promise to correct this situation.</p>

  <p>The revolution in wheat and rice production
  in India and Pakistan has not only greatly increased food
  production, but it also has had many indirect effects on both the
  farmer and the economy. It is estimated that Indian and Pakistani
  farmers who are cultivating the new Mexican dwarf-wheat varieties
  under the recommended management practices have increased their
  net income from thirty-seven dollars per hectare with the local
  varieties to 162 dollars with the dwarf Mexican varieties. During
  the past three harvests, a total of 1.4 billion dollars and 640
  million dollars have been added to the gross national product (G.
  N. P.) of India and Pakistan, respectively, from the increase in
  wheat production above the record 1965 base. The injection of
  this large increase in purchasing power into the economies has
  had many effects.</p>

  <p>Large numbers of tube-wells are being sunk
  by farmers in both India and Pakistan in order to expand the
  irrigated area and improve the control of irrigation water. It is
  estimated that a total of seventy thousand private tube-wells
  were sunk during the 1969-1970 crop season in India, which brings
  about 1.4 million hectares of additional land under controlled
  irrigation, thereby greatly expanding the food production
  potential. It is estimated that at present less than half of the
  irrigation potential of India has been developed.</p>

  <p>If the high-yielding dwarf wheat and rice
  varieties are the catalysts that have ignited the green
  revolution, then chemical fertilizer is the fuel that has powered
  its forward thrust. The responsiveness of the high-yielding
  varieties has greatly increased fertilizer consumption. The new
  varieties not only respond to much heavier dosages of fertilizer
  than the old ones but are also much more efficient in its use.
  The old tall-strawed varieties would produce only ten kilos of
  additional grain for each kilo of nitrogen applied, while the new
  varieties can produce twenty to twenty-five kilos or more of
  additional grain per kilo of nitrogen applied. Consumption of
  nitrogen fertilizer in India has increased from fifty-eight
  thousand metric tons of nutrients in 1950-1951 to 538 thousand
  and 1.2 million metric tons in 1964-1965 and 1969-1970 crop
  cycles, respectively; and about sixty percent of this amount was
  produced domestically. Phosphate consumption is approximately
  half that of nitrogen. A large part of the fertilizer currently
  being used is for wheat. The targeted consumption and domestic
  production needs of nitrogen for 1973-1974 are three million and
  two and a half million metric tons, respectively, a fantastic
  threefold increase in consumption and a fivefold increase in
  production. These fertilizer targets must be attained if the
  targeted production of 129 million metric tons of cereal is to be
  realized.</p>

  <p>Mechanization of agriculture is rapidly
  following the breakthrough in wheat production. Prior to the
  first big wheat crop in 1968, unsold tractors accumulated at the
  two factories then in production; at present, prospective
  purchasers must make written application for them and wait one or
  two years for delivery. Although five factories, with an output
  of eighteen thousand units per year, are now producing tractors,
  thirty-five thousand units were imported in 1969-1970.</p>

  <p>The traditional method of threshing by
  treading out of the grain with bullocks, followed by winnowing,
  is now inadequate for threshing the increased volume of wheat
  before the onset of the monsoon rains. Consequently, hundreds of
  thousands of small threshing machines have been produced and sold
  by hundreds of small village machine shops during the past three
  years, thus avoiding the loss of much of the crop after harvest
  and also providing additional employment in many new
  small-village industries.</p>

  <p>Moreover, mechanization has had another
  very important indirect effect on the intensification of cereal
  production. When small mechanical threshers replace bullocks for
  threshing, the bullocks are released for use in the timely
  preparation of the land for the next (summer) crop. This need for
  timely preparation of land is also one of the main reasons for
  the surge in demand for tractors. Before the adoption of the new
  wheat and rice varieties, in combination with heavy applications
  of chemical fertilizer, the time of sowing was relatively
  unimportant because yields were limited primarily by the low
  level of available plant nutrients. Most farmers would expect to
  harvest about one metric ton of wheat during the winter (rabi)
  season and about one and a half metric tons of rice during the
  summer (kharif) season, or a total of two and a half metric tons
  of grain per hectare per year. But by using the high-yielding
  varieties, fertilizing heavily, sowing at the right time, and
  managing the fields properly, the same farmer can now harvest
  five tons of wheat and seven tons of rice per hectare from the
  same land, a total of twelve metric tons of food grain per
  hectare per year, as contrasted with the two and a half tons
  which he obtained with the old varieties and methods. If
  plantings are not done at the optimum time, however, the yield of
  wheat may drop to three tons and that of rice to four tons per
  hectare, a total production of seven tons per year instead of the
  twelve tons when all operations are proper and timely. A few of
  the most progressive farmers now use triple cropping, involving
  wheat - mung beans - rice, or wheat - rice - potato, or three
  consecutive crops of rice during the same year. By increasing the
  intensity of cropping, both food production potential and
  employment are increased. Yields must then be calculated on the
  basis of kilos per hectare per year rather than on the basis of
  kilos per hectare per crop.</p>

  <p>The increased mechanization in cereal
  production has tended thus far to increase rather than decrease
  the employment opportunities for labor, and above all it has
  helped to reduce drudgery and increase the efficiency of human
  energy, especially in India.</p>

  <p>Millions of farmers who have successfully
  grown the new wheat, rice, and maize varieties have greatly
  increased their income. And this has stimulated the rapid growth
  of agro-industry by increasing the demand for fertilizers, pumps,
  machinery, and other materials and services.</p>

  <p>Farmers in many villages are investing in
  better storage facilities. In some locations, brick houses are
  beginning to replace those made of rammed earth. More electricity
  is being used to light the houses and to drive the motors on the
  wells. There also has been a rapid increase in demand for
  consumer goods. The purchase of transistors and radios for use in
  the villages has increased rapidly, and thereby the government
  for the first time can effectively reach the remote villages with
  educational programs. Sewing machines, bicycles, motor scooters,
  and motorcycles are coming to the villages, and truck and bus
  service between villages is improving.</p>

  <p>The green revolution has forced the Indian
  government to improve many of its public services. Although there
  was an extreme shortage of storage space for the first
  record-breaking wheat crop in 1968, the government improvised
  satisfactorily and very little grain was lost. During the past
  two years, stimulated in part by criticism by farmers and the
  press, warehouse capacity has been expanded greatly to provide
  adequate storage for the increasing grain production. The
  villages are demanding better roads, better public
  transportation, and better schools; and they are beginning to get
  them. Thus the divorce between intellect and labor, which the
  great Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi over forty years ago regarded
  as the bane of India's agriculture, is coming to an end.</p>

  <p>The changes wrought by the green
  revolution, which I have illustrated by the vast improvement of
  wheat production in India, have had similar effects in West
  Pakistan, Ceylon, the Philippines, and Thailand, although the
  effects in different countries were produced by changes in
  different crops or combinations of crops.</p>

  <p>Although the contributions of the green
  revolution to increased food production are considerable and
  highly significant, they are nonetheless modest in comparison
  with the magnitude of present global needs. The greatest obvious
  achievements are the rapid increase in cereal production during
  the past three years and the generation of a climate of
  confidence in the developing nations with regard to their
  capabilities of achieving food self-sufficiency. Perhaps even
  more significant, however, is the change in organizations and
  attitudes which has accompanied the increases in cereal
  production.</p>

  <p>The All-India Coordinated Wheat Improvement
  Program, which is largely responsible for the wheat revolution in
  India, has developed one of the most extensive and widely
  diversified wheat research programs in the world. Its success has
  generated confidence, a sense of purpose, and determination. The
  current agronomic research on wheat in India equals the best in
  the world. The breeding program is huge, diversified, and
  aggressive; already it has produced several varieties which
  surpass those originally introduced from Mexico in 1965. The
  first group of new Indian varieties, already in extensive
  commercial production, were derived from selections made in India
  from partially selected materials received from Mexico. A second
  group of varieties, now being multiplied, are selections from
  crosses made in India between Indian and Mexican varieties. The
  rapidity of creation and distribution of these new varieties has
  already diversified the type of resistance to diseases and
  therefore minimizes the menace of destructive disease epidemics
  if and when changes occur in parasitic races of the
  pathogens.</p>

  <p>Contrary to a widespread and erroneous
  opinion, the original dwarf wheat imported from Mexico definitely
  carried a wider spectrum of disease resistance than the local
  Indian types that they replaced. But the newer Indian varieties
  are even better in resistance and of a different genetic type
  than the original introductions. This greater diversity reduces
  the danger from disease epidemics but cannot completely eliminate
  the dangers of disease epidemics, as has become vividly evident
  from the unexpected and destructive epidemic of southern leaf
  blight of maize over vast areas of the U. S. A. during the summer
  of 1970. The only protection against such epidemics, in all
  countries, is through resistant varieties developed by an
  intelligent, persistent, and diversified breeding program, such
  as that being currently carried on in India, coupled with a broad
  disease-surveillance system and a sound plant pathology program
  to support the breeding program. From such a program a constant
  flow of new high-yielding disease-resistant varieties can be
  developed to checkmate any important changes in the pathogens.
  The Indian program is also developing competence in research on
  the biochemical, industrial, and nutritional properties of
  wheat.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most important contribution of
  all is that the methods and tactics used so successfully in
  making the production breakthrough in wheat, first in Mexico and
  now in India and Pakistan, can serve as a model for production
  programs with many other crops and in many other countries.</p>

  <p>West Pakistan has already used the wheat
  model to revolutionize its rice production. Although the Indian
  rice program has not yet achieved a nationwide breakthrough in
  production, rapid progress is now being made in several areas,
  and it seems probable that the area sown to the new seed and
  technology will be large enough to produce a strong impact on
  national production within another year. Varieties and new
  technology are also available for launching effective campaigns
  to increase the production of sorghum, millet, barley, soybeans,
  and cotton in many developing countries of Asia, Africa, and
  Latin America. What is still needed is the will and commitment of
  governments to support national production campaigns, both
  politically and financially, and the services of a few competent
  and dedicated agricultural scientists as leaders.</p>

  <p>The quality of scientific leadership is
  certainly a vital factor in the success of any production
  campaign. It is deplorable but true that many agricultural
  scientists in some advanced countries have renounced their
  allegiance to agriculture for reasons of expediency and presumed
  prestige. And some institutions have furnished them a curtain
  behind which to hide. Some educational and research institutions
  have even restricted the amount of basic research that can be
  done under the aegis of its agricultural departments, however
  basic these researches may be to progress in increasing and
  insuring food production. Let the individuals live with their own
  motivations; let them serve science and themselves if they wish.
  But the institutions have the moral obligation to serve
  agriculture and society also; and to discharge that obligation
  honorably, they must try to help educate scientists and
  scientific leaders whose primary motivation is to serve
  humanity.</p>

  <p>I want to reiterate emphatically that there
  now are available materials and techniques of great potential
  value for expanding the green revolution into additional fields
  of agriculture. But to convert these potential values into actual
  values requires scientific and organizational leadership. Where
  are those leaders? Where are the leaders who have the necessary
  scientific competence, the vision, the common sense, the social
  consciousness, the qualities of leadership, and the persistent
  determination to convert the potential benefactions into real
  benefactions for mankind in general and for the hungry in
  particular? There are not enough of them now; therefore we must
  try to identify and develop them in our educational systems and
  we must utilize them in our campaigns for food production. We
  need them and need them badly, for it is tragic to let potential
  values languish for want of leadership in capitalizing the
  potential. This is not theory; this is reality, as illustrated by
  the fact that the leadership has been the determining factor in
  the relative success of parallel but different crop production
  programs within the same country.</p>

  <p>But let no one think that we can relax our
  efforts in research. All successful action programs must be
  preceded and accompanied by research. It has been pointed out
  that the rapid change in wheat production in both India and
  Pakistan was in part made possible by two decades of research in
  Mexico. How did this come about?</p>

  <p>In 1943, several years before the
  establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of
  the <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html">United
  Nations</a>, a cooperative agricultural research and training
  program was launched in Mexico. This was a pioneer cooperative
  project between the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and the
  Rockefeller Foundation, initiated at the request of the Mexican
  government for assistance in increasing the production of maize,
  wheat, and beans.</p>

  <p>At that time Mexico was importing more than
  fifty percent of the wheat that it consumed, as well as a
  considerable percentage of its maize. Wheat yields were low and
  static, with a national average yield of 750 kilos per hectare,
  even though most of the wheat was grown on irrigated land. This
  situation was very similar to that in India and Pakistan before
  the recent advent of the green revolution. Mexican soils were
  impoverished and chemical fertilizer virtually unknown.</p>

  <p>Mexico's need was urgent, and so a simple
  research program was started to increase production. The
  philosophy of the Rockefeller Foundation was "to help Mexico to
  help itself" in solving its food production problems, and in the
  process work itself out of a job. I have had the privilege and
  good fortune to have been associated with the wheat program
  almost from the beginning, and have remained a part of it for the
  past twenty-six years. From the outset all factors limiting wheat
  production were studied; consequently, there were
  interdisciplinary researches between genetics and plant breeding,
  agronomy, soil fertility, plant pathology, and entomology. Cereal
  chemistry and biochemistry were added later.</p>

  <p>After preliminary work in 1943, plant
  breeders, soil scientists, plant pathologists, and entomologists
  working as a team, began a concentrated attack on the various
  aspects of wheat production in 1944.</p>

  <p>An in-service (intern) training component
  was added to the research program to train a new generation of
  Mexican scientists while they were assisting with the development
  of the research program. Provision was also made for fellowships
  to enable the most promising of these young scientists to study
  abroad for advanced degrees, hopefully in preparation for
  positions of leadership in Mexican agriculture.</p>

  <p>Research from the outset was
  production-oriented and restricted to that which was relevant to
  increasing wheat production. Researches in pursuit of irrelevant
  academic butterflies were discouraged, both because of the acute
  shortage of scientific manpower and because of the need to have
  data and materials available as soon as possible for use in the
  production program.</p>

  <p>To accelerate progress in varying
  development, two generations of all segregating materials were
  grown each year. One generation was sown close to sea level in
  Sonora at twenty-eight degrees north latitude in the fall when
  the days were progressively shorter; the second was sown near
  Toluca, at eighteen degrees latitude and 2,500 meters above sea
  level during the summer when days were progressively longer.
  Through the use of this technique, we developed high-yielding,
  day-length-insensitive varieties with a wide range of ecologic
  adoption and a broad spectrum of disease resistance - a new
  combination of uniquely valuable characters in wheat
  varieties.</p>

  <p>These characters were valuable in
  increasing wheat production in Mexico and neighboring countries,
  but were to prove even more valuable twenty years later when the
  Mexican varieties were introduced into Pakistan and India.
  Without this combination of characters the successful
  transplantation of the Mexican varieties into Pakistan and India
  would have been impossible; and the advent of the green
  revolution would almost certainly have been delayed many
  years.</p>

  <p>In Mexico, as soon as significant
  improvements were made by research, whether in varieties,
  fertilizer recommendations, or cultural practices, they were
  taken to farms and incorporated into the production programs. We
  never waited for perfection in varieties or methods but used the
  best available each year and modified them as further improvement
  came to hand. This simple principle is too often disregarded by
  scientific perfectionists who spend a lifetime searching for the
  unattainable in biological perfection, and consequently during a
  lifetime of frustration contribute nothing to increasing food
  production.</p>

  <p>Farm demonstrations of new varieties and
  technology were made by the research scientists who had developed
  them. Indeed, the revolution in wheat production in Mexico was
  accomplished before the extension service came into being. This
  forced the research scientists themselves to consider the
  obstacles to production that confronted the farmers. The same
  philosophy and tactic were used effectively to bring researchers
  in contact with the farmers' problems in the early years of the
  wheat improvement programs in India and West Pakistan. Later,
  however, the extension services were brought into the production
  programs in both countries.</p>

  <p>Mexican wheat yields began to climb by 1948
  and have continued their upward trend to the present time. During
  the past twenty-six years, the national average has risen from
  750 kilos per hectare to only slightly less than 3,000 kilos
  during the past harvest, approximately a fourfold increase.
  During the same period, total production has increased sevenfold.
  Mexico became self-sufficient in wheat production for the first
  time in 1956 and has remained self-sufficient since. This "quiet
  revolution" in wheat production in Mexico became the progenitor
  of the green revolution in India and Pakistan a decade later.</p>

  <p>As the use of fertilizer increased and
  yields climbed to four and a half thousand kilos per hectare,
  lodging (falling over of the plant) began to limit further
  increases in yields. A search was therefore made among wheat from
  different areas of the world to locate a suitable source of
  genetic dwarfness to overcome this barrier. Norin 10, an
  extremely dwarf wheat from Japan, proved to be a suitable source.
  Through a series of crosses and re-crosses begun in 1954,
  dwarfness was incorporated into the superior, new-combination
  Mexican types, finally giving rise to a group of so-called dwarf
  Mexican wheat varieties. With this new development, the potential
  yield of the new varieties, under ideal conditions, increased
  from the previous high of four and a half thousand kilos per
  hectare to nine thousand kilos per hectare. The dwarf Mexican
  wheat were first distributed in Mexico in 1961, and the best
  farmers began to harvest five, six, seven, and even eight tons
  more per hectare, and within seven years the national average
  yields doubled. It was these same dwarf Mexican wheat from the
  quiet revolution that served as catalysts to trigger off the
  green revolution in India and Pakistan.</p>

  <p>From the outset the Mexican Agricultural
  Program was watched with interest by many other countries. As
  progress became evident, the Rockefeller Foundation was besieged
  by requests from many countries for assistance in agricultural
  improvement programs. The Cooperative Mexican Agricultural
  Program had become a model. The Cooperative Colombian
  Agricultural Program, devoted largely to maize, wheat, potatoes,
  forage, and livestock, was established in 1950. Similarly, the
  Cooperative Chilean Agricultural Program was established in 1955
  to work on wheat and forage. The Cooperative Indian Agricultural
  Program was established in 1956 to improve maize, sorghum, and
  millet production and to assist in the development of
  postgraduate agricultural education. Each of these programs
  subsequently played an important role in improving agricultural
  production and education in different parts of the world.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, back in Mexico, the program that
  had originally been confined to maize, wheat, and beans, and soon
  thereafter potatoes, was expanded to include many other crops.
  Larger numbers of young Mexican scientists were added to the
  research and training programs. Progress in research was
  generally good, and the training program also bore fruit. Between
  the years 1943-1963, a total of 550 interns participated in the
  overall agricultural research and training programs, of whom
  about 200 received a Master of Science degree and about thirty
  the Doctor of Philosophy degree while on fellowships for study
  abroad. With this corps of trained scientists a new National
  Institute of Agricultural Research was born in 1961. The
  Rockefeller Foundation "had worked itself out of a job", which
  was one of its original objectives.</p>

  <p>The Mexican experience indicated that one
  of the greatest obstacles to the improvement of agriculture in
  the developing countries is the scarcity of trained people. This
  experience indicated clearly that training is a slow process.
  Where no corps of trained scientists exists, as was the case in
  Mexico twenty-seven years ago and remains the case in many
  countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America today, it requires
  eighteen to twenty-five years to develop enough competent
  research scientists and educators to meet a country's needs. So
  great is the urgency of the food shortage in many underdeveloped
  and emerging countries that there is not enough time to develop
  an adequate corps of scientists before attacking food production
  problems. A shortcut and organizational change had to be invented
  to meet the needs. And so was born the first truly international
  research and training institute, the International Rice Research
  Institute (IRRI) at Los Ba&ntilde;os, the Philippines, in 1960, to
  work exclusively on the regionally all-important but
  too-long-neglected rice crop. The institute was jointly financed
  by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations in collaboration with the
  government of the Philippines.</p>

  <p>The research activities on wheat, maize,
  and potatoes in Mexico were informally internationalized in 1959
  and organized as a second international center in 1963. This
  International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT) is
  supported also by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations in
  collaboration with the government of Mexico. More recently,
  additional financial support has been provided by the U.S. Agency
  for International Development (U.S.AID), United Nations
  Development Program (UNDP), and the Inter-American Development
  Bank (BID).</p>

  <p>A third center, the International Center of
  Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Colombia, and the International
  Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria, the most
  recent, have been established to study problems and stimulate
  production of certain tropical crops and animal species, as well
  as to help train scientific specialists. CIAT is financed by the
  Ford, Rockefeller, and W. K. Kellogg Foundations in cooperation
  with the government of Colombia. The Ford and Rockefeller
  Foundations and the Canadian International Development Agency
  (CIDA) are supporting IITA in collaboration with the government
  of Nigeria.</p>

  <p>These four international institutes
  represent a significant but modest start toward the construction
  of a worldwide network of international, national, and local
  research and training centers. This network will help solve
  problems and disseminate the benefits of science to all mankind
  in the shortest possible time and at minimum cost.</p>

  <p>The impact of such an integrated approach
  is already evident in the green revolution. New varieties and the
  new technologies that make them highly productive have been the
  thrust behind the green revolution. In the Philippines, Ceylon,
  Malaysia, and West Pakistan, it was IR8 rice, developed at the
  International Rice Research Institute. The dwarf Mexican wheat,
  partly produced by CIMMYT, have provided the thrust in India and
  Pakistan, and this is now spreading to Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran,
  Morocco, and Tunisia. Contributing equally, or perhaps even more,
  to the evolution of the green revolution was the talented
  supporting leadership that has been provided by the centers to
  the national programs through temporary assignments of mature
  scientists skilled in organizing crop production programs to
  assist in the development of the national production
  campaigns.</p>

  <p>The international centers were developed to
  supplement national agricultural research, production, and
  training programs, not to replace them. The centers are but one
  link in the worldwide network of organizations attacking basic
  food-crop production problems on a worldwide, regional, national,
  and local level. The backbone of this network is now and must
  continue to be the national programs. These must be given greater
  financial support and strengthened staff-wise to meet the
  challenge of rapidly expanding food needs for the future.</p>

  <p>The international centers, however, are in
  a unique position to assist the national programs. They are
  independent, nonpolitical international organizations, which,
  although originally funded by private foundations, now receive
  support from many diverse sources. Their scientific staffs are
  also international and comprise outstanding scientists
  representing the various scientific disciplines affecting crop
  production. Included on their staffs are a number of crop
  production experts who have the scientific competence and broad
  experience to assist national agencies in organizing and
  launching crop production programs.</p>

  <p>The centers collaborate not only with the
  national agencies from many different countries but also with
  other international organizations such as the Food and
  Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the United
  Nations Development Program (UNDP), and international development
  banks. Each year the centers have been collaborating with an
  increasing number of countries of all political spectra.</p>

  <p>I am convinced that the international
  agricultural research institutes are developing a bond of
  understanding among nations, based upon the common need for
  increasing food production. We must all strive to strengthen this
  bond in the spirit of Alfred Nobel "to promote brotherhood among
  the nations".</p>

  <p>The international centers are uniquely
  equipped to do fundamental, longtime researches of worldwide
  importance. For example, the opportunity for plant breeders,
  pathologists, and entomologists to operate on a worldwide basis
  permits them to develop well-conceived, diverse gene pools of the
  important crop species. The final crop varieties are not
  currently generally selected at the centers but sent to
  collaborators in national programs in many parts of the world,
  who in turn make the selections that best suit their needs; and
  many eventually become commercial varieties. Similarly, the
  centers prepare a series of international crop yield tests, which
  include representatives of the best commercial varieties from the
  world and a few of the most promising experimental lines from
  collaborators. These are sent to collaborators in thirty-five
  countries for growing at eighty locations. The data from
  collaborators are returned to CIMMYT for summarizing and for
  subsequent distribution to scientists in all parts of the world.
  The data obtained on yield, adaption, disease, and insect
  resistance in one year in such tests are often more meaningful
  and valuable to scientists engaged in crop research and
  production programs than data obtained by independent testing at
  one location for a period of ten or fifteen years.</p>

  <p>The international centers also are in a
  unique position to contribute to practical or internship type of
  training in all of the scientific disciplines affecting crop
  production. This type of training is particularly valuable for
  young scientists from the developing countries because it
  prepares them for initiating research work upon return to their
  native country and will also be of value if they subsequently
  continue their education at the graduate level.</p>

  <p>In summarizing the accomplishments of the
  green revolution during the past three years, I wish to restate
  that the increase in cereal production, rice, maize, and wheat,
  especially in wheat, has been spectacular and highly significant
  to the welfare of millions of human beings. It is still modest in
  terms of total needs. Recalling that fifty percent of the present
  world population is undernourished and that an even larger
  percentage, perhaps sixty-five percent, is malnourished, no room
  is left for complacency. It is not enough to prevent the
  currently bad situation from getting worse as population
  increases. Our aim must be to produce enough food to eradicate
  all present hunger while at the same time striving to correct
  malnutrition. To eliminate hunger now in the developing nations,
  we would need to expand world cereal production by thirty
  percent. If it were, however, as simple as increasing the total
  world production by thirty percent, regardless of where the
  production is to be expanded, it could be accomplished rather
  rapidly by expanding it in the United States, Canada, Australia,
  Argentina, and Russia. But this would not necessarily solve the
  hunger problem of the developing world because their weak
  economies will not permit them to expand their food imports by
  thirty percent. Worse still, even if present production could be
  expanded rapidly by thirty percent in the developing countries -
  which I believe is possible based on recent progress of the green
  revolution - so as theoretically to eliminate hunger, the hunger
  problem as it now exists still would not be solved. There remains
  the unsolved social-economic problem of finding effective ways to
  distribute the needed additional food to the vast underprivileged
  masses who have little or no purchasing power. This is still the
  great unsolved problem with which the economists, sociologists,
  and political leaders must now come to grips.</p>

  <p>I am convinced that if all policymakers
  would take sufficient interest in population control and in
  aggressively employing and exploiting agricultural development as
  a potent instrument of agrarian prosperity and economic
  advancement, many of the social ills of the present day could
  soon become problems of the past. The tropics and subtropics have
  abundant sunlight and other great biological assets, and it will
  be criminal to delay further the conversion of these assets into
  wealth meaningful to the poor and hungry.</p>

  <p>Some critics have said that the green
  revolution has created more problems than it has solved. This I
  cannot accept, for I believe it is far better for mankind to be
  struggling with new problems caused by abundance rather than with
  the old problem of famine. Certainly, loyalty to the status quo
  in food production - when being pressured by population growth -
  cannot break the chains that have bound the peasant to poverty
  and hunger. One must ask: Is it just to criticize the green
  revolution, with its recognized accomplishments, for failure to
  correct all the social-economic ills of the world that have
  accumulated from the days of Adam and Eve up to the present?
  Change we must, or we will perish as a species, just as did the
  dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous.</p>

  <p>The green revolution is a change in the
  right direction, but it has not transformed the world into
  Utopia. None are more keenly aware of its limitations than those
  who started it and fought for its success. But there has been
  solid accomplishment, as I have already shown by concrete
  examples. I have also tried to indicate the various opportunities
  for capitalizing more fully on the new materials that were
  produced and the new methods that were devised. And, above all, I
  cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress
  depends on intelligent, integrated, and persistent effort by
  government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators,
  and communication agencies, including the press, radio, and
  television.</p>

  <p>But progress is continuous, and we can and
  must make continuous progress. Better varieties of wheat and
  other cereals with not only higher yield potential but also with
  higher content of protein are already in the process of
  creation.</p>

  <p>We need also to explore more fully the
  feasibility of producing new manmade cereal species with greater
  production potential and better nutritional quality than those
  now in existence. Triticale, a man-made species, derived from a
  cross between wheat and rye, now shows promise of becoming such a
  crop.</p>

  <p>During the past six years, the
  International Corn and Wheat Center in Mexico, cooperating with
  the University of Manitoba, has developed a large breeding
  program to improve Triticale. Within the past three years we have
  developed highly fertile lines, and the results up to the present
  indicate the possibility of combining the desirable
  characteristics now present in different lines into a single
  line, thereby creating a new kind of cereal that is superior to
  wheat in productivity and nutritional quality.</p>

  <p>The rapid progress achieved in Triticale
  improvement suggests the desirability of initiating basic studies
  to determine the feasibility of developing other cereal species
  from wide crosses between different existing species or their
  wild relatives. Recent improvements in individual cell, tissue
  and embryo-culture techniques, in the development of culture
  media with additions of hormones and nutrients that foster cell
  and tissue differentiations, in achieving hybridization between
  somatic cells, and in the methods of inducing polyploidy and
  mutations, offer many fascinating possibilities of achieving
  crosses between species that were formerly uncrossable. Even the
  possibility of using protoplasmic and cell hybridization,
  followed by manipulation to promote cell differentiation for
  plant improvement, appears to be nearer.</p>

  <p>I propose therefore that a bold program of
  wide crosses be initiated to improve both cereals and legumes
  (pulses). It should include attempts to make numerous
  intergeneric crosses among cereals, employing all of the modern
  techniques to consummate fertilization, and propagate the
  hybrids. If a series of new combinations can be made and doubled,
  as, for example, between maize and sorghum, wheat and barley, or
  wheat and rice, it would open the door to the possibilities for
  vast subsequent improvement by conventional methods.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, all cereals are deficient in
  one or more of the essential amino acids, especially lysine,
  which is essential for normal body growth and for the maintenance
  of health. Protein malnutrition is widespread, especially among
  children, and many of its victims die or are maimed both
  physically and mentally for life.</p>

  <p>Although food supplements can alleviate
  this situation, the development of high-yielding varieties of
  cereal grains that have high levels of protein and better amino
  acid balance would be the ideal solution, since this would not
  involve added expense or special educational efforts, and there
  are good possibilities of producing them. The now famous opaque-2
  gene in maize doubles the production of the amino acid lysine
  which is essential to growth and health in man and many other
  animals. Similarly, an Ethiopian strain of barley, and some lines
  of Triticale have genes for extraordinary production of essential
  nutrient materials. Plant breeders are trying to combine such
  genes with the best genes now available for productivity and
  other desirable characters, thus increasing not only the tonnage
  of food, but also its essential nutrient quality. As we are now
  striving to emancipate ourselves from dependence on artificial
  food supplements, I have a dream that we can likewise emancipate
  ourselves to some extent from our dependence on artificial
  nutrients for the cereal plants themselves, thus lightening the
  financial burden that now oppresses the small farmer and
  handicaps his efforts to participate fully in the new
  technologies.</p>

  <p>In my dream I see green, vigorous,
  high-yielding fields of wheat, rice, maize, sorghums, and
  millets, which are obtaining, free of expense, 100 kilograms of
  nitrogen per hectare from nodule-forming, nitrogen-fixing
  bacteria. These mutant strains of <i>Rhizobium cerealis</i> were
  developed in 1990 by a massive mutation breeding program with
  strains of <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. obtained from roots of legumes
  and other nodule-bearing plants. This scientific discovery has
  revolutionized agricultural production for the hundreds of
  millions of humble farmers throughout the world; for they now
  receive much of the needed fertilizer for their crops directly
  from these little wondrous microbes that are taking nitrogen from
  the air and fixing it without cost in the roots of cereals, from
  which it is transformed into grain...</p>

  <p>Then I wake up and become disillusioned to
  find that mutation genetics programs are still engaged mostly in
  such minutiae as putting beards on wheat plants and taking off
  the hairs.</p>

  <p>If we are to capitalize fully on the past
  biological accomplishments and realize the prospective
  accomplishments, as exemplified in my dream, there must be far
  greater investments in research and education in the future than
  in the past.</p>

  <p>Few investments, if any, can match the
  economic and social returns from the wheat research in Mexico.
  The investment from 1943 to 1964 was estimated to have yielded an
  annual return of 750 percent. This study was made prior to the
  full impact of dwarf wheat on the national production. If the
  benefits were calculated now, with the inclusion of the returns
  from the increased wheat production in Pakistan, India, and other
  Asian and African countries, they would be fantastically
  high.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, vast sums are now being spent
  in all countries, developed and developing, on armaments and new
  nuclear and other lethal weapons, while pitifully small sums are
  being spent on agricultural research and education designed to
  sustain and humanize life rather than to degrade and destroy
  it.</p>

  <p>The green revolution has won a temporary
  success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given
  man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can
  provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three
  decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must
  also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution
  will be ephemeral only.</p>

  <p>Most people still fail to comprehend the
  magnitude and menace of the "Population Monster". In the
  beginning there were but two, Adam and Eve. When they appeared on
  this earth is still questionable. By the time of Christ, world
  population had probably reached 250 million. But between then and
  now, population has grown to 3.5 billion. Growth has been
  especially fast since the advent of modern medicine. If it
  continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two
  percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by
  the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock,
  about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population.
  The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for
  each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively,
  unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this
  impending doom. The ticktock of the clock will continually grow
  louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?</p>

  <p>Malthus signaled the danger a century and a
  half ago. But he emphasized principally the danger that
  population would increase faster than food supplies. In his time
  he could not foresee the tremendous increase in man's food
  production potential. Nor could he have foreseen the disturbing
  and destructive physical and mental consequences of the grotesque
  concentration of human beings into the poisoned and clangorous
  environment of pathologically hypertrophied megalopoles. Can
  human beings endure the strain? Abnormal stresses and strains
  tend to accentuate man's animal instincts and provoke irrational
  and socially disruptive behavior among the less stable
  individuals in the maddening crowd.</p>

  <p>We must recognize the fact that adequate
  food is only the first requisite for life. For a decent and
  humane life we must also provide an opportunity for good
  education, remunerative employment, comfortable housing, good
  clothing, and effective and compassionate medical care. Unless we
  can do this, man may degenerate sooner from environmental
  diseases than from hunger.</p>

  <p>And yet, I am optimistic for the future of
  mankind, for in all biological populations there are innate
  devices to adjust population growth to the carrying capacity of
  the environment. Undoubtedly, some such device exists in man,
  presumably <i>Homo sapiens</i>, but so far it has not asserted
  itself to bring into balance population growth and the carrying
  capacity of the environment on a worldwide scale. It would be
  disastrous for the species to continue to increase our human
  numbers madly until such innate devices take over. It is a test
  of the validity of <i>sapiens</i> as a species epithet.</p>

  <p>Since man is potentially a rational being,
  however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will
  recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of
  irresponsible population growth and will adjust the growth rate
  to levels which will permit a decent standard of living for all
  mankind. If man is wise enough to make this decision and if all
  nations abandon their idolatry of Ares, Mars, and Thor, then
  Mankind itself should be the recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize
  which is "to be awarded to the person who has done most to
  promote brotherhood among the nations".</p>

  <p>Then, by developing and applying the
  scientific and technological skills of the twentieth century for
  "the well-being of mankind throughout the world", he may still
  see Isaiah's prophesies come true: "... And the desert shall
  rejoice, and blossom as the rose... And the parched ground shall
  become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water..."<a href=

  <p>And may these words come true!</p>
