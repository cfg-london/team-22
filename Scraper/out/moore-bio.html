  <h1>Stanford Moore - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="moore.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Stanford
  Moore</b> was born in 1913 in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in
  Nashville, Tennessee, where his father was a member of the
  faculty of the School of Law of Vanderbilt
  University. His developmental years were in a home
  environment which made the pursuit of knowledge an eagerly
  adopted undertaking. He had the opportunity to attend a high
  school administered by the George Peabody College for Teachers in
  Nashville. A skilled teacher of science, R.O. Beauchamp, kindled
  an interest in chemistry. Moore entered Vanderbilt University
  undecided between a career in chemistry or aeronautical
  engineering. The courses which he took in the engineering school
  presaged a concern for instrumentation. But a gifted professor of
  organic chemistry, Arthur Ingersoll, succeeded in presenting the
  study of molecular architecture as an even more appealing
  discipline. Moore graduated from Vanderbilt (B.A. 1935, <i>summa
  cum laude</i> ) with a major in chemistry. The faculty
  recommended him for a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation
  Fellowship which took him to the University of Wisconsin where he received his
  Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  His thesis research was in biochemistry in the laboratory of Karl
  Paul Link. The first lessons that the young graduate student
  received from the skilled hands of his professor were in the
  microanalytical methods of Pregl for the determination of C, H,
  and N; Link had recently returned from Europe where he had
  studied in the laboratory of Fritz Pregl in Graz. This training
  from Link in microchemistry was especially valuable for a student
  who was later to be concerned with the quantitative analysis of
  proteins. Moore's thesis was on the characterization of
  carbohydrates as benzimidazole derivatives. The experience of
  bringing that work from the bench to the printed page under
  Link's guidance marked Moore's transition from a student to a
  productive scholar.<br>
  <br>
  Karl Paul Link was a friend of Max Bergmann, who had recently
  arrived from Germany to lead a laboratory at the Rockefeller
  Institute for Medical Research in New York. Through that
  friendship, Moore was encouraged to join the Bergmann Laboratory
  in 1939, which was an internationally renowned center of research
  on the chemistry of proteins and enzymes. During <a href=
  "../1902/index.html">Emil Fischer's</a> last years Max Bergmann
  had been his senior research associate, and Bergmann had
  attracted to Rockefeller a group of versatile chemists who
  maintained a tradition of innovative research and high
  productivity. After nearly three valuable years in such company,
  which included William H. Stein, the advent of World War II drew
  Moore out of the laboratory to serve as a junior administrative
  officer in Washington for academic and industrial chemical
  projects administered by the Office of Scientific Research
  Development. At the close of the war, he was on duty with the
  Operational Research Section attached to the Headquarters of the
  United States Armed Forces in the Pacific Ocean Area,
  Hawaii.<br>
  <br>
  During the war years, the situation at the Rockefeller Institute
  had changed. The untimely death of Max Bergmann in 1944 had
  brought to a close the major chapter in biochemistry which the
  contributions of his laboratory comprised. Moore's decision to
  return to Rockefeller was influenced by Herbert Gasser, then the
  Director of The Rockefeller Institute, who offered to give modest
  space to Moore and Stein to pursue the theme of research which
  they had begun with Bergmann or any new lines of investigation
  that appealed to them. Thus began the collaboration that led to
  the development of quantitative chromatographic methods for amino
  acid analysis, their automation, and the utilization of such
  techniques, in cooperation with younger associates, in the
  researches in protein chemistry summarized in the Nobel Lecture
  by Moore and Stein.<br>
  <br>
  The investigations were conducted in an atmosphere at Rockefeller
  that encouraged interdepartmental cooperation and international
  consultation that would expedite research. Interludes included
  Moore's tenure of the Francqui Chair at the University of
  Brussels in 1950, where, at the generous invitation of E.J.
  Bigwood, a laboratory of amino acid analysis was organized in the
  School of Medicine. Moore had the opportunity to round out the
  year in Europe with six months in England at the University of
  Cambridge where he shared part of a laboratory with Frederick
  Sanger during the time of the pioneering studies on insulin. In
  1968, Moore was a Visiting Professor of Health Sciences at the
  Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.<br>
