  <h1>William B. Shockley - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="shockley.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>William Shockley</b> was born
  in London, England, on 13th February, 1910, the son of William
  Hillman Shockley, a mining engineer born in Massachusetts and his
  wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradford) who had also been engaged
  in mining, being a deputy mineral surveyor in Nevada.<br>
  <br>
  The family returned to the United States in 1913 and William Jr.
  was educated in California, taking his B.Sc. degree at the
  California
  Institute of Technology in 1932. He studied at Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology under Professor J.C. Slater and obtained his Ph.D.
  in 1936, submitting a thesis on the energy band structure of
  sodium chloride. The same year he joined Bell Telephone
  Laboratories, working in the group headed by Dr. C.J. Davisson
  and remained there (with brief absences for war service, etc.)
  until 1955. He resigned his post of Director of the Transistor
  Physics Department to become Director of the Shockley
  Semi-conductor Laboratory of Beckman Instruments, Inc., at
  Mountain View, California, for research development and
  production of new transistor and other semiconductor devices. In
  1963 he was named first Alexander M. Poniatoff Professor of
  Engineering Science at Stanford University, where he will act as
  professor-at-large in engineering and applied sciences.<br>
  <br>
  During World War II he was Research Director of the
  Anti-submarine Warfare Operations Research Group and he
  afterwards served as Expert Consultant in the offce of the
  Secretary for War.<br>
  <br>
  He held two visiting lectureships: in 1946 at Princeton
  University, and in 1954 at the California Institute of
  Technology. For one year (1954-1955) he was Deputy Director and
  Research Director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the
  Defence Department.<br>
  <br>
  Shockley's research has been centred on energy bands in solids;
  order and disorder in alloys; theory of vacuum tubes;
  self-diffusion of copper; theories of dislocations and grain
  boundaries; experiment and theory on ferromagnetic domains;
  experiments on photoelectrons in silver chloride; various topics
  in transistor physics and operations research on the statistics
  of salary and individual productivity in research
  laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  His work has been rewarded with many honours. He received the
  Medal for Merit in 1946, for his work with the War Department;
  the Morris Leibmann Memorial Prize of the Institute of Radio
  Engineers in 1952; the following year, the Oliver E. Buckley
  Solid State Physics Prize of the American Physical Society, and a
  year later the Cyrus B. Comstock Award of the National Academy of
  Sciences. The crowning honour - the Nobel Prize for Physics -
  was bestowed on him in 1956, jointly with his two former
  colleagues at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, John Bardeen and
  Walter H. Brattain.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963 he was selected as recipient of the Holley Medal of the
  American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Shockley has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Panel
  of the U.S. Army since 1951 and he has served on the Air Force
  Scientific Advisory Board since 1958. In 1962 he was appointed to
  the President's Scientific Advisory Committee. He has received
  honorary science doctorates from the University of
  Pennsylvania, Rutgers University and Gustavus Adolphus Colleges (Minn.).<br>
  <br>
  In addition to numerous articles in scientific and technical
  journals, Shockley has written <i>Electrons and Holes in
  Semiconductors</i> (1950) and has edited <i>Imperfections of
  Nearly Perfect Crystals</i> (1952). He has taken out more than 50
  U.S. patents for his inventions.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Shockley has been married twice, and has three children by
  his first marriage to Jean (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bailey). This union
  ended in divorce; his second wife is Emmy Lanning.</p>
