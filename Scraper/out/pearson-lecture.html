  <h2><br>The Four Faces of Peace</h2>

  <p>I cannot think of anything more difficult
  than to say something which would be worthy of this impressive
  and, for me, memorable occasion, and of the ideals and purposes
  which inspired the Nobel Peace Award.</p>

  <p>I would like, at the very beginning, to pay
  my tribute to the memory of a great man, Alfred Nobel, who made
  this award - and others - possible. Seldom in history has any man
  combined so well the qualities of idealism and realism as he did
  - those of the poet and the practical man of business. We know
  all about his dynamite and his explosives and how he lamented the
  use to which they would be put. Yet ideas can also be explosive,
  and he had many that were good and were deeply concerned with
  peace and war. He liked to write and talk about the "rights of
  man and universal brotherhood", and no one worked harder or more
  unselfishly to realize those ideals, still so far away.</p>

  <p>At this moment I am particularly conscious
  of the wisdom of one of his observations that "long speeches will
  not ensure peace".</p>

  <p>May I also express my great pleasure at
  being again in Norway, a country to which my own is so closely
  bound by ties of friendship, freedom, and understanding. I have
  worked in a very close and cordial way with Norwegian
  representatives at many international meetings, and the pleasure
  I felt at those associations was equaled only by the profit I
  always secured from them.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I may be pardoned for putting any
  words I may have to say about peace within the framework of my
  own personal experience. During my lifetime greater and more
  spectacular progress has been made in the physical sciences than
  in many centuries that preceded it. As a result, the man who
  lived in 1507 would have felt more at home in 1907 than one who
  died fifty years ago if he came back to life today.</p>

  <p>A great gulf, however, has been opened
  between man's material advance and his social and moral progress,
  a gulf in which he may one day be lost if it is not closed or
  narrowed. Man has conquered outer space. He has not conquered
  himself. If he had, we would not be worrying today as much as we
  are about the destructive possibilities of scientific
  achievements. In short, moral sense and physical power are out of
  proportion.</p>

  <p>This imbalance may well be the basic source
  of the conflicts of our time, of the dislocations of this
  "terrible twentieth century".</p>

  <p>All of my adult life has been spent amidst
  these dislocations, in an atmosphere of international conflict,
  of fear and insecurity. As a soldier, I survived World War I when
  most of my comrades did not. As a civilian during the Second War,
  I was exposed to danger in circumstances which removed any
  distinction between the man in and the man out of uniform. And I
  have lived since - as you have - in a period of cold war, during
  which we have ensured by our achievements in the science and
  technology of destruction that a third act in this tragedy of war
  will result in the peace of extinction.</p>

  <p>I have, therefore, had compelling reason,
  and some opportunity, to think about peace, to ponder over our
  failures since 1914 to establish it, and to shudder at the
  possible consequences if we continue to fail.</p>

  <p>I remember particularly one poignant
  illustration of the futility and tragedy of war. It was
  concerned, not with the blood and sacrifice of battles from
  1914-1918, but with civilian destruction in London in 1941 during
  its ordeal by bombing.</p>

  <p>It was a quiet Sunday morning after a
  shattering night of fire and death. I was walking past the
  smoking ruins of houses that had been bombed and burned during
  the night. The day before they had been a neat row of humble, red
  brick, workmen's dwellings. They were now rubble except for the
  front wall of one building, which may have been some kind of
  community club, and on which there was a plaque that read "Sacred
  to the memory of the men of Alice Street who died for peace
  during the Great War, 1914-1918". The children and grandchildren
  of those men of Alice Street had now in their turn been
  sacrificed in the Greater War, 1939-1945. For peace? There are
  times when it does not seem so.</p>

  <p>True there has been more talk of peace
  since 1945 than, I should think, at any other time in history. At
  least we hear more and read more about it because man's words,
  for good or ill, can now so easily reach the millions.</p>

  <p>Very often the words are good and even
  inspiring, the embodiment of our hopes and our prayers for peace.
  But while we all pray for peace, we do not always, as free
  citizens, support the policies that make for peace or reject
  those which do not. We want our own kind of peace, brought about
  in our own way.</p>

  <p>The choice, however, is as clear now for
  nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction.
  The life of states cannot, any more than the life of individuals,
  be conditioned by the force and the will of a unit, however
  powerful, but by the consensus of a group, which must one day
  include all states. Today the predatory state, or the predatory
  group of states, with power of total destruction, is no more to
  be tolerated than the predatory individual.</p>

  <p>Our problem, then, so easy to state, so
  hard to solve, is how to bring about a creative peace and a
  security which will have a strong foundation. There have been
  thousands of volumes written by the greatest thinkers of the ages
  on this subject; so you will not expect too much from me in a few
  sketchy and limited observations. I cannot, I fear, provide you,
  in the words of Alfred Nobel, with "some lofty thoughts to lift
  us to the spheres".</p>

  <p>My aim this evening is a more modest one. I
  wish to look at the problem in four of its aspects - my "four
  faces of peace". There is peace and prosperity or trade, peace
  and power, peace and policy or diplomacy, peace and people.</p>

            <p><b>Peace and Prosperity</b></p>

  <p>One face of peace is reflected in the
  prosperity of nations. This is a subject on which thought has
  changed greatly within the memories of most of us and is now, I
  submit, in process of rapid further change.</p>

  <p>Not so long ago prominence was always given
  to economic factors as causes of war. That was at a time when
  people sought more assiduously than we now do for rational
  causation in human behavior. To the philosophers of the
  nineteenth century it seemed that there must be a motive of real
  self-interest, of personal gain, that led nations into conflict.
  To some extent there was. But in this century we have at least
  learned to understand more fully the complexity of motives that
  impel us both as individuals and as nations. We would be unwise
  to take any credit for that. The cynic might well remark that
  never has irrationality been so visible as in our times, and
  especially in relation to war.</p>

  <p>We know now that in modern warfare, fought
  on any considerable scale, there can be no possible economic gain
  for any side. Win or lose, there is nothing but waste and
  destruction. Whatever it is that leads men to fight and suffer,
  to face mutilation and death, the motive is not now self-interest
  in any material sense.</p>

  <p>If, however, we no longer stress so much
  economic factors as the direct cause of war, that does not lessen
  their importance in the maintenance of a creative and enduring
  peace. Men may not now go to war for trade, but lack of trade may
  help to breed the conditions in which men do go to war. The
  connection is not simple. Rich nations are not necessarily more
  peace-loving than poorer nations. You do not have to have poverty
  and economic instability; people do not have to be fearful about
  their crops or their jobs in order to create the fears and
  frustrations and tensions through which wars are made. But
  poverty and distress - especially with the awakening of the
  submerged millions of Asia and Africa - make the risks of war
  greater.</p>

  <p>It is already difficult to realize that a
  mere twenty years ago poverty was taken almost for granted over
  most of the earth's surface. There were always, of course, a few
  visionaries, but before 1939 there was little practical
  consideration given to the possibility of raising the living
  standards of Asia and Africa in the way that we now regard as
  indispensable. Perhaps only in North America every man feels
  entitled to a motor car, but in Asia hundreds of millions of
  people do now expect to eat and be free. They no longer will
  accept colonialism, destitution, and distress as preordained.
  That may be the most significant of all the revolutionary changes
  in the international social fabric of our times.</p>

  <p>Until the last great war, a general
  expectation of material improvement was an idea peculiar to
  Western man. Now war and its aftermath have made economic and
  social progress a political imperative in every quarter of the
  globe. If we ignore this, there will be no peace. There has been
  a widening of horizons to which in the West we have been perhaps
  too insensitive. Yet it is as important as the extension of our
  vision into outer space.</p>

  <p>Today continuing poverty and distress are a
  deeper and more important cause of international tensions, of the
  conditions that can produce war, than previously. On the other
  hand, if the new and constructive forces which are at work among
  areas and people, stagnant and subdued only a few years ago, can
  be directed along the channels of cooperation and peaceful
  progress, it should strengthen mankind's resistance to fear, to
  irrational impulse, to resentment, to war.</p>

  <p>Arnold Toynbee<a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> voiced this hope and this ideal when he
  said: "The twentieth century will be chiefly remembered by future
  generations not as an era of political conflicts or technical
  inventions, but as an age in which human society dared to think
  of the welfare of the whole human race as a practical
  objective."</p>

  <p>I hope he was not too optimistic.</p>

  <p>It is against this background that we
  should, I suggest, reassess our attitude to some ideas about
  which we have of late been too indifferent. It has been
  fashionable to look on many of our nineteenth-century economic
  thinkers as shallow materialists. We have, for instance, made
  light of the moral fervor and high political purpose that lay
  behind such an idea as free trade. Yet the ideals to which
  Richard Cobden<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a> gave the most
  articulate expression, at least in the English-speaking world,
  were not ideals about commerce alone. They visualized a free and
  friendly society of nations, for whom free trade was at once a
  result and a cause of good relations. It is a bitter commentary
  on our twentieth-century society that the very phrase "free
  trade" has come to have a hopelessly old-fashioned and
  unrealistic ring to it.</p>

  <p>We all recognize that in the depressed and
  disturbed economic conditions between the wars an upsurge of
  economic nationalism was inevitable. But why should so many be so
  ready to go on thinking in the same terms when the conditions
  that produced them are now different?</p>

  <p>We are too inclined to assume that man's
  today is more like his yesterday than like the day before
  yesterday. In some respects, I submit, the economics of our day
  are less different from those of nineteenth-century expansionism
  than they are from the abnormal period of depression and
  restrictionism that, just because it is nearer in time; still
  dominates much of our economic thinking.</p>

  <p>The scientific and technological
  discoveries that have made war so infinitely more terrible for us
  are part of the same process that has knit us all so much more
  closely together. Our modern phrase for this is interdependence.
  In essence, it is exactly what the nineteenth-century economist
  talked about as the advantages of international specialization
  and the division of labor. The main difference is that excessive
  economic nationalism, erecting its reactionary barriers to the
  international division of labor, is far more anomalous and
  irrational now than it was when the enlightened minds of the
  nineteenth century preached against it and for a time succeeded
  in having practiced what they preached.</p>

  <p>The higher the common man sets his economic
  goals in this age of mass democracy, the more essential it is to
  political stability and peace that we trade as freely as possible
  together, that we reap those great benefits from the division of
  labor, of each man and each region doing what he and it can do
  with greatest relative efficiency, which were the economic basis
  of nineteenth-century thought and policy. In no country is this
  more clearly understood than in Norway and in no country is the
  impulse to peace deeper or more widespread.</p>

  <p>In this sphere, our postwar record is
  better than it is fashionable to recognize. Under the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>
  there has been real progress in reducing trade barriers and in
  civilizing the commercial policies of national governments. The
  achievement so far has its limits, of course, and there have been
  setbacks, but there has been more progress, and over a wider
  area, than any of us would have dared to predict with confidence
  twelve years ago.</p>

  <p>Now the European nations are launching
  themselves, through the Common Market and its associated free
  trade area<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>, on an adventure in
  the economic unification of peoples that a few years ago would
  have seemed completely visionary. Is it any more visionary to
  foresee a further extension of this cooperative economic pattern?
  Is it not time to begin to think in terms of an economic
  interdependence that would bridge the Atlantic, that would at
  least break down the barrier between dollar and non-dollar
  countries which, next only to Iron Curtains, has hitherto most
  sharply divided our postwar One World?</p>

  <p>You will say that this is far too
  unrealistic. I can only reply that in the past decade we have
  already seen even more profound revolutions in men's political
  and social attitudes. It would be especially tragic if the people
  who most cherish ideals of peace, who are most anxious for
  political cooperation on a wider than national scale, made the
  mistake of underestimating the pace of economic change in our
  modern world.</p>

  <p>Just as we cannot in this day have a stable
  national democracy without progress in living standards and a
  sense that the community as a whole participates in those
  standards, without too great extremes of wealth and poverty,
  likewise we cannot have one world at peace without a general
  social and economic progress in the same direction. We must have
  rising living standards in which all nations are participating to
  such a degree that existing inequalities in the international
  division of wealth are, at least, not increased. For substantial
  progress on those lines we need the degree of efficiency that
  comes only with the freest possible movement of commerce through
  the world, binding people together, providing the basis of
  international investment and expansion, and thereby, I hope,
  making for peace.</p>

  <p><b>Peace and Power</b></p>

  <p>I now come to peace and power.</p>

  <p>Every state has not only the right but the
  duty to make adequate provision for its own defense in the way it
  thinks best, providing it does not do so at the expense of any
  other state. Every state denies and rejects any suggestion that
  it acquires military power for any other purpose than defense.
  Indeed, in a period of world tension, fear, and insecurity, it is
  easy for any state to make such denial sound reasonable, even if
  the ultimate aims and policies of its leaders are other than
  pacific.</p>

  <p>No state, furthermore, unless it has
  aggressive military designs such as those which consumed Nazi
  leaders in the thirties, is likely to divert to defense any more
  of its resources and wealth and energy than seems necessary. The
  economic burden of armaments is now almost overpowering, and
  where public opinion can bring itself effectively to bear on
  government, the pressure is nearly always for the greatest
  possible amount of butter and the fewest possible number of
  guns.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, defense by power as a first
  obligation on a state has to be considered in relation to things
  other than economics. For one thing - and this is certainly true
  of smaller countries - such power, unless it is combined with the
  defense forces of other friendly countries, is likely to be
  futile, both for protection and for prevention, or for
  deterrence, as we call it. This in its turn leads to coalitions
  and associations of states. These may be necessary in the world
  in which we live, but they do extend the area of a possible war
  in the hope that greater and united power will prevent any war.
  When they are purely defensive in character, such coalitions can
  make for peace by removing the temptation of easy victory. But
  they can never be more than a second-best substitute for the
  great coalition of the whole United Nations established to
  preserve the peace, but now too often merely the battleground of
  the cold war.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the force which you and your
  allies collect for your own security can, in a bad international
  climate, increase, or seem to increase, someone else's
  insecurity. A vicious chain reaction begins. In the past, the end
  result has always been, not peace, but the explosion of war.
  Arms, produced by fear out of international tension, have never
  maintained peace and security except for limited periods. I am
  not arguing against their short-run necessity. I am arguing
  against their long-run effectiveness. At best they give us a
  breathing space during which we can search for a better
  foundation for the kind of security which would itself bring
  about arms reduction.</p>

  <p>These coalitions for collective defense are
  limited in area and exclusive in character. And they provoke
  counter-coalitions. Today, for instance, we have now reached the
  point where two - and only two - great agglomerations of power
  face each other in fear and hostility, and the world wonders what
  will happen.</p>

  <p>If the United Nations were effective as a
  security agency - which it is not - these more limited
  arrangements would be unnecessary and, therefore, undesirable.
  But pending that day, can we not put some force behind the United
  Nations which - under the authorization of the Assembly - might
  be useful at least for dealing with some small conflicts and
  preventing them from becoming great ones?</p>

  <p>Certainly the idea of an international
  police force effective against a big disturber of the peace seems
  today unrealizable to the point of absurdity. We did, however,
  take at least a step in the direction of putting international
  force behind an international decision a year ago in the Suez
  crisis. The birth of this force was sudden and it was surgical.
  The arrangements for the reception of the infant were
  rudimentary, and the midwives - one of the most important of whom
  was Norway - had no precedents or experience to guide them.
  Nevertheless, UNEF<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>, the first
  genuinely international police force of its kind, came into being
  and into action.</p>

  <p>It was organized with great speed and
  efficiency even though its functions were limited and its
  authority unclear. And the credit for that must go first of all
  to the Secretary-General of the United Nations<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a> and his assistants.</p>

  <p>Composed of the men of nine United Nations
  countries from four continents, UNEF moved with high morale and
  higher purpose between national military forces in conflict.
  Under the peaceful blue emblem of the United Nations, it brought,
  and has maintained, at least relative quiet on an explosive
  border. It has supervised and secured a cease-fire.</p>

  <p>I do not exaggerate the significance of
  what has been done. There is no peace in the area. There is no
  unanimity at the United Nations about the functions and future of
  this force. It would be futile in a quarrel between, or in
  opposition to, big powers. But it may have prevented a brush fire
  becoming an all-consuming blaze at the Suez last year, and it
  could do so again in similar circumstances in the future.</p>

  <p>We made at least a beginning then. If, on
  that foundation, we do not build something more permanent and
  stronger, we will once again have ignored realities, rejected
  opportunities, and betrayed our trust. Will we never learn?</p>

  <p>Today, less than ever can we defend
  ourselves by force, for there is no effective defense against the
  all-destroying effect of nuclear missile weapons. Indeed, their
  very power has made their use intolerable, even unthinkable,
  because of the annihilative retaliation in kind that such use
  would invoke. So peace remains, as the phrase goes, balanced
  uneasily on terror, and the use of maximum force is frustrated by
  the certainty that it will be used in reply with a totally
  devastating effect. Peace, however, must surely be more than this
  trembling rejection of universal suicide.</p>

  <p>The stark and inescapable fact is that
  today we cannot defend our society by war since total war is
  total destruction, and if war is used as an instrument of policy,
  eventually we will have total war. Therefore, the best defense of
  peace is not power, but the removal of the causes of war, and
  international agreements which will put peace on a stronger
  foundation than the terror of destruction.</p>

  <p><b>Peace and Policy</b></p>

  <p>The third face of peace, therefore, is
  policy and diplomacy. If we could, internationally, display on
  this front some of the imagination and initiative, determination
  and sacrifice, that we show in respect of defense planning and
  development, the outlook would be more hopeful than it is. The
  grim fact, however, is that we prepare for war like precocious
  giants and for peace like retarded pygmies.</p>

  <p>Our policy and diplomacy - as the two sides
  in the cold war face each other - are becoming as rigid and
  defensive as the trench warfare of forty years ago, when two
  sides dug in, dug deeper, and lived in their ditches. Military
  moves that had been made previously had resulted in slaughter
  without gain; so, for a time, all movement was avoided.
  Occasionally there was almost a semblance of peace.</p>

  <p>It is essential that we avoid this kind of
  dangerous stalemate in international policy today. The main
  responsibility for this purpose rests with the two great world
  powers, the United States and the U.S.S.R. No progress will be
  made if one side merely shouts "coexistence" - a sterile and
  negative concept - and "parleys at the summit", while the other
  replies "no appeasement", "no negotiation without proof of good
  faith".</p>

  <p>What is needed is a new and vigorous
  determination to use every technique of discussion and
  negotiation that may be available, or, more important, that can
  be made available, for the solution of the tangled, frightening
  problems that divide today, in fear and hostility, the two
  power-blocks and thereby endanger peace. We must keep on trying
  to solve problems, one by one, stage by stage, if not on the
  basis of confidence and cooperation, at least on that of mutual
  toleration and self-interest.</p>

  <p>What I plead for is no spectacular meeting
  of a Big Two or a Big Three or a Big Four at the summit , where
  the footing is precarious and the winds blow hard, but for frank,
  serious, and complete exchanges of views - especially between
  Moscow and Washington - through diplomatic and political
  channels.</p>

  <p>Essential to the success of any such
  exchanges is the recognition by the West that there are certain
  issues such as the unification of Germany and the stabilization
  of the Middle East which are not likely to be settled in any
  satisfactory way without the participation of the U.S.S.R. Where
  that country has a legitimate security interest in an area or in
  a problem, that must be taken into account.</p>

  <p>It is also essential that the Soviet Union,
  in its turn, recognize the right of people to choose their own
  form of government without interference from outside forces or
  subversive domestic forces encouraged and assisted from
  outside.</p>

  <p>A diplomatic approach of this kind
  involves, as I well know, baffling complexities, difficulties,
  and even risks. Nevertheless, the greater these are, the stronger
  should be the resolve and the effort, by both sides and in direct
  discussions, to identify and expose them as the first step in
  their possible removal.</p>

  <p>Perhaps a diplomatic effort of this kind
  would not succeed. I have no illusions about its complexity or
  even its risks. Speaking as a North American, I merely state that
  we should be sure that the responsibility for any such failure is
  not ours. The first failure would be to refuse to make the
  attempt.</p>

  <p>The time has come for us to make a move,
  not only from strength, but from wisdom and from confidence in
  ourselves; to concentrate on the possibilities of agreement,
  rather than on the disagreements and failures, the evils and
  wrongs, of the past.</p>

  <p>It would be folly to expect quick, easy, or
  total solutions. It would be folly also to expect hostility and
  fears suddenly to vanish. But it is equal or even greater folly
  to do nothing: to sit back, answer missile with missile, insult
  with insult, ban with ban.</p>

  <p>That would be the complete bankruptcy of
  policy and diplomacy, and it would not make for peace.</p>

 <p><b>Peace and People</b></p>

  <p>In this final phase of the subject, I am
  not thinking of people in what ultimately will be their most
  important relationship to peace: the fact that more than thirty
  millions of them are added to our crowded planet each year. Nor
  am I going to dwell at any length on the essential truth that
  peace, after all, is merely the aggregate of feelings and
  emotions in the hearts and minds of individual people.</p>

  <p>Spinoza<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>
  said that "Peace is the vigor born of the virtue of the soul." He
  meant, of course, creative peace, the sum of individual virtue
  and vigor. In the past, however, man has unhappily often
  expressed this peace in ways which were more vigorous than
  virtuous.</p>

  <p>It has too often been too easy for rulers
  and governments to incite man to war. Indeed, when people have
  been free to express their views, they have as often condemned
  their governments for being too peaceful as for being too
  belligerent.</p>

  <p>This may perhaps have been due to the fact
  that in the past men were more attracted by the excitements of
  conflict and the rewards of expected victory than they were
  frightened by the possibility of injury, pain, and death.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, in earlier days, the drama of
  war was the more compelling and colorful because it seemed to
  have a romantic separation from the drabness of ordinary life.
  Many men have seemed to like war - each time - before it
  began.</p>

  <p>As a Canadian psychiatrist, Dr. G.H.
  Stevenson, put it once : "People are so easily led into
  quarrelsome attitudes by some national leaders. A fight of any
  kind has a hypnotic influence on most men. We men like war. We
  like the excitement of it, its thrill and glamour, its freedom
  from restraint. We like its opportunities for socially approved
  violence. We like its economic security and its relief from the
  monotony of civilian toil. We like its reward for bravery, its
  opportunities for travel, its companionship of men in a man's
  world, its intoxicating novelty. And we like taking chances with
  death. This psychological weakness is a constant menace to
  peaceful behavior. We need to be protected against this weakness,
  and against the leaders who capitalize on this weakness."</p>

  <p>Perhaps this has all changed now. Surely
  the glamour has gone out of war. The thin but heroic red line of
  the nineteenth century is now the production line. The warrior is
  the man with a test tube or the one who pushes the nuclear
  button. This should have a salutary effect on man's emotions. A
  realization of the consequences that must follow if and when he
  does push the button should have a salutary effect also on his
  reason.</p>

  <p>People and peace have another meaning. How
  can there be peace without people understanding each other, and
  how can this be if they don't know each other? How can there be
  cooperative coexistence, which is the only kind that means
  anything, if men are cut off from each other, if they are not
  allowed to learn more about each other? So let's throw aside the
  curtains against contacts and communication.</p>

  <p>I realize that contact can mean friction as
  well as friendship, that ignorance can be benevolent and
  isolation pacific. But I can find nothing to say for keeping one
  people malevolently misinformed about others. More contact and
  freer communication can help to correct this situation. To
  encourage it - or at least to permit it - is an acid test for the
  sincerity of protestations for better relations between
  peoples.</p>

  <p>I believe myself that the Russian people -
  to cite one example - wish for peace. I believe also that many of
  them think that the Americans are threatening them with war, that
  they are in danger of attack. So might I, if I had as little
  chance to get objective and balanced information about what is
  going on in the United States. Similarly, our Western fears of
  the Soviet Union have been partly based on a lack of
  understanding or of information about the people of that
  country.</p>

  <p>Misunderstanding of this kind arising from
  ignorance breeds fear, and fear remains the greatest enemy of
  peace.</p>

  <p>A common fear, however, which usually means
  a common foe, is also, regrettably, the strongest force bringing
  people together, but in opposition to something or someone.
  Perhaps there is a hopeful possibility here in the conquest of
  outer space. Interplanetary activity may give us planetary peace.
  Once we discover Martian space ships hovering over earth's
  airspace, we will all come together. "How dare they threaten us
  like this!" we shall shout, as one, at a really United
  Nations!</p>

  <p>At the moment, however, I am more conscious
  of the unhappy fact that people are more apt to be united for war
  than for peace; in fear rather than in hope. Where that unity is
  based on popular will, it means that war is total in far more
  than a military sense. The nation at war now means literally all
  the people at war, and it can add new difficulties to the making
  or even the maintenance of peace.</p>

  <p>When everybody is directly involved in war,
  it is harder to make a peace which does not bear the seeds of
  future wars. It was easier, for instance, to make peace with
  France under a Napoleon who had been kept apart in the minds of
  his foes from the mass of Frenchmen, than with a Germany under
  Hitler, when every citizen was felt to be an enemy in the popular
  passions of the time.</p>

  <p>May I express one final thought. There can
  be no enduring and creative peace if people are unfree. The
  instinct for personal and national freedom cannot be destroyed,
  and the attempt to do so by totalitarian and despotic governments
  will ultimately make not only for internal trouble but for
  international conflict. Authority under law must, I know, be
  respected as the foundation of society and as the protection of
  peace. The extension of state power, however, into every phase of
  man's life and thought is the abuse of authority, the destroyer
  of freedom, and the enemy of real peace.</p>

  <p>In the end, the whole problem always
  returns to people; yes, to one person and his own individual
  response to the challenges that confront him.</p>

  <p>In his response to the situations he has to
  meet as a person, the individual accepts the fact that his own
  single will cannot prevail against that of his group or his
  society. If he tries to make it prevail against the general will,
  he will be in trouble. So he compromises and agrees and
  tolerates. As a result, men normally live together in their own
  national society without war or chaos. So it must be one day in
  international society. If there is to be peace, there must be
  compromise, tolerance, agreement.</p>

  <p>We are so far from that ideal that it is
  easy to give way to despair and defeatism. But there is no cause
  for such a course or for the opposite one that leads to rash and
  ill-judged action.</p>

  <p>May I quote a very great American, Judge
  Learned Hand, on this point: "Most of the issues that mankind
  sets out to settle, it never does settle. They are not solved
  because... they are incapable of solution, properly speaking,
  being concerned with incommensurables. At any rate... the
  opposing parties seldom do agree upon a solution; and the dispute
  fades into the past unsolved, though perhaps it may be renewed as
  history and fought over again. It disappears because it is
  replaced by some compromise that, although not wholly acceptable
  to either side, offers a tolerable substitute for victory; and he
  who would find the substitute needs an endowment as rich as
  possible in experience, an experience which makes the heart
  generous and provides his mind with an understanding of the
  hearts of others."<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

  <p>Yet even people with generous and
  understanding hearts, and peaceful instincts in their normal
  individual behavior, can become fighting and even savage national
  animals under the incitements of collective emotion. Why this
  happens is the core of our problem of peace and war.</p>

  <p>That problem, why men fight who aren't
  necessarily fighting men, was posed for me in a new and dramatic
  way one Christmas Eve in London during World War II. The air raid
  sirens had given their grim and accustomed warning. Almost before
  the last dismal moan had ended, the antiaircraft guns began to
  crash. In between their bursts I could hear the deeper, more
  menacing sound of bombs. It wasn't much of a raid, really, but
  one or two of the bombs seemed to fall too close to my room. I
  was reading in bed and, to drown out or at least to take my mind
  off the bombs, I reached out and turned on the radio. I was
  fumbling aimlessly with the dial when the room was flooded with
  the beauty and peace of Christmas carol music. Glorious waves of
  it wiped out the sound of war and conjured up visions of happier
  peacetime Christmases. Then the announcer spoke in German. For it
  was a German station and they were Germans who were singing those
  carols. Nazi bombs screaming through the air with their message
  of war and death; German music drifting through the air with its
  message of peace and salvation. When we resolve the paradox of
  those two sounds from a single national source, we will, at last,
  be in a good position to understand and solve the problem of
  peace and war.</p>
