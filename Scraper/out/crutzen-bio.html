  <h1>Paul J. Crutzen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="crutzen.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Amsterdam on December, 3,
  1933, the son of Anna Gurk and Jozef Crutzen. I have one sister
  who still lives in Amsterdam with her family. My mother's parents
  moved to the industrial Ruhr region in Germany from East Prussia
  towards the end of the last century. They were of mixed German
  and Polish origin. In 1929 at the age of 17, my mother, moved to
  Amsterdam to work as a housekeeper. There she met my father. He
  came from Vaals, a little town in the southeastern corner of the
  Netherlands, Bordering Belgium and Germany and very close to the
  historical German city of Aachen. He died in 1977. He had
  relatives in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. Thus, from
  both parents I inherited a cosmopolitan view of the world. My
  mother, now 84 years old, still lives in Amsterdam, mentally very
  alert, but since a few months ago, wheelchair-bound. Despite
  having worked in several countries outside The Netherlands since
  1958, I have remained a Dutch citizen.<br>
  <br>
  In May, 1940, The Netherlands were overrun by the German army. In
  September of the same year I entered elementary school, "de grote
  school" (the big school), as it was popularly called. My six
  years of elementary school largely overlapped with the 2nd World
  War. Our school class had to move between different premises in
  Amsterdam after the German army had confiscated our original
  school building. The last months of the war, between the fall of
  1944 and Liberation Day on May, 5, 1945, were particularly
  horrible. During the cold "hongerwinter" (winter of famine) of
  1944-1945, there was a severe lack of food and heating fuels.
  Also water for drinking, cooking and washing was available only
  in limited quantities for a few hours per day, causing poor
  hygienic conditions. Many died of hunger and disease, including
  several of my schoolmates. Some relief came at the beginning of
  1945 when the Swedish Red Cross dropped food supplies on
  parachutes from airplanes. To welcome them we waved our red,
  white and blue Dutch flags in the streets. I had of course not
  the slightest idea how important Sweden would become later in my
  life. We only had a few hours of school each week, but because of
  special help from one of the teachers, I was allowed together
  with two other schoolmates to continue to the next and final
  class of elementary school; unfortunately, all the others lost a
  year. More or less normal school education only became possible
  again with the start of the new school year in the fall of
  1945.<br>
  <br>
  In 1946, after a successful entrance exam, I entered the "Hogere
  Burgerschool" (HBS), "Higher Citizen School", a 5 year long
  middle school, which prepared for University entrance. I finished
  this school in June, 1951, with natural sciences as my focal
  subjects. However, we all also had to become proficient in 3
  foreign languages: French, English and German. I got considerable
  help in learning languages from my parents: German from my
  mother, French from my father. During those years, chemistry
  definitely was not one of my favourite subjects. They were
  mathematics and physics, but I also did very well in the three
  foreign languages. During my school years I spent considerable
  time with a variety of sports: football, bicycling, and my
  greatest passion, long distance skating on the Dutch canals and
  lakes. I also played chess, which in the Netherlands is ranked as
  a "denksport" (thought sport). I read widely about travels in
  distant lands, about astronomy, as well as about bridges and
  tunnels. Unfortunately, because of a heavy fever, my grades in
  the final exam of the HBS were not good enough to qualify for a
  university study stipend, which was very hard to obtain at that
  time, only 6 years after the end of the 2nd world war and a few
  years after the end of colonial war in Indonesia, which had been
  a large drain on Dutch resources. As I did not want to be a
  further financial burden on my parents for another 4 years or
  more (my father, a waiter, was often unemployed; my mother worked
  in the kitchen of a hospital), I chose to attend the Middelbare
  Technische School (MTS), middle technical school, now called the
  higher technical school (HTS), to train as a civil engineer.
  Although the MTS took 3 years, the second year was a practical
  year during which I earned a modest salary, enough to live on for
  about 2 years. From the summer of 1954 until February, 1958, with
  a 21-month interruption for compulsory military service in The
  Netherlands, I worked at the Bridge Construction Bureau of the
  City of Amsterdam. In the meanwhile, on a vacation trip in
  Switzerland, I met a sweet girl, Terttu Soininen, a student of
  Finnish history and literature at the University of Helsinki. A
  few years later I was able to entice her to marry me. What a
  great choice I made! She has been the center of a happy family;
  without her support, I would never have been able to devote so
  much of my time to studies and science. After our marriage in
  February, 1958, we settled in G&auml;vle, a little town about 200
  km north of Stockholm, where I had found a job in a building
  construction bureau. In December of that same year our daughter
  Ilona was born. In March, 1964, she got a little sister, Sylvia.
  Ilona is a registered nurse. Her son Jamie Paul is 12 years old.
  Sylvia is a marketing assistant in M&uuml;nchen, Germany. All
  were present in Stockholm, Uppsala and G&auml;vle during the
  Nobel week. We had a happy and unforgettable time.<br>
  <br>
  All this time I had longed for an academic career. One day, at
  the beginning of 1958, I saw an advertisement in a Swedish
  newspaper from the Department of Meteorology of Stockholm
  H&ouml;gskola (from 1961, Stockholm University) announcing an
  opening for a computer programmer. Although I had not the
  slightest experience in this subject, I applied for the job and
  had the great luck to be chosen from among many candidates. On
  July 1, 1959, we moved to Stockholm and I started with my second
  profession. At that time the Meteorology Institute of Stockholm
  University (MISU) and the associated International Meteorological
  Institute (IMI) were at the forefront of meteorological research
  and many top researchers worked in Stockholm for extended
  periods. Only about a year earlier the founder of the institutes,
  Prof. Gustav Rossby, one of the greatest meteorologists ever, had
  died suddenly and was succeeded by Dr. Bert Bolin, another famous
  meteorologist, now "retired" as director of the Intergovernmental
  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At that time Stockholm University
  housed the fastest computers in the world (BESK and its successor
  FACIT).<br>
  <br>
  With the exception of participation in a field campaign in
  northern Sweden, led by Dr. Georg Witt to measure the properties
  of noctilucent clouds, which appear during summer at about 85 km
  altitude in the coldest parts of atmosphere, and some programming
  work related to this, I was until about 1966 mainly involved in
  various meteorological projects, especially helping to build and
  run some of the first numerical (barotropic) weather prediction
  models. I also programmed a model of a tropical cyclone for a
  good friend, Hilding Sundquist, now a professor at MISU. At that
  time programming was a special art. Advanced general computer
  languages, such as Algol or Fortran, had not been developed, so
  that all programmes had to be written in specific machine code.
  One also had to make sure that all operations yielded numbers in
  the range -1 &lt; x &lt; 1, which meant that one had to scale all
  equations to stay within these limits; otherwise the computations
  would yield wrong results.<br>
  <br>
  The great advantage of being at a university department was that
  I got the opportunity to follow some of the lecture courses that
  were offered at the university. By 1963 I could thus fulfill the
  requirement for the filosofie kandidat (corresponding to a Master
  of Science) degree, combining the subjects mathematics,
  mathematical statistics, and meteorology. Unfortunately, I could
  include neither physics nor chemistry in my formal education,
  because this would have required my participation in time
  consuming laboratory exercises. In this way I became a pure
  theoretician. I have, however, always felt close to experimental
  work, which I have strongly supported during my later years as
  director of research at the National Center of Atmospheric
  Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado (1977-1980) and at the
  Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany (since
  1980).<br>
  <br>
  Being employed at the meteorological research institute, it was
  quite natural to take a meteorological topic for my filosofie
  licentiat thesis (comparable to a Ph.D. thesis). Building on my
  earlier experience further development of a numerical model of a
  tropical cyclone had been proposed to me. However, around 1965 I
  was given the task of helping a scientist from the U.S. to
  develop a numerical model of the oxygen allotrope distribution in
  the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This project
  got me highly interested in the photochemistry of atmospheric
  ozone and I started an intensive study of the scientific
  literature. This gave me an understanding of the status of
  scientific knowledge about stratospheric chemistry by the latter
  half of the 1960's, thus setting the "initial conditions" for my
  scientific career. Instead of the initially proposed research
  project, I preferred research on stratospheric chemistry, which
  was generously accepted. At that time the main topics of research
  at the Meteorological Institute at the University of Stockholm
  were dynamics, cloud physics, the carbon cycle, studies of the
  chemical composition of rainwater, and especially the "acid rain"
  problem which was largely "discovered" at MISU through the work
  of Svante Od&eacute;n and Erik Eriksson. Several researchers at
  MISU, among them Prof. Bolin and my good friend and fellow
  student Henning Rodhe, now Professor in Chemical Meteorology at
  MISU, got heavily involved in the issue which drew considerable
  political interest at the first United Nation Conference on the
  Environment in Stockholm in 1972. However, I wanted to do pure
  science related to natural processes and therefore I picked
  stratospheric ozone as my subject, without the slightest
  anticipation of what lay ahead. In this choice of research topic
  I was left totally free. I can not overstate how I value the
  generosity and confidence which were conveyed to me by my
  supervisors Prof. Georg Witt, an expert on the aeronomy of the
  upper atmosphere, and the head of MISU Prof. Bert Bolin. They
  were always extremely helpful and showed great interest in the
  progress of my research.</p>
