  <h1>Koichi Tanaka - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tanaka.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Japan
  on August 3, 1959. My natural mother died one month after I was
  born, apparently due to giving birth at an advanced age. Because
  my father was also physically frail, I was brought up by my uncle
  and aunt. When I use the words "father" and "mother" now, I am
  referring to the father and mother who raised me. Perhaps it was
  because of my easygoing character that I remained ignorant of my
  early circumstances until I was 18 years old, when my parents
  informed me of these circumstances. More likely, however, my
  blissful ignorance was due to the completely fair-minded
  upbringing I received by my parents, older sister and brothers,
  relatives and neighbours.</p>

  <p>My parents operated a business selling and
  repairing carpentry tools in Toyama Prefecture. I grew up with
  images of my father sharpening saw-blade teeth and planes, images
  in which he was seemingly always busy working quietly with his
  hands. My mother was not only busy performing housework, but also
  making end-of-month collections and keeping the books of the
  family business until late at night. I have no memory of my
  parents encouraging me with words like 'study' or 'succeed.'
  There is no doubt, however, that the values they instilled in me
  were much more important than those suggested by these words.
  From my father, I learned the importance of working sincerely at
  things to which I had committed myself, and to persevere
  untiringly even in the face of little progress. My mother also
  stressed the importance of working quietly towards achieving my
  missions in life, without neglecting attention to details. My
  father passed away three years ago (1999).</p>

  <p>Apart from my parents, I was also
  influenced by my grandmother. She often admonished me, using the
  expression "What a waste!" ("Mottai-nai!" in Japanese). While
  these words are approaching extinction these days, they used to
  be an integral part of the cultural values in Japan. My
  grandmother valued even the smallest of things. Once, when she
  noticed me crumpling up a sheet of paper to throw it away, she
  angrily reproached me, saying "What a waste. You could straighten
  that paper out and use it to blow your nose." It is no wonder the
  concept "What a waste!" is so ingrained in my psyche.</p>

  <p>The prefecture name "Toyama" means "rich in
  mountains." Toyama is surrounded by the Tateyama Mountains to the
  east, other mountains to the south and west, and the Sea of Japan
  to the north. Just the sight of the Tateyama Mountains brings me
  a sense of calm. This area is blessed with bountiful nature,
  eliciting in me a feeling of awe towards all living things and a
  compelling interest in the mysteries of nature, so difficult to
  find in urban settings.</p>

  <p>I was enrolled in the Hachininmachi
  Elementary School in Toyama City in 1966. I cannot say that I was
  a particularly diligent student, especially during the lower
  grades. One event, however, did make a lasting impression on me,
  and that was Expo '70, Japan's first world fair, held in Osaka in
  1970. The Exposition site displayed the future of technology,
  which would actually be realized 20 to 30 years later. I truly
  felt the power of science and technology. Our teacher for the
  last three years of elementary school was Mr. Kyosei Sawagaki. He
  taught us not by having us memorize textbooks, but through the
  joy of performing scientific experimentation and discovering
  phenomena with our own eyes. One day our teacher showed us an
  experiment in which boric acid was first dissolved in water, and
  then re-crystallized. As I watched and experienced this
  incredible phenomenon, I blurted out, "It's starting to snow!"
  While this would have been considered incorrect as an answer in a
  test, my teacher cherished that response. That was when I
  discovered that learning could be enjoyable, and not just a
  painful experience.</p>

  <p>I enrolled in Toyama Municipal Shibazono
  Middle School in 1972. This was not an especially elite middle
  school, but I did apply myself singlemindedly to my studies. My
  efforts enabled me to attain a ranking in the top ten percent of
  the class.</p>

  <p>In 1975, I enrolled in Toyama Chubu High
  School in Toyama Prefecture. This high school is known for its
  competitive first or second ranking in Toyama Prefecture as a
  school for sending graduates on to "first-class" universities.
  Together with just about every other student in the school, I
  devoted a great deal of effort to studying for the university
  entrance examination. The tenacious character I've possessed
  since I was a small child propelled me to successfully meet this
  challenge, and I was able to safely gain acceptance to the
  university of my choice.</p>

<p class="photo-gallery-caption">View of Tateyama Mountains (as high as 3,000 meters) from Toyama City.</p>

  
  

  <p>Upon receiving my notification of
  acceptance to the university, my parents noticed that they were
  obliged to submit to the university, among other things, a copy
  of my official family register. After much mental anguish, they
  decided to inform me of the secret of my birth. The truth came as
  a considerable shock to me, and the trauma surged over me in
  waves for a long time afterwards. At the same time, however, it
  was a chance for me to assert my independence. The thought grew
  strong in me that since I had gone to the trouble of being born,
  I might as well be useful in helping people live long and healthy
  lives. And this thought has always resided in the back of my
  mind.</p>

  <p>In 1978, I entered Tohoku University, into the Department of
  Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Technology. I suppose the
  reason I chose electrical engineering was because I had always
  been interested in electricity, involving myself in such projects
  as building radios from the time I was a child. Moreover, I
  thought that electrical-related skills would be useful upon
  graduation, and that it would be easy to find a job among the
  electronics-related businesses so active in Japan at that time.
  Perhaps as a reaction to the tremendous efforts I had made to
  pass the university entrance examination, I let up somewhat in my
  first- and second-year studies at the university. As a result, my
  grades suffered in German class, and I was forced to repeat the
  year. Aware that I had placed a burden on my parents, from that
  point on, I diligently applied myself to my studies. In my senior
  year at the university, we were obliged to complete a graduation
  research project, and mine was entitled "Absorption of a Plane
  Wave by an Impedance-Loaded Dipole Array Buried in a Lossy
  Medium." The objective of the research was to reduce the ghost
  effect of television broadcast waves by placing an array of
  line-shaped conductors in front of a building to prevent the
  reflection of electric waves from the building. I was guided in
  my research by Professor Saburo Adachi. Needless to say, my
  present research endeavors have practically no relevance to that
  subject.</p>

  <p>The Faculty of Technology of Tohoku
  University is renowned for its tradition of practical studies.
  For instance, historical individuals associated with the
  university include Professor Kotaro Honda for his contributions
  in metallurgical engineering, Professor Hidetsugu Yagi, the
  inventor of the wellknown Yagi antenna (patented in 1940), and
  Professor Jun-ichi Nishizawa for his opto-electronics and
  semiconductor research. In such an environment, I was able to
  study things that could be of immediate usefulness to the world.
  That learning experience undoubtedly served me well when I
  eventually entered the work force.</p>

  <p>When it came time to find employment, I set
  my sights on becoming an engineer at a home electronics
  manufacturer, a field that was closely related to my major at
  university. I took an entrance examination for employment at one
  such company, but failed the examination. Despite my desire to be
  an electrical engineer, I am sure my answers to the
  electricity-related questions were somewhat less than acceptable.
  Even though I failed, however, I still hold that company in high
  regard.</p>

  <p>At that point, I decided that there was no
  need to focus solely on electrical engineering, especially
  because I had only two years of electrical-related knowledge. I
  turned to my mentor, Professor Adachi, and he was kind enough to
  introduce me to Shimadzu Corporation. I learned from Shimadzu's
  employment literature that the company was manufacturing Xray
  devices and other types of medical equipment. This struck a chord
  with me, rekindling the possibility that I might yet satisfy my
  desire to help suffering people, albeit indirectly. I decided to
  take the employment examination, and that time, I passed without
  problem. However, instead of being assigned to the area of
  medical equipment, I learned I was to be involved in research and
  development of analytical instrumentation. Fortunately, that
  field also held interest for me, and it became the central area
  of my work.</p>

  <p>Kyoto city is home to Shimadzu's main
  factories and research divisions, and has fostered six out of
  Japan's nine Nobel Prize laureates in scientific fields,
  including Prof. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1949/index.html">Hideki Yukawa</a> (selected
  in 1949), Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Shin-ichiro Tomonaga</a>
  (1965), Prof. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/index.html">Ken-ichi Fukui</a> (1981),
  Prof. <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1987/index.html">Susumu
  Tonegawa</a> (1987), Prof. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/index.html">Ryoji Noyori</a> (2001),
  and myself. Probably no one can explain exactly why so many
  laureates hail from Kyoto, but the knowledge of this fact did
  have somewhat of an effect on me. I might even have mused that I
  could reach to such a level if I were to put my heart and soul
  into the effort.</p>

  <p>I joined Shimadzu Corporation in 1983, and
  was immediately assigned to the Central Research Laboratory, a
  new department which had been established in 1980. At that time,
  there were three laboratories, for mechanical-, chemical- and
  electrical-related research, respectively. I was assigned to the
  laboratory for electrical systems-related research, and joined a
  team charged with developing component technology for analytical
  instruments. This team comprised Dr. Tamio Yoshida, Mr. Yoshikazu
  Yoshida, Mr. Satoshi Akita, Mr. Yutaka Ido, the one member who
  joined the company with me, and myself. We were a very young
  team, with an average age in the 20's, with me being the youngest
  of all.</p>

  <p>Even before I joined the company, Shimadzu
  had been engaged in research involving the mapping the elements
  on the surface of a semiconductors and metals after ionizing the
  surfaces using an Nd-YAG laser beam concentrated to a diameter of
  about one micrometer. An instrument that was to be competitive
  with a German product was developed, but since its performance
  did not significantly exceed that of the other product, it was
  not placed on the market. However, rather than give up at that
  point, our team consulted with a product manager in the
  Scientific Equipment Division to find a more constructive
  alternative. We decided to utilize the instrumentation we had
  been using in our research together with the accumulated
  laser-related technology we had developed, and we shifted the
  focus of our work to the field of mass analysis of
  biological-related substances. That research and development
  began in 1984. Since Mr. Akita was already a talented designer of
  electrical circuits and systems, I assumed the responsibility of
  acquiring data from the chemical experiments. This would be a
  first-time ever experience for me to irradiate substances with a
  laser, and the first time to perform chemical experiments away
  from the educational context of school. However, I undertook this
  project thinking that it would be very interesting, drawing on
  the inquisitiveness that had guided me since my elementary school
  days.</p>

  <p>My specific task was to search for a matrix
  that would enable non-destructive ionization of macromolecules by
  efficiently absorbing the laser energy. The laboratory stocked
  hundreds of substances that were candidates for the matrix.
  Without having studied the theory of ionization coupled with my
  paucity of knowledge in chemistry, I single-mindedly,
  day-after-day, repeated trial and error experiments with the
  candidate substances. Continuing this regimen tirelessly, I felt
  like I had become one with these substances and the instrument.
  However, a solution was not easily found.</p>

  <p>One day in February of 1985, instead of
  using Cobalt Ultra Fine Metal Powder (UFMP) as a matrix, I
  mistakenly used a glycerin-UFMP mixed matrix. I noticed this
  mistake immediately, but I thought, "Mottai-nai!" at the idea of
  throwing the mixture away. If I allowed the glycerin to
  evaporate, I thought that I could still make use of the UFMP, so
  I placed the mixture in the vacuum chamber to dry it out.
  Thinking that I could even speed up the drying process by
  irradiating the mixture with the laser, I switched on the laser
  beam. On top of that, anxious to confirm the elimination of the
  glycerin as soon as possible, I kept the spectrometer running and
  monitored the results. And then, I noticed a signal peak I had
  never before seen mixed in with the noise peaks. I think because
  up to that point I had always felt annoyance at the sight of that
  noise wave data in the experiments, I noticed a slight
  difference. The signal peak that I had never seen before now
  appeared at the same position no matter how many times I ran the
  experiment.</p>

      in glass bottles (bottom).</p>
  



  <p>Thinking about it now, this "monumental
  blunder" was the start of it all. From then on, noticeable
  progress was evident every time I ran an experiment. This
  contrasted entirely with the situation that continued
  day-after-day until a few days prior, when I would say to myself
  each time I failed, "Well now I know that method won't work."
  During that productive period of time I was truly happy as an
  engineer. Most of the work performed by a development engineer
  results in failure. However, the occasional visit of success
  provides just the excitement an engineer needs to face work the
  following day.</p>

  <p>To say that I discovered the method of
  ionization does not take into account the complete story. It is
  necessary to point out that because the signal was so minute, the
  discovery could not have been made if it were not for the
  sensitivity and high performance of the instrument. Technologies
  for the mass separation mechanism, the detector and the signal
  processor were developed by Dr. Tamio Yoshida, Mr. Yoshikazu
  Yoshida, Mr. Yutaka Ido and Mr. Satoshi Akita of the research
  team. Many advancements that exceeded the technological levels at
  that time were incorporated into these components. Rather than to
  mention only my excellence, I believe it is more appropriate to
  say that the overall support of the research team was excellent.
  We were also probably influenced by the climate within Shimadzu
  Corporation, which provided a large degree of freedom for this
  type of research to a team composed of such young members.</p>

  <p>The product was developed based on our
  research results. These were announced for the first time outside
  the company at the Annual Conference of the Mass Spectrometry Society
  of Japan held in Kyoto in May 1987. At that time, the mass
  number that we had been able to measure had already exceeded
  48,000. However, this announcement did not cause much of a stir
  in the world of mass spectrometry. We, on the other hand, were
  just satisfied that we had achieved our goal and were able to
  announce it publicly. We were not at all troubled by the lack of
  reverberating excitement in the world of mass spectrometry. In
  September 1987, the Second Japan-China Joint Symposium on Mass
  Spectrometry was held in Takarazuka, Japan, and it was there that
  we announced our results in English for the first time (at that
  time we could measure mass numbers in the range of 72,000). There
  is a double significance here, in that not only were the research
  results written in English, I actually presented the results in
  English for the first time. Although my English was far from
  good, my meaning was well enough understood by Professor Cotter
  for him to make the results known around the world.</p>

  <p>Our first product, the "LAMS-50K," was put
  on the market in 1988. I visited many research laboratories at
  universities and companies to introduce and explain the product.
  I also performed analysis on many samples provided by potential
  customers. However, because the performance fell short of the
  expectations of customers performing analysis of biological
  samples, and because the instrument was so expensive, we were not
  able to sell any of these instruments in Japan. Ultimately, we
  were able to sell only one instrument, and that was to the City
  of Hope's Beckman Research Institute in the US, where the
  instrument's performance received a satisfactory evaluation
  (1990). After that, manufacture of this instrument was
  discontinued, and I was obliged to join the development team for
  Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) instruments, another
  kind of mass spectrometer.</p>

  <p>In May of 1989, Mr. Yoshikazu Yoshida and I
  won a Research Award from the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan
  for "Research on Macromolecular Ion Detection using a Laser
  Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometric Method." That was
  the only acknowledgement I had ever received publicly before
  being selected for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002. I was so
  pleased to receive that first award for the research in which I
  had participated.</p>

  <p>In January of 1992, I was transferred
  temporarily to KRATOS Analytical Ltd. (a subsidiary company of
  Shimadzu Corporation) in Manchester, England for a period of one
  year. This was my first experience to reside overseas, and it was
  a bewildering experience from various viewpoints, the most
  prominent being language and culture. To begin with, I was to act
  as a liaison between the two companies. However, I also joined
  the development team charged with developing compact MALDI mass
  spectrometers (KOMPACT MALDI series). Although I returned to
  Japan midway through the development project, I subsequently
  continued my cooperation through involvement in domestic sales of
  the product, as well as performing MALDI technology-related
  research. There are many engineers who dislike being involved in
  sales efforts through education of potential customers. But as
  long as I am an engineer, I think it is important to assure that
  customers obtain satisfaction with a product that I have had a
  hand in developing. Moreover, because such contact with customers
  widens one's own knowledge, this knowledge cannot but help in
  focusing on desirable features in development of the next
  product.</p>

  <p>In May of 1995, at the age of 35, I married
  Yuko Ikegami who also grew up in my native Toyama Prefecture.
  Thirty-five years of age is generally considered to be a bit late
  for a first marriage in Japan. Because I have always had a
  tendency to tense up whenever speaking to a woman, I never had
  good karma when it came to women. What's more, being so involved
  with work all the time, I had little time to think of marriage. I
  suppose the correct interpretation is that by the time I noticed,
  I was 35 years old. However, even for someone like me, my joy was
  undeniable when my wife said to me "There is nothing about you I
  don't like." In front of her, I lost my awkwardness and I am now
  able to behave naturally. Furthermore, after getting married, I
  became much more stable. I am normally too embarrassed to express
  my thanks verbally, but I want to take this opportunity to tell
  my wife "Thank you."</p>

  <p>From April of 1997 to May of 2002, I was
  posted once again to the UK for the purpose of developing a new
  type MALDI-MS called a "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption
  Ionization Quadrupole Ion Trap Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer
  (MALDI-QIT-TOFMS)" (Model Name: AXIMA-QIT). The theory and
  results were presented to the public for the first time at the
  Annual Conference of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry in 1999.</p>

  <p>One fond remembrance I have occurred in May
  of 2002. Just before leaving the KRATOS premises, I was summoned
  to the boardroom. When I entered the room, there was a surprise
  farewell party all prepared for me. I received as a present a
  bright red uniform with the number 7 printed on it, along with my
  name. Of course, number 7 is the number of the renowned football
  player David Beckham, a member of the world famous Manchester
  United football team, whose stadium is located very near the
  KRATOS home office.</p>

  <p>In May of 2002, I returned to Japan to
  begin preparing for sales of the new AXIMA-QIT product. I
  performed marketing to widen the sales opportunities of the
  instrument, and also continued feasibility studies on analytical
  methods for biological macromolecules beyond those for proteins.
  However, my destiny changed suddenly and dramatically with one
  telephone call from Sweden received on October 9, 2002.</p>

  <p>Until writing these passages, I have never
  looked back on my life as I am doing so now. I have always
  thought that I was doing what I desired to do, doing what was
  interesting to me. However, upon reflecting on my life in this
  way, it seems that my life is a product of my relationship with
  such factors as my birth, my family, teachers, friends,
  companions at work, and even the business world, geographical
  regions, the natural environment as well as my cultural
  environment. I am sure that receiving this Nobel Prize will also
  have an effect on my life. However, just as when there is an
  unexpected result in an experiment which brings a pleasant
  surprise, I hope that I will be able to continue enjoying my life
  in a natural manner after receiving this prize. It is my desire
  to keep walking through life as an engineer, and to continue
  producing results that are useful to society.</p>

  <p>Finally, I'd like to express my thanks to
  everyone who gave me the opportunity to walk freely through this
  life. "ARIGATO GOZAIMASU!"</p>
