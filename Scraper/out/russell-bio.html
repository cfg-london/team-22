  <h1>Bertrand Russell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="russell.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Bertrand Arthur William Russell</b>
  was born at Trelleck on 18th May, 1872. His parents were Viscount
  Amberley and Katherine, daughter of 2nd Baron Stanley of
  Alderley. At the age of three he was left an orphan. His father
  had wished him to be brought up as an agnostic; to avoid this he
  was made a ward of Court, and brought up by his grandmother.
  Instead of being sent to school he was taught by governesses and
  tutors, and thus acquired a perfect knowledge of French and
  German. In 1890 he went into residence at Trinity College,
  Cambridge, and after being a very high Wrangler and obtaining a
  First Class with distinction in philosophy he was elected a
  fellow of his college in 1895. But he had already left Cambridge
  in the summer of 1894 and for some months was attach&eacute; at the
  British embassy at Paris.</p>

  <p>In December 1894 he married Miss Alys
  Pearsall Smith. After spending some months in Berlin studying
  social democracy, they went to live near Haslemere, where he
  devoted his time to the study of philosophy. In 1900 he visited
  the Mathematical Congress at Paris. He was impressed with the
  ability of the Italian mathematician Peano and his pupils, and
  immediately studied Peano's works. In 1903 he wrote his first
  important book, <i>The Principles of Mathematics</i>, and with
  his friend Dr. Alfred Whitehead proceeded to develop and extend
  the mathematical logic of Peano and Frege. From time to time he
  abandoned philosophy for politics. In 1910 he was appointed
  lecturer at Trinity College. After the first World War broke out,
  he took an active part in the No Conscription fellowship and was
  fined &pound; 100 as the author of a leaflet criticizing a
  sentence of two years on a conscientious objector. His college
  deprived him of his lectureship in 1916. He was offered a post at
  Harvard university, but was refused a passport. He intended to
  give a course of lectures (afterwards published in America as
  <i>Political Ideals</i>, 1918) but was prevented by the military
  authorities. In 1918 he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment
  for a pacifistic article he had written in the <i>Tribunal</i>.
  His <i>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</i> (1919) was
  written in prison. His <i>Analysis of Mind</i> (1921) was the
  outcome of some lectures he gave in London, which were organized
  by a few friends who got up a subscription for the purpose.</p>

  <p>In 1920 Russell had paid a short visit to
  Russia to study the conditions of Bolshevism on the spot. In the
  autumn of the same year he went to China to lecture on philosophy
  at the Peking university. On his return in Sept. 1921,
  having been divorced by his first wife, he married Miss Dora
  Black. They lived for six years in Chelsea during the winter
  months and spent the summers near Lands End. In 1927 he and his
  wife started a school for young children, which they carried on
  until 1932. He succeeded to the earldom in 1931. He was divorced
  by his second wife in 1935 and the following year married
  Patricia Helen Spence. In 1938 he went to the United States and
  during the next years taught at many of the country's leading
  universities. In 1940 he was involved in legal proceedings when
  his right to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New
  York was questioned because of his views on morality. When his
  appointment to the college faculty was cancelled, he accepted a
  five-year contract as a lecturer for the Barnes foundation,
  Merion, Pa., but the cancellation of this contract was announced
  in Jan. 1943 by Albert C. Barnes, director of the foundation.</p>

  <p>Russell was elected a fellow of the Royal
  Society in 1908, and re-elected a fellow of Trinity College in
  1944. He was awarded the Sylvester medal of the Royal Society,
  1934, the de Morgan medal of the London Mathematical Society in
  the same year, the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1950.</p>

  <p>In a paper "Logical Atomism"
  (<i>Contemporary British Philosophy. Personal Statements</i>,
  First series. Lond. 1924) Russell exposed his views on his
  philosophy, preceded by a few words on historical
  development.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
