  <h1>Peter Mitchell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mitchell.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Peter
  Mitchell</b> was born in Mitcham, in the County of Surrey,
  England, on September 29, 1920. His parents, Christopher Gibbs
  Mitchell and Kate Beatrice Dorothy (n&eacute;e) Taplin, were very
  different from each other temperamentally. His mother was a shy
  and gentle person of very independent thought and action, with
  strong artistic perceptiveness. Being a rationalist and an
  atheist, she taught him that he must accept responsibility for
  his own destiny, and especially for his failings in life. That
  early influence may well have led him to adopt the religious
  atheistic personal philosophy to which he has adhered since the
  age of about fifteen. His father was a much more conventional
  person than his mother, and was awarded the O.B.E. for his
  success as a Civil Servant.<br>
  <br>
  Peter Mitchell was educated at Queens College, Taunton, and at
  Jesus college, Cambridge. At Queens he benefited particularly from
  the influence of the Headmaster, C.L. Wiseman, who was an
  excellent mathematics teacher and an accomplished amateur
  musician. The result of the scholarship examination that he took
  to enter Jesus College Cambridge was so dismally bad that he was
  only admitted to the University at all on the strength of a
  personal letter written by C.L. Wiseman. He entered Jesus College
  just after the commencement of war with Germany in 1939. In Part
  I of the Natural Sciences Tripos he studied physics, chemistry,
  physiology, mathematics and biochemistry, and obtained a Class
  III result. In part II, he studied biochemistry, and obtained a
  II-I result for his Honours Degree.<br>
  <br>
  He accepted a research post in the Department of Biochemistry,
  Cambridge, in 1942 at the invitation of J.F. Danielli. He was
  very fortunate to be Danielli's only Ph.D. student at that time,
  and greatly enjoyed and benefited from Danielli's friendly and
  unauthoritarian style of research supervision. Danielli
  introduced him to David Keilin, whom he came to love and respect
  more than any other scientist of his acquaintance.<br>
  <br>
  He received the degree of Ph.D. in early 1951 for work on the
  mode of action of penicillin, and held the post of Demonstrator
  at the Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, from 1950 to 1955.
  In 1955 he was invited by Professor Michael Swann to set up and
  direct a biochemical research unit, called the Chemical Biology
  Unit, in the Department of Zoology, Edinburgh University, where
  he was appointed to a Senior Lectureship in 1961, to a Readership
  in 1962, and where he remained until acute gastric ulcers led to
  his resignation after a period of leave in 1963.<br>
  <br>
  From 1963 to 1965, he withdrew completely from scientific
  research, and acted as architect and master of works, directly
  supervising the restoration of an attractive Regency-fronted
  Mansion, known as Glynn House, in the beautiful wooded Glynn
  Valley, near Bodmin, Cornwall - adapting and furnishing a major
  part of it for use as a research labotatory. In this, he was
  lucky to receive the enthusiastic support of his former research
  colleague Jennifer Moyle. He and Jennifer Moyle founded a
  charitable company, known as Glynn Research Ltd., to promote
  fundamental biological research and finance the work of the Glynn
  Research Laboratories at Glynn House. The original endowment of
  about &pound;250,000 was donated about equally by Peter Mitchell
  and his elder brother Christopher John Mitchell.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965, Peter Mitchell and Jennifer Moyle, with the practical
  help of one technician, Roy Mitchell (unrelated to Peter
  Mitchell), and with the administrative help of their company
  secretary, embarked on the programme of research on chemiosmotic
  reactions and reaction systems for which the Glynn Research
  Institute has become known. Since its inception, the Glynn
  Research Institute has not had sufficient financial resources to
  employ more than three research workers, including the Research
  Director, on its permanent staff. He has continued to act as
  Director of Research at the Glynn Research Institute up to the
  present time. An acute lack of funds has recently led to the
  possibility that the Glynn Research Institute may have to
  close.<br>
  <br>
  Beside his interest in communication between molecules, Peter
  Mitchell has become more and more interested in the problems of
  communication between individual people in civilised societies,
  especially in the context of the spread of violence in the
  increasingly collectivist societies in most parts of the world.
  His own experience of small and large organisations in the
  scientific world has led him to regard the small organisations as
  being, not only more alive and congenial, but also more
  effective, for many (although perhaps not all) purposes. He would
  therefore like to have the opportunity to become more deeply
  involved in studies of the ways in which sympathetic
  communication and cooperative activity between free and
  potentially independent people may be improved. One of his
  specific interests in this field of knowledge is the use of money
  as an instrument of personal responsibility and of choice in free
  societies, and the flagrant abuse and basically dishonest
  manipulation of the system of monetary units of value practised
  by the governments of most nations.</p>
