  <h1>Sully Prudhomme - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="prudhomme.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Rene Francois Armand
  Prudhomme</b> (1839-1907) was the son of a French shopkeeper. He
  wanted to become an engineer, but an eye disease terminated his
  training at a polytechnic institute. He studied literature, and
  after a brief and unsuccessful interlude in industry, he took up
  law, though without much conviction, and worked in a solicitor's
  office. Sully Prudhomme was a member of the &laquo;Conference La
  Bruy&egrave;re&raquo;, a distinguished student society, and the
  favourable reception that his fellow members gave to his
  juvenilia encouraged him to go on writing poetry. His first
  volume, <i>Stances et Po&egrave;mes</i> (1865) [Stanzas and Poems],
  was well reviewed by Sainte-Beuve and established his reputation.
  Sully Prudhomme combined a Parnassian regard for formal
  perfection and elegance with philosophic and scientific
  interests, which are revealed, for instance, in his translation
  of the first book of Lucretius' <i>De Rerum Natura</i> (1878-79).
  Some of his other poetic works are: <i>Croquis Italiens</i>
  (1866-68) [Italian Notebook]; <i>Solitudes</i> (1869);
  <i>Impressions de la guerre</i> (1870) [Impressions of War];
  <i>Les Destins</i> (1872) [Destinies]; <i>La R&eacute;volte des
  fleurs</i> (1872) [Revolt of the Flowers ]; <i>La France</i>
  (1874); <i>Les Vaines Tendresses</i> (1875) [Vain Endearments];
  <i>La Justice</i> (1878); and <i>Le Bonheur</i> (1888)
  [Happiness]. <i>Les Epaves</i> (1908) [Flotsam], published
  posthumously, was a collection of miscellaneous poems. A
  collected edition of his writings in five volumes appeared in
  1900-01. He also wrote essays and a book on Pascal, <i>La Vraie
  Religion selon Pascal</i> (1905) [Pascal on true Religion]. Sully
  Prudhomme was a member of the French Academy from 1881 until his
  death in 1907.</p>
