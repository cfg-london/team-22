  <h1>Sheldon Glashow - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="glashow.jpg" class="bio-img">My parents, Lewis Glashow and Bella
  n&eacute;e Rubin immigrated to New York City from Bobruisk in the
  early years of this century. Here they found the freedom and
  opportunity denied to Jews in Czarist Russia. After years of
  struggle, my father became a successful plumber, and his family
  could then enjoy the comforts of the middle class. While my
  parents never had the time or money to secure university
  education themselves, they were adamant that their children
  should. In comfort and in love, we were taught the joys of
  knowledge and of work well done. I only regret that neither my
  mother nor my father could live to see the day I would accept the
  Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  When I was born in Manhattan in 1932, my brothers Samuel and
  Jules were eighteen and fourteen years old. They chose careers of
  dentistry and medicine, to my parents' satisfaction. From an
  early age, I knew I would become a scientist. It may have been my
  brother Sam's doing. He interested me in the laws of falling
  bodies when I was ten, and helped my father equip a basement
  chemistry lab for me when I was fifteen. I became skilled in the
  synthesis of selenium halides. Never again would I do such
  dangerous research. Except for the occasional suggestion that I
  should become a physician and do science in my spare time, my
  parents always encouraged my scientific inclinations.<br>
  <br>
  Among my chums at the Bronx High School of Science were Gary Feinberg and
  Steven Weinberg. We spurred one another to learn physics while
  commuting on the New York subway. Another classmate, Dan
  Greenberger, taught me calculus in the school lunchroom.
  High-school mathematics then terminated with solid geometry. At
  Cornell
  University, I again had the good fortune to join a talented
  class. It included the mathematician Daniel Kleitman who was to
  become my brother-in-law, my old classmate Steven Weinberg, and
  many others who were to become prominent scientists. Throughout
  my formal education, I would learn as much from my peers as from
  my teachers. So it is today among our graduate students.<br>
  <br>
  I came to graduate school at Harvard University in 1954. My thesis
  supervisor, <a href="../1965/index.html">Julian Schwinger</a>,
  had about a dozen doctoral students at a time. Getting his ear
  was as difficult as it was rewarding. I called my thesis "The
  Vector Meson in Elementary Particle Decays", and it showed an
  early commitment to an electroweak synthesis. When I completed my
  work in 1958, Schwinger and I were to write a paper summarizing
  our thoughts on weak-electromagnetic unification. Alas, one of us
  lost the first draft of the manuscript, and that was that.<br>
  <br>
  I won an NSF postdoctoral fellowship, and planned to work at the
  Lebedev Institute in Moscow with <a href="../1958/index.html">I.
  Tamm</a>, who enthusiastically supported my proposal. I spent the
  tenure of my fellowship in Copenhagen at the Niels Bohr Institute
  (and, partly, at CERN), waiting for the Russian visa that was never
  to come. Perhaps all was for the best, because it was in these
  years (1958-60) that I discovered the SU(2) x U(1) structure of
  the electroweak theory. Interestingly, it was also in Copenhagen
  that my early work on charm with Bjorken was done. This was
  during a brief return to Denmark in 1964.<br>
  <br>
  During my stay in Europe, I was "discovered" by <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Murray Gell-Mann</a>. He presented my ideas
  on the algebraic structure of weak interactions to the 1960
  "Rochester meeting" and brought me to Caltech. Then, he
  invented the eightfold way, which kept Sidney Coleman and me
  distracted for several years. How we found various
  electromagnetic formulae, yet missed the discovery of the
  Gell-Mann-Okubo formula and of the Cabibbo current is another
  story.<br>
  <br>
  I became an assistant professor at Stanford
  University and then spent several years on the faculty of the
  University of
  California at Berkeley. During this time, I continued to
  exploit the phenomenological successes of flavor SU(3) and
  attempted to understand the departures from exact symmetry as a
  consequence of spontane23ous symmetry breakdown. I returned to
  Harvard University in 1966 where I have remained except for
  leaves to CERN, MIT, and the University of Marseilles. Today, I am
  Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard.<br>
  <br>
  In 1969, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani came to Harvard as
  research fellows. Together, we found the arguments that predicted
  the existence of charmed hadrons. Much of my later work was done
  in collaboration with Alvaro de Ruj&uacute;la or Howard Georgi. In
  early 1974, we predicted that charm would be discovered in
  neutrino physics or in e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>-</sup> annihilation.
  So it was. With the discovery of the J/Psi particle, we realized
  that many diverse strands of research were converging on a single
  theory of physics. I remember once saying to Howard that if QCD
  is so good, it should explain the Sigma-Lambda mass splitting.
  The next day he showed that it did. When we spoke, in 1974, of
  the unification of all elementary particle forces within a simple
  gauge group, and of the predicted instability of the proton, we
  were regarded as mad. How things change!<br>
  <br>
  The wild ideas of yesterday quickly become today's dogma. This
  year I have been honored to participate in the inauguration of
  the Harvard Core Curriculum Program. My students are not, and
  will never be, scientists. Nonetheless, in my course "From
  Alchemy to Quarks" they seem to be as fascinated as I am by the
  strange story of the search for the ultimate constituents of
  matter.<br>
  <br>
  I was married in 1972 to the former Joan Alexander. We live in a
  large old house with our four children, who attend the Brookline
  public schools.</p>
