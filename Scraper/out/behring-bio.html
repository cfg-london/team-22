  <h1>Emil von Behring - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="behring.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Emil Adolf
  Behring</b> was born on March 15, 1854 at Hansdorf, Deutsch-Eylau
  as the eldest son of the second marriage of a schoolmaster with a
  total of 13 children. Since the family could not afford to keep
  Emil at a University, he entered, in 1874, the well-known Army
  Medical College at Berlin. This made his studies financially
  practicable but also carried the obligation to stay in military
  service for several years after he had taken his medical degree
  (1878) and passed his State Examination (1880). He was then sent
  to Wohlau and Posen in Poland. Besides much practical work he
  found in Posen time to study (at the Chemical Department of the
  Experimental Station) problems connected with septic diseases. In
  the years 1881-1883 he carried out important investigations on
  the action of iodoform, stating that it does not kill microbes
  but may neutralize the poisons given off by them, thus being
  antitoxic. His first publications on these questions appeared in
  1882. The governing body concerned with military health, which
  was especially interested in the prevention and combating of
  epidemics, being aware of the ability of Behring, sent him to the
  pharmacologist C. Binz at Bonn for further training in
  experimental methods. In 1888 they ordered him back to Berlin,
  where he worked-undoubtedly in full agreement with his own wishes
  - as an assistant at the Institute of Hygiene under Robert Koch.
  He remained there for several years after 1889, and followed Koch
  when the latter moved to the Institute for Infectious Diseases.
  This appointment brought him into close association, not only
  with Koch, but also with P. Ehrlich, who joined, in 1890, the
  brilliant team of workers Koch had gathered round him. In 1894
  Behring became Professor of Hygiene at Halle, and the following
  year he moved to the corresponding chair at Marburg.<br>
  <br>
  Behring's most important researches were intimately bound up with
  the epoch-making work of Pasteur, <a href=
  "../1905/index.html">Koch</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/index.html">Ehrlich</a>, L&ouml;ffler,
  Roux, Yersin and others, which led the foundation of our modern
  knowledge of the immunology of bacterial diseases; but he is,
  himself, chiefly remembered for his work on diphtheria and on
  tuberculosis. During the years 1888-1890 E. Roux and A. Yersin,
  working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, had shown that
  filtrates of diphtheria cultures which contained no bacilli,
  contained a substance which they called a <i>toxin</i>, that
  produced, when injected into animals, all the symptoms of
  diphtheria. In 1890, L. Brieger and C. Fraenkel prepared, from
  cultures of diphtheria bacilli, a toxic substance, which they
  called <i>toxalbumin</i>, which when injected in suitable doses
  into guinea-pigs, immunized these animals to diphtheria.<br>
  <br>
  Starting from his observations on the action of iodoform, Behring
  tried to find whether a disinfection of the living organism might
  be obtained if animals were injected with material that had been
  treated with various disinfectants. Above all the experiments
  were performed with diphtheria and with tetanus bacilli. They led
  to the well-known development of a new kind of therapy for these
  two diseases. In 1890 Behring and S. Kitasato published their
  discovery that graduated doses of sterilised brothcultures of
  diphtheria or of tetanus bacilli caused the animals to produce,
  in their blood, substances which could neutralize the toxins
  which these bacilli produced <i>(antitoxins)</i>. They also
  showed that the antitoxins thus produced by one animal could
  immunize another animal and that it could cure an animal actually
  showing symptoms of diphtheria. This great discovery was soon
  confirmed and successfully used by other workers.<br>
  <br>
  Earlier in 1898, Behring and F. Wernicke had found that immunity
  to diphtheria could be produced by the injection into animals of
  diphtheria toxin neutralized by diphtheria antitoxin, and in 1907
  Theobald Smith had suggested that such toxin-antitoxin mixtures
  might be used to immunize man against this disease. It was
  Behring, however, who announced, in 1913, his production of a
  mixture of this kind, and subsequent work which modified and
  refined the mixture originally produced by Behring resulted in
  the modern methods of immunization which have largely banished
  diphtheria from the scourges of mankind. Behring himself saw in
  his production of this toxin-antitoxin mixture the possibility of
  the final eradication of diphtheria; and he regarded this part of
  his efforts as the crowning success of his life's work.<br>
  <br>
  From 1901 onwards Behring's health prevented him from giving
  regular lectures and he devoted himself chiefly to the study of
  tuberculosis. To facilitate his work a commercial firm in which
  he had a financial interest, built for him well-equipped
  laboratories at Marburg and in 1914 he himself founded, also in
  Marburg, the Behringwerke for the manufacture of sera and
  vaccines and for experimental work on these. His association with
  the production of sera and vaccines made him financially
  prosperous and he owned a large estate at Marburg, which was well
  stocked with cattle which he used for experimental
  purposes.<br>
  <br>
  The great majority of Behring's numerous publications have been
  made easily available in the editions of his <i>Gesammelte
  Abhandlungen</i> (Collected Papers) in 1893 and 1915.<br>
  <br>
  Numerous distinctions were conferred upon Behring. Already in
  1893 the title of Professor was conferred upon him, and two years
  later he became &laquo;Geheimer Medizinalrat&raquo; and officer of
  the French Legion of Honour. In the ensuing years followed
  honorary membership of Societies in Italy, Turkey and France; in
  1901, the year of his Nobel Prize, he was raised to the nobility,
  and in 1903 he was elected to the Privy Council with the title of
  Excellency. Later followed further honorary memberships in
  Hungary and Russia, as well as orders and medals from Germany,
  Turkey and Roumania. He also became an honorary freeman
  (Ehrenb&uuml;rger) of Marburg.<br>
  <br>
  In 1896 Behring married the 20 years old Else Spinola, daughter
  of the Director of the Charit&eacute; at Berlin. They had six
  sons. Behring died at Marburg on March 31, 1917.</p>
