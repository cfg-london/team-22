  <h1>Sir William Ramsay - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="ramsay.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>William
  Ramsay</b> was born in Glasgow on October 2, 1852, the son of
  William Ramsay, C.E. and Catherine, n&eacute;e Robertson. He was a
  nephew of the geologist, Sir Andrew Ramsay.<br>
  <br>
  Until 1870 he studied in his native town, following this with a
  period in Fittig's laboratory at T&uuml;bingen until 1872. While
  there his thesis on orthotoluic acid and its derivatives earned
  him the degree of doctor of philosophy.<br>
  <br>
  On his return to Scotland in 1872 he became assistant in
  chemistry at the Anderson College in Glasgow and two years
  later secured a similar position at the University there. In 1880
  he was appointed Principal and Professor of Chemistry at University College,
  Bristol, and moved on in 1887 to the Chair of Inorganic
  Chemistry at University College, London, a post which he held
  until his retirement in 1913.<br>
  <br>
  Ramsay's earliest works were in the field of organic chemistry.
  Besides his doctor's dissertation, about this period he published
  work on picoline and, in conjunction with Dobbie, on the
  decomposition products of the quinine alkaloids (1878-1879). From
  the commencement of the eighties he was chiefly active in
  physical chemistry, his many contributions to this branch of
  chemistry being mostly on stoichiometry and thermodynamics. To
  these must be added his investigations carried on with Sidney
  Young on evaporation and dissociation (1886-1889) and his work on
  solutions of metals (1889).<br>
  <br>
  It was however in inorganic chemistry that his most celebrated
  discoveries were made. As early as 1885-1890 he published several
  notable papers on the oxides of nitrogen and followed those up
  with the discovery of argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon.
  Led to the conclusion by different paths and, at first, without
  working together, both <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">Lord Rayleigh</a> and Sir
  William Ramsay succeeded in proving that there must exist a
  previously unknown gas in the atmosphere. They subsequently
  worked in their separate laboratories on this problem but
  communicated the results of their labours almost daily. At the
  meeting of the British Association in August 1894, they announced
  the discovery of argon.<br>
  <br>
  While seeking sources of argon in the mineral kingdom, Ramsay
  discovered helium in 1895. Guided by theoretical considerations
  founded on Mendeleev's periodic system, he then methodically
  sought the missing links in the new group of elements and found
  neon, krypton, and xenon (1898).<br>
  <br>
  Yet another discovery of Ramsay (in conjunction with <a href=
  "../1921/index.html">Soddy</a>), the importance of which it was
  impossible to foresee, was the detection of helium in the
  emanations of radium (1903).<br>
  <br>
  With regard to the scientific honours which - besides the Nobel
  Prize have been awarded to Ramsay, mention can be made of a great
  number of honorary memberships, viz. of the Institut de France,
  the Royal Academies of Ireland, Berlin, Bohemia, The
  Netherlands, Rome, Petrograd, Turin, Roumania, Vienna, Norway
  and <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1904/ramsay-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/en/" target="_blank">Sweden</a>; the Academies of Geneva, Frankfurt and
  Mexico; the German Chemical Society; the Royal Medical and
  Chirurgical Society of London; the Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine
  de Paris; the Pharmaceutical Society, and the Philosophical
  Societies of Manchester, Philadelphia and Rotterdam. He also
  received the Davy and Longstaff Medals, honorary doctorate of
  Dublin University, the Barnardo Medal and a prize of $ 5,000 from
  the Smithsonian Institution, a prize of Fr. 25,000 from France
  (together with <a href="../1906/index.html">Moissan</a>), and the
  A.W. Hoffmann Medal in gold (Berlin, 1903). He was created
  K.C.B.(Knight Commander of the Order of Bath) in 1902, and was
  also a Knight of the Prussian order "Pour le m&eacute;rite",
  Commander of the Crown of Italy, and Officer of the Legion
  d'Honneur of France.<br>
  <br>
  In 1881 Ramsay married Margaret, the daughter of George Stevenson
  Buchanan. They had one son and one daughter. His recreations were
  languages and travelling.<br>
  <br>
  Sir William Ramsay died at High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on July
  23, 1916.</p>
