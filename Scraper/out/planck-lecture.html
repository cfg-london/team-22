  <h2>The Genesis and Present State of Development of the Quantum
  Theory</h2>

  <p>If I take it correctly that the duty
  imposed upon me today is to give a public lecture on my writings,
  then I believe that this task, the importance of which I am well
  aware through the gratitude felt towards the noble-minded founder
  of our Foundation, cannot be more suitably fulfilled than by my
  trying to give you the story of the origin of the quantum theory
  in broad outlines and to couple with this, a picture in a small
  frame, of the development of this theory up to now, and its
  present-day significance for physics.</p>

  <p>When I look back to the time, already
  twenty years ago, when the concept and magnitude of the physical
  quantum of action began, for the first time, to unfold from the
  mass of experimental facts, and again, to the long and ever
  tortuous path which led, finally, to its disclosure, the whole
  development seems to me to provide a fresh illustration of the
  long-since proved saying of Goethe's that man errs as long as he
  strives. And the whole strenuous intellectual work of an
  industrious research worker would appear, after all, in vain and
  hopeless, if he were not occasionally through some striking facts
  to find that he had, at the end of all his criss-cross journeys,
  at last accomplished at least one step which was conclusively
  nearer the truth. An indispensable hypothesis, even though still
  far from being a guarantee of success, is however the pursuit of
  a specific aim, whose lighted beacon, even by initial failures,
  is not betrayed.</p>

  <p>For many years, such an aim for me was to
  find the solution to the problem of the distribution of energy in
  the normal spectrum of radiating heat. Since Gustav Kirchhoff has
  shown that the state of the heat radiation which takes place in a
  cavity bounded by any emitting and absorbing substances of
  uniform temperature is entirely independent upon the nature of
  the substances, a universal function was demonstrated which was
  dependent only upon temperature and wavelength, but in no way
  upon the properties of any substance. And the discovery of this
  remarkable function promised deeper insight into the connection
  between energy and temperature which is, in fact, the major
  problem in thermodynamics and thus in the whole of molecular
  physics. To attain this there was no other way but to seek out
  from all the different substances existing in Nature one of known
  emissive and absorptive power, and to calculate the properties of
  the heat radiation in stationary energy exchange with it.
  According to Kirchhoff's Law, this would have to prove
  independent of the nature of the body.</p>

  <p>Heinrich Hertz's linear oscillator, whose
  laws of emission, for a given frequency, Hertz had just
  previously completely developed, seemed to me to be a
  particularly suitable device for this purpose. If a number of
  such Hertzian oscillators are set up within a cavity surrounded
  by a sphere of reflecting walls, then by analogy with audio
  oscillators and resonators, energy will be exchanged between them
  by the output and absorption of electromagnetic waves, and
  finally stationary radiation corresponding to Kirchhoff's Law,
  the so-called black-body radiation, should be set up within the
  cavity. I was filled at that time with what would be thought
  today naively charming and agreeable expectations, that the laws
  of classical electrodynamics would, if approached in a
  sufficiently general manner with the avoidance of special
  hypotheses, be sufficient to enable us to grasp the most
  significant part of the process to be expected, and thus to
  achieve the desired aim. I, therefore, developed first the laws
  of emission and absorption of a linear resonator on the most
  general basis, in fact I proceeded on such a detour which could
  well have been avoided had I made use of the existing electron
  theory of <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/index.html">H.A.
  Lorentz</a>, already basically complete. But since I did not
  quite trust the electron hypothesis, I preferred to observe that
  energy which flowed in and out through an enclosing spherical
  surface around the resonator at a suitable distance from it. By
  this method, only processes in a pure vacuum came into account,
  but a knowledge of these was sufficient to draw the necessary
  conclusions however, about the energy changes in the
  resonator.</p>

  <p>The fruit of this long series of
  investigations, of which some, by comparison with existing
  observations, mainly the vapour measurements by V. Bjerknes, were
  susceptible to checking, and were thereby confirmed, was the
  establishment of the general connection between the energy of a
  resonator of specific natural period of vibration and the energy
  radiation of the corresponding spectral region in the surrounding
  field under conditions of stationary energy exchange. The
  noteworthy result was found that this connection was in no way
  dependent upon the nature of the resonator, particularly its
  attenuation constants - a circumstance which I welcomed happily
  since the whole problem thus became simpler, for instead of the
  energy of radiation, the energy of the resonator could be taken
  and, thereby, a complex system, composed of many degrees of
  freedom, could be replaced by a simple system of one degree of
  freedom.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the result meant no more than
  a preparatory step towards the initial onslaught on the
  particular problem which now towered with all its fearsome height
  even steeper before me. The first attempt upon it went wrong, for
  my original secret hope that the radiation emitted from the
  resonator can be in some characteristic way or other
  distinguished from the absorbed radiation and thereby allow a
  differential equation to be set up, from the integration of which
  one could gain some special condition for the properties of
  stationary radiation, proved false. The resonator reacted only to
  those rays which it also emitted, and was not in the slightest
  bit sensitive to the adjacent spectral regions.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, my hypothesis that the
  resonator could exercise a unilateral, i.e. irreversible, effect
  upon the energy in the surrounding radiation field, was strongly
  contested by Ludwig Boltzmann, who, with his riper experience in
  these problems, proved that according to the laws of classical
  dynamics each of the processes observed by me can proceed in
  exactly the opposite direction, in such a way, that a spherical
  wave emitted from the resonator, returns and contracts in
  steadily diminishing concentric spherical surfaces inwards to the
  resonator, and is again absorbed by it, thereby allowing the
  formerly absorbed energy to be re-transmitted into space in the
  direction from which it came. And when I excluded this kind of
  singular process, such as an inwardly directed wave, by means of
  the introduction of a limiting definition, the hypothesis of
  natural radiation, all these analyses still showed ever more
  clearly that an important connecting element or term, essential
  for the complete grasp of the core of the problem, must be
  missing.</p>

  <p>So there was nothing left for me but to
  tackle the problem from the opposite side, that of
  thermodynamics, in which field I felt, moreover, more confident.
  In fact my earlier studies of the Second Law of Heat Theory stood
  me in good stead, so that from the start I tried to get a
  connection, not between the temperature but rather the entropy of
  the resonator and its energy, and in fact, not its entropy
  exactly but the second derivative with respect to the energy
  since this has a direct physical meaning for the irreversibility
  of the energy exchange between resonator and radiation. Since I
  was, however, at that time still too far oriented towards the
  phenomenological aspect to come to closer quarters with the
  connection between entropy and probability, I saw myself, at
  first, relying solely upon the existing results of experience. In
  the foreground of interest at that time, in 1899, was the energy
  distribution law established by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/index.html">W. Wien</a> shortly before,
  whose experimental proof was taken up, on the one hand, by F.
  Paschen at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover, and, on the
  other hand, by O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim at the State
  Institution in Charlottenburg. This law brought out the
  dependence of the radiation intensity on the temperature,
  representing it by an exponential function. If one calculates the
  connection between the entropy and the energy of a resonator,
  determined by the above law, the remarkable result is obtained
  that the reciprocal value of the above-mentioned differential
  coefficient, which I will call <i>R</i>, is proportional to the
  energy. This extremely simple relationship can be considered as
  the completely adequate expression of Wien's energy distribution
  law; for with the dependence upon the energy, the dependence upon
  the wavelength is always directly given through the general,
  well-established displacement law by Wien.</p>

  <p>Since the whole problem concerned a
  universal law of Nature, and since at that time, as still today,
  I held the unshakeable opinion that the simpler the presentation
  of a particular law of Nature, the more general it is - though at
  the same time, which formula to take as the simpler, is a problem
  which cannot always be confidently and finally decided - I
  believed for a long time that the law that the quantity <i>R</i>
  is proportional to the energy, should be looked upon as the basis
  for the whole energy distribution law. This concept could not be
  maintained for long in the face of fresh measurements. Whilst for
  small values of the energy and for short waves, Wien's law was
  satisfactorily confirmed, noteworthy deviations for larger
  wavelengths were found, first by O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim, and
  finally by H. Rubens and F. Kurlbaum, whose measurements on the
  infrared residual rays of fluorite and rock salt revealed a
  totally different, though still extremely simple relationship,
  characterized by the fact that the quantity <i>R</i> is not
  proportional to the energy, but to the square of the energy, and
  in fact this holds with increasing accuracy for greater energies
  and wavelengths.</p>

  <p>So, through direct experiment, two simple
  limits were determined for the function <i>R</i>: for small
  energies, proportionality with the energy; for greater energies,
  proportionality with the square of the energy. There was no
  better alternative but to make, for the general case, the
  quantity R equal to the sum of two terms, one of the first power,
  and one of the second power of the energy, so that for small
  energies the first is predominant, whilst for the greater
  energies the second is dominant. Thus the new radiation formula
  was found, which, in the face of its experimental proof, has
  stood firm to a reasonable extent until now. Even today,
  admittedly, we cannot talk of final exact confirmation. In fact,
  a fresh attempt at proof is urgently required.</p>

  <p>However, even if the radiation formula
  should prove itself to be absolutely accurate, it would still
  only have, within the significance of a happily chosen
  interpolation formula, a strictly limited value. For this reason,
  I busied myself, from then on, that is, from the day of its
  establishment, with the task of elucidating a true physical
  character for the formula, and this problem led me automatically
  to a consideration of the connection between entropy and
  probability, that is, Boltzmann's trend of ideas; until after
  some weeks of the most strenuous work of my life, light came into
  the darkness, and a new undreamed-of perspective opened up before
  me.</p>

  <p>I must make a small intercalation at this
  point. According to Boltzmann, entropy is a measure for physical
  probability, and the nature and essence of the Second Law of Heat
  Theory is that in Nature a state occurs more frequently, the more
  probable it is. Now one always measures in Nature the difference
  in entropies, never the entropy itself, and to this extent one
  cannot speak of the absolute entropy of a state, without a
  certain arbitrariness. Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce
  the suitably defined absolute value of entropy, namely for the
  reason that with its help certain general laws can be
  particularly easily formulated. The case seems to be parallel, as
  I see it, with that of energy. Energy itself cannot be measured,
  only its difference. For that reason one used to deal, not with
  energy, but with work, and even Ernst Mach, who had so much to do
  with the Law of Conservation of Energy, and who in principle kept
  away from all speculations beyond the field of observation, has
  always avoided speaking of energy itself. Likewise, in
  thermochemistry, one has always stuck to the thermal effect, that
  is, to energy differences, until <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1909/index.html">Wilhelm Ostwald</a> in
  particular emphatically showed that many detailed considerations
  could be significantly abbreviated if one dealt with energy
  itself instead of with calorimetric numbers. The additive
  constant which was at first still undetermined in the expression
  for energy, has later been finally determined through the
  relativistic law of the proportionality between energy and
  inertia.</p>

  <p>In a similar way to that for energy, an
  absolute value can be defined also for entropy and, as a result
  thereof, for the physical probability too, e.g. by so fixing the
  additive constant that energy and entropy disappear together. On
  the basis of a consideration of this kind a specific, relatively
  simple combinatorial method was obtained for the calculation of
  the physical probability of a specified energy distribution in a
  system of resonators, which led exactly to that entropy
  expression determined by the radiation law, and it brought me
  much-valued satisfaction for the many disappointments when Ludwig
  Boltzmann, in the letter returning my essay, expressed his
  interest and basic agreement with the train of thoughts expounded
  in it.</p>

  <p>For the numerical treatment of the
  indicated consideration of probability, knowledge of two
  universal constants is required, both of which have an
  independent physical meaning, and whose subsequent evaluation
  from the law of radiation must provide proof as to whether the
  whole method is to be looked upon as a mere artifice for
  calculation, or whether it has an inherent real physical sense
  and interpretation. The first constant is of a more formal nature
  and is connected with the definition of temperature. If
  temperature were to be defined as the average kinetic energy of a
  molecule in an ideal gas, that is, as a tiny, little quantity,
  then the constant would have the value 2/3. In conventional
  temperature measure, on the contrary, the constant has an
  extremely small value which stands, naturally, in close
  association with the energy of a single molecule, and an exact
  knowledge of which leads, therefore, to the calculation of the
  mass of a molecule and those parameters related to it. This
  constant is often referred to as Boltzmann's constant, although,
  to my knowledge, Boltzmann himself never introduced it - a
  peculiar state of affairs, which can be explained by the fact
  that Boltzmann, as appears from his occasional utterances, never
  gave thought to the possibility of carrying out an exact
  measurement of the constant. Nothing can better illustrate the
  positive and hectic pace of progress which the art of
  experimenters has made over the past twenty years, than the fact
  that since that time, not only one, but a great number of methods
  have been discovered for measuring the mass of a molecule with
  practically the same accuracy as that attained for a planet.</p>

  <p>At the time when I carried out the
  corresponding calculation from the radiation law, an exact proof
  of the number obtained was quite impossible, and not much more
  could be done than to determine the order of magnitude which was
  admissible. It was shortly afterward that <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">E. Rutherford</a> and H.
  Geiger succeeded in determining, by direct counting of the alpha
  particles, the value of the electrical elementary charge, which
  they found to be 4.65 x 10<sup>-10</sup> electrostatic units; and
  the agreement of this figure with the number calculated by me,
  4.69 x 10<sup>-10</sup>, could be taken as decisive confirmation
  of the usefulness of my theory. Since then, more sophisticated
  methods have led to a slightly higher value, these measurements
  being carried out by E. Regener, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/index.html">R.A. Millikan</a>, and
  others.</p>

  <p>The explanation of the second universal
  constant of the radiation law was not so easy. Because it
  represents the product of energy and time (according to the first
  calculation it was 6.55 x 10<sup>-27</sup> erg sec), I described
  it as the elementary quantum of action. Whilst it was completely
  indispensable for obtaining the correct expression for entropy -
  since only with its help could the magnitude of the "elementary
  regions" or "free rooms for action" of the probability, decisive
  for the assigned probability consideration, be determined - it
  proved elusive and resistant to all efforts to fit it into the
  framework of classical theory. As long as it was looked upon as
  infinitely small, that is, for large energies or long periods of
  time, everything went well; but in the general case, however, a
  gap yawned open in some place or other, which was the more
  striking, the weaker and faster the vibrations that were
  considered. The foundering of all efforts to bridge the chasm
  soon left little doubt. Either the quantum of action was a
  fictional quantity, then the whole deduction of the radiation law
  was in the main illusory and represented nothing more than an
  empty non-significant play on formulae, or the derivation of the
  radiation law was based on a sound physical conception. In this
  case the quantum of action must play a fundamental role in
  physics, and here was something entirely new, never before heard
  of, which seemed called upon to basically revise all our physical
  thinking, built as this was, since the establishment of the
  infinitesimal calculus by Leibniz and Newton, upon the acceptance
  of the continuity of all causative connections.</p>

  <p>Experiment has decided for the second
  alternative. That the decision could be made so soon and so
  definitely was due not to the proving of the energy distribution
  law of heat radiation, still less to the special derivation of
  that law devised by me, but rather should it be attributed to the
  restless forwardthrusting work of those research workers who used
  the quantum of action to help them in their own investigations
  and experiments. The first impact in this field was made by
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">A. Einstein</a> who,
  on the one hand, pointed out that the introduction of the energy
  quanta, determined by the quantum of action, appeared suitable
  for obtaining a simple explanation for a series of noteworthy
  observations during the action of light, such as Stokes' Law,
  electron emission, and gas ionization, and, on the other hand,
  derived a formula for the specific heat of a solid body through
  the identification of the expression for the energy of a system
  of resonators with that of the energy of a solid body, and this
  formula expresses, more or less correctly, the changes in
  specific heat, particularly its reduction with falling
  temperature. The result was the emergence, in all directions, of
  a number of problems whose more accurate and extensive
  elaboration in the course of time brought to light a mass of
  valuable material. I cannot give here even an approximate report
  on the abundance of the work carried out. Only the most important
  and characteristic steps along the path of progressive knowledge
  can be high-lighted here.</p>

  <p>First come thermal and chemical processes.
  As far as the specific heat of solid bodies is concerned,
  Einstein's theory, which rested upon the assumption of a single
  natural vibration of the atom, was extended by M. Born and Th.
  von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n to the case of various kinds of natural
  vibrations, which approached more nearly to the truth. P. Debye
  succeeded, by means of a bold simplification of the stipulations
  for the character of natural vibrations, in producing a
  relatively simple formula for the specific heat of solid bodies
  which, particularly for low temperatures, not only satisfactorily
  reproduces the measurements obtained by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/index.html">W. Nernst</a> and his
  pupils, but is also compatible with the elastic and optical
  properties of these substances. The quantum of action also comes
  to the fore in considering the specific heat of gases. W. Nernst
  had earlier suggested that to the quantum of energy of a
  vibration there must also correspond a quantum of energy of a
  rotation, and accordingly it was to be expected that the
  rotational energy of the gas molecules would disappear with
  falling temperature. The measurements by A. Eucken on the
  specific heat of hydrogen confirmed this conclusion, and if the
  calculations of A. Einstein and O. Stern, P. Ehrenfest and others
  have not until now afforded any completely satisfactory
  agreement, this lies understandably in our, as yet, incomplete
  knowledge of the model of a hydrogen molecule. The fact that the
  rotations of the gas molecules, as specified by quantum
  conditions, do really exist in Nature, can no longer be doubted
  in view of the work on absorption bands in the infrared by N.
  Bjerrum, E. von Bahr, H. Rubens, G. Hetmer and others, even
  though it has not been possible to give an all-round exhaustive
  explanation of this remarkable rotation spectra up to now.</p>

  <p>Since, ultimately, all affinity properties
  of a substance are determined by its entropy, the
  quantum-theoretical calculation of the entropy opens up the way
  to all the problems of chemical relationships. The Nemst chemical
  constant, which O. Sackur calculated directly through a
  combinatorial method as applied to oscillators, is characteristic
  for the absolute value of the entropy of a gas. H. Tetrode, in
  close association with the data to be obtained by measurement,
  determined the difference in entropy values between vapour and
  solid state by studying an evaporation process.</p>

  <p>Whilst in the cases so far considered,
  states of thermodynamic equilibrium are concerned, for which
  therefore the measurements can only yield statistically average
  values relating to many particles and lengthy periods of time,
  the observation of electron impacts leads directly to the dynamic
  details of the process under examination. Thus the determination
  of the so-called resonance potential carried out by J. Franck and
  G. Hertz, or that concerning the critical velocity is the minimum
  an electron must possess in order to cause emission of a light
  quantum or photon by impact with a neutral atom, supplied a
  method of measuring the quantum of action which was as direct as
  could be wished for. The experiments by D.L. Webster and E.
  Wagner and others resulted in the development of methods suitable
  for the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/index.html">R&ouml;ntgen</a> spectrum
  which also gave completely compatible results.</p>

  <p>The production of photons by electron
  impact appears as the reverse process to that of electron
  emission through irradiation by light-, R&ouml;ntgen-, or
  gamma-rays and again here, the energy quanta, determined by the
  quantum of action and by the vibration frequency, play a
  characteristic role, as could be recognized, already at an early
  time, from the striking fact that the velocity of the emitted
  electrons is not determined by the intensity of radiation, but
  only by the colour of the light incident upon the substance. Also
  from the quantitative aspect, Einstein's equations with respect
  to the light quantum have proved true in every way, as
  established by R.A. Millikan, in particular, by measurements of
  the escape velocity of emitted electrons, whilst the significance
  of the photon for the initiation of photochemical reactions was
  discovered by E. Warburg.</p>

  <p>If the various experiments and experiences
  gathered together by me up to now, from the different fields of
  physics, provide impressive proof in favour of the existence of
  the quantum of action, the quantum hypothesis has, nevertheless,
  its greatest support from the establishment and development of
  the atom theory by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>. For it fell
  to this theory to discover, in the quantum of action, the
  long-sought key to the entrance gate into the wonderland of
  spectroscopy, which since the discovery of spectral analysis had
  obstinately defied all efforts to breach it. And now that the way
  was opened, a sudden flood of new-won knowledge poured out over
  the whole field including the neighbouring fields in physics and
  chemistry. The first brilliant acquisition was the derivation of
  Balmer's series formula for hydrogen and helium including the
  reduction of the universal Rydberg constant to merely known
  numerical quantities, whereby even the small discrepancies for
  hydrogen and helium were recognized as essentially determined by
  the weak motion of the heavy atom nucleus. Investigation then
  turned to other series in the optical and the R&ouml;ntgen
  spectrum using the extremely fruitful Ritz combination principle,
  which was at last revealed clearly in all its fundamental
  significance.</p>

  <p>Whoever, in view of the numerous agreements
  which in the case of the special accuracy of spectroscopic
  measurements could lay claim to particularly striking
  confirmatory power, might have been still inclined to feel that
  it was all attributable to the play of chance, would been forced,
  finally, to discard even his last doubt, as A. Sommerfeld showed
  that from a logical extension of the laws of quantum distribution
  in systems with several degrees of freedom, and out of
  consideration of the variability of the inertial mass in
  accordance with the relativity theory, that magic formula arose
  before which both the hydrogen and the helium spectrum had to
  reveal the riddle of their fine structure, to such an extent that
  the finest present-day measurements, those of F. Paschen, could
  be explained generally through it - an achievement fully
  comparable with that of the famous discovery of the planet
  Neptune whose existence and orbit was calculated by Leverrier
  before the human eye had seen it. Progressing further along the
  same path, P. Epstein succeeded in fully explaining the Stark
  effect of the electrical splitting up of the spectral lines, P.
  Debye produced a simple explanation of the K-series of the
  R&ouml;ntgen spectrum, which had been investigated by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1924/index.html">Manne Siegbahn</a>, and now
  followed a great number of further experiments, which illuminated
  with more or less success the dark secrets of the construction of
  the atom.</p>

  <p>After all these results, towards whose
  complete establishment still many reputable names ought
  essentially to have been mentioned here, there is no other
  decision left for a critic who does not intend to resist the
  facts, than to award to the quantum of action, which by each
  different process in the colourful show of processes, has
  ever-again yielded the same result, namely, 6.52 x
  10<sup>-27</sup> erg sec, for its magnitude, full citizenship in
  the system of universal physical constants. It must certainly
  appear a unique coincidence that just in that time when the ideas
  of general relativity have broken through, and have led to
  fantastic results, Nature should have revealed an "absolute" in a
  place where it could be least expected, an invariable unit, in
  fact, by means of which the action quantity, contained in a
  space-time element, can be represented by a completely definite
  non-arbitrary number, and thereby divested itself of its (until
  now) relative character.</p>

  <p>To be sure, the introduction of the quantum
  of action has not yet produced a genuine quantum theory. In fact,
  the path the research worker must yet tread to it is not less
  than that from the discovery of the velocity of light by Olaf
  R&ouml;mer to the establishment of Maxwell's theory of light. The
  difficulties which the introduction of the quantum of action into
  the well-tried classical theory has posed right from the start
  have already been mentioned by me. During the course of the years
  they have increased rather than diminished, and if, in the
  meantime, the impetuous forward-driving research has passed to
  the order of the day for some of these, temporarily, the gaps
  left behind, awaiting subsequent filling, react even harder upon
  the conscientious systematologist. What serves in Bohr's theory
  as a basis to build up the laws of action, is assembled out of
  specific hypotheses which, up to a generation ago, would
  undoubtedly have been flatly rejected altogether by every
  physicist. The fact that in the atom, certain quite definite
  quantum-selected orbits play a special role, might be taken still
  as acceptable, less easily however, that the electrons,
  circulating in these orbits with definite acceleration, radiate
  no energy at all. The fact that the quite sharply defined
  frequency of an emitted photon should be different from the
  frequency of the emitting electron must seem to a theoretical
  physicist, brought up in the classical school, at first sight to
  be a monstrous and, for the purpose of a mental picture, a
  practically intolerable demand.</p>

  <p>But numbers decide, and the result is that
  the roles, compared with earlier times, have gradually changed.
  What initially was a problem of fitting a new and strange
  element, with more or less gentle pressure, into what was
  generally regarded as a fixed frame has become a question of
  coping with an intruder who, after appropriating an assured
  place, has gone over to the offensive; and today it has become
  obvious that the old framework must somehow or other be burst
  asunder. It is merely a question of where and to what degree. If
  one may make a conjecture about the expected escape from this
  tight comer, then one could remark that all the signs suggest
  that the main principles of thermodynamics from the classical
  theory will not only rule unchallenged but will more probably
  become correspondingly extended. What the armchair experiments
  meant for the foundation of classical thermodynamics, the
  adiabatic hypothesis of P. Ehrenfest means, provisionally, to the
  quantum theory; and in the same way as R. Clausius, as a starting
  point for the measurement of entropy, introduced the principle
  that, when treated appropriately, any two states of a material
  system can, by a reversible process, undergo a transition from
  one to the other, now the new ideas of Bohr's open up a very
  similar path into the interior of a wonderland hitherto hidden
  from him.</p>

  <p>There is in particular one problem whose
  exhaustive solution could provide considerable elucidation. What
  becomes of the energy of a photon after complete emission? Does
  it spread out in all directions with further propagation in the
  sense of Huygens' wave theory, so constantly taking up more
  space, in boundless progressive attenuation? Or does it fly out
  like a projectile in one direction in the sense of Newton's
  emanation theory? In the first case, the quantum would no longer
  be in the position to concentrate energy upon a single point in
  space in such a way as to release an electron from its atomic
  bond, and in the second case, the main triumph of the Maxwell
  theory - the continuity between the static and the dynamic fields
  and, with it, the complete understanding we have enjoyed, until
  now, of the fully investigated interference phenomena - would
  have to be sacrificed, both being very unhappy consequences for
  today's theoreticians.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, in any case no doubt can
  arise that science will master the dilemma, serious as it is, and
  that which appears today so unsatisfactory will in fact
  eventually, seen from a higher vantage point, be distinguished by
  its special harmony and simplicity. Until this aim is achieved,
  the problem of the quantum of action will not cease to inspire
  research and fructify it, and the greater the difficulties which
  oppose its solution, the more significant it finally will show
  itself to be for the broadening and deepening of our whole
  knowledge in physics.</p>
