  <h1>Zhores I. Alferov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="alferov.jpg" class="bio-img">Life goes on surprisingly fast. It seems to
  happen a short time ago that I would attend anniversary
  celebrations in honour of noted physicists, my teachers who to my
  mind looked quite old. But at the present time, I myself have
  recently marked the 70th birthday.</p>

  <p>My parents, Ivan Karpovich, and Anna
  Vladimirovna, had been Byelorussia born and raised. At the age of
  eighteen my father arrived in Saint Petersburg, in the year 1912.
  In his early hard years, he had been a docker, an errand boy and
  consequently got a job as a worker at the "Lessner" plant (later
  the Karl Marx Plant).</p>

  <p>During World War I, he was a brave hussar,
  a non-commissioned officer of the Life Guards, a holder of the
  St. George Order. In September 1917, my father joined the
  Bolshevik party and retained his adherence to the socialist and
  communist principles to the end of his life.</p>

  <p>In childhood, my brother and I "with a
  sinking heart" used to listen to father's stories about the civil
  war and his military career. We learned how the formerly
  non-commissioned officer had been appointed to take command of a
  cavalry regiment in Red Army. Father also used to tell us about
  his meetings with revolutionary leaders: V.I. Lenin, L.D.
  Trotsky, B.E. Dumenko, "comrade Andrey" (A. Solts) who always put
  his apartment in the "Embankment House" at my father's disposal
  while we stayed in Moscow. Father graduated from the Industrial
  Academy in 1935 and since then destiny was throwing us all over
  the country: Stalingrad, Novosibirsk, Barnaul, Syas'stroy in the
  environs of Leningrad, Turinsk (Sverdlovsk region), where we
  lived throughout the war time, and eventually the Minsk-city
  lying in ruins after the war. Dad was given a new assignment as
  director of a factory, joint enterprises (corporation of
  enterprises), later director of a trust. Mother headed a public
  organization of housewives; worked as a librarian and always
  remained our close friend while bringing us up without
  discouraging words. As a result of being so-called "director's
  boys", my brother and I tried to behave ourselves and to act in
  the way that people thought was correct and proper both at school
  and in public.</p>

  <p>Learning was easy to me, and dependable
  defender, my elder brother Marx, made my existence cloudless at
  school and outdoors as well. Marx had graduated high school on
  June 21, 1941 (next day the Nazi invasion started) in the town of
  Syas'stroy and shortly after that we left for the Urals to
  Turinsk city as Dad had been assigned there to a post of director
  of a newly-built gunpowder cellulose factory (at the time
  referred to as factory No. 3). My elder brother, who was
  seventeen years old then, joined the Urals Industrial Institute
  (the Energy Faculty). The young student considered the problem of
  energy to be of cardinal importance for the future. But not long
  did he study at the Institute. He decided to defend his
  Motherland and to fight against fascists at the front line.</p>

  <p>He passed Stalingrad, Kharkov, the Kursk
  battle. Having recovered after heavy head injury he was sent to
  the Army in the Field again. That was so called "another
  Stalingrad", i.e., the Korsun-Shevchenko battle, where in his 20
  years was shot down a Guard junior lieutenant Marx Ivanovich
  Alferov, my elder brother who remained of 20 years forever.</p>

  <p>In October 1943, on the way to front from a
  hospital he spent 3 days with us in Sverdlovsk. I often look back
  and reflect on those three days; on his description of the war,
  his youthful enthusiasm and faith in the power of science,
  technology and human intelligence.</p>

  <p>In the post-war particular situation I
  attended an only boy's school in the destroyed Minsk-city, and
  was lucky in having an excellent physics teacher there Yakov
  Borisovich Meltserson. He delivered lectures on physics for us,
  rather naughty boys, and we were sitting quiet and listened
  attentively. The teacher loved physics devotedly and had a gift
  of making our imagination work. His explanation of the cathode
  oscilloscope operation and talk on radar systems greatly
  impressed me. When finishing the school I took his advice which
  institution to choose for education and that was a celebrated
  Ul'yanov Electrotechnical Institute in Leningrad (abbreviated to
  LETI).</p>

  <p>Many of systematic studies in electronics
  and radio engineering that had been performed there made
  significant contributions into the electronics industry. As for
  me, it was my good fortune to meet my first supervisor there.
  Theoretical courses of studies were easy enough for me. It was
  the laboratory research that attracted me. Being a third-year
  student, I began to work in a laboratory of vacuum processes. My
  first investigations were directed by a research associate N.N.
  Sozina who studied semiconductor photodetectors. Since that time,
  half a century ago, semiconductors have become main objects of my
  scientific interests. A book "The Electroconductivity of
  Semiconductors" by F.F. Volkenshtein, which had been written in
  Leningrad (during the time of Leningrad's siege) was my Textbook
  then. My graduation thesis was devoted to the problem of
  obtaining the thin films and investigating the photoconductivity
  of bismuth telluride compounds.</p>

  <p>In December 1952, I graduated from the
  Institute and was offered by my supervisor N.N. Sozina to stay in
  the LETI to continue my study. But I dreamed of working at the
  Physico-Technical Institute that had been founded by Abram
  Fedorovich Ioffe. His book "Fundamentals of Modern Physics" was a
  manual for me. Happily, three vacancies for graduates had been
  given to us by Ioffe's Institute. One of them fell to my lot. My
  joy was boundless. And may be it is this lucky distribution that
  has determined my happy scientific career.</p>

  <p>In the letter to my parents, then residing
  in the Minsk-city, I wrote about my lucky chance. I did not know
  that Academician Ioffe was dismissed and left the Institute of
  which the director he had been for thirty years.</p>

  <p>I recall my first day at the
  Physico-Technical Institute on January 30, 1953. I was introduced
  to my new supervisor, V.M. Tuchkevich, head of a subdivision. It
  was a very important problem to be solved by our not very big
  team: creation of germanium diodes and triodes (transistors) on
  p-n junctions.</p>

  <p>The Physico-Technical Institute, being
  regarded on today's scale, was not a big one. I was given an
  Institute pass No. 429, i.e., the total amount of employees was
  as high as the above mentioned number; most of famous physicists
  of the Physico-Technical Institute moved to Moscow (to I.V.
  Kurchatov's, and newly-built atomic centers). Semiconductors
  elite followed A.F. Ioffe in order to work under his supervision
  in a recently organized semiconductor laboratory belonging to the
  Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In the
  Physico-Technical Institute there retained only D.N. Nasledov,
  B.T. Kolomiets and V.M. Tuchkevich as representatives of the old
  generation of physicists who formerly dealt with
  semiconductors.</p>

  <p>Academician A.P. Komar was after A.E. Ioffe
  on charge of the Physico-Technical Institute. The new director's
  attitude to his predecessor was not quite correct but as to the
  restoration and development of the Institute, his strategy was
  O.K. Of utmost importance was the support of works on the
  creation of new semiconductor electronics, space investigations
  (gas dynamics of high velocities and high temperature protective
  coatings; development of the light isotope separation methods for
  the hydrogen weapon (under the guidance of B.P.
  Konstantinov).</p>

  <p>Studies of fundamental problems of physics,
  both theoretical and experimental ones, were encouraged too: just
  in this time experimental discovery of exciton was done (E.F.
  Gross), it was formulated the principles of a kinetic theory of
  strength (S.N. Zhurkov), development of the pioneering works on
  physics of atomic collisions were initiated (V.M. Dukel'skii,
  N.V. Fedorenko).</p>

  <p>Both the director of the Institute (A.P.
  Komar) and the deputy director (D.N. Nasledov) understood the
  importance of drawing the interests of young people to science.
  It was a practice then to welcome newcomers at the highest level.
  In this way many renowned Russian scientists started their work,
  among them were present members of the Academy of Sciences, B.P.
  Zakharchenya, A.A. Kaplyanskii, E.P. Mazets, V.V Afrosimov and
  others.</p>

  <p>I remember my first attendance of the
  seminar on semiconductors at the Physico-Technical Institute in
  February 1953 as one of the most impressive events I have ever
  experienced. That was a brilliant report delivered by E.F. Gross
  about the discovery of the exciton. The sensation I experienced
  then could not be compared to anything. I was stunned by the talk
  on the birth of a discovery in the area of science to which I
  myself had got the access.</p>

  <p>Yet the main thing was everyday
  experimental work in the laboratory. Since that time I have been
  keeping, as a most precious thing, my laboratory daily report
  book that contains notes of mine about the creation of the first
  soviet p-n junction transistor on the 5th of March, 1953. And
  now, when recalling that time I cannot help feeling proud of what
  we had accomplished. We comprised a team of very young people.
  Under the guidance of V.M. Tuchkevich we succeeded in working out
  principles of the technology and the metrics of transistor
  electronics. Below are the names of researchers who had been
  working in our small laboratory: A.A. Lebedev, a Leningrad
  University graduate - the growth and doping of perfect germanium
  single crystals; Zh.I. Alferov - the preparation of transistors,
  their parameters being at the level of the best world samples;
  A.I. Uvarov and S. M. Ruvkin - the creation of a precise metrics
  of germanium single crystals and transistors; N.S. Yakovchuk, a
  graduate of the Faculty of Radio Engineering of the Leningrad
  Electrical Technical Institute - designing transistor-based
  circuits.</p>

  <p>As early as in May 1953, the first Soviet
  transistor receivers were shown to the "top authorities". That
  work, of which the performers had been working with passion
  peculiar to their young hearts and with utmost sense of
  responsibility, exerted a great influence upon me. While quickly
  and effectively progressing as a scientist, I began to comprehend
  the significance of the technology not only for electronic
  devices, but in basic research work too, in regard with notorious
  "minor" details and sporadic results. And it is since then that I
  prefer to analyze experimental result proceeding from "simple"
  general laws prior to putting forward sophisticated
  explanations.</p>

  <p>In subsequent years, our team of
  researchers at the Physico-Technical institute expanded
  considerably and in a very short time the first Soviet germanium
  power rectifiers were created alongside with germanium
  photodiodes and silicon also were being carried out then.</p>

  <p>In the month of May 1958, Anatolii Petrovic
  Alexandrov (later the President of the Academy of Sciences of the
  USSR) asked our team of working out a special semiconductor
  device for the first Soviet atomic submarine. That required a
  perfectly new technology and in addition to - another
  construction of germanium rectifiers, which had been done in a
  record short space of time. In the month of October, these
  devices were mounted on a submarine. I was a junior research
  associate at the Institute then, and was somewhat surprised by a
  telephone call from the first Vice-Chairman of the Government of
  the USSR, Dmitrii Fedorovich Ustinov, who asked me of fortnight
  reduction of the term. There was no getting away from that: I
  directly moved in the laboratory premises and settled there but,
  of course, the request was fulfilled that was my first State
  Order, which I had been decorated with then and which I valued
  very much.</p>

  <p>In 1961, I read my candidate degree thesis
  that had been mainly devoted to working out and investigating of
  power germanium and partially silicon rectifiers. Occurrence of
  Soviet power semiconductor electronics became possible as a
  result of those works. Of great importance there, in the sense of
  a scientific, purely physical standpoint, had been a conclusion
  drawn by me that in p-i-n, p-n-n semiconductor homostructures
  under working current densities (for most of semiconductor
  devices), the current had been determined by recombination in
  heavily doped p- and n (n<sup>+</sup>)-regions while the
  recombination contribution in the middle i(n)-region of a
  homostructure was not the determining one: so, as soon as the
  first work on semiconductor lasers had appeared, it was natural
  for me to consider the advantages of employing in lasers the
  double heterostructure of p-i-n (p-n-n<sup>+</sup>,
  n-n-p<sup>+</sup>) type. The idea was formulated by us shortly
  after the appearance of the first work of R. Hall with
  co-workers, which described a semiconductor laser based on a GaAs
  homo-p-n-structure.</p>

  <p>To realize principal advantages of
  heterostructures appeared to be possible only after obtaining of
  Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>l-x</sub>As heterostructures. We did that
  and it turned out that we had been only one month ahead in
  relation to American researches from IBM.</p>

  <p>When we began investigating
  heterostructures, I used to convince my young colleagues, that we
  were not one and only group of scientists in the world who
  understood the significance of the concept that the semiconductor
  physics and electronics would be developing on the basis of
  HETERO-, rather than HOMO-structures. Indeed, since 1968 we
  entered an era of a strong competition and the first of all were
  three laboratories of the biggest American companies: Bell
  Telephone, IBM and RCA.</p>

  <p>In 1967, while on a short trip to UK, I
  visited STL laboratories in Harlow. They were well equipped and
  the experimental base was excellent but English colleagues only
  discussed theoretical aspects of the heterostructures physics;
  they did not find experimental study of heterostructures to be
  promising then. In London I had some time for sightseeing and
  shopping. I bought there Wedding gifts to my fiancee Tamara
  Darskaya. As soon as I returned to Leningrad, we celebrated our
  wedding in a splendid restaurant "Krysha" (the Roof) in the Grand
  Hotel "Europe".</p>

  <p>Tamara was a daughter of a very popular
  actor of Voronezh Theater of Musical Comedy. Tamara worked then
  in the environs of Moscow at a big Space Enterprise under the
  guidance of Academician V.P. Glushko. She wonderfully combined
  incompatible beauty with cleverness and common sense and was
  always very kind toward her close friends. It was time of
  repeated weekly flights to Moscow. Holding a position of a Senior
  Research Associate at the Physico-Technical Institute, I could
  afford that. Leningrad-Moscow flight occurred in an hour time and
  the cost of a ticket to the TU-104 plane was as low as 11 rubles
  (about 15 US dollars). Nevertheless, after half a year shuttling
  between the two cities Tamara had moved to Leningrad.</p>

  <p>In 1968-1969, we virtually realized all the
  ideas on control the electron and light fluxes in classical
  heterostructures based on the arsenid gallium-arsenid aluminum
  system. Apart from fundamental results that were quite new and
  important efficient one-side injection, the "superinjection"
  effect, diagonal tunneling, electron and optical confinement in a
  double heterostructure (which in a short while became the main
  element in studying the low-dimensional electron gas in
  semiconductors), we succeeded in employing principal benefits of
  heterostructure applications in devices, i.e., lasers, LEDs,
  solar cells, dynistors and transistors. Of utmost importance was,
  beyond doubts, the making of low threshold room temperature
  operating lasers on a double heterostructure (DHS) that had been
  suggested by us as far back as 1963. The approach developed by
  M.B. Panish and I. Hayashi (Bell Telephone) as well as by H.
  Kressel (RCA) was different from that of ours since they offered
  to use in lasers a single p-AlGaAs-p-GaAs heterostructure, which
  made their approach rather limited. A possibility of obtaining an
  efficient injection in the heterojunction seemed doubtful to them
  and, in spite of the fact that potential advantages of DHS had
  been recognized.</p>

  <p>In August 1969, I first time visited the
  USA; my paper that I read there at the International Conference
  on Luminescence in Newarc (State of Delaver) was devoted to
  AlGaAs-based DHS low threshold room temperature lasers and
  produced an impression of an exploded bomb on American
  colleagues. Professor Ya. Pankov from RCA, who just shortly
  before my reading the paper had explained to me that they had not
  got a permission for my visiting their laboratory, as soon as I
  concluded my speech told me that the permission had been
  received. I could not help enjoying my refusal explaining that
  now I had been invited by that moment to attend IBM and Bell
  Telephone laboratories.</p>

  <p>My seminar in the Bell followed by the
  looking over the laboratories and discussions with researches
  clearly revealed to me our merits and demerits of our progress in
  my laboratory. I believe that the soon commenced emulation for
  being the first in getting the continuous wave operation of laser
  at the room temperature was at that time a rare example of an
  open and friendly competition between laboratories belonging to
  the antagonistic Great Powers. We won the competition overtaking
  by a month Panish's group in Bell Telephone. Significance of
  obtaining the continuous wave regime had the connection first and
  foremost with working out an optical fiber with low losses as
  well as the creation of our DHS lasers, which resulted in
  appearance and rapid development of optical fiber
  communication.</p>

  <p>In the winter 1970-1971 and spring 1971, I
  spent six months in the USA working in laboratory of
  semiconductor devices at the University of Illinois together with
  Prof. Nick Holonyak. We met at the first time in 1967, when he
  visited my laboratory at the Physico-Technical Institute. Prof.
  Nick Holonyak, who is one of the founders of semiconductor
  optoelectronics, the inventor of the first visible semiconductor
  laser and LED became my closest friend. Now over 33 years we have
  discussed all semiconductor physics and electronics problems,
  political and life aspects and our interaction (visits, letters,
  seminars, telephone conversations) played very important role in
  our work and life.</p>

  <p>In 1971, I became a recipient of the USA
  Franklin's Institute gold medal for DHS laser works. Being my
  first international award, it was of particular value to me.
  There are Soviet physicists besides me who have been given the
  Franklin's Institute gold medals too: Academician P.L. Kapitsa in
  1944; Academician N.N. Bogolubov in 1974; Academician A.D.
  Sakharov in 1981. I consider it a big honour to belong to such a
  company!</p>

  <p>An Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>l-x</sub>As system
  of lattice-matched heterostructures, which in practice seemed to
  be a lucky exception, was infinitely expanded on the basis of
  multi-component solid solutions, first theoretically and later on
  experimentally (InGaAsP is the most convincing example).</p>

  <p>Heterostructure-based solar cells were
  created by us as far back as 1970. And when American scientists
  published their early works, our solar batteries have been
  already mounted on the satellites (sputniks) and their industrial
  production was in full swing. The cells, when being employed in
  space, proved their efficiency. For many years they have been
  operating on the "MIR" skylab and in spite of the fact that
  forecasts of a substantial decrease of the value of one watt of
  the electrical power have not been justified so far, the most
  effective energy source in space is, nevertheless, a set of solar
  cells on heterostructures of III-V compounds.</p>

  <p>In 1972, my pupils-colleagues and I were
  awarded the Lenin's Prize - the highest scientific Prize in the
  USSR. Our gladness regrettably was not cloudless. For some formal
  and obscure reasons we lost from the list of nominees R.F.
  Kazarinov and E.L. Portnoi.</p>

  <p>On the day of the prize award I was in
  Moscow and called home, to Leningrad. But the telephone did not
  answer. Then, I called my parents (they have been living in
  Leningrad since 1963) and gladly told my father that I had been
  given the Lenin's Prize. But my father replied - And so what- Our
  grandson is born today! In my lucky 1972 year, in addition to the
  prestigious prize I was elected a member of the Academy of
  Sciences. But the happiest day was that of Vanya Alferov's
  birth.</p>

  <p>Studies of superlattices and quantum wells
  were rapidly promoted in the West and afterwards in this country
  soon resulted in coming into being of a new area of the quantum
  physics of solid: the physics of low-dimensional electron
  systems. In this regard, studies of zero-dimensional structures -
  so-called "quantum dots" - form the summit of the above mentioned
  works. Gratifying is the circumstance that the Ioffe Institute
  today, while going through the hard times, remains the world
  leader in this area of physics. Works of the second and third
  generation of my students, those being well-known P.S. Kop'ev,
  N.N. Ledentsov, V.M. Ustinov, S.V. Ivanov have won general
  recognition nowadays. N.N. Ledentsov has become the youngest
  corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>

  <p>In 1987, I was elected director of the
  Ioffe Institute, in 1989, president of the Leningrad Scientific
  Center of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR; and in April 1990,
  Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
  Afterwards, I was reelected and hold all these posts now within
  the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>

  <p>In the first years of my presidency and
  directorship we succeeded in remarkable scaling up research
  activity in our unique (for all the world) Academy of Sciences.
  We have also developed effective collaboration with Universities
  and Educational Institutions. The Physico-Technical Special
  Secondary School attached to Ioffe's Physico-Technical Institute
  had been opened at that time; ongoing was the process of creation
  of specialized University chairs: the first one, that of
  Optoelectronics was organized in the Electrotechnical University,
  (formerly the LETI) as far back as in 1973. On the basis of both
  then existing and newly organized chairs a Physicotechnical
  faculty was set up in the Polytechnical Institute in 1988.</p>

  <p>A great contribution into the above
  mentioned system makes the Scientific Educational Center that has
  been built by the Physico-Technical Institute and incorporates
  school boys, students and scientists in a magnificent edifice,
  which can be called "The Palace of Knowledge".</p>

  <p>Still, throughout the years passed, of
  greatest importance has been so far the existence of our Academy
  of Sciences as a unique both scientific and educational structure
  in Russia. The Academy faced the menace of abolition in the
  twenties as "an inheritance from the tsarist regime". It faced
  the menace of abolition in the nineties as "an inheritance from
  the totalitarian Soviet regime". To insure its safety I gave my
  consent to be a member of the Russian Parliament (a deputy of
  State Duma) in 1995. President Yu.S. Osipov and Vice-Presidents,
  Academicians and Corresponding Members, doctors and candidates of
  sciences, senior and junior research associates, lab-assistants
  and mechanics took a firm stand on this kind of situation. For
  the saving of the Academy of Sciences, we made compromises with
  the power but never with the conscience.</p>

  <p>All that had been made by human beings, in
  principle, was made due to Science. And if our country's choice
  is to be a Great Power, Russia will be the great power not
  because of the nuclear potential, not because of faith in God or
  president, or western investments but thanks to the labor of the
  nation, faith in Knowledge and Science and thanks to the
  maintenance and development of scientific potential and
  education.</p>

  <p>When I was a little boy of ten, I have read
  a wonderful book "Two Captains" (by V. Kaverin). In essence, in
  my life I have been following the principle that was peculiar the
  main character of that book: "One should make efforts and search
  for. And having obtained whatever the purpose, to make efforts
  again".</p>

  <p>Of great importance here is to know what
  you are struggling for.</p>
