  <h1>Christian de Duve - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="duve.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born on
  October 2nd 1917, in Thames-Ditton, near London. My parents, of
  Belgian-German extraction, were Belgian nationals who had taken
  refuge in England during the war. They returned to Belgium in
  1920, and I grew up in the cosmopolitan harbour city of Antwerp,
  at a time when education in the Flemish part of the country was
  still half French and half Flemish. Due to these various
  circumstances, when I entered the Catholic University of Louvain in 1934, I had
  already travelled in a number of European countries and spoke
  four languages fairly fluently. This turned out to be a valuable
  asset in my subsequent career as a scientist.<br>
  <br>
  That I would embrace such a career was, however, very far from my
  mind. My education, according to the tradition of the jesuit
  school which I attended, had been centered on the "ancient
  humanities", and I was strongly attracted to the more literary
  branches. I nevertheless decided to study medicine, largely
  because of the appeal of medical practice as an occupation.
  Medical studies left a fair amount of free time in those days,
  and there was a tradition at the university that the better
  students joined a research laboratory. So it was that I entered
  the physiology laboratory of Professor J. P. Bouckaert, whose
  rigorous analytical mind exerted a strong influence on my
  intellectual development. I was attached to a group investigating
  the effect of insulin on glucose uptake. By the time when I
  graduated as an MD in 1941, I had abandoned all thought of a
  medical career, and had only one ambition: to elucidate the
  mechanism of action of insulin.<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, war had broken out. After a brief interval in
  the army and a temporary stay in a prisoners' camp, from which I
  promptly escaped thanks to the general confusion which followed
  the disastrous defeat of the allies, I had returned to Louvain to
  complete my studies. I had become convinced that the problem of
  insulin action needed to be approached by means of biochemical
  methods. Since research activities were almost paralysed due to
  lack of essential supplies, I embarked an another four-year
  curriculum, to gain the degree of "Licenci&eacute; en Sciences
  Chimiques". I combined these studies with a clinical internship
  in the Cancer Institute, with as much experimental work as war
  circumstances allowed, and with extensive reading of the earlier
  literature on insulin.<br>
  <br>
  As a medical student, I had been rather relaxed, but I worked
  really hard during those four years. Still I could not have
  achieved what I did without the support of my clinical chief,
  Professor Joseph Maisin, who enthusiastically approved of my
  plans and gave me a great deal of free time. By 1945, I had
  presented a thesis on the mechanism of action of insulin, which
  earned me the degree of "Agr&eacute;g&eacute; de l'Enseignement
  Sup&eacute;rieur", written a 400-page book entitled "Glucose,
  Insuline et Diab&egrave;te", and prepared a number of research
  articles for publication.<br>
  <br>
  By that time, the war had ended and I felt a great need of
  further training in biochemistry. In 1946-1947, I had the good
  fortune of spending 18 months at <a href="http://www.nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank">the Medical Nobel Institute</a> in Stockholm, in the
  laboratory of <a href="../1955/index.html">Hugo Theorell</a>, who
  was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1955. I then spent 6 months as a
  Rockefeller Foundation fellow at Washington University, under <a href=
  "../1947/index.html">Carl and Gerty Cori</a> who jointly received
  the Nobel Prize while I was there. In St. Louis, I collaborated
  with <a href="../1971/index.html">Earl Sutherland</a>, Nobel
  laureate in 1971. Indeed, I have been very fortunate in the
  choice of my mentors, all sticklers for technical excellence and
  intellectual rigour, those prerequisites of good scientific
  work.<br>
  <br>
  I returned to Louvain in March 1947 to take over the teaching of
  physiological chemistry at the medical faculty, becoming full
  professor in 1951. I started a small research laboratory, where I
  was joined by a young physician, Gery Hers, who had already
  worked with me during the war, and by an increasing number of
  first class students, including Jacques Berthet, Henri Beaufay,
  Robert Wattiaux, Pierre Jacques and Pierre Baudhuin. All have
  since carved distinguished careers for themselves.<br>
  <br>
  Insulin, together with glucagon which I had helped rediscover,
  was still my main focus of interest, and our first investigations
  were accordingly directed on certain enzymatic aspects of
  carbohydrate metabolism in liver, which were expected to throw
  light on the broader problem of insulin action. But fate had a
  surprise in store for me, in the form of a chance observation,
  the so-called "latency" of acid phosphatase. It was essentially
  irrelevant to the object of our research but it was most
  intriguing. My curiosity got the better of me, and as a result I
  never elucidated the mechanism of action of insulin. I pursued my
  accidental finding instead, drawing most of my collaborators
  along with me.<br>
  <br>
  Our investigations were very fruitful. They led to the discovery
  of a new cell part, the lysosome, which received its name in
  1955, and later of yet another organelle, the peroxisome. At the
  same time, we were prompted to develop progressively improved
  instrumental, technical and conceptual tools in relation to the
  separation and analysis of cell components, and to apply them to
  an increasing variety of problems of biological and also medical
  interest.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962, I was appointed a professor at the Rockefeller Institute
  in New York, now the Rockefeller University, the institution where
  <a href="index.html">Albert Claude</a> had made his pioneering
  studies between 1929 and 1949, and where <a href=
  "index.html">George Palade</a> had been working since 1946. I
  retained my position in Louvain and have since shared my time
  more or less equally between the two universities. In New York, I
  was able to develop a second flourishing group, which follows the
  same general lines of research as the Belgian group, but with a
  program of its own. The two laboratories work closely together
  and complement each other in many respects.<br>
  <br>
  Recently, with a number of colleagues, I have created a new
  institute, the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular
  Pathology, or ICP, located on the new site of the Louvain Medical
  School in Brussels. The aim of the ICP is to accelerate the
  translation of basic knowledge in cellular and molecular biology
  into useful practical applications.<br>
  <br>
  In September 1943, I married the former Janine Herman, the
  daughter of a physician. We have four children, three of whom are
  married, and two grandchildren.</p>
