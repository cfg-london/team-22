  <h1>Hamilton O. Smith - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="smith.jpg" class="bio-img">My mother and father each came from simple
  country backgrounds, but both showed an early inclination for
  scholarly pursuits. They eventually met as school teachers in a
  local Panama City, Florida high school and were married in 1929.
  The following year, my father was appointed Assistant Professor
  of Education at the University of Florida at Gainesville, and in that
  year my brother was born. In 1931, my father went on leave to
  Columbia
  University in New York City to complete his doctoral work in
  education. I was born there on August 23, 1931 while he was a
  graduate student. Though the family commuted annually between New
  York City and Gainesville over the next five years, I retain the
  strongest memories of our life in the city. In particular are
  recollections of life in a small, intimate apartment, walks in
  the city parks, and quiet evenings spent with my mother and
  father who entertained us with arithmetic problems and a small
  Gilbert chemistry set.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937, our family moved to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. My
  father had joined the faculty of the Department of Education at
  the University of
  Illinois and was to spend the major part of his academic
  career there until retirement. My entire boyhood was spent in
  this small midwestern academic community. Despite the fact that
  our life in Urbana spanned the late depression years and World
  War II, the community continued to function pretty much as if
  untouched by world events. At home, an atmosphere of intense
  intellectualism was maintained. My father was perpetually working
  and writing. At the same time, my mother struggled to establish
  herself as a writer, but she was to remain frustrated in her
  ambitions. However, she, in particular, imbued us with a respect
  and desire for the creative life.<br>
  <br>
  My brother and I received private French lessons during our
  pre-teen years. I began piano lessons at age eight and my brother
  took up violin. We studied with a talented musical family, the
  Fosters and Sonderskovs. I was in no way gifted and found
  practice to be a chore until one memorable day when I was about
  age thirteen. On that day, a friend introduced me to the local
  music shop and by chance I picked up a recording of Artur
  Rubinstein playing Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata. I had been
  struggling with the piece for sometime, but had never appreciated
  its dramatic beauty. Listening to Rubinstein's magnificent
  performance for the first time was a truly awakening experience.
  From then on I became a devoted pupil and music lover.<br>
  <br>
  My boyhood friends were mostly sons of university faculty. Our
  interests included football, basketball, music, chemistry,
  electricity, and electronics. My brother and I spent many hours
  in our basement laboratory stocked with supplies purchased from
  our paper route earnings. We attended University High School, a
  superb small college preparatory school with an array of
  exceptionally talented students drawn largely from university
  faculty families. To my knowledge, two Nobel Laureates are
  counted among "Uni-High's"graduates, as well as numerous
  successful professionals, and no less than three current
  professors at Johns Hopkins. I
  completed high school in three years largely due to a wonderful
  science teacher, Wilbur E. Harnish, who allowed me to complete
  chemistry and physics during the two summers preceding ninth
  grade. Two other teachers at "Uni-High" influenced my development
  profoundly: Vynce Hines, who taught me the beauties and rigor of
  plane geometry and Miles C. Hartley, who gave me a sound
  foundation in algebra.<br>
  <br>
  After completing high school, I matriculated at the University of
  Illinois, majoring in mathematics for which I had a flair but no
  deep talent. I had not yet decided on a particular field of
  science. My brother, who was considerably more gifted in the
  abstract areas than I, was studying theoretical physics, but this
  did not appeal strongly to me, nor was I interested in pure
  chemistry. At that time biology, as taught, was largely
  descriptive. It was not especially appealing for one brought up
  on "real" science. However, during my sophomore year, my brother
  introduced me to a book on mathematical modeling of central
  nervous system circuits by a biophysicist named Rashevsky. It
  caught my interest and I began reading about the nervous system.
  I continued this interest after transferring to the University of
  California at Berkeley in 1950. There, for the first time, I
  found courses in cell physiology, biochemistry, and biology that
  interested me. I recall in particular at that time, a guest
  lecture by <a href="../1967/index.html">George Wald</a>
  describing his studies of retinal biochemistry. I was converted
  overnight into an avid student of visual physiology. It had
  become clear that mathematics, while providing an excellent basic
  training, was not my real interest. With a broadening
  appreciation of biology and a budding interest in human visual-
  and neurophysiology, I decided to apply to medical school.<br>
  <br>
  In 1952, I began my studies at the Johns Hopkins
  University Medical School in Baltimore, Maryland. I was
  immediately caught up in the excitement of a new kind of life,
  and without firm commitments to any particular area of research,
  I was to continue a fairly conventional medical career for
  several years. I received my M. D. degree from Hopkins in 1956
  and proceeded to Barnes Hospital in St. Louis for a medical
  internship. There I experienced for the first time a true feeling
  of freedom and independence. In my second month of internship I
  met Elizabeth Anne Bolton, a young nursing student. She was from
  a family of doctors and engineers, had been born in Spain, reared
  in Mexico City, and had come to the States for college and
  nurses' training. We immediately liked each other, and a few
  months later, were married.<br>
  <br>
  In July, 1957, I was called up in the Doctor's Draft, and rather
  than seek any of several avenues of deferment, decided it was an
  opportune time to be done with my service obligation. I chose the
  Navy and we received a two year assignment in San Diego,
  California. It was a relaxed and easy time for us after so many
  years of schooling. For the first time in my life I was faced
  with greatly reduced demands on my time and the problem of
  idleness. I began to search for ways to occupy myself. A report
  of the then new research in human chromosomal aberrations caught
  my interest. Soon I was reading textbooks on genetics. Because of
  my mathematical background, I delved deeply into the population
  genetics of Sewell Wright and Ronald Fisher.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959, with the Navy service completed, my wife and I moved to
  Detroit, Michigan with our one-year old son to begin my medical
  residency training at the Henry Ford Hospital. There I found a
  well-stocked library that included "Bacteriophage" by Mark Adams,
  the first issues of the Journal of Molecular Biology containing
  the classical <a href="../1965/index.html">Jacob</a> and <a href=
  "../1965/index.html">Monod</a> paper describing the operon model
  for gene regulation, and two collections of papers by Adelberg
  and Stent. I suddenly became aware of the beautiful work of the
  "phage school" and of <a href="../1962/index.html">Watson</a> and
  <a href="../1962/index.html">Crick</a> and DNA. After many years
  of haphazard searching for the "right" area of research, I knew I
  had found it.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962, armed with a N.I.H. postdoctoral fellowship, I began my research
  career with Myron Levine in the Department of Human Genetics at
  the University of
  Michigan in Ann Arbor. Mike was a geneticist studying
  <i>Salmonella</i> Phage P22 lysogeny. The choice to work with
  him, while governed more by expediency than by considered
  planning, turned out to be most fortuitous. Mike was an
  easy-going young investigator with a solid phage background and
  well established among the phage crowd. He allowed me just the
  right blend of independence and encouragement. Together we
  carried out a series of studies demonstrating the sequential
  action of the P22 <i>C</i>-genes which controlled lysogenization.
  In 1965, we discovered the gene controlling prophage attachment,
  now known as the <i>int</i> gene. By 1967, I had published this
  work and had carried out a study of defective transducing
  particles formed after induction of <i>int</i> mutant prophage.
  During 1966-67, Mike took a sabbatical year with <a href=
  "index.html">Werner Arber</a> in Geneva and through
  correspondence, I learned for the first time about Arber's
  remarkable work on restriction and modification phenomenon in
  bacteria.<br>
  <br>
  In 1967, I came to Johns Hopkins as an Assistant Professor of
  Microbiology and have remained there since. My research work
  includes studies of restriction and modification enzymes,
  enzymology of genetic recombination, mechanism of bacterial
  transformation, and genetic regulation in prokaryotes and
  eukaryotes. In 1975-76, as a Guggenheim Fellow, I collaborated
  with Max Birnstiel at the University of Zurich in Switzerland on histone gene
  arrangement and sequence. It was a superbly enriching year for
  both myself and for my family.<br>
  <br>
  My wife, Elizabeth, is artistically inclined, enjoys a variety of
  "Handarbeit", sings in a church choir, enjoys classical music,
  and is a moderately proficient linguist (English, Spanish,
  German, and French). My major non-scientific diversions are
  classical music and piano. We have four sons and a daughter, none
  of whom currently indicate a strong interest in science.</p>
