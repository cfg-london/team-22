  <h1>Steven Weinberg - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="weinberg.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in 1933 in New York
  City to Frederick and Eva Weinberg. My early inclination toward
  science received encouragement from my father, and by the time I
  was 15 or 16 my interests had focused on theoretical
  physics.<br>
  <br>
  I received my undergraduate degree from Cornell in 1954, and
  then went for a year of graduate study to the Institute for
  Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen (now the Niels Bohr Institute).
  There, with the help of David Frisch and Gunnar K&auml;ll&eacute;n.
  I began to do research in physics. I then returned to the U.S. to
  complete my graduate studies at Princeton. My Ph.D thesis, with
  Sam Treiman as adviser, was on the application of renormalization
  theory to the effects of strong interactions in weak interaction
  processes.<br>
  <br>
  After receiving my Ph.D. in 1957, I worked at Columbia and then
  from 1959 to 1966 at Berkeley. My research during this period was on a
  wide variety of topics - high energy behavior of Feynman graphs,
  second-class weak interaction currents, broken symmetries,
  scattering theory, muon physics, etc. - topics chosen in many
  cases because I was trying to teach myself some area of physics.
  My active interest in astrophysics dates from 1961-62; I wrote
  some papers on the cosmic population of neutrinos and then began
  to write a book, <i>Gravitation and Cosmology</i>, which was
  eventually completed in 1971. Late in 1965 I began my work on
  current algebra and the application to the strong interactions of
  the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking.<br>
  <br>
  From 1966 to 1969, on leave from Berkeley, I was Loeb Lecturer at
  Harvard and
  then visiting professor at M.I.T. In 1969 I accepted a professorship in the
  Physics Department at M.I.T., then chaired by Viki Weisskopf. It
  was while I was a visitor to M.I.T. in 1967 that my work on
  broken symmetries, current algebra, and renormalization theory
  turned in the direction of the unification of weak and
  electromagnetic interactions. In 1973, when Julian Schwinger left
  Harvard, I was offered and accepted his chair there as Higgins
  Professor of Physics, together with an appointment as Senior
  Scientist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.<br>
  <br>
  My work during the 1970's has been mainly concerned with the
  implications of the unified theory of weak and electromagnetic
  interactions, with the development of the related theory of
  strong interactions known as quantum chromodynamics, and with
  steps toward the unification of all interactions.<br>
  <br>
  In 1982 I moved to the physics and astronomy departments of the
  University of
  Texas at Austin, as Josey Regental Professor of Science. I
  met my wife Louise when we were undergraduates at Cornell, and we
  were married in 1954. She is now a professor of law. Our daughter
  Elizabeth was born in Berkeley in 1963.</p>
