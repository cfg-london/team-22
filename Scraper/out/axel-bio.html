  <h1>Richard Axel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="axel.jpg" class="bio-img">New York City is my world. I was born in Brooklyn, the first child of immigrant
parents whose education was disrupted by the Nazi invasion of Poland.
Although not themselves learned, my parents shared a deep respect for learning.
I grew up in a home rich in warmth, but empty of books, art or music. My early
life and education were centered on the streets of Brooklyn. Stickball, baseball
with a pink ball and broom handle, and schoolyard basketball were my
culture. In stickball, a ball hit the distance to one manhole cover was a single,
and four manhole covers, a home run, a Nobel Prize. My father was a tailor.
My mother, although quick and incisive, did not direct her mind to intellectual
pursuits and I had not even the remotest thought of a career in academia.
I was happy on the courts. In those days, we worked at a relatively young age.
At eleven, I was a messenger, delivering false teeth to dentists. At twelve, I was
laying carpets, and at thirteen, I was serving corned beef and pastrami in a
local delicatessen. Vladimir, the Russian chef, was the first to expose me to
Shakespeare which he recited as we sliced cabbage heads for coleslaw.</p>
  <p>My local high school had the best basketball team in
    Brooklyn but the Principal of my grade school had a vision different from
    my own and insisted that I attend Stuyvesant High School, far away in Manhattan.
    Stuyvesant High advertised itself as a school for intellectually gifted boys
    but had the worst basketball team in the city. I was unhappy about the prospect
    of attending for it seemed antithetical to my self-image. Shortly after I
    entered, however, my world changed. I embraced the culture and aesthetics
    of Manhattan. The world of art, books and music opened before me and I devoured
    it. In school, I heard bits of an opera for the first time. I remember it
    distinctly, the Letter Duet from Mozart's <i>Marriage of Figaro</i>. The next night
    I attended Tannh&auml;user at the Metropolitan Opera and thus began a love affair,
    bordering on an obsession, that has had no end. Twice a week, I stood on
    line for standing room tickets at the Metropolitan Opera where I was exposed
    to a cult of similarly obsessed but far more knowledgeable afficionados who
    taught me the intricate nuances of this rich genre. The great Italian tenor,
    Franco Corelli, would serve us coffee as we waited and the diva, Joan Sutherland,
    would invite us backstage.</p>
  <p>On other days, I would read in a most beautifully appointed place, the
Reading Room of the Central New York Public Library on 42nd Street. One
passes the pair of sculpted lions, ascends a flight of stairs into a huge high-ceilinged
room of impressive silence where I read incessantly without direction
but with a newfound fascination that made up for years of illiteracy. I met a
coterie of library dwellers, men and women of New York, who spent all of
their days in the Reading Room. I did not know who they were or how they
came to be there, but they had an insight and understanding of literature
that amazed and still perplexes me and they were my teachers. This was New
York for me, a city of the culturally obsessed that opened up before me and
framed my new world.</p>
  <p>To support a seemingly extravagant life for a young high school student, I
worked. I used my skills as a waiter in a delicatessen in Brooklyn, to wait tables
in the cafes and nightspots of Greenwich Village. In the sixties, the Village
was the home of the beat generation that through music and poetry and ultimately
protest translated discord into meaningful changes in both America
and the world. Stuyvesant High School was on the fringe of Greenwich
Village and some of its teachers were artists, writers, performers who fueled
the politically-fired student body, many the sons of Marxist immigrants. With
this array of artistic faculty Stuyvesant nourished my new and voracious appetite.</p>
  <p>But old worlds die hard. I continued to play basketball in high school and
this led to a most memorable and humbling experience. I came onto the
court as the starting center, and the center on the opposing team from Power
Memorial High School lumbered out on the court, a lanky 7 foot 2 inch sixteen
year old. When I was first passed the ball, he put his hands in front of my
face, looked at me and asked, "What are you going to do, Einstein?" I did
rather little. He scored 54 points and I scored two. He was the young Lew
Alcindor, later known as Karim Abdul Jabar, who went on to be among the
greatest basketball legends and I became a neurobiologist.</p>
  <p>My decision to remain in New York and attend Columbia College revealed
the provincial but endearing quality of my family. When I chose to accept a
gracious scholarship offered by Columbia, my father was disappointed. It was
a fact well known that the brightest children of Brooklyn immigrants attended
City College. My freshman year at Columbia, I lived with abandon. The opera,
the arts, the freedom, the protest left little time for study. In the first semester,
I met a student from Tennessee, Kevin Brownlee, who remains a dear friend
and is now a Professor of Medieval French at the University of Pennsylvania.
Brownlee urged me to redirect this intensity to learning. The world of the
arts will remain, but my time at Columbia University was limited. Once again,
a new world opened before me. With Kevin as my guide, I became a dedicated,
even obsessed, student. My life was spent in a small room lined with volumes
of Keats' poetry at the Columbia Library and I immersed myself in my studies.
The study of literature at Columbia in the sixties was exciting in the presence of
the poet, Kenneth Koch, the critics, Lionel Trilling, Moses Hadas, and
Jacques Barzun. It was largely chance, however, that led me to biology.</p>
  <p>To support myself in college, I obtained a job washing glassware in the
laboratory of Bernard Weinstein, a Professor of Medicine at Columbia
University. Bernie was working on the universality of the genetic code. The
early sixties was a time shortly after the elucidation of the structure of DNA
and the realization that DNA is the repository of all information and from
which all information flows. The genetic code had just been deciphered and
the central dogma was complete. I was fascinated by the new molecular biology
with its enormous explanatory power. I was a terrible glassware washer
because I was far more interested in experiments than dirty flasks. I was fired
and was rehired as a Research Assistant and Bernie spent endless hours
patiently teaching this scientifically naïve, but intensely interested young
student. I was torn between literature and science. Dubious about my literary
ambitions and fascinated by molecular biology, I decided to attend graduate
school in genetics.</p>
  <p>My plans were thwarted by an unfortunate war and to assure deferment
from the military, I found myself a misplaced medical student at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. I entered medical school by default.
I was a terrible medical student, pained by constant exposure to the suffering
of the ill and thwarted in my desire to do experiments. My clinical incompetence
was immediately recognized by the faculty and deans. I could rarely, if
ever, hear a heart murmur, never saw the retina, my glasses fell into an abdominal
incision and finally, I sewed a surgeon's finger to a patient upon suturing
an incision. It was during this period of incompetence and disinterest that I
met another extremely close friend, Frederick Kass, now a Professor of
Psychiatry at Columbia University. Fred was an unusual medical student, a
Texan with a degree in art history from Harvard, who remains a kindred spirit.</p>
  <p>It was a difficult time, but I was both nurtured and protected by Howard
Dintzis, Victor McCusick, and Julie Krevins, three professors at Johns Hopkins
who somehow saw and respected my conflict. Without them, there is little
question that I would not have been tolerated but they urged the deans to come
up with a solution. I was allowed to graduate medical school early with an
M.D. if I promised never to practice medicine on live patients. I returned to
Columbia as an intern in Pathology where I kept this promise by performing
autopsies. After a year in Pathology, I was asked by Don King, the Chairman
of Pathology, never to practice on dead patients.</p>
  <p>Finally, I was afforded the opportunity to pursue molecular biology in earnest.
I joined the laboratory of Sol Spiegelman in the Department of Gentics at
Columbia University. Spiegelman was a short, incisive, witty man with a tongue as
sharp as his mind. Spiegelman was the first to synthesize infectious RNA
    <i>in vitro</i> and this led to a series of extremely interesting and clever experiments
revealing Darwinian selection at the level of molecules in a test tube. Sol
recognized the importance of the early RNA world in the evolution of life
and had recently turned his laboratory to a study of RNA tumor viruses. An
immediate bond formed between us and Sol taught me how to think about
science, to identify important problems, and how to effect their solution.</p>
  <p>Although I felt a growing confidence in my abilities
    in molecular biology, I was naïve in other areas of biology, notably biophysics.
    Importantly, I had a sense early in my career that my interest in biology
    was eclectic and that I would need a concomitantly broad background to embrace
    the different areas of biology without trepidation. I left to begin a second
    postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, working with
    Gary Felsenfeld on DNA and chromatin structure. Since I entered medical school
    to avoid the draft, I had a military obligation that was fulfilled by my
    years at the NIH and was endearingly termed a "yellow beret." Gary was great,
    but the NIH was alien, a government reservation with a fixed workday. As
    a night person, I found it strange and at some level difficult since I arrived
    at noon after all the parking spaces were occupied, left at midnight and
    accumulated an increasing number of parking tickets. In the midst of a molecular
    hybridization reaction, I was arrested by two FBI agents (the NIH is a federal
    reservation) for 100 summonses for parking violations.</p>
  <p>As a fellow in Felsenfeld's lab studying how chromatin serves to regulate
gene expression, I formed close friendships that continue to the present. On
the beach at Cold Spring Harbor, I sat with Tom Maniatis and Harold
Weintraub and talked about chromosome replication and gene expression
and within a few hours a bond formed, a respect for one another and for one
another's thinking, that has lasted for thirty years. Hal, unfortunately, died
ten years ago of a brain tumor, but his warmth, his creativity persist.</p>
  <p>Sol Spiegelman invited me to return to Columbia as an
    Assistant Professor in 1974 in the Institute of Cancer Research. I was ecstatic
    to occupy a lab and office adjacent to his. Sol had many visitors in those
    years, and when he felt bored in a meeting he would excuse himself and hide
    in my office where we talked science until his visitors finally gave up and
    left. I was studying the structure of genes in chromatin and had the good
    fortune of participating in a revolution made possible by recombinant DNA
    technology. I spent a great deal of time with Tom Maniatis, who pioneered
    many of the techniques in recombinant DNA. Tom left Harvard for Cal Tech,
    because he was restricted from performing recombinant DNA experiments in
    Cambridge, Massachusetts. We learned how to cut and paste DNA, to isolate
    genes and to analyze their anatomy down to the last detail. We recognized
    that to understand gene control and gene function, however, required a functional
    assay. Within months of establishing my own laboratory in 1974, Michael Wigler,
    my first graduate student along with Sol Silverstein, a Professor at Columbia,
    developed novel procedures that allowed DNA-mediated transformation of mammalian
    cells. Michael, even at this very early stage in his career, was conceptually
    and technically masterful and within a few years he devised procedures that
    permitted the introduction of virtually any gene into any cell in culture.
    He developed a system that not only allowed for the isolation of genes, but
    also for detailed analysis of how they worked. We now had a facile assay
    to study the sequences regulating gene expression as well as gene function.</p>
  <p>Michael went off to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and simultaneous
with Bob Weinberg at MIT identified the mutant ras gene as the gene
responsible for malignant transformation in many cancer cells. My laboratory
went off in many directions, first identifying the regulatory sequences
responsible for control of specific gene expression. At the same time, a fellow,
Dan Littman, now a Professor at NYU, joined the lab interested in two molecules
that characterize the major classes of T cells. Dan, along with a student, Paul
Maddon, succeeded in exploiting the gene transfer to isolate these two
molecules. As often in science, serendipity heightened the interest in these
molecules: we demonstrated that one of these receptors, CD4, was the high
affinity receptor for HIV, allowing attachment and infection of immune cells.</p>
  <p>This early work on recombinant DNA was a period of enormous excitement,
for it led to a revolution in both thinking and technology in biology. It provided
a new tool for the study of fundamental problems and spurred a new and
valuable industry, biotechnology. We, who were involved at its inception, were
perhaps a bit haughty, aggressive and proud, and were accused by many of
playing "God." As evidence, the press noted that "I baptized my first child,
Adam."</p>
  <p>Recombinant DNA aroused a good deal of passion and hostility. The
notion of tinkering with life was thought to endanger life and this cry became
one of the major indictments of modern biology. These experiments raised
endless debate because the idea that genes can be taken out of one organism
and introduced into the chromosome of another is by itself upsetting. The very
notion of the performance of recombinant DNA was linked with the mysterious
and supernatural. This conjured up myths that elicited intense anxiety.
Recombinant DNA, it was feared, would permit biologists to alter individual
species as well as the evolution of species. This controversy emphasized the
fact that advances in science may indeed bring harm as well as benefit. In the
case of recombinant DNA, as François Jacob said, "Apocalypse was predicted
but nothing happened." In fact, with recombinant DNA, only good things
happened. At a practical level, the ability to construct bacteria replicating
eucaryotic genes has allowed for the production of an increasingly large
number of clinically important proteins. At a conceptual level, gene cloning
has permitted a detailed look at the molecular anatomy of individual genes
and from a precise analysis of these genes we have deduced the informational
potential of the gene and the way in which it dictates the properties of an
organism.</p>
  <p>At a personal level, the emergence of a new discipline, biotechnology,
introduced me to a world outside of academia. This important excursion
showed me that brilliance is not limited to universities. I met and remain very
close to two dynamic leaders of technology development, Fred Adler and Joe
Pagano. Despite disparate histories, we remain very close and they continue
to fascinate me with lives quite different from that of a university professor.</p>
  <p>In 1982, I began to think about the potential impact of the new molecular
biology and recombinant DNA technology on problems in neuroscience.
Molecular biology was invented to solve fundamental problems in genetics at
a molecular level. With the demystification of the brain, with the realization
that the mind emerges from the brain and that the cells of the brain often use
the very same principles of organization and function as a humble bacterium
or a liver cell, perhaps molecular biology and genetics could now interface
with neuroscience to approach the tenuous relationship between genes and
behavior, cognition, memory, emotion, and perception. This thinking was the
result of a faculty meeting at which <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2000/index.html">Eric
Kandel</a> and I overcame our boredom
with administration by talking science. Eric was characteristically exuberant
about his recent data that revealed a correlation between a simple form of
memory in the marine snail, <i>Aplysia</i> and cellular memory at the level of a
specific synapse. Molecular biologists had encountered cellular memory
before in the self-perpetuating control of gene expression. This led to the
realization that this was the moment to begin to apply the techniques of
molecular biology to brain function and I would attempt to recruit Eric
Kandel as my teacher.</p>
  <p>A courageous new postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory, Richard Scheller,
now Director of Research for Genentech, was excited about embarking on an
initial effort in molecular neurobiology in a laboratory with absolutely no
expertise in neuroscience. Together with Richard and Eric, we set out to isolate
the genes responsible for the generation of stereotyped patterns of innate
behaviors. All organisms exhibit innate behaviors that are shaped by evolution
and inherited by successive generations that are largely unmodified by experience
or learning. It seemed reasonable to assume that this innate behavior
was dictated by genes that might be accessible to molecular cloning. It was an
exciting and amusing time with myself unfamiliar with action potentials and
Kandel uncomfortable with central dogma. Richard Scheller exploited the
techniques of recombinant DNA to identify a family of genes encoding a set
of related neuropeptides whose coordinated release is likely to govern the fixed
action pattern of behaviors associated with egg laying. A single gene, the ELH
gene, specifies a polyprotein that is cut into small biologically active peptides
such that individual components of the behavioral array may be mediated by
peptides encoded by one gene.</p>
  <p>Watching the story unfold, observing the interface of
    molecular biology and neuroscience provided great pleasure. More importantly,
    this collaboration formed the basis of a continuing relationship with Eric
Kandel, with his incisive
mind, inimitable laugh and boundless energy. In 1986, neuroscience for me
was made even richer when Tom Jessell came along. Tom joined the faculty at
Columbia and was to occupy a lab adjacent to my own. Not surprisingly, the lab
was not ready and I had the great pleasure of hosting Tom in my own
laboratory and this forged a long-lasting scientific and personal relationship.
Jessell, the understated British scientist with a wry wit and piercing mind, joined
a fellow in my laboratory, David Julius, now at the University of California at
San Francisco, and together they devised a clever assay for the isolation of
genes encoding the neurotransmitter receptors. These experiments, which
might have been the last performed by the hands of Jessell, led to the isolation
of genes encoding the seven transmembrane domain serotonin receptor,
5HT1C, and more generally provided an expression system that permitted the
identification of functional genes that encode receptors in the absence of any
information on the nature of the protein sequence. With Kandel one floor above,
and Jessell next door, there was no departure from neuroscience. I was surrounded
and I did not want to escape. I was beginning to feel that neuroscience was
indeed an appropriate occupation for a molecular biologist. To quote Woody
Allen, a fellow New Yorker, "The brain is my second favorite organ."</p>
  <p>In the late 1980's I became fascinated in the problem
    of perception: how the brain represents the external world. I was struck
    by observations from animal behavior that what an organism detects in its
    environment is only part of what is around it and that part can differ in
    different organisms. The brain functions then not by recording an exact
    image of the world but by creating its own selective picture. Biological
    reality will therefore reflect the particular representation of the external
    world that a brain is able to build and a brain builds with genes. If genes
    are indeed the arbiters of what we perceive from the outside world then it
    follows that an understanding of the function of these genes could provide
    insight into how the external world is represented in the brain. Together
    with Linda Buck, a creative fellow in the lab, we began to consider how the
    chemosensory world is represented in the brain. The problem of olfaction
    was a perfect intellectual target for a molecular biologist. How we recognize
    the vast diversity of odorous molecules posed a fascinating problem. We assumed
    that the solution would involve a large family of genes and Linda Buck devised
    a creative approach that indeed identified the genes encoding the receptors
    that recognize the vast array of odorants in the environment. Linda came
    to me with the experimental data late one night, exuberant, and I fell uncharacteristically
    silent. There were 1,000 odorant receptor genes in the rat genome, the largest
    family of genes in the chromosome and this provided the solution to the problem
    of the diversity of odor recognition. More importantly, the identification
    of these 10,000 genes and their expression revealed an early and unanticipated
    logic of olfaction. Indeed, the subsequent use of these genes to manipulate
    the genome of mice has afforded a view of how the olfactory world could be
    represented in the brain, how genes shape our perception of the sensory environment.
    From that late night moment to the present, it has been a joy to watch this
    story unfold.</p>
  <p>It is this work for which Linda Buck and I share the profound honor and
good fortune of having been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine. But there are deeper, more human joys, two sons, Adam and
Jonathan, my sister, Linda, a very close coterie of friends, and a new love.
Watching, contributing to the growth of my children is not only moving but
humbling and puts my intense life in science in perspective. Often this
intensity, bordering on obsession, distracted me from fathering and this is a
regret. But my sons have emerged from a frenetic teenage into very human
college students, extremely unlikely to pursue a career in science. My sister
remains a close and dedicated member of an increasingly small family. A new
love, Cori Bargmann, a behavioral geneticist now at Rockefeller University,
has entered my world. Her intensity for science hides a knowledge and
passion for books, music, and art. I have learned much from her but most
importantly, Cori has shown me how to combine intellectual intensity with
humanity and warmth.</p>
  <p>Finally, the Nobel Prize was awarded to me not as a man, but for my work,
a work of science that derives from the efforts of many brilliant students as
well as from the incisive teachings of devoted colleagues. I take equal pride in
the science that has been accomplished in the laboratory as in the scientists
that have trained with me and are now independently contributing to our
understanding of biology. I therefore feel that I can only accept the Nobel
Prize in trust, as a representative of a culture of science in my laboratory and
at Columbia University. I am deeply grateful for this culture.</p>
