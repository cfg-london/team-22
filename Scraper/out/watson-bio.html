  <h1>James Watson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="watson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>James Dewey Watson</b> was born in
  Chicago, Ill., on April 6th, 1928, as the only son of James D.
  Watson, a businessman, and Jean Mitchell. His father's ancestors
  were originally of English descent and had lived in the midwest
  for several generations. His mother's father was a Scottish-born
  tailor married to a daughter of Irish immigrants who arrived in
  the United States about 1840. Young Watson's entire boyhood was
  spent in Chicago where he attended for eight years Horace Mann
  Grammar School and for two years South Shore High School. He then
  received a tuition scholarship to the University of
  Chicago, and in the summer of 1943 entered their experimental
  four-year college.<br>
  <br>
  In 1947, he received a B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these
  years his boyhood interest in bird-watching had matured into a
  serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he
  received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana
  University in Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degree
  in Zoology in 1950. At Indiana, he was deeply influenced both by
  the geneticists <a href="../1946/index.html">H. J. Muller</a> and
  T. M. Sonneborn, and by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/index.html">S. E. Luria</a>, the
  Italian-born microbiologist then on the staff of Indiana's
  Bacteriology Department. Watson's Ph.D. thesis, done under
  Luria's able guidance, was a study of the effect of hard X-rays
  on bacteriophage multiplication.<br>
  <br>
  From September 1950 to September 1951 he spent his first
  postdoctoral year in Copenhagen as a Merck Fellow of the National Research
  Council. Part of the year was spent with the biochemist
  Herman Kalckar, the remainder with the microbiologist Ole
  Maal&oslash;e. Again he worked with bacterial viruses, attempting
  to study the fate of DNA of infecting virus particles. During the
  spring of 1951, he went with Kalckar to the Zoological Station at
  Naples. There at a Symposium, late in May, he met <a href=
  "index.html">Maurice Wilkins</a> and saw for the first time the
  X-ray diffraction pattern of crystalline DNA. This greatly
  stimulated him to change the direction of his research toward the
  structural chemistry of nucleic acids and proteins. Fortunately
  this proved possible when Luria, in early August 1951, arranged
  with <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html">John
  Kendrew</a> for him to work at the Cavendish
  Laboratory, where he started work in early October
  1951.<br>
  <br>
  He soon met <a href="index.html">Crick</a> and discovered their
  common interest in solving the DNA structure. They thought it
  should be possible to correctly guess its structure, given both
  the experimental evidence at King's College plus careful examination of
  the possible stereochemical configurations of polynucleotide
  chains. Their first serious effort, in the late fall of 1951, was
  unsatisfactory. Their second effort based upon more experimental
  evidence and better appreciation of the nucleic acid literature,
  resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal of the
  complementary double-helical configuration.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, he was experimentally investigating the
  structure of TMV, using X-ray diffraction techniques. His object
  was to see if its chemical sub-units, earlier revealed by the
  elegant experiments of Schramm, were helically arranged. This
  objective was achieved in late June 1952, when use of the
  Cavendish's newly constructed rotating anode X-ray tubes allowed
  an unambiguous demonstration of the helical construction of the
  virus.<br>
  <br>
  From 1953 to 1955, Watson was at the California Institute of
  Technology as Senior Research Fellow in Biology. There he
  collaborated with Alexander Rich in X-ray diffraction studies of
  RNA. In 1955-1956 he was back in the Cavendish, again working
  with Crick. During this visit they published several papers on
  the general principles of virus construction.<br>
  <br>
  Since the fall of 1956, he has been a member of the Harvard Biology
  Department, first as Assistant Professor, then in 1958 as an
  Associate Professor, and as Professor since 1961. During this
  interval, his major research interest has been the role of RNA in
  protein synthesis. Among his collaborators during this period
  were the Swiss biochemist Alfred Tissi&egrave;res and the French
  biochemist Fran&ccedil;ois Gros. Much experimental evidence
  supporting the messenger RNA concept was accumulated. His present
  principal collaborator is the theoretical physicist <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/index.html">Walter Gilbert</a> who, as
  Watson expressed it, &laquo;has recently learned the excitement of
  experimental molecular biology&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  The honours that have to come to Watson include: the John Collins
  Warren Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, with Crick in
  1959; the Eli Lilly Award in Biochemistry in the same year; the
  Lasker Award, with Crick and Wilkins in 1960; the Research
  Corporation Prize, with Crick in 1962; membership of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, and Foreign membership
  of the Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a
  consultant to the President's Scientific Advisory
  Committee.<br>

  Watson is unmarried. His recreations are bird-watching and
