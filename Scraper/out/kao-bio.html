<h1>Charles K. Kao - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="kao.jpg" class="bio-img"></p>
<p><strong>Family Background</strong><br>
  The Kao family comes from a township called Zhangyan in the Jinshan
  district near Shanghai, China<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>. As landowners, the family would have been
  considered wealthy. The sons of each generation would be well educated in
  the style of the times. My knowledge of the family&rsquo;s genealogy goes back only
to Grandfather.</p>
<p>Grandfather Kao Hsieh<sup><a href="#not2">2</a></sup> also went by the courtesy name Kao Ch&rsquo;ui Wan<sup><a href="#not3">3</a></sup>.
  He was a literary man, famous for his beautiful poems, which he would render
  in Chinese calligraphy; the combination of poetry with calligraphy is an
  art form of the East. As a Confucian scholar, he was a collector of books and
  also a prominent member of the <em>Nan She </em>(Southern Society). Other family
  members were also active in the Society; its aim during the 1911 Chinese
  Revolution was to help bring down the ruling Qing dynasty. A museum now
  erected in the town exhibits his work and also gives a history of the political
  activities the man participated in. He was of a liberal bent.</p>
<p>Grandfather had four sons and two daughters. My father, Kao Chun Hsin,
  was not the eldest of the sons. The eldest would have stayed in the town to
  look after the family properties and affairs; that is where those duties always
  fell. He was the third son. These sons were growing up as modern times were
  coming to China. After a good education in Shanghai, my father went to
  study for a year at the Michigan Law School. Before he left for the U.S.A., a
  marriage was arranged to a petite lady from one of the families in the social
  circle. She was left behind to wait for the return of the adventuring husband.
  Coming from an equally modern and intellectually accomplished family, the
  new wife was well educated and a poet herself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were the years when scions of the few wealthier middle-class families in China ventured out to Paris, to London, to New York, to further their experiences and studies. When they returned to China, they were welcomed
with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>On his return from the U.S.A., Kao Chun Hsin, a young man then only
  in his mid-twenties, was appointed to sit as the Chinese judge in the Court
  for International Law. He shared the bench with established judges from
  Western countries. With this prestigious appointment, he and his young wife
  moved to Shanghai, where they joined the social life of the city.  </p>

<p>The first child born to the couple was a daughter, followed two years
  later by a son. Misfortune struck. In a measles epidemic, both children were
  stricken, and both died from complications, the elder child ten years old,
  the younger eight. The mother was small boned and of a delicate, fragile
  appearance. Childbirth would not have been easy. In the years after the tragedy,
  she had miscarriages one after another. Finally in 1933, I was born, for my
  parents happily a healthy child. My younger brother Timothy was added to
  the family four years later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the earlier loss of the two elder siblings, my brother and I lived
  a very pampered and protected life. Nursemaids kept constant watch. With
  my parents busy at dinner parties and social events, we only met them as if
  for a daily royal audience. Later, home tutors came to give us lessons. The
  basic lesson plans were readings from the well-known classics, the <em>Four Books</em><sup><a href="#not4">4</a></sup>,
  which we learned to recite by memory. A second tutor taught English.</p>
<p>Finally, when I was ten, I was sent off to school. The driver dropped me
  off inside the school playground, telling me to wait and someone would tell
  me where to go. I had never seen so many kids running about so wildly in a
  crowd and stood wide-eyed.</p>
<p>A bell rang and soon the playground was empty, but for one solitary child.
  A kindly looking lady appeared and took me to my class. Maybe it was the
  home tutoring, or the late start to formal schooling, or an overly cautious
  and protective upbringing, but in any case I never became a talkative person.
  As an adult I am not always comfortable in social gatherings with small talk. I
  must have inherited my father&rsquo;s gentle nature.</p>
<p>The primary school I attended in Shanghai was a very liberal one, established
  by scholars who had return from an education in France. The children
  of leading families were enrolled there, including the son of a well-known
  man, believed to be a top gangster of the underworld!</p>
  
  <img src="kao_autobio_4.jpg" alt="Kao's old home in Shanghai, China">
<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i>Figure 4</i>. Kao's old home in Shanghai, China.</p>


 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By now the family had a home that was situated inside the French Concession.
  The International Settlements were in an area within the city where various
  Western powers held authority. These areas were generally kept free from
  the rough and tumble of the metropolis, providing a haven from the human
  poverty of China. The locals nicknamed this area <em>shili yangchang </em>(a ten-mile
  strip of foreign spectacles). So when the Japanese invaded China in the
  1930s, these areas were off limits for the invaders.</p>
<p>The family was shielded from the horrors that occurred. With the chaos
  of war, the law courts were suspended, and social gatherings dried up. My
  parents stayed home more during this period, and we built a closer
  relationship with them. Together we played bridge and card games to pass
  the hours.</p>
<p>The cessation of war with Japan did not bring peace. Soon the Red Army,
  who had been fighting the Nationalist Government, was at the city gates. My
  father made the decision to leave. The topic had been discussed often over
  the family games of bridge and the various options mulled over. To move to
  Chungking<sup><a href="#not5">5</a></sup>, or to join relatives in Taiwan, or perhaps there were relatives
  who lived in Hong Kong too?  </p>
<p>In 1948, gathering a few belongings, the family boarded a ship that sailed
  out of Shanghai on a grey dismal wet day. The famous waterfront at the Bund
  slowly receded out of sight and that was the last we saw of our home city for
  many years.</p>
<p>A short sojourn in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, persuaded my father that
  Hong Kong would be a better haven. With help from maternal relatives in
  Hong Kong, the family found a small apartment and my brother and I were
  enrolled into St. Joseph&rsquo;s College where our cousins also studied. As English
  was the preferred medium of instruction, the local dialect of Cantonese was
  not a requirement and I never felt the need to learn the tongue.</p>
<p>At 48, my father felt he was too old to study for the law exams that would
  qualify him to practice in Hong Kong. Instead he took on a job as legal
  adviser to a company and also taught a few Chinese law courses at local colleges.
  He became known in Hong Kong as the expert interpreter of the old
  Chinese laws. There were still some cases of family inheritance and such matters
  that would need expert advice of this type.</p>
<p>I did well academically, but did not apply myself much to athletics or sports
  during my five years at St. Joseph&rsquo;s College. My ex-classmates, in later life,
  reported that they remember me as a quiet person who did not join in the
  rough and tumble of boy play. I managed almost straight A&rsquo;s in the school
  matriculation examinations, which qualified me to apply for entry to the
  University of Hong Kong. However the University was still in some disarray
  after the war and not all faculties were functioning. I wished to study electrical
  engineering. Britain beckoned and the British Council in Hong Kong was
  helpful. In 1953 I boarded a P &amp; O liner bound for England.</p>
<p>I enrolled at Woolwich Polytechnic in London, to sit for the A-level exams
  which I passed easily. I was so much at home at Woolwich Polytechnic that instead
  of applying for entry to the other more prestigious Colleges of London
  University, I continued on to study for my bachelor&rsquo;s degree there. I graduated
  in 1957 with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. In those days the degrees were
  awarded as a First, Second, Pass or Fail. As I spent more time on the tennis
  court than with my books, my degree was a Second.</p>
<p>It was necessary to immediately find a job. Financing my studies had been
  a heavy burden for my father. I joined Standard Telephones &amp; Cables (STC),
  a British subsidiary of International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co (ITT) in
  North Woolwich, a factory located on the opposite bank of the Thames. As a
  trainee, I was rotated through different sections for a year before I decided
  that I liked the work in the microwave division. After two more years, I felt
  it was time to move on, and applied for a lectureship at Loughborough
  Polytechnic.</p>
<p>During my three years at STC, I met and married Gwen, a fellow engineer
  who worked in the lab one floor above my work bench. So we drove to
  Loughborough for the interview, I got the job, and we immediately set about
  to look for a home. Finding newly built homes, we put down a deposit on one
  and drove back to hand in our notices to STC. </p>

<p class="photo-gallery-caption"><i>Figure 5</i>. In 1965, the then young scientist Charles Kao doing an early experiment on optical fibers at the Standard Telecommunication Laboratories in Harlow, U.K.</p>


 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>However, It Was Not To Be<br>
</strong>Someone in senior management had noticed how I had worked on the
  microwave projects and felt the promise I showed should not be lost to the
  company. The offer came immediately to allow me to transfer to the research
  lab, STL, in Harlow. To add incentive for me to stay, a job would be found
  for Gwen too at the new location. Loughborough had to be pacified and the
  lawyers got to work on that, and to get the house deposit refunded. The offer
  was too good to pass up, and my future was destined to take on this new
  course. I stayed with ITT Corp, working for the next thirty years at various
  locations, in the U.K., the U.S.A. and Europe.</p>
<p>During these years, in 1967 my parents emigrated to join us in the U.K..
  They were then both in their late 60s and elderly, but still able to live independently.
  They were happy to see a grandson, born in 1961, and a granddaughter,
  born in 1963.</p>
<p>In 1970, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK, came calling.
  Would I come to the institution to set up an electronics department? STL
  agreed to give a two-year leave of absence, which then became four years. I
  was able to see the first batch of students graduate, and to establish a graduate
  program as well. During this time, 1970&ndash;1974, annual summer leaves
  were taken to return to STL to keep abreast of developments in the research
  field of optical fibers. It was also an opportunity to see my parents, who had
  remained in Harlow.</p>
<p>By 1974, the project I had seeded, with the now famous 1966 paper published
  in the <em>IEE Proceedings</em>, had progressed to the pre-production development stage. An industry had grown up around it and it was full speed ahead
  to revolutionize the telecommunications systems around the world. ITT
  wanted me back to be part of the team for this endeavor.</p>
<p>So the young family was uprooted again and the move this time was to
  the ITT plant in Roanoke, Virginia, in the U.S.A.. I was promoted to Chief
  Scientist, then Vice-President and Director of Engineering in charge of the
  electro-optical products division at ITT. During my years in the U.S.A., I continued
  to travel to other research labs around the world, to discuss progress,
  to encourage work, to keep abreast of the leading edge of the developments.
  It was a busy time. I always dropped by to visit my parents in the U.K..</p>
<p>In 1976, my mother died at the age of 76 years. My widowed father, who
  visited Roanoke once or twice, preferred his life in the U.K. and this situation
  continued until finally, in his eighth decade, he moved in to live with us,
  when we were back in Hong Kong again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the 1980s optical fibers were being laid across the world in vast quantities,
  and the industry had evolved into a giant. The capacity for communications
  had grown exponentially. In 1982 I was appointed Executive Scientist
  at ITT in charge of all research and development activities and I moved
  to the Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut, U.S.A.. This post was
  specially created and allowed me the freedom to do anything I considered
  important for ITT. In order to chart the waters on the ultimate limits of optical
  communication technology, I pioneered the Terabit Optoelectronics
  Technology Project to explore the technologies that could reach terabits
  per second of transmission capacity. The project involved a consortium of
  ten universities and institutions, and aimed at a goal that was three orders of
  magnitude higher than the then state-of-the-art. In 1985 I was appointed the
  Director of Corporate Research at ITT. During this time, many innovations
  by creative minds were evolving to make use of the increased capacity for
  sending information over the system. The internet was born.</p>
<p>In 1986, CUHK again came calling. This time the request was for me to
  accept the position as President of the University, the contract to begin in
  1987. In British terminology, this position is known as the Vice-Chancellor<sup><a href="#not6">6</a></sup>
  of the University.</p>
<p>The second move to Hong Kong was made as ITT Corp began the process
  of selling off all its technical divisions in the U.S.A. to Alcatel, a French
  business. After thirty years it was a sad moment to part company with
  colleagues of long standing.</p>
<p>I spent nine years as the third Vice-Chancellor of CUHK. It was an
  interesting and challenging time, both for Hong Kong as it prepared for
  the resumption of sovereignty by China, and for the higher education
  sector, which saw a massive expansion and improvements in quality. During
  those years I sought to establish research more prominently as part of the
  normal work of the faculty, set up contacts with many leading institutions in
  the U.S.A. and the U.K., and set the University on a path to become a more
  well-known institution, competitive with the best institutions. I was especially
  pleased with the establishment of the Faculty of Engineering, in which
  information technology played a major role. A Faculty of Education was also
  established during those years. A number of research institutes also came
  into being. The University nearly doubled in size during those few years, and
  a fourth undergraduate college was established.</p>
<p>At the University, my role was to create space for people to grow. What I
  had done essentially was create situations where people would like to take
  on responsibilities. This had enabled the University to grow as a whole:
  everybody would be contributing what they should because they feel it is their
  responsibility and the environment allows them to do so. I created the space
  at the right time for talent within the University to perform as it should, thus
  taking it to a new level of development.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of the tertiary education sector and the increased
  government funding that came with it have allowed us to do a lot of things
  to become a top university. The most satisfying change was a scholarly
  atmosphere on campus &ndash; people are pursuing important things because they
  believe such things are important.</p>
<p>It was perhaps natural that my advice was sought and I became involved
  in technology issues in the community, especially in relation to information
  technology. I was able to play a part in setting up an Internet exchange in
  Hong Kong (then a bit of a novelty and even now providing useful service),
  and in promoting the establishment of the Hong Kong Science Park.</p>
<p>My father died in 1996, just prior to my retirement from the University &ndash; a
  year before the return of colonial Hong Kong back to China. My father&rsquo;s ashes
  were brought back to England to be laid to rest with my mother &ndash; in a cemetery
  in Harlow. After a year of lecture tours around S. E. Asia, I stayed in Hong Kong,
  setting up my own company for consultancy. I was appointed to a number of
  companies as non-executive director.<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 2009, I moved to California to be
  closer to my two children.</p> 
  <p><strong>Vignettes from Childhood and Working Life Memories</strong><br>
    I had a fight with Lo, in my classroom. With our calligraphy brushes, we
  attacked and daubed each other&rsquo;s faces and hands with black ink. The
  teacher was horrified. Lo, my mother warned me, was the son of a bad man.
  I was to be careful not to fight with the boy again. Otherwise school was fine.
  We sang French songs. The calligraphy teacher was very encouraging. This
  stroke is beautiful and will be marked with a red dot. But this one is leaning
and unbalanced, it will get two red dots!</p>
<p>I made a good friend in primary school who liked to play with me at home.
  We got our driver to buy all sorts of chemicals. Reading from scientific magazines,
  together we experimented and made mud balls from phosphorous
  to throw at stray cats and dogs. The mud balls would explode with a bang
  and frighten the animals out of their wits! From glass bottles and such like
  I would fashion the funnels and beakers needed. I had bottles of cyanide
  and concentrated acids. One day as I was boiling up some nitric acid, the
  bottle exploded and the concentrated acid splashed onto my young brother&rsquo;s
  trousers. It burnt the cloth entirely away but fortunately did not land on
  any of his skin! My parents were furious and confiscated all my chemicals,
  including the cyanide. I wonder where they disposed of the stuff.</p>
<p>One day my father brought home a big round yellow disc of food that he
  told us was called &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; that foreigners ate. Food was in short supply so we
  ate it, but it tasted very funny. When we went outside for some walks we sometimes
  passed a big tall building with Japanese soldiers standing at the door.
  My parents told us to walk past quickly as people inside were killed there, and
  to bow to the soldiers.</p>
<p>It was sad to leave Shanghai, but I was fourteen years old and ready for
  new adventures. The war with Japan was also exciting. As we cowered under
  the desks, we could hear the aerial dogfight in the skies above. Peering from
  under, I could even catch a glimpse of the American planes chasing and diving
  after the Japanese planes!</p>
<p>So the waterfront of Shanghai faded away and we went to Hong Kong. The
  schooling there was easy and the book work was not hard at all. The class
  went on a field trip and some of my classmates got lost in the hills until it
  was pitch dark and they could see &ldquo;tigers&rdquo;! I was not in that group, but now,
  whenever we have a class re-union, the boys will relate their adventures with
  gusto and lots of laughs. So my years in Hong Kong passed by swiftly and I
  was to embark on my next adventure all by myself.</p>
<p>On the boat to England to study electrical engineering, I shared a cabin
  with three others. Two worked for the Hong Kong Government and were
  going to England to attend some courses relevant to their work, meteorology
  and water treatment respectively. The third was a professor of mathematics.
  During the sea trip, which lasted six weeks, the professor taught me quantum
  mechanics. He also took some other young students and myself under his
  wings. He escorted us to his friend&rsquo;s home when we stopped at Singapore
  and taught us all to eat hot curry and to wash the fiery food down with beer.</p>
<p>I was nineteen years old and had never before left my family to be on my
  own. Everything was a new experience. To put my foot down on the soil at
  Port Said so I could tell myself I had been to Africa, to sail pass the Straits of
  Gibraltar and say I had seen Europe and the Sahara, to find England a cold
  and grey land! Little did I think eleven long years would pass by before I
  would see my parents again.</p>
<p>The British Council staff met me and arranged lodgings for me with a
  landlady in a house in Plumstead Commons, near the Woolwich Poly. Her
  house was old and large, with rooms for several lodgers. We all ate breakfast
  and dinner together under the stern eyes of the landlady. Food was still
  scarce after World War II and the slices of meat served for dinner were so
  thin, they were transparent when held up to the light! After such a sparse
  meal, we all trooped out for &lsquo;fresh air&rsquo;, but the real reason was to buy fish
  and chips, which we scoffed down hungrily on the walk back up the hill. The
  habit remains; I still love fish and chips.</p>
<p>After graduation in 1957 from the Polytechnic, I joined STC and had to
  walk through the tunnel under the River Thames every day to work. My first
  project was to build an amplifier and I got out my books to study the theories.
  My boss came by and said to put away the books, just do it. School work is to
  exercise the brain so it can think intelligently. There was no need for more
  revamping of theories!</p>
<p>I met my wife-to-be at work. She was an engineer in the coil section. We
  were married in 1959 and our children were born, a son in 1961, and a
  daughter in 1963. By then we were living in Harlow and working at STL.</p>
<p>The research was enthralling work and in 1966 I published the now
  famous ground-breaking paper, &ldquo;Dielectric-fibre Surface Waveguides for
  Optical Frequencies&rdquo;. This research was to spawn a whole new industry over
  the next twenty years.</p>
<p>People asked me if the idea came as a sudden flash, eureka! I had been
  working since graduation on microwave transmissions. The theories and
  limitations were ground into my brain. I knew we needed much more
  bandwidth and thoughts of how it could be done were constantly in my
  mind.</p>
<p>Transmission of light through glass is an old, old idea. It had been used in
  past years to shine light for entertainment, for decoration, for short distances
  for surgery, through a glass rod, but it had not been possible to use it over the
  long distances required for telephony. Light passing through a rod of glass
  just fades out to nothing after a very short distance of a few feet. Efforts by
  many research laboratories to find a way to transmit light over long distances
  were desperate as the public, prompted by media reports of hopeful technical
  advances, were expecting more and more exotic services.</p>
<p>I played around with what was causing the failure of light to penetrate
  glass. With the invention of the laser in the 1950s and subsequent developments,
  there was an ideal source of light that could send out pulse of light
  in a digital stream of noughts and ones, represented by off and on states of
  the pulse.</p>
<p>Ideas do not always come in a flash, but by diligent trial-and-error experiments
  that take time and thought.</p>
