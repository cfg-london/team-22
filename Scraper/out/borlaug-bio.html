  <h1>Norman Borlaug - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="borlaug.jpg" class="bio-img">A central
  figure in the "green revolution", <b>Norman Ernest Borlaug</b>
  (born March 25, 1914) was born on a farm near Cresco, Iowa, to Henry
  and Clara Borlaug. For the past twenty-seven years he has
  collaborated with Mexican scientists on problems of wheat
  improvement; for the last ten or so of those years he has also
  collaborated with scientists from other parts of the world,
  especially from India and Pakistan, in adapting the new wheats to
  new lands and in gaining acceptance for their production. An
  eclectic, pragmatic, goal-oriented scientist, he accepts and
  discards methods or results in a constant search for more
  fruitful and effective ones, while at the same time avoiding the
  pursuit of what he calls "academic butterflies". A vigorous man
  who can perform prodigies of manual labor in the fields, he
  brings to his work the body and competitive spirit of the trained
  athlete, which indeed he was in his high school and college
  days.<br>
  <br>
  After completing his primary and secondary education in Cresco,
  Borlaug enrolled in the University of Minnesota where he studied forestry.
  Immediately before and immediately after receiving his Bachelor
  of Science degree in 1937, he worked for the U.S. Forestry
  Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. Returning to the
  University of Minnesota to study plant pathology, he received the
  master's degree in 1939 and the doctorate in 1942.<br>
  <br>
  From 1942 to 1944, he was a microbiologist on the staff of the du
  Pont de Nemours Foundation where he was in charge of research on
  industrial and agricultural bactericides, fungicides, and
  preservatives.<br>
  <br>
  In 1944 he accepted an appointment as geneticist and plant
  pathologist assigned the task of organizing and directing the
  Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico. This
  program, a joint undertaking by the Mexican government and the
  Rockefeller
  Foundation, involved scientific research in genetics, plant
  breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil science,
  and cereal technology. Within twenty years he was spectacularly
  successful in finding a high-yielding short-strawed,
  disease-resistant wheat.<br>
  <br>
  To his scientific goal he soon added that of the practical
  humanitarian: arranging to put the new cereal strains into
  extensive production in order to feed the hungry people of the
  world - and thus providing, as he says, "a temporary success in
  man's war against hunger and deprivation," a breathing space in
  which to deal with the "Population Monster" and the subsequent
  environmental and social ills that too often lead to conflict
  between men and between nations. Statistics on the vast acreage
  planted with the new wheat and on the revolutionary yields
  harvested in Mexico, India, and Pakistan are given in the
  presentation speech by Mrs. Lionaes and in the Nobel lecture by
  Dr. Borlaug. Well advanced, also, is the use of the new wheat in
  six Latin American countries, six in the Near and Middle East,
  several in Africa.<br>
  <br>
  When the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in cooperation with the
  Mexican government established the International Maize and Wheat
  Improvement Center (CIMMYT), an autonomous international research
  training institute having an international board of trustees and
  staff, Dr. Borlaug was made director of its International Wheat
  Improvement Program. In this capacity he has been able to realize
  more fully a third objective, that of training young scientists
  in research and production methods. From his earliest days in
  Mexico he has, to be sure, carried on an intern program, but with
  the establishment of the Center, he has been able to reach out
  internationally. In the last seven years some 1940 young
  scientists from sixteen or so countries (the figures constantly
  move upward) have studied and worked at the Center.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Borlaug is presently participating in extensive
  experimentation with triticale, a man-made species of grain
  derived from a cross between wheat rye that shows promise of
  being superior to either wheat or rye in productivity and
  nutritional quality.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Borlaug has received
  extensive recognition from universities and organizations in six
  countries: Canada, India, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, the United
  States. In 1968 he received an especially satisfying tribute when
  the people of Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico, in whose area he
  did some of his first experimenting, named a street in his
  honor.</p>
