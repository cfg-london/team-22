  <h2>How Characters Became the Masters and the Author Their
    Apprentice</h2>
  <p>The wisest man I ever knew in my whole life
  could not read or write. At four o'clock in the morning, when the
  promise of a new day still lingered over French lands, he got up
  from his pallet and left for the fields, taking to pasture the
  half-dozen pigs whose fertility nourished him and his wife. My
  mother's parents lived on this scarcity, on the small breeding of
  pigs that after weaning were sold to the neighbours in our
  village of Azinhaga in the province of Ribatejo. Their names were
  Jer&oacute;nimo Meirinho and Josefa Caixinha and they were both
  illiterate. In winter when the cold of the night grew to the
  point of freezing the water in the pots inside the house, they
  went to the sty and fetched the weaklings among the piglets,
  taking them to their bed. Under the coarse blankets, the warmth
  from the humans saved the little animals from freezing and
  rescued them from certain death. Although the two were kindly
  people, it was not a compassionate soul that prompted them to act
  in that way: what concerned them, without sentimentalism or
  rhetoric, was to protect their daily bread, as is natural for
  people who, to maintain their life, have not learnt to think more
  than is needful. Many times I helped my grandfather Jer&oacute;nimo
  in his swineherd's labour, many times I dug the land in the
  vegetable garden adjoining the house, and I chopped wood for the
  fire, many times, turning and turning the big iron wheel which
  worked the water pump. I pumped water from the community well and
  carried it on my shoulders. Many times, in secret, dodging from
  the men guarding the cornfields, I went with my grandmother, also
  at dawn, armed with rakes, sacking and cord, to glean the
  stubble, the loose straw that would then serve as litter for the
  livestock. And sometimes, on hot summer nights, after supper, my
  grandfather would tell me: "Jos&eacute;, tonight we're going to
  sleep, both of us, under the fig tree". There were two other fig
  trees, but that one, certainly because it was the biggest,
  because it was the oldest, and timeless, was, for everybody in
  the house, the fig tree. More or less by antonomasia, an erudite
  word that I met only many years after and learned the meaning
  of  ... Amongst the peace of the night, amongst the tree's high
  branches a star appeared to me and then slowly hid behind a leaf
  while, turning my gaze in another direction I saw rising into
  view like a river flowing silent through the hollow sky, the opal
  clarity of the Milky Way, the Road to Santiago as we still used
  to call it in the village. With sleep delayed, night was peopled
  with the stories and the cases my grandfather told and told:
  legends, apparitions, terrors, unique episodes, old deaths,
  scuffles with sticks and stones, the words of our forefathers, an
  untiring rumour of memories that would keep me awake while at the
  same time gently lulling me. I could never know if he was silent
  when he realised that I had fallen asleep or if he kept on
  talking so as not to leave half-unanswered the question I
  invariably asked into the most delayed pauses he placed on
  purpose within the account: "And what happened next?" Maybe he
  repeated the stories for himself, so as not to forget them, or
  else to enrich them with new detail. At that age and as we all do
  at some time, needless to say, I imagined my grandfather
  Jer&oacute;nimo was master of all the knowledge in the world. When
  at first light the singing of birds woke me up, he was not there
  any longer, had gone to the field with his animals, letting me
  sleep on. Then I would get up, fold the coarse blanket and
  barefoot - in the village I always walked barefoot till I was
  fourteen - and with straws still stuck in my hair, I went from
  the cultivated part of the yard to the other part, where the
  sties were, by the house. My grandmother, already afoot before my
  grandfather, set in front of me a big bowl of coffee with pieces
  of bread in and asked me if I had slept well. If I told her some
  bad dream, born of my grandfather's stories, she always reassured
  me: "Don't make much of it, in dreams there's nothing solid". At
  the time I thought, though my grandmother was also a very wise
  woman, she couldn't rise to the heights grandfather could, a man
  who, lying under a fig tree, having at his side Jos&eacute; his
  grandson, could set the universe in motion just with a couple of
  words. It was only many years after, when my grandfather had
  departed from this world and I was a grown man, I finally came to
  realise that my grandmother, after all, also believed in dreams.
  There could have been no other reason why, sitting one evening at
  the door of her cottage where she now lived alone, staring at the
  biggest and smallest stars overhead, she said these words: "The
  world is so beautiful and it is such a pity that I have to die".
  She didn't say she was afraid of dying, but that it was a pity to
  die, as if her hard life of unrelenting work was, in that almost
  final moment, receiving the grace of a supreme and last farewell,
  the consolation of beauty revealed. She was sitting at the door
  of a house like none other I can imagine in all the world,
  because in it lived people who could sleep with piglets as if
  they were their own children, people who were sorry to leave life
  just because the world was beautiful; and this Jer&oacute;nimo, my
  grandfather, swineherd and story-teller, feeling death about to
  arrive and take him, went and said goodbye to the trees in the
  yard, one by one, embracing them and crying because he knew he
  wouldn't see them again.<br>
  <br>
  Many years later, writing for the first time about my grandfather
  Jer&oacute;nimo and my grandmother Josefa (I haven't said so far
  that she was, according to many who knew her when young, a woman
  of uncommon beauty), I was finally aware I was transforming the
  ordinary people they were into literary characters: this was,
  probably, my way of not forgetting them, drawing and redrawing
  their faces with the pencil that ever changes memory, colouring
  and illuminating the monotony of a dull and horizonless daily
  routine as if creating, over the unstable map of memory, the
  supernatural unreality of the country where one has decided to
  spend one's life. The same attitude of mind that, after evoking
  the fascinating and enigmatic figure of a certain Berber
  grandfather, would lead me to describe more or less in these
  words an old photo (now almost eighty years old) showing my
  parents "both standing, beautiful and young, facing the
  photographer, showing in their faces an expression of solemn
  seriousness, maybe fright in front of the camera at the very
  instant when the lens is about to capture the image they will
  never have again, because the following day will be, implacably,
  another day  ... My mother is leaning her right elbow against a
  tall pillar and holds, in her right hand drawn in to her body, a
  flower. My father has his arm round my mother's back, his
  callused hand showing over her shoulder, like a wing. They are
  standing, shy, on a carpet patterned with branches. The canvas
  forming the fake background of the picture shows diffuse and
  incongruous neo-classic architecture." And I ended, "The day will
  come when I will tell these things. Nothing of this matters
  except to me. A Berber grandfather from North Africa, another
  grandfather a swineherd, a wonderfully beautiful grandmother;
  serious and handsome parents, a flower in a picture - what other
  genealogy would I care for? and what better tree would I lean
  against?"<br>
  <br>
  I wrote these words almost thirty years ago, having no other
  purpose than to rebuild and register instants of the lives of
  those people who engendered and were closest to my being,
  thinking that nothing else would need explaining for people to
  know where I came from and what materials the person I am was
  made of, and what I have become little by little. But after all I
  was wrong, biology doesn't determine everything and as for
  genetics, very mysterious must have been its paths to make its
  voyages so long  ... My genealogical tree (you will forgive the
  presumption of naming it this way, being so diminished in the
  substance of its sap) lacked not only some of those branches that
  time and life's successive encounters cause to burst from the
  main stem but also someone to help its roots penetrate the
  deepest subterranean layers, someone who could verify the
  consistency and flavour of its fruit, someone to extend and
  strengthen its top to make of it a shelter for birds of passage
  and a support for nests. When painting my parents and
  grandparents with the paints of literature, transforming them
  from common people of flesh and blood into characters, newly and
  in different ways builders of my life, I was, without noticing,
  tracing the path by which the characters I would invent later on,
  the others, truly literary, would construct and bring to me the
  materials and the tools which, at last, for better or for worse,
  in the sufficient and in the insufficient, in profit and loss, in
  all that is scarce but also in what is too much, would make of me
  the person whom I nowadays recognise as myself: the creator of
  those characters but at the same time their own creation. In one
  sense it could even be said that, letter-by-letter, word-by-word,
  page-by-page, book after book, I have been successively
  implanting in the man I was the characters I created. I believe
  that without them I wouldn't be the person I am today; without
  them maybe my life wouldn't have succeeded in becoming more than
  an inexact sketch, a promise that like so many others remained
  only a promise, the existence of someone who maybe might have
  been but in the end could not manage to be.<br>
  <br>
  Now I can clearly see those who were my life-masters, those who
  most intensively taught me the hard work of living, those dozens
  of characters from my novels and plays that right now I see
  marching past before my eyes, those men and women of paper and
  ink, those people I believed I was guiding as I the narrator
  chose according to my whim, obedient to my will as an author,
  like articulated puppets whose actions could have no more effect
  on me than the burden and the tension of the strings I moved them
  with. Of those masters, the first was, undoubtedly, a mediocre
  portrait-painter, whom I called simply H, the main character of a
  story that I feel may reasonably be called a double initiation
  (his own, but also in a manner of speaking the author's) entitled
  <i>Manual of Painting and Calligraphy,</i> who taught me the
  simple honesty of acknowledging and observing, without resentment
  or frustration, my own limitations: as I could not and did not
  aspire to venture beyond my little plot of cultivated land, all I
  had left was the possibility of digging down, underneath, towards
  the roots. My own but also the world's, if I can be allowed such
  an immoderate ambition. It's not up to me, of course, to evaluate
  the merits of the results of efforts made, but today I consider
  it obvious that all my work from then on has obeyed that purpose
  and that principle.<br>
  <br>
  Then came the men and women of Alentejo, that same brotherhood of
  the condemned of the earth where belonged my grandfather
  Jer&oacute;nimo and my grandmother Josefa, primitive peasants
  obliged to hire out the strength of their arms for a wage and
  working conditions that deserved only to be called infamous,
  getting for less than nothing a life which the cultivated and
  civilised beings we are proud to be are pleased to call -
  depending on the occasion - precious, sacred or sublime. Common
  people I knew, deceived by a Church both accomplice and
  beneficiary of the power of the State and of the landlords,
  people permanently watched by the police, people so many times
  innocent victims of the arbitrariness of a false justice. Three
  generations of a peasant family, the Badweathers, from the
  beginning of the century to the April Revolution of 1974 which
  toppled dictatorship, move through this novel, called <i>Risen
  from the Ground,</i> and it was with such men and women risen
  from the ground, real people first, figures of fiction later,
  that I learned how to be patient, to trust and to confide in
  time, that same time that simultaneously builds and destroys us
  in order to build and once more to destroy us. The only thing I
  am not sure of having assimilated satisfactorily is something
  that the hardship of those experiences turned into virtues in
  those women and men: a naturally austere attitude towards life.
  Having in mind, however, that the lesson learned still after more
  than twenty years remains intact in my memory, that every day I
  feel its presence in my spirit like a persistent summons: I
  haven't lost, not yet at least, the hope of meriting a little
  more the greatness of those examples of dignity proposed to me in
  the vast immensity of the plains of Alentejo. Time will
  tell.<br>
  <br>
  What other lessons could I possibly receive from a Portuguese who
  lived in the sixteenth century, who composed the <i>Rimas</i> and
  the glories, the shipwrecks and the national disenchantments in
  the <i>Lus&iacute;adas,</i> who was an absolute poetical genius,
  the greatest in our literature, no matter how much sorrow this
  causes to Fernando Pessoa, who proclaimed himself its Super
  Cam&otilde;es? No lesson would fit me, no lesson could I learn,
  except the simplest, which could have been offered to me by
  Lu&iacute;s Vaz de Cam&otilde;es in his pure humanity, for instance
  the proud humility of an author who goes knocking at every door
  looking for someone willing to publish the book he has written,
  thereby suffering the scorn of the ignoramuses of blood and race,
  the disdainful indifference of a king and of his powerful
  entourage, the mockery with which the world has always received
  the visits of poets, visionaries and fools. At least once in
  life, every author has been, or will have to be, Lu&iacute;s de
  Cam&otilde;es, even if they haven't written the poem
  <i>S&ocirc;bolos Rios</i>  ... Among nobles, courtiers and censors
  from the Holy Inquisition, among the loves of yester-year and the
  disillusionments of premature old age, between the pain of
  writing and the joy of having written, it was this ill man,
  returning poor from India where so many sailed just to get rich,
  it was this soldier blind in one eye, slashed in his soul, it was
  this seducer of no fortune who will never again flutter the
  hearts of the ladies in the royal court, whom I put on stage in a
  play called <i>What shall I do with this Book?,</i> whose ending
  repeats another question, the only truly important one, the one
  we will never know if it will ever have a sufficient answer:
  "What will you do with this book?" It was also proud humility to
  carry under his arm a masterpiece and to be unfairly rejected by
  the world. Proud humility also, and obstinate too - wanting to
  know what the purpose will be, tomorrow, of the books we are
  writing today, and immediately doubting whether they will last a
  long time (how long?) the reassuring reasons we are given or that
  are given us by ourselves. No-one is better deceived than when he
  allows others to deceive him.<br>
  <br>
  Here comes a man whose left hand was taken in war and a woman who
  came to this world with the mysterious power of seeing what lies
  beyond people's skin. His name is Baltazar Mateus and his
  nickname Seven-Suns; she is known as Blimunda and also, later, as
  Seven-Moons because it is written that where there is a sun there
  will have to be a moon and that only the conjoined and harmonious
  presence of the one and the other will, through love, make earth
  habitable. There also approaches a Jesuit priest called
  Bartolomeu who invented a machine capable of going up to the sky
  and flying with no other fuel than the human will, the will
  which, people say, can do anything, the will that could not, or
  did not know how to, or until today did not want to, be the sun
  and the moon of simple kindness or of even simpler respect. These
  three Portuguese fools from the eighteenth century, in a time and
  country where superstition and the fires of the Inquisition
  flourished, where vanity and the megalomania of a king raised a
  convent, a palace and a basilica which would amaze the outside
  world, if that world, in a very unlikely supposition, had eyes
  enough to see Portugal, eyes like Blimunda's, eyes to see what
  was hidden  ... Here also comes a crowd of thousands and thousands
  of men with dirty and callused hands, exhausted bodies after
  having lifted year after year, stone-by-stone, the implacable
  convent walls, the huge palace rooms, the columns and pilasters,
  the airy belfries, the basilica dome suspended over empty space.
  The sounds we hear are from Domenico Scarlatti's harpsichord, and
  he doesn't quite know if he is supposed to be laughing or
  crying  ... This is the story of <i>Baltazar and Blimunda,</i> a
  book where the apprentice author, thanks to what had long ago
  been taught to him in his grandparents' Jer&oacute;nimo's and
  Josefa's time, managed to write some similar words not without
  poetry: "Besides women's talk, dreams are what hold the world in
  its orbit. But it is also dreams that crown it with moons, that's
  why the sky is the splendour in men's heads, unless men's heads
  are the one and only sky." So be it.<br>
  <br>
  Of poetry the teenager already knew some lessons, learnt in his
  textbooks when, in a technical school in Lisbon, he was being
  prepared for the trade he would have at the beginning of his
  labour's life: mechanic. He also had good poetry masters during
  long evening hours in public libraries, reading at random, with
  finds from catalogues, with no guidance, no-one to advise him,
  with the creative amazement of the sailor who invents every place
  he discovers. But it was at the Industrial School Library that
  <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis</i> started to be
  written ... There, one day the young mechanic (he was about
  seventeen) found a magazine entitled <i>Atena</i> containing
  poems signed with that name and, naturally, being very poorly
  acquainted with the literary cartography of his country, he
  thought that there really was a Portuguese poet called Ricardo
  Reis. Very soon, though, he found that this poet was really one
  Fernando Nogueira Pessoa, who signed his works with the names of
  non-existent poets, born of his mind. He called them heteronyms,
  a word that did not exist in the dictionaries of the time which
  is why it was so hard for the apprentice to letters to know what
  it meant. He learnt many of Ricardo Reis' poems by heart ("To be
  great, be one/Put yourself into the little things you do"); but
  in spite of being so young and ignorant, he could not accept that
  a superior mind could really have conceived, without remorse, the
  cruel line "Wise is he who is satisfied with the spectacle of the
  world". Later, much later, the apprentice, already with grey
  hairs and a little wiser in his own wisdom, dared to write a
  novel to show this poet of the <i>Odes</i> something about the
  spectacle of the world of 1936, where he had placed him to live
  out his last few days: the occupation of the Rhineland by the
  Nazi army, Franco's war against the Spanish Republic, the
  creation by Salazar of the Portuguese Fascist militias. It was
  his way of telling him: "Here is the spectacle of the world, my
  poet of serene bitterness and elegant scepticism. Enjoy, behold,
  since to be sitting is your wisdom ..."<br>
  <br>
  <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis</i> ended with the
  melancholy words: "Here, where the sea has ended and land
  awaits." So there would be no more discoveries by Portugal, fated
  to one infinite wait for futures not even imaginable; only the
  usual fado, the same old saudade and little more ... Then the
  apprentice imagined that there still might be a way of sending
  the ships back to the water, for instance, by moving the land and
  setting that out to sea. An immediate fruit of collective
  Portuguese resentment of the historical disdain of Europe (more
  accurate to say fruit of my own resentment ...) the novel I then
  wrote - <i>The Stone Raft</i> - separated from the Continent the
  whole Iberian Peninsula and transformed it into a big floating
  island, moving of its own accord with no oars, no sails, no
  propellers, in a southerly direction, "a mass of stone and land,
  covered with cities, villages, rivers, woods, factories and
  bushes, arable land, with its people and animals" on its way to a
  new Utopia: the cultural meeting of the Peninsular peoples with
  the peoples from the other side of the Atlantic, thereby defying
  - my strategy went that far - the suffocating rule exercised over
  that region by the United States of America ... A vision twice
  Utopian would see this political fiction as a much more generous
  and human metaphor: that Europe, all of it, should move South to
  help balance the world, as compensation for its former and its
  present colonial abuses. That is, Europe at last as an ethical
  reference. The characters in <i>The Stone Raft</i> - two women,
  three men and a dog - continually travel through the Peninsula as
  it furrows the ocean. The world is changing and they know they
  have to find in themselves the new persons they will become (not
  to mention the dog, he is not like other dogs ...). This will
  suffice for them.<br>
  <br>
  Then the apprentice recalled that at a remote time of his life he
  had worked as a proof-reader and that if, so to say, in <i>The
  Stone Raft</i> he had revised the future, now it might not be a
  bad thing to revise the past, inventing a novel to be called
  <i>History of the Siege of Lisbon,</i> where a proof-reader,
  checking a book with the same title but a real history book and
  tired of watching how "History" is less and less able to
  surprise, decides to substitute a "yes" for a "no", subverting
  the authority of "historical truth". Raimundo Silva, the
  proof-reader, is a simple, common man, distinguished from the
  crowd only by believing that all things have their visible sides
  and their invisible ones and that we will know nothing about them
  until we manage to see both. He talks about this with the
  historian thus: "I must remind you that proof-readers are serious
  people, much experienced in literature and life, My book, don't
  forget, deals with history. However, since I have no intention of
  pointing out other contradictions, in my modest opinion, Sir,
  everything that is not literature is life, History as well,
  Especially history, without wishing to give offence, And painting
  and music, Music has resisted since birth, it comes and goes,
  tries to free itself from the word, I suppose out of envy, only
  to submit in the end, And painting, Well now, painting is nothing
  more than literature achieved with paintbrushes, I trust you
  haven't forgotten that mankind began to paint long before it knew
  how to write, Are you familiar with the proverb, If you don't
  have a dog, go hunting with a cat, in other words, the man who
  cannot write, paints or draws, as if he were a child, What you
  are trying to say, in other words, is that literature already
  existed before it was born, Yes, Sir, just like man who, in a
  manner of speaking, existed before he came into being, It strikes
  me that you have missed your vocation, you should have become a
  philosopher, or historian, you have the flair and temperament
  needed for these disciplines, I lack the necessary training, Sir,
  and what can a simple man achieve without training, I was more
  than fortunate to come into the world with my genes in order, but
  in a raw state as it were, and then no education beyond primary
  school, You could have presented yourself as being self-taught,
  the product of your own worthy efforts, there's nothing to be
  ashamed of, society in the past took pride in its autodidacts, No
  longer, progress has come along and put an end to all of that,
  now the self-taught are frowned upon, only those who write
  entertaining verses and stories are entitled to be and go on
  being autodidacts, lucky for them, but as for me, I must confess
  that I never had any talent for literary creation, Become a
  philosopher, man, You have a keen sense of humour, Sir, with a
  distinct flair for irony, and I ask myself how you ever came to
  devote yourself to history, serious and profound science as it
  is, I'm only ironic in real life, It has always struck me that
  history is not real life, literature, yes, and nothing else, But
  history was real life at the time when it could not yet be called
  history, So you believe, Sir, that history is real life, Of
  course, I do, I meant to say that history was real life, No doubt
  at all, What would become of us if the deleatur did not exist,
  sighed the proof-reader." It is useless to add that the
  apprentice had learnt, with Raimundo Silva, the lesson of doubt.
  It was about time.<br>
  <br>
  Well, probably it was this learning of doubt that made him go
  through the writing of <i>The Gospel According to Jesus
  Christ</i>. True, and he has said so, the title was the result of
  an optical illusion, but it is fair to ask whether it was the
  serene example of the proof-reader who, all the time, had been
  preparing the ground from where the new novel would gush out.
  This time it was not a matter of looking behind the pages of the
  New Testament searching for antitheses, but of illuminating their
  surfaces, like that of a painting, with a low light to heighten
  their relief, the traces of crossings, the shadows of
  depressions. That's how the apprentice read, now surrounded by
  evangelical characters, as if for the first time, the description
  of the massacre of the innocents and, having read, he couldn't
  understand. He couldn't understand why there were already martyrs
  in a religion that would have to wait thirty years more to listen
  to its founder pronouncing the first word about it, he could not
  understand why the only person that could have done so dared not
  save the lives of the children of Bethlehem, he could not
  understand Joseph's lack of a minimum feeling of responsibility,
  of remorse, of guilt, or even of curiosity, after returning with
  his family from Egypt. It cannot even be argued in defence that
  it was necessary for the children of Bethlehem to die to save the
  life of Jesus: simple common sense, that should preside over all
  things human and divine, is there to remind us that God would not
  send His Son to Earth, particularly with the mission of redeeming
  the sins of mankind, to die beheaded by a soldier of Herod at the
  age of two ... In that Gospel, written by the apprentice with the
  great respect due to great drama, Joseph will be aware of his
  guilt, will accept remorse as a punishment for the sin he has
  committed and will be taken to die almost without resistance, as
  if this were the last remaining thing to do to clear his accounts
  with the world. The apprentice's Gospel is not, consequently, one
  more edifying legend of blessed beings and gods, but the story of
  a few human beings subjected to a power they fight but cannot
  defeat. Jesus, who will inherit the dusty sandals with which his
  father had walked so many country roads, will also inherit his
  tragic feeling of responsibility and guilt that will never
  abandon him, not even when he raises his voice from the top of
  the cross: "Men, forgive him because he knows not what he has
  done", referring certainly to the God who has sent him there, but
  perhaps also, if in that last agony he still remembers, his real
  father who has generated him humanly in flesh and blood. As you
  can see, the apprentice had already made a long voyage when in
  his heretical Gospel he wrote the last words of the temple
  dialogue between Jesus and the scribe: "Guilt is a wolf that eats
  its cub after having devoured its father, The wolf of which you
  speak has already devoured my father, Then it will be soon your
  turn, And what about you, have you ever been devoured, Not only
  devoured, but also spewed up".<br>
  <br>
  Had Emperor Charlemagne not established a monastery in North
  Germany, had that monastery not been the origin of the city of
  M&uuml;nster, had M&uuml;nster not wished to celebrate its
  twelve-hundredth anniversary with an opera about the dreadful
  sixteenth-century war between Protestant Anabaptists and
  Catholics, the apprentice would not have written his play <i>In
  Nomine Dei</i>. Once more, with no other help than the tiny light
  of his reason, the apprentice had to penetrate the obscure
  labyrinth of religious beliefs, the beliefs that so easily make
  human beings kill and be killed. And what he saw was, once again,
  the hideous mask of intolerance, an intolerance that in
  M&uuml;nster became an insane paroxysm, an intolerance that
  insulted the very cause that both parties claimed to defend.
  Because it was not a question of war in the name of two inimical
  gods, but of war in the name of a same god. Blinded by their own
  beliefs, the Anabaptists and the Catholics of M&uuml;nster were
  incapable of understanding the most evident of all proofs: on
  Judgement Day, when both parties come forward to receive the
  reward or the punishment they deserve for their actions on earth,
  God - if His decisions are ruled by anything like human logic -
  will have to accept them all in Paradise, for the simple reason
  that they all believe in it. The terrible slaughter in
  M&uuml;nster taught the apprentice that religions, despite all
  they promised, have never been used to bring men together and
  that the most absurd of all wars is a holy war, considering that
  God cannot, even if he wanted to, declare war on himself ...<br>
  <br>
  Blind. The apprentice thought, "we are blind", and he sat down
  and wrote <i>Blindness</i> to remind those who might read it that
  we pervert reason when we humiliate life, that human dignity is
  insulted every day by the powerful of our world, that the
  universal lie has replaced the plural truths, that man stopped
  respecting himself when he lost the respect due to his
  fellow-creatures. Then the apprentice, as if trying to exorcise
  the monsters generated by the blindness of reason, started
  writing the simplest of all stories: one person is looking for
  another, because he has realised that life has nothing more
  important to demand from a human being. The book is called <i>All
  the Names.</i> Unwritten, all our names are there. The names of
  the living and the names of the dead.<br>
  <br>
  I conclude. The voice that read these pages wished to be the echo
  of the conjoined voices of my characters. I don't have, as it
  were, more voice than the voices they had. Forgive me if what has
  seemed little to you, to me is all.</p>
