  <h1>John E. Walker - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="walker.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Halifax, Yorkshire on
  January 7th, 1941 to Thomas Ernest Walker and Elsie Walker
  (n&eacute;e Lawton). My father was a stone mason, and a talented
  amateur pianist and vocalist. I was brought up with my two
  younger sisters, Judith and Jennifer, in a rural environment
  overlooking the Calder valley near Elland, and then in Rastrick.
  I received an academic education at Rastrick Grammar School,
  specializing in Physical Sciences and Mathematics in the last
  three years. I was a keen sportsman, and became school captain in
  soccer and cricket. In 1960, I went to St. Catherine's
  College, Oxford, and received the B.A. degree in Chemistry in
  1964.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965, I began research on peptide antibiotics with E. P.
  Abraham in the Sir Willian Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, and
  was awarded the D. Phil. degree in 1969. During this period, I
  became aware of the spectacular developments made in Cambridge in the
  1950s and early 1960s in Molecular Biology through a series of
  programmes on BBC television given by <a href=
  "../1962/index.html">John Kendrew</a>, and published in 1966
  under the title "The Thread of Life". These programmes made a
  lasting impression on me, and made me want to know more about the
  subject. Two books, "Molecular Biology of the Gene" by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">J. D. Watson</a>, first
  published in 1965, and William Hayes' "Bacterial Genetics" helped
  to assuage my appetite for more information. My knowledge of this
  new field was extended by a series of exciting lectures for
  graduate students on protein structure given in 1966 by David
  Phillips, the new Professor of Molecular Biophysics at Oxford. Another series
  of lectures given by Henry Harris, the Professor of Pathology and
  published in book form under the title "Nucleus and Cytoplasm",
  provided more food for thought.<br>
  <br>
  Then followed a period of five years working abroad, from
  1969-1971, first at The School of Pharmacy at the University of
  Wisconsin, and then from 1971-1974 in France, supported by
  Fellowships from NATO and EMBO, first at the CNRS at
  Gif-sur-Yvette and then at the Institut
  Pasteur.<br>
  <br>
  Just before Easter in 1974, I attended a research workshop in
  Cambridge entitled "Sequence Analysis of Proteins". It was
  sponsored by EMBO (The European Molecular Biology Organization),
  and organised by Ieuan Harris from the Medical Research Council's
  Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) and by Richard Perham from
  the Cambridge University Department of Biochemistry. At the
  associated banquet, I found myself sitting next to someone that I
  had not met previously, who turned out to be <a href=
  "../1958/index.html">Fred Sanger</a>. In the course of our
  conversation, he asked if I had thought about coming back to work
  in England. I jumped at the suggestion, and with some
  trepidation, approached Ieuan Harris about the possibility of my
  joining his group. After discussions with Fred Sanger, it was
  agreed that I could come to the Protein and Nucleic Acid
  Chemistry (PNAC) Division at the LMB for three months from June
  1974. More than 23 years later, I am still there.<br>
  <br>
  It goes without saying that this encounter with Fred Sanger and
  Ieuan Harris transformed my scientific career. In 1974, the LMB
  was infused throughout its three Divisions with a spirit of
  enthusiasm and excitement for research in molecular biology led
  by <a href="../1962/index.html">Max Perutz</a> (the Chairman of
  the Laboratory), Fred Sanger, <a href="../1982/index.html">Aaron
  Klug</a>, <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis
  Crick</a>, Sidney Brenner, Hugh Huxley, John Smith and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/index.html">C&eacute;sar Milstein</a>,
  which was coupled with extraordinary success. For example, along
  the corridor from my laboratory Fred was inventing his methods
  for sequencing DNA, immediately across the corridor C&eacute;sar
  Milstein and Georges K&ouml;hler were inventing monoclonal
  antibodies, and elsewhere in the building, Francis Crick and
  Aaron Klug and their colleagues were revealing the structures of
  chromatin and transfer RNA. Fred's new DNA sequencing methods
  were applied first to the related bacteriophages fX174 and G4,
  and then to DNA from human and bovine mitochondria. I analyzed
  the sequences of the proteins from G4 and from mitochondria using
  direct methods. These efforts led to the discovery of triple
  overlapping genes in G4 where all three DNA phases encode
  proteins, and to the discovery that subunits I and II of
  cytochrome c oxidase were encoded in the DNA in mitochondria.
  Later on, I helped to uncover details of the modified genetic
  code in mitochondria.<br>
  <br>
  In 1978, I decided to apply protein chemical methods to membrane
  proteins, since this seemed to be both a challenging and
  important area. Therefore, in search of a suitable topic, I read
  the literature extensively. The enzymes of oxidative
  phosphorylation from the inner membranes of mitochondria were
  known to be large membrane bound multi-subunit complexes, but
  despite their importance, they had been studied hardly at all
  from a structural point of view. Therefore, the same year, I
  began a structural study of the ATP synthase from bovine heart
  mitochondria and from eubacteria. These studies resulted
  eventually in a complete sequence analysis of the complex from
  several species, and in the atomic resolution structure of the F
  catalytic domain of the enzyme from bovine mitochondria, giving
  new insights into how ATP is made in the biological world.
  Michael Runswick has worked closely with me throughout this
  period, and has made contributions to all aspects of our
  studies.<br>
  <br>
  In 1959, I received the A. T. Clay Gold Medal. I was awarded the
  Johnson Foundation Prize by the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, in 1996,
  the CIBA Medal and Prize of the Biochemical Society, and The
  Peter Mitchell Medal of the European Bioenergetics Congress, and
  in 1997 The Gaetano Quagliariello Prize for Research in
  Mitochondria by the University of Bari, Italy. In 1995, I was elected a
  Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1997, I was made a Fellow of
  Sidney Sussex
  College, Cambridge and became an Honorary Fellow of St.
  Catherine's College, Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  I married Christina Westcott in 1963. We have two daughters,
  Esther, aged 21 and Miriam, aged 19. At present, both of them are
  university students, studying Geography and English,
  respectively, at Nottingham-Trent and Leeds
  Universities.</p>
