  <h1>Fritz Haber - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="haber.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fritz Haber</b> was born on December
  9, 1868 in Breslau, Germany, in one of the oldest families of the
  town, as the son of Siegfried Haber, a merchant. He went to
  school at the St. Elizabeth classical school at Breslau and he
  did, even while he was at school, many chemical
  experiments.<br>
  <br>
  From 1886 until 1891 he studied chemistry at the University of Heidelberg under Bunsen, at the
  University of Berlin under A.W. Hoffmann, and at the Technical
  School at Charlottenburg under Liebermann. After completing his
  University studies he voluntarily worked for a time in his
  father's chemical business and, being interested in chemical
  technology, he also worked for a while under Professor Georg
  Lunge at the Institute of Technology at Zurich. He then finally
  decided to take up a scientific career and went for one and a
  half years to work with Ludwig Knorr at Jena, publishing with him
  a joint paper on diacetosuccinic ester. Still uncertain whether
  to devote himself to chemistry or physics, he was offered in
  1894, and accepted, an assistantship at Karlsruhe by the Professor of Chemical Technology
  there, Hans Bunte. Here he remained until 1911. Bunte was
  especially interested in combustion chemistry and Carl Engler,
  who was also there, introduced Haber to the study of petroleum
  and Haber's subsequent work was greatly influenced by these two
  colleagues.<br>
  <br>
  In 1896 Haber qualified as a Privatdozent with a thesis on his
  experimental studies of the decomposition and combustion of
  hydrocarbons and in 1906 he was appointed Professor of Physical
  Chemistry and Electrochemistry and Director of the Institute
  established at Karlsruhe to study these subjects.<br>
  <br>
  In 1911 he was appointed to succeed Engler as Director of the
  Institute for Physical and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem,
  where he remained until, in 1933, the Nazi race laws compelled
  nearly all his staff to resign and Haber, rather than agree to
  this, himself resigned. He was then invited by Sir William Pope
  to go to Cambridge, England and there he remained for a
  while. He had, however, been suffering for some time from heart
  disease and, fearing the English winter, he moved to
  Switzerland.<br>
  <br>
  Haber's early work on the decomposition and combustion of
  hydrocarbons has already been mentioned.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 Haber published his textbook on Electrochemistry, which
  was based on the lectures he gave at Karlsruhe. In the preface to
  his book he expressed his intention to relate chemical research
  to industrial processes and in the same year he reported the
  results of his work on electrolytic oxidation and reduction, in
  which he showed that definite reduction products can result if
  the potential at the cathode is kept constant. In 1898 he
  explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode
  and this became the model for other similar reduction
  processes.<br>
  <br>
  There followed, during the next ten years, many other
  electrochemical researches. Among these was his work on the
  electrolysis of solid salts (1904), on the establishment of the
  quinone-hydroquinone equilibrium at the cathode, which laid the
  foundations for Biilmann's quinhydrone electrode for determining
  the acidity of a liquid; but Haber invented, in collaboration
  with Cremer, the glass electrode for the same purposes which is
  now widely used. This led Haber to make the first experimental
  investigations of the potential differences that occur between
  solid electrolytes and their aqueous solutions, which were of
  great interest to physiologists.<br>
  <br>
  During this period Haber also studied the loss of energy by steam
  engines, turbines and motors driven by fuels, and sought methods
  of limiting their loss by electrochemical means. He did not
  succeed in finding a solution of this problem that was
  commercially applicable, but he did succeed in finding a
  fundamental solution for the laboratory combustion of carbon
  monoxide and hydrogen.<br>
  <br>
  He then turned to the study of flames and did fundamental
  researches on the Bunsen flame, showing that, in the luminous
  inner cone of this flame, a thermodynamic water-gas equilibrium
  is established and that, in its outer mantle, there is combustion
  of water-gas. This led to a chemical method of determining flame
  temperatures.<br>
  <br>
  Haber then undertook the work on the fixation of nitrogen from
  the air for which he was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for
  1918 (awarded in 1919).<br>
  <br>
  In 1905 he had published his book on the thermodynamics of
  technical gas reactions, in which he recorded the production of
  small amounts of ammonia from N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> at
  a temperature of 1000&deg; C with the help of iron as a
  catalyst. Later he decided to attempt the synthesis of ammonia
  and this he accomplished after searches for suitable catalysts,
  by circulating nitrogen and hydrogen over the catalyst at a
  pressure of 150-200 atmospheres at a temperature of about
  500&deg; C. This resulted in the establishment, with the
  cooperation of Bosch and Mittasch, of the Oppau and Leuna Ammonia
  Works, which enabled Germany to prolong the First World War when,
  in 1914, her supplies of nitrates for making explosives had
  failed. Modifications of this Haber process also provided
  ammonium sulphate for use as a fertilizer for the soil. The
  principle used for this process and the subsequent development of
  the control of catalytic reactions at high pressures and
  temperatures, led to the synthesis of methyl alcohol by Alwin
  Mittasch and to the hydrogenation of coal by the method of
  Bergius and the production of nitric acid.<br>
  <br>
  During the years between the two World Wars Haber produced his
  firedamp whistle for the protection of miners, his quartz thread
  manometer for low gas pressures and his observation that
  adsorption powers can be due to unsaturated valence forces of a
  solid body, on which <a href="../1932/index.html">Langmuir</a>
  founded his theory of adsorption. When the First World War broke
  out he was appointed a consultant to the German War Office and
  organised gas attacks and defences against them. This and other
  work undermined his health and for some time he was engaged in
  administrative work. He helped to create the German Relief
  Organisation and served on the League of Nations Committee on
  Chemical Warfare.<br>
  <br>
  From 1920 until 1926 he experimented on the recovery of gold from
  sea water, his idea being to enable Germany to meet her war
  reparations. Greatly depressed by the failure of this project,
  which he attributed to his own deficiency, he devoted himself to
  the reorganisation of his Institute, to which he appointed
  sectional directors with complete freedom in their work. Among
  these were James Franck, Herbert Freundlich, Michael Polanyi and
  Rudolf Ladenburg; from the Institute came much work on colloid
  chemistry and atomic physics. Haber himself, at this time, made
  great efforts to re-establish the scientific relationships of
  Germany with other countries and the colloquia which he held
  every fortnight did much to establish the international repute of
  his Institute. During his last years he worked on chain reactions
  and on mechanisms of oxidation and on hydrogen peroxide
  catalysis.<br>
  <br>
  Haber lived for science, both for its own sake and also for the
  influence it has in moulding human life and human culture and
  civilization. Versatile in his talents, he possessed an
  astonishing knowledge of politics, history, economics, science
  and industry and he might have succeeded equally well in other
  fields. The hesitation with which he finally decided to be a
  chemist has already been mentioned. He welcomed administrative
  responsibilities in addition to research work. Always
  approachable and courteous, he was interested in every kind of
  problem. His ability to clarify, in a few sentences, the
  obscurities of a scientific discussion, was a valuable feature of
  the colloquia he held at his Institute and his organising talent
  made him a model Director of a large establishment in which he
  allowed complete freedom, to the workers under him, maintaining,
  nevertheless, a remarkable control over the activities of the
  Institute as a whole. A man of forceful personality, he left a
  lasting impression on the minds of all his associates.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from the Nobel Prize, Haber received many honours during
  his life. At Max von Laue's instigation, the Institute for
  Physical and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem was renamed the
  Fritz Haber Institute after his death.<br>
  <br>
  After a grave illness, Haber died on January 29, 1934, at Basle,
  on his way from England to convalesce in Switzerland, his spirit
  broken by his rejection by the Germany he had served so well.</p>
