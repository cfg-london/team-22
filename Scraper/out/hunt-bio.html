  <h1>Tim Hunt - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hunt.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in
  1943 at Neston in the Wirral, not far from Liverpool where my
  father, Richard William Hunt was a lecturer in paleography, the
  study of mediaeval manuscripts. Richard's father was a doctor,
  and there is still a chemist's shop (i.e. pharmacy) in Winchester
  that bears the family name. My mother's father, Harry Rowland was
  a businessman, a timber merchant who imported wood from South
  America. Actually, as I discovered from letters to my mother,
  Kit, which I found after they were both dead, Richard was working
  in London at Bush House, presumably in some kind of intelligence
  role although he never spoke of it, and I was always afraid to
  ask. He was the kind of man who, having signed the Official
  Secrets Act, would have felt bound by it to the grave.
  Immediately the war was over, Richard accepted a position as
  Keeper of the Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian
  Library in Oxford, a post he held for the next 32 years. My
  earliest memories are of the winter of 1947-8, pushing a pram
  down to the coal depot about a mile away near the railway station
  as the delivery trucks having been stuck in snow drifts. Food
  rationing also made a deep impression on me, and the habit of
  breaking eggs separately into a cup lest one should be bad and
  the week's omelette be spoiled persisted for many years. Kind
  American mediaevalists would send food parcels, which prejudiced
  me strongly in favour of the USA at an early age.</p>

  <p>My education started with latin taught at
  home by a governess, I can't imagine why, and for some reason I
  attended the Infants Department of the Oxford High School for
  Girls before moving to the Dragon School at the dangerous age of
  8 or so. All I can remember of the girls is their bossy mothers,
  who liked to organise parties that I detested because of the
  competitive spirit that I detected in games like musical chairs.
  There was also knitting squares for the refugees' blankets, at
  which I was hopeless - the girls produced neat squares, myself
  ragged trapezoids. And there was the matter of the garden. My
  small patch was so barren that I was told to describe an
  imaginary garden when it came time to write Nature notes. The
  Dragon was much better, much less regimented, at the same time
  much more playful and more serious. Woe betide you for
  grammatical errors. Although mornings were largely devoted to
  latin and greek, at which I got worse and worse as time went by,
  there was a science lesson every week conducted by a young German
  called Gerd Sommerhoff. It was he who showed me that biology was
  an easy subject, and from then on I really never had to make any
  more career decisions. I also liked English, was bad at maths and
  hopeless at history, and fanatical about cricket, though not
  terribly good. My hero was Denis Compton.</p>

  <p>At the age of 14, I moved across town to
  Magdalen College School, Oxford, where science
  played a much larger role in the curriculum. I loved Chemistry in
  particular, largely because the teacher, Colonel Simmons was much
  more concerned with principles than facts, although a thoroughly
  practical man himself. We were allowed considerable freedom, and
  on more than one occasion started fires from distilling volatile
  flammable solvents. One became adept at avoiding injury. Later
  on, biology again came to the fore when a young teacher called
  Terence Doherty took just three of us for Zoology. We dissected
  my brother's pet rabbit when it died, which was a treat after all
  the formalin-fixed dogfish. Terence wanted to be a painter,
  really, and later worked as an assistant with the sculptor,
  Michael Ayrton. I was also introduced by Terence to the Craftsman
  Potters' Shop in London, where I still love to browse. Very
  important during these years were Extramural Lectures given by
  the University of
  Oxford and the Christmas lectures in the Oxford Museum. For
  me, the University appeared to be largely devoted to the classics
  and history, and our house had a steady flow of mediaevalists of
  various stripes, but here in corners were revealed real
  treasures: the shrunken heads of the Pitt Rivers Collection, the
  dinosaur skeletons, lectures on the Theory of Evolution (on the
  occasion of the centenary of the publication of the Origin of
  Species) and on the Krebs Cycle. We also used to visit local
  factories and research institutes; at Alcan Aluminum they were
  trying to develop a Coca-Cola resistant lining for the cans, and
  somewhere we watched the zone refinement of an enormous silicon
  crystal. Balances that could weigh a human hair were pretty
  impressive, and even the telephone exchange was fascinating
  behind the scenes. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1958/index.html">George Beadle</a> spent a
  year as Eastman Professor and came to give a lecture to the
  Scientific Society (his son Redmond attended the school), and I
  remember asking him to explain the work that led him to win the
  Nobel Prize.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1961 I went up to Clare College,
  Cambridge to read Natural Sciences, with the intention of
  becoming a biochemist in the end. The courses were mostly
  excellent, and I did much better in the practical exams than in
  the theory. We were worked extremely hard, with certain practical
  classes falling on Saturday afternoons. Sydney Brenner organised
  seminars in his college rooms, and gave lectures that were
  officially off-limits to biochemists. It was all tremendously
  exciting, and we were very conscious, I think, of being
  surrounded by Very Great Men as well as very much in awe of the
  weight of the history of scientific discovery, especially in
  physics.</p>

  <p>I started my scientific career in 1964 in
  the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge, under the supervision of Asher
  Korner, who encouraged a great deal of freedom among his students
  to work on any aspect they chose of DNA, RNA or protein
  synthesis! Very early on, I decided that I wanted to work on the
  control of translation of mRNA, and thanks to Louis Reichardt
  (who spent a year in Cambridge in the same bay as me before going
  to Stanford to do his Ph.D. with Dale Kaiser) I learned
  about the use of rabbit reticulocytes for studies of haemoglobin
  synthesis, and began to appreciate the advantages of simple model
  systems. Together with Tony Hunter, a fellow student, I became
  interested in the question of when the haem was inserted into
  globin to make haemoglobin, and the question of whether ribosomes
  had to queue up under conditions where iron (and hence haem) was
  limiting. This was inspired by a talk we hear in 1965 by Vernon
  Ingram at a meeting in Cambridge on the subject of haemoglobin,
  at which I also listened to Henry Borsook's talk comparing
  protein synthesis in sea urchin eggs with protein synthesis in
  red cells. I thought very little about this at the time, but it
  planted an important seed. Tony and I found that the ribosomes
  were evenly spaced along the mRNA, and never formed a queue
  unless we forced them by other means. In 1966, I went to another
  meeting about haemoglobin, this time in Thessaloniki in northern
  Greece, where I met Irving London. I persuaded him that it would
  be fun to come and work in his lab during the summer, and by the
  time I was back in Cambridge (the train through Yugoslavia went
  very slowly), tickets to New York awaited me. I spent July
  through October 1966 living in a very hot dormitory out in the
  far east Bronx, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The lab was the
  coolest place to be.</p>

  <p>When I finished my Ph.D. in 1968, I went to
  New York to work with Irving, who had long been interested in the
  haem question. These were turbulent times, but I was fortunate in
  having a number of collaborators at the Albert
  Einstein College of Medicine. In particular, with Nechama
  Kosower and her husband Ed, we discovered that tiny amounts of
  oxidized glutathione were extremely inhibitory to protein
  synthesis in reticulocytes, and with Ellie Ehrenfeld that even
  tinier amounts of double-stranded RNA killed protein synthesis.
  Most striking was the finding that depletion of haem, and
  addition of GSSG or dsRNA all seemed to have similar effects on
  cell-free protein synthesis in the reticulocyte lysate, as though
  these disparate agents all acted in a similar manner. I also
  discovered that simple gel-filtration of the lysate caused a
  drastic fall in its activity. All these effects needed several
  more years to work out. One other thing I learned about during
  the studies on the inhibition of protein synthesis by dsRNA was
  that micrococcal nuclease, which requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> for
  activity, did not inhibit protein synthesis in the reticulocyte
  lysate provided no Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present.</p>

  <p>On my return to Cambridge, I found myself
  reunited with two friends from the Korner laboratory, Richard
  Jackson and Tony Hunter. They had recently made the important
  discovery that Met-tRNA<sub>f</sub> was used to initiate
  haemoglobin synthesis, and this enabled us to probe the process
  of initiation in much more detail, leading to a set of very
  surprising results: that the initiator tRNA bound to ribosomes
  before the mRNA, and that all the inhibitory effects I had been
  studying in New York blocked the very first step, the binding of
  Met-tRNA<sub>f</sub> to 40S ribosomal subunits. It took three or
  four years to realise that this inhibition was due to the action
  of at least two inhibitors of the process, one activated by the
  absence of haem, the other by the presence of dsRNA, and that
  these inhibitors were protein kinases, which phosphorylated
  eIF-2, the key initiation factor that catalysed the binding of
  Met-tRNA<sub>f</sub> to ribosomes. Actually, it turned out to be
  rather complicated, because phosphorylation did not block the
  reaction the first time round, but rather prevented nucleotide
  recycling on the initiation factor, so that its re-use was
  inhibited.</p>

  <p>By 1977, the outlines of all this were
  pretty clear, and we had a very good understanding of the
  reticulocyte lysate and its properties. The cause of the
  gel-filtration problem proved to be loss of polyamines, and the
  GSSG inhibition was a problem with thioredoxin and thioredoxin
  reductase which were needed to keep something in the reduced
  state. The micrococcal nuclease calcium dependence was put to
  good use by Hugh Pelham, a graduate student in the lab, who
  developed the use of nuclease treatment of the lysate to assay
  heterologous mRNAs. An important factor in this development was a
  ready source of messenger RNA, for which we used tobacco mosaic
  virus. Working with David Zimmern, a student of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1982/index.html">Aaron Klug</a>'s, and John
  Knowland, who was in <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/">John Gurdon</a>'s laboratory, it became clear
  that the RNA in the virions did not direct the synthesis of coat
  protein. Tony Hunter and I therefore ground up som TMV-infected
  tobacco leaves in liquid nitrogen and found to our great joy that
  a small mRNA was present that efficiently directed the synthesis
  of authentic TMV coat protein.</p>

  <p>I therefore turned to new systems for
  studying translational control, and took the opportunity of
  teaching summer courses at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, to
  look at changes in protein synthesis in sea urchin and clam eggs
  after fertilization. This opened new horizons, not only in
  learning to deal with new systems, but in the breadth of
  approaches and interests of the scientists who passed through
  Woods Hole during the summers. I learned a tremendous amount of
  developmental and cell biology over the years. In 1979, Joan
  Ruderman and her student Eric Rosenthal were teaching the
  embryology course, and I helped them with experiments on the
  translational control of maternal mRNA; the major mRNAs concerned
  later turned out to be the A and B-type cyclins and the small
  subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. We carried out quite a lot
  of work together on the translational control, and Nancy Standart
  worked as a postdoc first with Joan and then with me in
  Cambridge. I believe that these clam mRNAs were the first really
  well-authenticated case of specific translational control.
  Together with Nancy, we later identified the key regulatory
  regions in the 3' untranslated region of ribonucleotide reductase
  and cyclin A mRNAs that are necessary for translational
  masking.</p>

  <p>By 1982, work on the control of protein
  synthesis in sea urchin eggs had almost ground to a halt; every
  idea that my students and I tested proved to be false, and the
  very basis of the system was essentially flawed in that we were
  studying a system in which the ribosomes changed from having
  almost no activity to one in which about 2% of them were active,
  leaving the 98% majority of them still inert. The one question we
  did not ask up to that point, because the answer was supposed to
  be known already, was as to why an increase in protein synthesis
  occurred at fertilization, although it had been shown many years
  earlier that inhibiting protein synthesis inhibited cell
  division. One day in July 1982, with teaching over, I did a very
  simple experiment that was actually designed to answer the
  question of whether the proteins made after fertilisation were
  the same as the proteins made after parthenogenetic activation of
  the eggs. The eggs were divided into two batches, one of which
  was fertilized, the other treated with calcium ionophore, A23187.
  Radiolabelled methionine was added to both, and samples taken
  until after the fertilized eggs had divided into two-cell
  embryos. When the autoradiograph of the 1-dimensional SDS slab
  gel was developed, I noticed a very strange thing in the
  fertilized samples, which was a labelled band that went away,
  unlike all the others which, as expected, got stronger with time.
  Scarcely was the film dry when I ran into John Gerhart at the
  traditional Friday night lecture wine and cheese party, who told
  me about experiments he and Marc Kirschner had been doing on the
  oscillations in frog MPF activity during meiotic maturation of
  <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. They found that MPF activity went away
  transiently between meiosis I and meiosis II, but if protein
  synthesis was inhibited, the MPF never returned. The behaviour of
  the band I had just seen fitted in beautifully with their
  physiological findings, and I was sure that this band, which we
  called cyclin, must have something to do with MPF. The rest of
  that summer was spent looking for cyclins in other species, and
  describing the basic behaviour of the strange disappearance,
  which turned out to occur about 10 minutes before each cell
  division. The oscillations went on for several hours after
  fertilization. Clam eggs did the same thing, except that two
  bands showed this behaviour. It is very surprising that nobody
  had spotted this before; it could have been done any time after
  the invention of the slab SDS polyacrylamide gel in about
  1970.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to work on cyclins back
  in Cambridge, because there were no clams or sea urchins, and by
  the time the next summer arrived I thought perhaps the
  suddenly-disappearing proteins had been a complete fantasy.
  Fortunately, on return to Woods Hole next summer the results
  proved quite reproducible, but it was clearly going to be an
  uphill struggle to find out what was going on, and whether it had
  any general application. Progress was slow for various accidental
  reasons, like the fact that Tom Evans who spent the summer of
  1982 as my undergraduate assistant had already signed up with
  David Secher at the MRC Molecular Biology Laboratory as his Ph.D.
  supervisor and it did not seem right to alter the arrangements.
  Jon Pines joined me a year later, but his first year was a
  terrible one for sea urchin eggs, delaying library construction
  by a whole year! Not until Christmas 1986 did we succeed in
  cloning and sequencing sea urchin cyclin B. After that, the pace
  began to accelerate, and it did not take long to isolate clones
  for <i>Xenopus</i> cyclins A and B, which was very exciting,
  because it made it clear that these proteins were not restricted
  to marine invertebrates. We developed the use of
  oligodeoxynucleotides in conjunction with RNase H as a way of
  specifically cutting particular mRNAs, and were able to show
  thereby that B-type cyclin synthesis was necessary for
  <i>Xenopus</i> extracts to enter mitosis, and that <i>Xenopus</i>
  MPF contained B-type cyclins as well as p34<sup>cdc2</sup>.</p>

  <p>Today, cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein
  kinases are recognised as key elements in the regulation of cell
  cycle transitions, and the family of proteins has grown
  considerably, thanks to work in many laboratories. I well recall
  the scepticism in the early days, however, when most people did
  not believe things could be so simple as making an enzyme to
  catalyse mitosis, and then destroying the enzyme to leave
  mitosis. Moreover, in retrospect, we were very slow to realise
  that cyclins were regulatory and activating subunits of Cdc2 and
  its relatives. I do not know why this penny took so long to
  drop.</p>

  <p>Moving to ICRF allowed better access to
  <i>Xenopus</i> than had been possible in Cambridge, and important
  achievements have been the identification of c-<i>mos</i> as the
  activator of MAP kinase with Angel Nebreda, which also led to the
  discovery of a new member of the MAP kinase family called p38;
  the identification of John Shuttleworth's MO15 kinase as the CDK
  activating kinase with Randy Poon, and the purification of
  soluble and active fragments of cyclin A that allowed Jane
  Endicott, Martin Noble and Nick Brown to solve its crystal
  structure. We have defined a very large family of cyclins in
  <i>Xenopus</i>, and tested the importance of different members of
  the cyclin B family by making "knockout" mice. Right now, major
  interests of the laboratory lie in understanding how cyclins are
  targeted for proteolysis by their "destruction boxes", and in
  seeking substrates for cyclin dependent kinases. This is no easy
  matter, and our successes in the past, finding the salient
  substrates for c-<i>mos</i> and MO15 owed more to luck, and
  keeping our eyes open while doing other things, than any rational
  approach.</p>

  <p><b>Postscript</b><br>
  Of the many letters of congratulation that arrived after the
  announcement of the Nobel Prize, the one that gave me the purest
  pleasure was from a Swedish woman called Kerstin Westin in
  Uppsala, enquiring if I was, by any chance, the Tim Hunt she had
  known in Oxford in 1950 when she worked as an au pair girl with
  my family - and I was. Unlike my brother Sandy, who was only 5 at
  the time, I could clearly recall the young girl who looked after
  us all those years ago, and we had a happy reunion 51 years later
  in Stockholm. Apparently, nothing about the 7-year old boy gave
  any hint of his future. I would say that I was lucky to grow up
  in a loving family with wonderful teachers. Later, as a young
  scientist, I had the further good fortune to witness many of the
  founders of molecular biology at close hand. They set the
  standards of what was and could be expected. For my generation,
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Francis Crick</a>
  was probably the most obviously influential presence. He was
  often at lunch in the canteen of the Laboratory of Molecular
  Biology where he liked to explain what he was thinking about, and
  he was always careful to make sure that everyone round the table
  really understood. He was a frequent presence at talks in and
  around Cambridge, where he liked to ask questions. Sometimes, I
  remember thinking, they seemed slightly ignorant questions to
  which a man of his extraordinary range and ability ought to have
  known the answers. Only slowly did it dawn on me that he only and
  always asked questions when he was unclear or unsure, a great
  lesson.</p>

  <p>For many years, I used to supervise
  students in Cambridge, preferring either to teach the
  introductory course in Cell Biology or third year students in
  their biochemistry laboratory projects. Here again, I had the
  good fortune to meet a succession of clever people, many much
  cleverer than I. Supervisions worked best when the group
  (typically of two or three students and myself) was engaged on a
  mutual course of discovery, for at the time, not so much was
  known about how cells worked and one could profitably muse on how
  things might work. Very different, as a friend pointed out, from
  teaching, say, crystallography where the principles had been
  worked out years and years before and your job was to clarify
  them for the newcomer. As more and more became known, I found
  teaching became less fun, whereas learning became more
  pleasurable. In particular, I learned a tremendous amount at the
  Marine Biological Laboratory during the summers I taught and
  researched there, and when that phase of my life was over, I
  started working with John Wilson on the problems book that
  accompanies <i>Molecular Biology of the Cell</i> by Alberts <i>et
  al</i>. The ferreting around trying to make sense of unfamiliar
  territory and the discussions with the other authors provided an
  even more intense pleasure of learning new things.</p>

  <p>But none of these pleasures, great and
  satisfying though they are, match the joy of discovery.</p>
