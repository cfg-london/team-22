  <h1>Menachem Begin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="begin.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Menachem
  Begin</b> was born in Brest-Litovsk, Poland on 16 August 1913,
  son of Zeev-Dov and Hassia Begin. He was educated at the Mizrachi
  Hebrew School and the Polish Gymnasium (High School). In 1931, he
  entered Warsaw
  University and took his law degree in 1935.<br>
  <br>
  Until the age of 13 he belonged to the Hashomer Hatza'ir scout
  movement, and at the age of 16 joined Betar (Brit Trumpeldor),
  the nationalist youth movement associated with the Zionist
  Revisionist Movement. In 1932 he became head of the Organization
  Department of Betar for Poland travelling on its behalf
  throughout the country, and contributing many articles to the
  revisionist press. He was sent to Czechoslovakia to head the
  movement there.<br>
  <br>
  In 1937 he returned to Poland, and for a time was imprisoned for
  leading a demonstration, in front of the British Legation in
  Warsaw, protesting against British policy in Palestine. He
  organized groups of Betar members who went to Palestine as
  illegal immigrants, and in 1939 became the head of the movement
  in Poland. On the outbreak of World War II, he was arrested by
  the Russian authorities and in 1940-41 was confined in
  concentration camps in Siberia and elsewhere, but was released
  under the terms of the Stalin-Sikorski agreement.<br>
  <br>
  On his release he joined the Polish army and was transferred to
  the Middle East. After demobilization, in 1943, he assumed
  command of the Irgun Zvati Leumi (National Military
  Organization), known by the initials of its Hebrew name as
  "Etzel". In this capacity he directed Etzel's operations against
  the British, and the Palestine Government offered a reward of
  &pound; 10,000 for information leading to his arrest, but he
  evaded capture by living in disguise in Tel Aviv. In 1947, he met
  in secret with several members of the United Nations Special
  Committee on Palestine as well as the foreign press, to explain
  the outlook of his movement.<br>
  <br>
  After the establishment of the State of Israel, he founded the
  Herut Movement, together with his colleagues, and headed the
  party's list of candidates for the Knesset. He has been a member
  of the Knesset since the first elections.<br>

  in which he served as Minister without Portfolio until 4 August
  1970.<br>
  <br>

  after having won the Knesset elections (17 May 1977) - presented
  the new Government to the Knesset and became Prime Minister of
