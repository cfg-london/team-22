  <h1>Kofi Annan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="annan.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Kofi A.
  Annan</b> of Ghana, the seventh Secretary-General of the United
  Nations, is the first to be elected from the ranks of UN staff.
  His first five-year term began on 1 January 1997 and, following
  his subsequent re-appointment by the UN Member States, he will
  begin a second five-year term on 1 January 2002.</p>

  <p>As Secretary-General, Mr. Annan has given
  priority to revitalizing the UN through a comprehensive programme
  of reform; strengthening the Organization's traditional work in
  the areas of development and the maintenance of international
  peace and security; advocating human rights, the rule of law and
  the universal values of equality, tolerance and human dignity;
  restoring public confidence in the Organization by reaching out
  to new partners and, in his words, by "bringing the United
  Nations closer to the people". The Secretary-General has also
  taken a leading role in mobilizing the international community in
  the battle against HIV/AIDS, and more recently against the global
  terrorist threat.</p>

  <p>Born in Kumasi, Ghana, on 8 April 1938, Mr.
  Annan studied at the University of Science and Technology in
  Kumasi and completed his undergraduate work in economics at
  Macalester
  College in the United States in 1961. From 1961 to 1962, he
  undertook graduate studies in economics at the Institut
  universitaire des hautes &eacute;tudes internationales in Geneva.
  As a 1971- 1972 Sloan Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr.
  Annan received a Master of Science degree in management.</p>

  <p>Mr. Annan joined the UN in 1962, working
  for the World
  Health Organization in Geneva, where he later also served
  with the Office of the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1954/index.html">UN High Commissioner for
  Refugees</a>. At UN Headquarters in New York, Mr. Annan held
  senior positions in a diverse range of areas, including human
  resources management (1987-1990), budget and finance (1990-1992),
  and peacekeeping (March 1992-December 1996). He was
  Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping at a time when nearly
  70,000 military and civilian personnel were deployed in UN
  operations around the world.</p>

  <p>Before becoming Secretary-General, Mr.
  Annan received a number of special assignments. In 1990, he
  facilitated the repatriation of international staff and citizens
  of Western countries from Iraq after it invaded Kuwait. He
  subsequently led initial negotiations with Baghdad on the sale of
  oil to fund humanitarian relief. From November 1995 to March
  1996, Mr. Annan served as the Secretary-General's Special
  Representative to the former Yugoslavia. As Secretary-General,
  Mr. Annan has used his good offices in several delicate political
  situations, including an attempt in 1998 to gain Iraq's
  compliance with Security Council resolutions, as well as a
  mission that year to promote the transition to civilian rule in
  Nigeria. In 1999, he helped to resolve the stalemate between
  Libya and the Security Council, and to forge an international
  response to violence in East Timor. In 2000, he certified
  Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. Since the renewed outbreak of
  violence in the Middle East in September 2000, he has worked to
  encourage Israelis and Palestinians to resolve their differences
  through negotiations based on Security Council resolutions and
  the principle of "land for peace".</p>

  <p>The Secretary-General has strengthened
  partnerships with civil society, the private sector and others
  outside of government whose strengths complement those of the UN.
  He has called for a "Global Compact" to encourage businesses to
  respect standards relating to the environment, employment laws
  and human rights. In April, 2000, he issued a report on the UN's
  role in the 21st century, outlining actions needed to end poverty
  and inequality, improve education, cut HIV/AIDS, safeguard the
  environment and protect peoples from violence. The report formed
  the basis of the Millennium Declarations adopted by national
  leaders attending the UN Millennium Summit that September.</p>

  <p>Calling the HIV/AIDS epidemic his "personal
  priority", the Secretary- General issued a "Call to Action" in
  April, 2001, proposing the establishment of a Global AIDS and
  Health Fund, which has since received some $ 1.5 billion in
  pledges and contributions.</p>

  <p>Since the terrorist attacks hit the United
  States on 11 September 2001, the Secretary-General has played a
  leading role in galvanizing global action through the General
  Assembly and the Security Council to combat terrorism. The
  Secretary-General has received honorary degrees from universities
  in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, as well as a number of
  other prizes and awards for his contributions to the aims and
  purposes of the United Nations.</p>

  <p>The Secretary-General is fluent in English,
  French and several African languages. He is married to Nane
  Annan, of Sweden, a lawyer and painter who has a great interest
  in understanding the work of the United Nations in the field. Two
  issues of particular concern to her are HIV/AIDS and education
  for women. She has also written a book for children about the
  United Nations. The Annans have three children.</p>
