  <h1>Joseph L. Goldstein - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="goldstein.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Joseph L. Goldstein</b> was born on
  April 18, 1940, in Sumter, South Carolina, the only son of
  Isadore E. and Fannie Alpert Goldstein. The family owned and
  operated a clothing store in Kingstree, South Carolina, a town of
  5000 people. After his education in the primary and secondary
  public schools of Kingstree, Goldstein attended Washington and
  Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, and received the B.S.
  degree in chemistry, <i>summa cum laude</i>, in 1962. He then
  attended Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas
     Health Science Center in Dallas where he was inspired to
     pursue a career in academic medicine by Donald W. Seldin, then
     and now Chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine.
     During his last year in medical school, Seldin offered
     Goldstein a future faculty position if he would become trained
     in genetics and return to Dallas to establish a division of
     medical genetics in the Department of Internal Medicine. After
     receiving the M.D. degree in 1966, Goldstein moved to Boston
     where he was an Intern and Resident in Medicine at the Massachusetts
     General Hospital (1966-68).It was at the Massachusetts
     General Hospital that Goldstein first met and developed a
     friendship with <a href="index.html">Michael S. Brown</a>, his
     long-term scientific collaborator.<br>
  <br>
  After completion of his medical training, Goldstein spent two
  years (1968-70) at the National Institutes of Health, where he worked in
  the laboratory of <a href="../1968/index.html">Marshall W.
  Nirenberg</a> and also served as a clinical associate at the
  National Heart Institute. The opportunity to work in a first-rate
  basic science laboratory while at the same time carrying a
  limited clinical responsibility proved highly influential in
  shaping Goldstein's career. In Nirenberg's laboratory, Goldstein
  and his colleague C. Thomas Caskey isolated, purified, and worked
  out the mechanism of action of several proteins required for
  termination of protein synthesis. Here he acquired scientific
  skills and taste, experienced the thrill of discovery and the
  excitement of science, and appreciated the power of a molecular
  biology approach to human disease. As a clinical associate,
  Goldstein served as physician to the patients of Donald S.
  Fredrickson, then Clinical Director of the National Heart
  Institute and an expert on disorders of lipid metabolism. His
  curiosity about hypercholesterolemia was aroused when he cared
  for patients with the striking clinical syndrome of homozygous
  familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients were intensively
  discussed with Brown. In view of his and Brown's common interest
  in metabolic disease, Goldstein convinced his colleague to join
  him as a faculty member at the University of Texas Health Science
  Center at Dallas, where they would work collaboratively on the
  genetic regulation of cholesterol metabolism. While at the
  National Institutes of Health, Goldstein and Brown became avid
  duplicate bridge players. Their successful bridge partnership
  proved to be a valid testing ground for their future scientific
  partnership.<br>
  <br>
  Before returning to Dallas, Goldstein spent two years (1970-72)
  as a Special NIH Fellow in Medical Genetics with Arno G. Motulsky
  at the University of Washington in Seattle. Motulsky was
  one of the creators of human genetics as a medical specialty. In
  Seattle, Goldstein initiated and completed a population genetic
  study to determine the frequency of the various hereditary lipid
  disorders in an unselected population of heart attack survivors.
  He and his colleagues discovered that 20% of all heart attack
  survivors have one of three single-gene determined types of
  hereditary hyperlipidemia. One of these disorders was the
  heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia, which was
  found to affect 1 out of every 500 persons in the general
  population and 1 out of every 25 heart attack victims. During his
  fellowship in Seattle, he became conversant with tissue culture
  techniques, which proved to be invaluable in the subsequent
  studies with Brown.<br>
  <br>
  In 1972, Goldstein returned to the University of Texas Health
  Science Center at Dallas, where he was appointed Assistant
  Professor in Seldin's Department of Internal Medicine and head of
  the medical school's first Division of Medical Genetics. He
  became Associate Professor of Internal Medicine in 1974 and
  Professor in 1976. In 1977, he was made Chairman of the
  Department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Texas
  Health Science Center at Dallas and Paul J. Thomas Professor of
  Medicine and Genetics, a position that he currently holds. In
  1985, he was named Regental Professor of the University of
  Texas.<br>
  <br>
  Goldstein was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1980. He is also a
  member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Association
  of American Physicians, American Society for Clinical
  Investigation (President, 1985-86), American Society of
  Biological Chemists, American Society of Human Genetics, American
  Society for Cell Biology, and the American Federation for
  Clinical Research (National Council, 1979-82). He is also a
  Fellow of the American College of Physicians and is a Diplomate
  of the American Board of Internal Medicine. Goldstein has served
  on study sections for the American Heart Association (1975-78)
  and the National Institutes of Health (1975-78). He served on the
  Scientific Review Board of the Howard Hughes Medical Research
  Institute (1978-84) and is presently a member of its Medical
  Advisory Board (1985-present). In 1983 he became a Non-resident
  Fellow of The Salk Institute for Biological Sciences. He is, or
  has been, a member of the Editorial Board of the following
  journals: <i>Annual Review of Genetics</i> (1979-84),
  <i>Arteriosclerosis</i> (1981-present), <i>Cell</i>
  (1982-present), <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> (1980-85),
  <i>Journal of Clinical Investigation</i> (1977-82), and
  <i>Science</i> (1985-present).<br>
  <br>
  He has received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the
  University of Chicago (1982) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
  (1982). His other academic honors include membership in Phi Beta
  Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha. He was also the recipient of the Ho
  Din Award for Outstanding Medical School Graduate of the
  University of Texas Southwestern Medical School (1966) and of a
  Research Career Development Award from the National Institutes of
  Health (1972-77).<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the 1985 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine,
  Goldstein and his colleague Brown have been jointly honored for
  their research with the following awards: Heinrich Wieland Prize
  for Research in Lipid Metabolism (1974); Pfizer Award for Enzyme
