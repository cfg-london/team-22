<h1>François Englert - Biographical</h1>
 
<p><img src="englert.jpg" alt="François Englert" class="bio-img">I was born in Belgium on 6 November 1932. I am married to Mira Nikomarow 
and have five children: Michèle, Anne, Georges from a first marriage with Esther Dujardin and Sarah, Hélène from a second one with Danielle Vindal.</p>

<p>My parents emigrated from Poland in 1924 with my brother, who was a few 
months old. They were from a simple family of Polish Jews. They were looking, 
I suppose, for a better economic life and were escaping from an anti-Semitic 
environment. They worked hard, set up a textile shop and managed to reach a 
rather decent life when in May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium, less than 
one year after the invasion of Poland. I was seven years old and quite aware of 
the situation. Persecution came gradually. After two years of relatively normal 
life, I was compelled to wear, as all Jews who could not hide their identity, the 
distinctive Star of David. A few months later, the Nazis started the deportation 
of Jews to concentration camps where they were murdered.</p>

<p>My parents, my brother and I survived the war in Belgium. We were helped 
and hidden by people who did not even know us, people who in those times of 
darkness took the great risk of displaying generosity, humanity and courage.</p>

<p>My parents were hiding in a place unknown to me. Separated from them 
to increase my chances of survival, I was taken care of by Camille and Louise 
Jourdan, the owners of a cafe-restaurant in Lustin, a village in the Ardennes. I 
want to pay tribute to their memory and of that of their daughter Yvonne, whose 
tenderness in initiating me to music and piano was like a glimmer of hope in 
a world of desperation. And to the memory of priest Warnon of Annevoie, an
other small village in the Ardennes, where our family, fleeing from Lustin after a 
denunciation, reunited and stayed to the end of the war; he presented us to the 
village inhabitants as Christians; he went as far as baptising me so that I could 
attend the Catholic College “Notre-Dame de Bellevue” in Dinant as an ordinary 
student; he enrolled my brother, dressed in a fake soutane, at a seminarist school 
as if preparing him for priesthood. And also to the memory of many others who 
helped us. Without these wonderful people we could not have escaped the persecution and I would not be here to tell about it.</p>

<p>I have always present in my mind the courage of my parents, their perspicacity in finding the right move for escape at many critical moments, and most of 
all their love: in confronting the barbarity of the German Nazis and their many 
complicities, they always put the life of their children before the preservation of 
their own. Their survival was tragically marred by the complete disappearance 
of their Polish family, murdered in Poland by the German Nazis.</p>

<p>After the war, we attempted and largely succeeded in resuming a normal life. 
I went to secondary school and, while memories of past years still haunted the 
nightmares of my sleep, I functioned well at school. I developed an interest in 
literature, music and mathematics. My teacher of mathematics, whom I deeply 
appreciated, recommended studies in polytechnics for its extended program in 
mathematics at the University. My parents also pushed me in the same direction, out of concern about my future well-being. So in 1955 I got my degree in 
electrical-mechanical engineering. I realised however that my interest was less 
in practical applications than in the understanding of the underlying theoretical 
structure and I decided to learn physics. As an assistant in the polytechnic department, I was able to finance new studies and got my Physics Masters Degree 
in 1958 and my PhD in 1959.</p>

<p>I had discovered a passion for research and I was thrilled when the same 
year, based on recommendations and a few previous publications in <em>Condensed 
Matter Physics</em>, I was offered a two-year position in the United States at Cornell 
University, Ithaca (NY), as Research Associate for the young Professor Robert 
Brout. I immediately accepted and left for Ithaca.</p>

<p>Our first contact was unexpectedly warm. During my stay the convergence 
of our vision of science and life laid the groundwork for lasting collaboration 
and a lifelong friendship. In Ithaca, we worked together in condensed matter 
physics and in the statistical theory of phase transitions, mainly on ferromagnetism and superconductivity. We realised the importance of spontaneous symmetry breaking in phase transitions and we were extremely impressed when 
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-facts.html">Yoichiro Nambu</a> showed how this notion could be transferred to elementary 
particle physics to explain the small pion mass on the hadron scale. This work 
and his beautiful analysis of superconductivity in field theoretic terms drove us 
later to study the fate of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of gauge 
theory.</p>

<p>In fall 1961, I was scheduled to return to Belgium. By that time our collaboration and our friendship had become deeply rooted. I was offered a University 
Professorship at Cornell but I was missing Europe very much. I decided not 
to accept it and to return to Belgium. Robert and his wife Martine had a similar attraction for the Old Continent; Robert got a Guggenheim fellowship and 
they joined me with their children in Belgium. After a few months, the social 
life there and our personal relationship persuaded Robert to resign from his 
professorship at Cornell University and to settle permanently at the Université 
Libre de Bruxelles in Brussels. He eventually acquired Belgian nationality and 
together we directed the theoretical physics group at the ULB.</p>

<p>In Brussels, we resumed our analysis on spontaneous symmetry breaking, both in the statistical theory of phase transition and, inspired mainly by 
Nambu's work, in field theory. This is how we discovered the mass generating 
mechanism that may now indeed be viewed as a phase transition from a high 
temperature phase in the early Universe, where elementary particle were massless, to the present low temperature phase where their mass arises from a generalisation of spontaneous symmetry breaking to Yang-Mills fields, namely the BEH mechanism.</p>

<p>At the ULB, Brout and I initiated a research group in fundamental interactions, that is, in the search for the general laws of nature. Joined by brilliant 
students, many of them becoming world renowned physicists, our group contributed to the many fields at the frontier of the challenges facing contemporary physics. While the mechanism discovered in 1964 was developed all over 
the world to encode the nature of weak interactions in a "Standard Model," our 
group contributed to the understanding of strong interactions and quark confinement, general relativity and cosmology. There we introduced the idea of a 
primordial exponential expansion of the universe, later called inflation, which 
we related to the origin of the universe itself, a scenario, which I still think may 
possibly be conceptually the correct one. During these developments, our group 
extended our contacts with other Belgian universities and got involved in many 
international collaborations.</p>

<p>With our group and many other collaborators I analysed fractal structures, 
supergravity, string theory, infinite Kac-Moody algebras and more generally all 
tentative approaches to what I consider as the most important problem in fundamental interactions: the solution to the conflict between the classical Einsteinian theory of gravitation, namely general relativity, and the framework of our 
present understanding of the world, quantum theory. Although this conflict appears experimentally to affect known results only at very tiny scales of the order of 10<sup>–33</sup> <em>cm</em>, transcending it would amount to overcoming a conceptual mistake. 
As such, a solution of this conflict might affect our understanding of the laws of 
nature at all scales and is crucial for attempting to reach a rational understanding of the origin of the Universe.</p>

<p>Robert was less interested in these new developments and concentrated 
more on cosmology. Our collaboration became less frequent but our friendship 
was unaffected. He passed away on May 3, 2011 after a prolonged illness and 
missed the remarkable discovery of the Standard Model scalar boson at CERN 
and the awarding of the Nobel Prize.</p>
