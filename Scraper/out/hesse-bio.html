  <h1>Hermann Hesse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hesse.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Calw in the Black Forest on
  July 2, 1877. My father, a Baltic German, came from Estonia; my
  mother was the daughter of a Swabian and a French Swiss. My
  father's father was a doctor, my mother's father a missionary and
  Indologist. My father, too, had been a missionary in India for a
  short while, and my mother had spent several years of her youth
  in India and had done missionary work there.<br>
  <br>
  My childhood in Calw was interrupted by several years of living
  in Basle (1880-86). My family had been composed of different
  nationalities; to this was now added the experience of growing up
  among two different peoples, in two countries with their
  different dialects.<br>
  <br>
  I spent most of my school years in boarding schools in
  Wuerttemberg and some time in the theological seminary of the
  monastery at Maulbronn. I was a good learner,
  good at Latin though only fair at Greek, but I was not a very
  manageable boy, and it was only with difficulty that I fitted
  into the framework of a pietist education that aimed at subduing
  and breaking the individual personality. From the age of twelve I
  wanted to be a poet, and since there was no normal or official
  road, I had a hard time deciding what to do after leaving school.
  I left the seminary and grammar school, became an apprentice to a
  mechanic, and at the age of nineteen I worked in book and antique
  shops in T&uuml;bingen and Basle. Late in 1899 a tiny volume of
  my poems appeared in print, followed by other small publications
  that remained equally unnoticed, until in 1904 the novel <i>Peter
  Camenzind</i>, written in Basle and set in Switzerland, had a
  quick success. I gave up selling books, married a woman from
  Basle, the mother of my sons, and moved to the country. At that
  time a rural life, far from the cities and civilization, was my
  aim. Since then I have always lived in the country, first, until
  1912, in Gaienhofen on Lake Constance, later near Bern, and
  finally in Montagnola near Lugano, where I am still living.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after I settled in Switzerland in 1912, the First World War
  broke out, and each year brought me more and more into conflict
  with German nationalism; ever since my first shy protests against
  mass suggestion and violence I have been exposed to continuous
  attacks and floods of abusive letters from Germany. The hatred of
  the official Germany, culminating under Hitler, was compensated
  for by the following I won among the young generation that
  thought in international and pacifist terms, by the friendship of
  <a href="../1915/index.html">Romain Rolland</a>, which lasted
  until his death, as well as by the sympathy of men who thought
  like me even in countries as remote as India and Japan. In
  Germany I have been acknowledged again since the fall of Hitler,
  but my works, partly suppressed by the Nazis and partly destroyed
  by the war; have not yet been republished there.<br>
  <br>
  In 1923, I resigned German and acquired Swiss citizenship. After
  the dissolution of my first marriage I lived alone for many
  years, then I married again. Faithful friends have put a house in
  Montagnola at my disposal.<br>
  <br>
  Until 1914 I loved to travel; I often went to Italy and once
  spent a few months in India. Since then I have almost entirely
  abandoned travelling, and I have not been outside of Switzerland
  for over ten years.<br>
  <br>
  I survived the years of the Hitler regime and the Second World
  War through the eleven years of work that I spent on the
  <i>Glasperlenspie</i>l (1943) [<i>Magister Ludi</i>], a novel in
  two volumes. Since the completion of that long book, an eye
  disease and increasing sicknesses of old age have prevented me
  from engaging in larger projects.<br>
  <br>
  Of the Western philosophers, I have been influenced most by
  Plato, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche as well as the
  historian Jacob Burckhardt. But they did not influence me as much
  as Indian and, later, Chinese philosophy. I have always been on
  familiar and friendly terms with the fine arts, but my
  relationship to music has been more intimate and fruitful. It is
  found in most of my writings. My most characteristic books in my
  view are the poems (collected edition, Z&uuml;rich, 1942), the
  stories <i>Knulp</i> (1915), <i>Demian</i> (1919),
  <i>Siddhartha</i> (1922), <i>Der Steppenwolf</i> (1927)
  [<i>Steppenwolf</i>], <i>Narziss und Goldmund</i>. (1930), <i>Die
  Morgenlandfahrt</i> (1932) [<i>The Journey to the East</i>], and
  <i>Das Glasperlenspiel</i> (1943) [<i>Magister Ludi</i>]. The
  volume <i>Gedenkbl&auml;tter</i> (1937, enlarged ed. 1962)
  [Reminiscences] contains a good many autobiographical things. My
  essays on political topics have recently been published in
  Z&uuml;rich under the title <i>Krieg und Frieden</i> (1946)
  [<i>War and Peace</i>].<br>
  <br>
  I ask you, gentlemen, to be contented with this very sketchy
  outline; the state of my health does not permit me to be more
  comprehensive.</p>
