  <h1>Fritz Lipmann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lipmann.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fritz
  Albert Lipmann</b> was born on June 12th, 1899, at Koenigsberg,
  Germany. He was the son of Leopold Lipmann and his wife Gertrud
  Lachmanski.<br>
  <br>
  Lipmann was educated, during the years 1917-1922, at the
  Universities of Koenigsberg, Berlin, and Munich, where he studied medicine. He took his M.D.
  degree in 1924 at Berlin. He was, during his pre-clinical year of
  medical study, strongly impressed by what he has called &laquo;a
  dramatic chemistry course&raquo; given by Professor Klinger at
  Koenigsberg. Later, he took a primer course in biochemistry given
  in Berlin by Professor Rona and in 1923 he definitely took up
  biochemistry, and held for a time a Fellowship in the Department
  of Pharmacology, at the University of Amsterdam, under Professor
  Ernst Laqueur. Feeling then the need for further study of
  chemistry, Lipmann returned to Koenigsberg to study chemistry
  under Professor Hans Meerwein, who had then succeeded Professor
  Klinger. In 1926 he went as an assistant in <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a>'s laboratory at the Kaiser
  Wilhelm Institute, Berlin, to prepare a thesis for the degree of
  Ph.D., Berlin, which he took in 1927. He then went with Meyerhof
  to Heidelberg, where he did further research on the biochemical
  reactions occurring in muscle.<br>
  <br>
  In 1930 Lipmann went back to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in
  Berlin to work as a research assistant in the laboratory of
  Albert Fischer, who was interested in applying biochemical
  methods to tissue culture. Fischer was then getting ready to
  occupy a new Institute in Copenhagen and he asked Lipmann to
  accompany him there, which he did in 1932. The years 1931 and
  1932, however, he spent as a Rockefeller Fellow in the laboratory
  of P. A. Levene at the Rockefeller Institute in New York, where he
  identified serine phosphate as the constituent of phosphoproteins
  which contains the phosphate.<br>
  <br>
  When he went to Copenhagen in 1932, as Research Associate in the
  Biological Institute of the Carlsberg Foundation there, Lipmann
  became interested in the metabolism of fibroblasts and this
  prompted him to investigate the Pasteur effect, which led to
  important papers on the mechanism of this reaction and on the
  part played by glycolysis in the metabolism of the cells of
  embryos.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 Lipmann became Research Associate in the Department of
  Biochemistry, Cornell Medical School, New York, and in 1941 joined
  the research staff of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,
  first as a Research Associate in the Department of Surgery, then
  heading his own group in the Biochemical Research Laboratory of
  the Hospital. In 1949 he became Professor of Biological Chemistry
  at Harvard
  Medical School, Boston. In 1957, he was appointed a Member
  and Professor of the Rockefeller Institute, New York, a post
  which he still holds.<br>
  <br>
  During the late forties and early fifties, the wealth of problems
  opened up by the discovery of coenzyme A attracted much
  attention. He left this post to explore the chemical nature of
  some seemingly unusual phosphate derivatives arising in the
  process of group activation through phosphoryl transfer from ATP.
  Thus, through observations on a phosphorolysis of citrulline, his
  attention was drawn to the probability of carbamyl phosphate
  (CMP) representing the metabolically active carbamyl donor. The
  suspicion proved justified, and proof of metabolic formation and
  its function, in collaboration with Mary Ellen Jones and Leonard
  Spector, was greatly simplified by the latter's discovery of an
  unexpectedly simple method of chemical CMP synthesis through
  condensation of cyanate and phosphate at room temperature and in
  excellent yield.<br>
  <br>
  Another unusual phosphate derivative had been indicated through
  the function of ATP in sulphate activation. Work with Hilz and
  Robbins in this area brought out the existence of a new class of
  chemical compounds, the mixed anhydrides between phosphate and
  sulphate; adenosine-5'-phosphosulphate (APS) and
  3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulphate (PAPS) were identified as
  &laquo;active&raquo; sulphates. The latter compound, PAPS, was
  found in animals and plants to be the common sulphate donor in
  the sulphurylation of mono- or poly-saccharides and other
  sulphate derivatives.<br>
  <br>
  Recently, most of his attention has returned to development of
  the biological mechanism of peptide and protein synthesis. At
  present, this is what has become his major interest.<br>
  <br>
  Lipmann is a member of several learned societies in the U.S.A.,
  the Faraday Society, and the Danish Royal Academy of Sciences and
  is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of England. He holds honorary
  degrees of the Universities of Marseilles, Chicago and
  Chile, and is
  Doctor of Humane Letters of Brandeis University. In 1931, he married
  Elfreda M. Hall, and they have one son, Steven.</p>
