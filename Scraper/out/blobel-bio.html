  <h1>G&uuml;nter Blobel - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="blobel.jpg" class="bio-img">In 1936, when I was born in the small
  Silesian village of Waltersdorf in the county of Sprottau in the
  then eastern part of Germany, now part of Poland, the fine
  structure of the cell was still an enigma. After 300 years of
  staring through light microscopes, essentially all that
  biologists had learned was that the cell was delimited by a
  plasma membrane and contained a nucleus. Staining procedures had
  revealed other distinct territories in the cytoplasm and in the
  nucleus, but their fine structure remained unknown. A dramatic
  revolution occurred in 1945, when Keith Porter, Ernest Fullam and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/index.html">Albert Claude</a>
  at the then Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in
  New York City introduced the electron microscope to look at
  cells. The first structure they saw was a lace-like network in
  the cytoplasm that they termed the endoplasmic reticulum. This
  discovery formed the foundation for my future scientific
  career.</p>

  <p>1945 was also a turning point in my life.
  Until then my childhood was a perfect 19th century idyll. In the
  cold and snow-rich Silesian winters there were hour-long rides on
  Sundays in horse-drawn sleighs to my maternal grandparent's farm
  to have lunch and to spend the afternoon. The house was a
  magnificent 18th century manor house in the nearby Altgabel with
  a great hall that was decorated with hunting trophies. In the
  summer, of course, horse-drawn landauers were used as means of
  transportation. The way to school was a long one. We went there
  on foot and as a pack, usually consisting of one or two of my
  seven brothers and sisters and of children from neighboring
  houses.</p>

  <p>At the end of January 1945, we had to flee
  from the advancing Russian Red Army. My father, a veterinarian
  stayed behind for a few more days and left only hours before the
  Red Army moved in. My fourteen year-old brother, Reiner, drove my
  mother, my youngest brother, an older brother, the two younger
  sisters and me in a small automobile to relatives west of Dresden
  in Saxony. On the way there we drove through Dresden. We entered
  the city from the eastern hills. Its many spires and the
  magnificent cupola of the Frauenkirche (die Steinerne Glocke, the
  Stone Bell) were a magnificent sight even for the untrained eye
  of a child. Driving through Dresden, I still remember the many
  palaces, happily decorated with cherubs and other symbols of the
  baroque era. The city made an indelible impression on me. Only a
  few days, later, on February 13, 1945, we saw from a distance of
  about 30 kilometers a fire-lit, red night sky reflecting the
  raging firestorm that destroyed this great jewel of a city in one
  of the most catastrophic bombing attacks of World War II. It was
  a very sad and unforgettable day for me.</p>

  <p>The months before and after the end of
  World War II were chaotic and miserable. None of my relatives had
  enough space to accommodate our large family leaving us divided
  among several relatives in different villages. There was no
  communication and little food. On September 9, 1945, we learned
  of the death of my beautiful oldest sister Ruth who, at age 19,
  was killed in an air raid on a train she was travelling in on
  April 10, 1945. She was buried in a mass grave near the site of
  the attack in Schwandorf, Bavaria. Ruth was born when my mother
  was just 20. The two had a sisterly relationship. My mother
  grieved over Ruth's death until the end of her own life.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, things took a turn for the
  better, when my father was able to continue his veterinarian
  practice in the charming medieval Saxon town of Freiberg. Most
  members of our family were reunited there by 1947. We lived in a
  nice villa surrounded by a large garden on the edge of town. My
  way to school was along the old medieval city wall. For only
  40,000 inhabitants, Freiberg had a rich cultural life with a 175
  year old theater. Most impressive were the musical performances
  in the magnificent gothic cathedral, the Dom, with the splendid
  great Silbermann organ. Each week Bach cantatas were performed.
  The great choral works of Bach, Mozart and Haydn were regularly
  performed and at the highest artistic level at the major
  religious holidays. I even participated in singing in the cantus
  firmus of Bach's Matth&auml;us Passion. So, it was almost like a
  19th century idyll again, this time in a small medieval town
  instead of a country village.</p>

  <p>However, there was now the ever more
  oppressive regime of East Germany to deal with on a daily basis.
  When I graduated from high school in 1954 I was not allowed to
  continue my education at a university because I was considered a
  member of the "capitalist" classes. Fortunately, at that time,
  i.e., before the Berlin Wall, it was possible to escape and to
  travel freely to West Germany. So, on August 28, Goethe's
  birthday, I left Freiberg for Frankfurt on the Main in West
  Germany. The train left in the morning and in the afternoon it
  passed Weimar, where Goethe spent most of his life, and then
  Eisenach, where Bach was born and in the evening it arrived in
  Frankfurt, Goethe's birthplace.</p>

  <p>I studied medicine, beginning in Frankfurt
  and then in Kiel, M&uuml;nchen and T&uuml;bingen, graduating in
  1960 from the University of T&uuml;bingen. Although I completed
  two years of internship in various small hospitals, I decided
  against continuing my medical training. I was much more
  fascinated by the unsolved problems of medicine than by
  practicing it. Fortunately, my oldest brother Hans had a similar
  experience in his field of study, veterinary medicine. He had
  obtained the prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to study in the
  U.S., continued his training there in microbiology and rapidly
  achieved the rank of full professor at the University of
  Wisconsin in Madison. He was extremely sympathetic to my
  dilemma and helped me to secure a graduate fellowship to study
  either with <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/index.html">Khorana</a> or with Van R.
  Potter. So, in 1962, I sailed to Montreal on a German steel
  freighter, and from there drove to Madison to arrive on a
  beautiful late day in May. Potter was a marvellous mentor, witty,
  energetic and stimulating. I graduated in November 1966, and
  decided to join <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/index.html">George Palade</a>'s
  Laboratory of Cell Biology at the Rockefeller
  University (formerly the Rockefeller Institute). The
  revolution that began there in 1945, and that led to the
  discovery of all the major structures of the cell continued in
  the realm of relating cellular structures to specific cellular
  functions. My arrival there coincided with the end of this second
  phase and the exciting beginnings of a third phase, the molecular
  analysis of cellular functions (see below). I was fortunate
  enough in helping to initiate this third phase of analysis which
  is still in full swing.</p>

  <p>George Palade has been my most influential
  mentor, a good friend and a wonderful colleague. He taught me how
  to conceptualize a collection of disparate facts, to formulate
  working hypotheses and to design experiments to test these
  hypotheses. I am greatly indebted to him.</p>

  <p>In New York I married Laura Maioglio. Laura
  studied art history and, at her father's death, took over
  Barbetta Restaurant founded by her father in 1906. Laura has
  introduced me to many artistic pleasures that I had not
  experienced before. She greatly encouraged me in my work and
  never complained about the many hours I spent in the
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>In 1994, I founded Friends of
  Dresden, Inc., a charitable organization, with the goal to
  raise funds in the U.S. to help rebuild the Frauenkirche in
  Dresden. The rebuilding of many of the historic monuments of
  Dresden is one of the most exciting consequences of German
  reunification and the liberation from communism. It is a
  childhood dream come true.</p>

  <p>It was one of the great pleasures of my
  life to donate the entire sum of the Nobel Prize, in memory of my
  sister Ruth Blobel, to the restoration of Dresden, to the
  rebuilding of the Frauenkirche and the building of a new
  synagogue. This donation also serves to express my gratitude to
  my fellow Saxons. They received us with open arms when we had to
  flee Silesia. I spent a wonderful period of my life there and
  they gave me a thorough and valuable education. A few thousand
  dollars will also be donated for the restoration of an old
  baroque church in Fubine/Piemonte/ltaly, the home town of my
  wife's father, Sebastanio Maioglio. We have spent many happy
  summers there in the parental home of my wife.</p>
