  <h2>The Organization of the Peace Movement</h2>

  <p>Yesterday was the seventeenth of May,
  Norway's great day of national celebration<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Today's date, the eighteenth of
  May, should sometime become an occasion of great international
  celebration, for on this day ten years ago the first Peace
  Conference opened at The Hague. I regard it as a good omen that
  the Nobel Committee has allowed me to present my address on this
particular day.</p>

  <p>There is no contradiction between a
  nation's strong self-esteem and its will to internationalize
  itself (to use a current expression) with other peoples in order
  to promote better understanding - the supreme aim of peace. This
  concept of international understanding is what Alfred Nobel
  called "fraternity among nations". It is not enough to cry out,
  "Lay down your arms"<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>; and
  this, incidentally, is not the same as "Away with armaments." We
  must also shout, "Lift up your hearts!"</p>

  <p>The address which I am about to give I have
  entitled "The Organization of the Peace Movement". My role has
  not, in the main, been that of a propagandist, but rather that of
  an organizer whose work has been discharged behind the
  scenes.</p>

  <p>I could, perhaps, have called my lecture
  "The Organization of Peace". To describe briefly my understanding
  of the organization of peace, a structure which has been built on
  a foundation laid by the peace movement, I would compare it to a
  house of three stories.</p>

  <p>The first story belongs to the peace
  associations. They hold an annual conference, known as "le
  congr&egrave;s universel" or <i>the</i> <i>international
  congress</i><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The next story
  is <i>the</i> <i>Interparliamentary Union</i><a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, which generally also holds one
  meeting a year, <i>the interparliamentary conference</i>.
  Finally, <i>the</i> third story, which we hope will not be the
  last, is the <i>intergovernmental peace conference</i><a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>. An easy but less precise labeling
  of the situation is: there are <i>peoples</i>,
  <i>parliaments</i>, and <i>governments</i>. These three stories I
  shall now consider rather more closely.</p>

  <p>In speaking of the peace movement, I could
  also use another metaphor. The distinguished Chairman referred in
  his introductory words to my being an old soldier, and I shall
  therefore use a military one. There are threecolumns marching
  forth: the <i>international,</i> the <i>interparliamentary</i>,
  and the <i>intergovernmental</i>. These three columns must
  maintain contact with one another. In battle, it is useless to
  attack alone, however courageous one may be; one has to maintain
  contact to the left and to the right; otherwise nothing of great
  moment can be achieved. This contact, this organization, is of
  the utmost importance if results are to be achieved in the peace
  movement.</p>

  <p>I shall not deal in great detail with the
  subject of the mutual contacts required. Various proposals have
  been made. On many occasions, pacifists have expressed the wish
  that a bond of association be formed linking all those who work
  for the cause of peace, both individuals and institutions. To
  this end they have suggested the appointment of a common supreme
  authority. I do not believe, however, that this solution would be
  successful. I do not believe that such a joint supreme authority
  is desirable. And it would scarcely prove practical.</p>

  <p>When the London International Peace
  Congress was under preparation in 1890, I studied its
  program<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Coincidentally,
  this was in the same place where I sat as a cadet in 1854. As a
  result of my study, I came to the conclusion that a common
  supreme authority was undesirable. I would rather propose a
  bureau somewhat similar to that which we have in the Universal
  Postal Union<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Strangely
  enough the same idea had been introduced previously, unbeknown to
  me. During the Paris World Peace Congress in 1878, the elderly
  Charles Lemonnier<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> defended
  this concept against all the rest of those assembled. The others
  wanted to have a joint authority, but he maintained that there
  should be only a bureau as a common bond of association. I
  attempted to promote this idea in London. Although unsuccessful,
  I did not give up hope. I worked on, and I shall report briefly
  how the matter developed.</p>

  <p>At the Congress in Rome on November 13,
  1891, an <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1910/index.html">International
  Peace Bureau</a> was set up<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>.
  This bureau was, in my mind, originally intended as a sort of
  focus for the whole peace movement, forming a bond of association
  between all institutions and individuals who desired to cooperate
  for peace, and serving as a source of information. But it soon
  developed that the Interparliamentary Conference, which was held
  immediately afterward, would not agree to anything of this kind.
  In the following year, however, in 1892 in Bern, the conference
  explored the setting up of an interparliamentary bureau<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Since that time small rifts have
  appeared; a kind of dualism has asserted itself between the
  international and the interparliamentary work for peace. I
  believe that this dualism is in the process of being smoothed
  out, and the trend should rapidly gather momentum. The proposals
  which are adopted at [peace] congresses should be referred to the
  [interparliamentary] conferences, and in turn the congresses
  should strive to influence the people and to implement the
  decisions which are taken at the interparliamentary conferences.
  It would, moreover, be desirable for some persons to be members
  both of the Interparliamentary Council and of the Board of the
  World Peace Bureau (just as I am myself).</p>

  <p>I wish, figuratively speaking, to pause for
  a moment at the lowest story of the structure of peace, that of
  the peace associations, and raise the question: Should they be
  political? Yes or no? This is a moot point. They should be
  political insofar as the cause of peace, like all else which
  concerns the activity of the state, also concerns politics. But
  they should not be party-political. A sign that a peace
  association is going adrift is its exclusion of other political
  parties, with whom it could collaborate effectively on most of
  the problems besetting the cause of peace. Leave well enough
  alone and let each have his own opinions about domestic policies!
  In this respect, the interparliamentary groups, in which all
  shades of political opinion meet, are good models. In the Danish
  Parliament, all members of the Lower House, without exception,
  are members of the interparliamentary group, and so are all but
  eleven members of the Upper House.</p>

  <p>Now first of all, we have - and I again
  revert to the military metaphor - recruitment, so as to encourage
  membership in the peace associations. I am reminded of an
  incident that took place a good many years ago. A young man came
  up to me and said, "I have heard talk of this Nobel Peace Prize
  and I would very much like to have it. Can you tell me how I
  should set about it?" With the greatest of pleasure," I replied.
  "Please sit down, and I will help you." I then asked, "Are you a
  member of the peace association?" "No." "Well, that is the first
  step!"</p>

  <p>Once members have been brought into the
  association, they should then be informed and educated, for there
  is much to learn. On joining such a movement, one should not
  think that he is wiser than all those who have been working for
  it for a long time. One must be informed. Ordinary and annual
  meetings are arranged by the groups. At the national meetings
  which are held in most countries, representatives are chosen for
  the annual peace congresses. These representatives, in turn,
  receive further information. They return and report what they
  have heard. In this way a process of mutual education comes into
  operation.</p>

  <p>One of the first documents that the Bureau
  in Bern sought to prepare was a set of statistics on the existing
  peace associations. Since it is difficult to obtain accurate data
  on the effective membership of these associations, it would not
  be amiss if at some time we could afford to appoint an
  inspector-general who would travel around to determine how many
  of the members included in the statistics are in fact active.</p>

  <p>Propaganda is a topic of particular concern
  to peace associations. This is a matter of educating the
  population in general, and not least the voters. The voters elect
  the people's representatives who will enter the
  interparliamentary groups forming the Interparliamentary Union.
  For this reason,. the peace associations have often approved
  their members' asking prospective candidates if they, upon
  election, would join the interparliamentary groups. I believe
  that at present no further commitment is required, for election
  automatically brings membership, at any rate in Denmark.</p>

  <p>With regard to the task of education, I
  shall touch on the question of literature. There are those who
  believe we have need of more literature, of a large international
  publishing house, of a great peace newspaper, or the like. I am
  rather skeptical about this idea. We already have an immense
  literature. I could name a whole series of excellent periodicals
  in England, America, France, and Germany; and in addition we all
  have in common <i>La Correspondance bimensuelle</i><a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>,with its factual announcements,
  issued by the Peace Bureau in Bern. No, it is not this that we
  need so much. Indeed; peace literature is almost exclusively
  read, though to good effect, by pacifists, while what is needed
  is the canvassing of those who have not so far been won to the
  cause. Up to now, we have had too much of what the French call
  "pr&ecirc;cher aux convertis" - preaching to the converted. We
  should direct special efforts toward those who still remain
  unconverted. In this connection, I got an idea not long ago from
  a bird called the cuckoo: It lays its eggs in other birds' nests.
  I have, therefore, applied to the Danish Ministry of Justice for
  permission to deposit a sum of 1,000 kroner in the Public Trustee
  Office - this being the safest place to invest money in Denmark-
  the income from which will go to the person who, in the course of
  the preceding calendar year, has written for a national newspaper
  or journal the best article, in the opinion of a certain
  committee, in the cause of peace on an appropriate theme, such as
  "folkens f&ouml;rbr&ouml;drande" [fraternity among nations]. The
  articles in competition must have appeared in the daily press. As
  you can see, to obtain this prize the person concerned must first
  persuade an editor to accept his essay. The task of the committee
  which is to judge the articles is lightened by the fact that the
  press will have already rejected those efforts which are totally
  unacceptable. This experiment is to be made in Denmark and, if it
  succeeds, I hope that the example will be followed elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There is another form of propaganda which I
  shall call the "letter movement". I give it this name since it is
  directed at some higher authority which is to be influenced. As
  an old parliamentarian, however, I know that this method seldom
  has much effect. There are many members of parliament present
  here who know as well as I do that, if a man has not already been
  converted, it will require a great deal more than a letter of
  appeal to achieve conversion. Nevertheless, this type of
  propaganda has a special value, for it serves to convince those
  who sign the appeal, of the necessity for carrying on propaganda;
  so a corps of propagandists, if I may use the term, is thus
  trained. It is important, however, to find the right objective
  for such an appeal. It must not be anything remote; it must be
  something which can be envisaged by those to whom it is
  addressed, something which can be accomplished in the not too
  distant future. Let me give you an example. At the last Hague
  Conference, a step in the direction of compulsory arbitration of
  international disputes was proposed. In the end; thirty-two
  nations were persuaded to vote for arbitration<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and a proposal was then advanced
  - I believe its sponsor is among us today - that these nations be
  prevailed upon to unite. In most cases, of course, unanimity is
  required at diplomatic conferences, but in this instance a number
  of states could clearly unite with advantage, and others could
  later be added to their number.</p>

  <p>This is the task, I think, of a letter
  movement. But it should be set up only in states where a
  significant response can be achieved, for a letter movement
  necessarily presupposes a strong organization. We have had such a
  letter movement on two occasions in Denmark when more than a
  quarter of the adult Danish population participated. Such an
  achievement, however, demands a really great effort and also a
  great deal of money. If an excellent organization had not already
  been in existence, these projects could scarcely have
  succeeded.</p>

  <p>I shall touch quite briefly on another
  method, that of mutual international visits. Such visits have
  been made in the past, of course, and have proved to be of great
  value, particularly those between England and France and between
  England and Germany - the Scandinavians, of course, have been
  visiting in Paris for five years. This is a very costly method,
  and I am sure I may say that, while work and play may go
  together, there should not, however, be too much play. I believe
  that if this method is to be worthwhile, it should be pursued
  somewhat more assiduously than has hitherto been the case. The
  same applies also to conferences generally and to the
  interparliamentary conferences in particular, for they tend, as I
  have indicated, to resemble meetings of tourists rather than
  conclaves of jurists. Always we must bear in mind that law has to
  be substituted for power, that care must be taken to serve the
  interests of law. Naturally, business and pleasure can be readily
  combined, but a certain balance should exist, and the latter
  should not predominate over the former.</p>

  <p>There is one criticism which cannot be
  leveled at interparliamentary conferences but which is applicable
  to a great extent to peace congresses: the meetings waste time.
  Peace congresses often start by dealing with some of the less
  important questions in excessive detail, so at the end there is
  no time to discuss the most important problems. One even
  occasionally sees, as I have seen at a congress in Milan, a
  chairman left with a number of proposals in his hand, like a
  handful of playing cards, saying, "You may just as well adopt all
  the resolutions without discussion - they are quite
  straightforward."</p>

  <p>The aspect of congresses and such meetings
  generally to which I attach the greatest importance is the
  discussion. That is why people assemble: to hear different
  opinions, rather than to pass resolutions. To read the report of
  a discussion in which arguments for and against are presented, in
  which a subject has been covered from different points of view,
  with new ideas advanced - this is far more instructive than to
  read a brief account of the resolution passed on the matter. Here
  we can learn something from the Swedes who, if they fail to reach
  agreement after discussing a matter, often conclude their
  meetings with a vote that "diskussionen &auml;r svar p&aring;
  fr&aring;gan" [the discussion is a reply to the question].</p>

  <p>One serious obstacle to the smooth working
  of congresses is the language barrier. At the first peace
  congress in Paris in 1889<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>,
  only French was used. When the initial session had ended, the
  Englishmen got together and asked that everything be translated
  into their language. President <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/index.html">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
  Passy</a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>, however, said
  that he could not accede to this request because the Germans
  would then demand a German translation, and so on. It has since
  been agreed that speeches given in English will be translated
  into French and vice versa, and even into German and Italian when
  necessary. No doubt translations into Esperanto will also soon be
  in demand. If everyone understood Esperanto, this language could
  be used everywhere, but that is surely a long way off. I would
  have thought it possible to choose delegates for these larger
  conferences who, even if they could not speak the principal
  languages, could at least understand them or could have friends
  seated beside them who could keep them informed on essential
  points. It is quite unbelievable how much time is wasted
  otherwise. I ask your indulgence for making all these criticisms,
  but I wish to take this opportunity to express them while
  speaking to this gathering in the hope that my words will reach
  not only those present but also those farther afield. I have
  omitted to add that, although many decisions have been made at
  these congresses, the participants nevertheless accomplish too
  little. The congresses have now taken over the Peace Bureau at
  Bern for special services. This bureau has not become what I
  originally hoped it would: a central office for all, congresses,
  conferences, and so forth. It has been reserved mainly and almost
  exclusively for the world peace congresses. In this respect it is
  no doubt of great value, but it cannot accomplish everything
  asked of it. It is not a patient pack mule upon which everything
  possible may be loaded. When a matter cannot be brought to a
  conclusion at a congress, it is referred to the Bern Bureau, and
  the bureau then tries to find a solution. It circularizes
  proposals to appropriate institutions and individuals - for
  example, to the ministers of foreign affairs. Unfortunately, not
  many reply and those who do, confine themselves to an
  acknowledgment of receipt. Last time, only one foreign minister
  sent a really thoughtful reply such as might be expected from a
  friend of peace, and this was the Norwegian foreign minister.</p>

  <p>The interparliamentary conference should,
  in my opinion, direct its particular attention to the preparation
  of the next Hague Conference, the diplomatic conference, the
  conference of governments. For this reason I proposed at Berlin
  last year<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> that each of the
  different parliamentary groups should set up a commission which
  would list, on the one hand, those older questions which had
  received favorable consideration but. which had not been fully
  discussed at the 1907 Hague Conference, and, on the other, any
  new questions which they thought should be debated at the next
  conference. I had a suspicion at the back of my mind, however,
  that this measure would not succeed, since parliamentarians have
  much, almost too much, to do attending to their own affairs, with
  little time to spare for other matters such as this.
  Nevertheless, I wanted to make the proposal in order to emphasize
  the need for a different approach. Since it now appears that
  nothing has been done, the governments will have to make this
  analysis themselves. There are, as was pointed out at the Hague
  Conference, a great many problems which have to be studied
  nationally before they can usefully be studied
  internationally.</p>

  <p>I now propose to discuss the third story,
  the peace conference at The Hague. The assembly is composed of a
  great many people, many of whom have never seen each other
  before. I prepared statistics for the first of the Hague
  Conferences, showing that there were 138 representatives in all.
  Of this number no less than seventy-seven were diplomats. With
  all due respect to diplomats, who can be good or even excellent,
  I feel that one can have too much of a good thing and that a
  smaller proportion of diplomats would be beneficial at future
  conferences. There were also thirty-six military officers,
  twenty-two from the army and fourteen from the navy. Of real
  politicians there were only thirteen, of whom twelve were experts
  on international law, six of them members of the Institut de
  droit international<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. If
  you were to read the Proceedings, you would find that the
  remaining twenty-five were those who really carried the load.
  These were the men who presided over or chaired the different
  commissions. I have no similar figures for the last Hague
  Conference, the Proceedings of which have not as yet been
  published in their entirety. I believe, however, that an analysis
  would reveal like results. I mention this because I firmly
  believe that governments should see to it that future
  representation to Hague Conferences be such as to make them more
  fruitful.</p>

  <p>An advantage that the Hague Conferences
  lack, in contrast to the peace associations and the
  Interparliamentary Union, is a bureau. The International Court of
  Arbitration at The Hague has its central office, but the
  conference itself has none. This was pointed out by an earlier
  winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, namely <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1902/index.html">Dr. Gobat</a>, who delivered
  his lecture here, to the best of my memory, on the eighteenth of
  July, 1906<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>. The last Hague
  Conference has in the meantime expressed its opinion that a body
  should be established which could prepare for the work involved
  more effectively than has hitherto proved possible. I interpret
  the resolution taken at The Hague as confirming the desirability
  of setting up such a body within the next two years, one capable
  of carrying out preparatory work prior to the assembling of the
  next conference. Immediately, a number of difficulties arise. It
  becomes apparent, I believe, when this stage has been reached,
  that there will be a question as to who is to set the machinery
  in motion. No one government has been given this responsibility.
  Moreover, how is the commission itself to be constituted? It is
  of course impossible to call upon representatives from all
  states.</p>

  <p>I would suggest a method which I think
  could work and which I shall designate by the Swiss term, the
  "Vorort" system<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>; it
  consists in yielding the presidency to each of the participant
  states in turn. Naturally, it would be an honor for the state
  which is appointed first. After all, up to the present, only
  Russia has had the presidency. It could, however, pass to another
  state whose government would appoint a commission and take the
  responsibility for the preparatory work.</p>

  <p>A similar arrangement has already been
  introduced in the Nordic Interparliamentary Union, which was set
  up last year. Its council and its executive are elected by the
  three Scandinavian groups. The council consists of nine persons.
  The first two from each country are the president and the
  vice-president of each of the three groups, and a third member is
  then chosen from each of them-an elected member. I have had the
  honor of being elected for two years by the Danish group.</p>

  <p>When we met in Copenhagen on the fourteenth
  of September last year to constitute the council, we agreed to
  establish the presidency in such a way that one man could not be
  reelected president time after time, and to do it by using the
  so-called "Vorort" system. This year it is Sweden which presides
  and which is therefore responsible for convening the meeting of
  delegates, which number forty-five in all, including the three
  triads already mentioned. They are to meet in Stockholm this year
  on the twenty-seventh of August, or perhaps a little later. Next
  year Norway has the presidency, and it is up to the Norwegian
  group to decide whether an assembly of delegates or a conference
  will be convened and how it is to be organized. The following
  year, 1911, Denmark will assume the leadership, the presidency,
  the "vorort". A similar method is used in Switzerland when the
  peace associations of the various cantons hold their joint annual
  meeting. The presidency passes from state to state, in turn:
  Bern, Neuch&acirc;tel, Lucerne, and so on. At each annual meeting,
  the "Vorort" for the following year is named.</p>

  <p>Before I proceed with my observations on
  the Hague Conferences, I want to comment on a term which I have
  not originated but have adopted from someone else. This is the
  word "pacig&eacute;rance" or "waging peace" in contrast to
  "bellig&eacute;rance" or "waging war". I have taken it from a
  famous and distinguished Belgian writer, Baron Descamps<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>, who is at present Belgium's
  minister of science and art. In 1898 he wrote an excellent book
  in which he developed the legal principles which should apply to
  neutral and non-neutral states in time of war and which he calls
  "pacig&eacute;rat" or "pacig&eacute;rance". According to French
  etymology, however, "pacig&eacute;rat" must signify a condition, a
  legal status; whereas "pacig&eacute;rance" denotes an action, an
  activity, something to be done, performed. Later Descamps used
  the word "pacig&eacute;rat" only in the former sense.</p>

  <p>I requested and received his permission to
  borrow the word pacig&eacute;raance and to use it in another sense.
  Waging war we understand, but not waging peace, or at any rate
  less consciously so. It should, however, be better understood,
  and we should direct the attention of states to the matter of
  "waging peace" with other states; this should be one of the ways
  by which we seek to further the cause of peace and in particular
  to put the results of the Hague Conferences to practical use. I
  am convinced that this work will gain increasing momentum.</p>

  <p>We have long possessed the art of war and
  the science of war, which have been evolved in the minutest
  detail. Warfare has been marvelously developed. It will soon be
  impossible to raise it to further heights. Indeed, whenever a new
  idea is developed, as for example ballooning, warfare immediately
  takes possession. On the other hand, the waging of peace as a
  science, as an art, is in its infancy. But we can trace its
  growth, its steady progress, and the time will come when there
  will be particular individuals designated to assume
  responsibility for and leadership of this movement. There are in
  most states one or two ministers of war, one of whom is the
  minister of naval affairs. I would not wish on any account to
  abolish them; as long as the status of international law is no
  better than it is at present, we cannot very well do without
  them. But I feel convinced, and I venture even to prophesy in
  this regard, that the time will come when there will also be a
  minister of peace in the cabinet, seated beside the ministers of
  war.</p>

  <p>Among the problems confronting the waging
  of peace, "pacig&eacute;rance", I would return to one already
  mentioned, that of obtaining agreement between the states whose
  delegates at The Hague voted for compulsory arbitration of
  international disputes on the seventh of October, 1907.</p>

  <p>I would also mention another matter which
  in my opinion could be further refined. All who have followed
  later developments know that last year-I believe it was on the
  twenty-third of April - a so-called "entente" was concluded among
  the North Sea Powers and among the Baltic Sea Powers, whereby
  they guaranteed each other's coastal areas<a href=
  "#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>. There is, however, an
  extraordinary definition in this agreement, namely, that the
  North Sea ends where the Baltic begins. But the agreement does
  not state where the North Sea does in fact end. Since the whole
  question remains obscure, I believe that it is desirable to try
  to bring these two "entente groups", that for the North Sea and
  that for the Baltic, into a closer association. A first step has
  to be taken; there is a need to "treatify", if I may coin this
  expression, the waterways - the French call them "canaux
  interoc&eacute;aniques" - which connect the two seas. These are the
  Sound, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. Clearly, when such
  waterways are concerned, it is necessary to define precisely what
  rights and duties are invested in those who use them. To use a
  logical approach to the problem, I would say: Let us begin with
  one waterway; for example, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, the North
  Sea-Baltic Canal. There is no doubt that Germany exercises
  control of it. If we then turn to the Little Belt, I believe it
  would be natural to say: This is both a Danish and a German
  coastal area; so Denmark and Germany have to agree on what is to
  happen to it. And, by analogy, a similar situation must exist in
  the case of the Sound. The Sound has, however, already been the
  subject of a treaty, the treaty of 1857 (concerning the toll
  levy)<a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>. This treaty, I
  believe, should be interpreted so that it relates only to
  politico-commercial circumstances and not to strategic ones. I
  believe that great master of international law,
  Bluntschli<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>, is right when
  he says that, when two states border on the open sea and also
  have overlapping coastal areas, they are then obliged to support
  each other in the event of war. It would be of tremendous
  importance and would also affect Danish domestic affairs, if the
  Sound could be "treatified" in such a way that in. the event of
  war between powers inside or outside the Baltic, the Sound would
  remain open as a commercial waterway but be closed to the
  warships of belligerent powers. The warships would then have to
  be diverted to the Great Belt, which in any case is the only
  available route for large warships whose draft is too deep to
  allow them to pass through the Sound. In time of war, ships sail
  in squadrons. It is thus no sacrifice to use the Great Belt,
  which is a passageway through which, both in time of peace and of
  war, all types of shipping ought to be able to sail. The Baltic
  must not become a "closed sea". Indeed, this is a matter which
  merits very detailed study in view of the many important and
  intricate problems involved. I do not in any way pretend to have
  found the answer; but I should mention that I have spoken to many
  experts about it, and they have agreed with the idea that the
  Sound be prohibited to the warships of belligerent powers in
  wartime so that it can then remain an assured commercial seaway.
  I might mention that as early as 1887 I wrote a treatise on this
  subject published in the Danish naval officers' journal, the
  <i>Journal of Naval Affairs</i>. I also offered a resolution
  about it which was accepted at the Lucerne Peace Congress in
  1905. It is one of my pet subjects, and therefore, I should not
  like to let pass this opportunity of reiterating my views. I
  believe that it is of particular significance at present. Norway
  may be geographically somewhat remote, but as a seafaring nation
  with a large merchant fleet she is nevertheless interested in
  seeing the Sound closed [to warships] in case of war between
  powers within or without the Baltic.</p>

  <p>I wish, finally, to touch on a question
  which was recently raised in the Danish Parliament but which has
  received relatively little attention. Fourteen members of
  Parliament, with Mr. Sveistrup<a href=
  "#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> as their spokesman, submitted a
  proposal that the cause of peace be supported by a very
  substantial monetary grant. There are now very few people. who
  believe that the cause of peace should be entirely unsupported by
  government funds. It seems to me that the cause of peace serves
  international political ends, ends which also strongly affect the
  domestic affairs of a state, to such an extent that the state
  should supply funds for its support. In this connection, Norway
  led the way as early as 1890 by granting traveling expenses for
  its delegates to the interparliamentary conferences. Denmark has
  also been generous of late. But on this last occasion, an
  appropriation of no less than a quarter-million kroner was
  proposed. This caused considerable astonishment, but the present
  Danish president of the Council, Neergaard<a href=
  "#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>, was on the whole favorably
  disposed and said that when the purpose for which the funds were
  to be used had been specified in greater detail, he would not
  oppose the motion. He referred particularly to the
  interparliamentary delegate meetings of which our Nordic
  delegates are a part. I hope this matter will be discussed there
  also.</p>

  <p>What I have called "pacig&eacute;rance" is
  clearly part of the larger struggle for civilization which is
  progressing on an increasingly broad front: it is civilization's
  battle between rule by law and rule by power. In this context,
  pacifists should stress more and more that it is the rule of law
  for which they are fighting. It is quite usual to maintain that
  treaties become just so much wastepaper when war breaks out. This
  is a military concept that pacifists should not tolerate. We
  should do everything within our power to insure that the idea of
  law conquers. What contributes largely to the confusion of ideas
  is the accepted division of the world into major powers and small
  states. We understand a "power" to be a state which has a large
  population and well-developed armed forces, army and navy, and so
  on. This is comparable to believing that a great man is a very
  tall and big man. By a great man, however, we mean a man who,
  because of his spiritual gifts, his character, and other
  qualities, deserves to be called great and who as a result earns
  the power to influence others. By the same token it must follow
  that the state we now call a small state is in reality a power if
  it plays such a role in the development of civilization that it
  marches in the front ranks and wins victories in the fight for
  law which surpass those of the so-called great powers.</p>

  <p>I do not think that I dare tire my
  distinguished audience any longer. I have touched on various
  matters, many of which would have merited discussion as separate
  topics. I ask you to forgive me for a lecture which has been
  rather fragmentary. It is true that I have kept a thread running
  through it with my metaphor of the three stories and the three
  columns, but apart from that I have expressed random thoughts
  which I must characterize as details and which may seem, for the
  most part, of quite secondary importance. If this is so, I would
  recall, turning again to the military, the words of that great
  general, Frederick II of Prussia<a href=
  "#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>. Very fond of expressing himself
  in French, he once said, in another context naturally, that one
  should not turn up one's nose at details, that details should be
  noted and attended to, for they constitute the first step to
  victory.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">Aimez donc ces d&eacute;tails! Ils ne sont pas
    sans gloire.<br>
    Ce sont les premiers pas menant &agrave; la victoire.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I must now thank you for the attention you
  have shown, and I wish to offer special appreciation to the Head
  of this State<a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a> who has
  honored the lecture with his presence. And last but certainly not
  least, my thanks to those to whom I owe the privilege of standing
  here today: the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament.</p>

  The peace societies or associations scattered throughout the
  world had held international peace congresses intermittently
  since 1843. In 1889 their representatives met in a "Universal
  Peace Congress" in Paris at almost the same time the first
  Interparliamentary Conference, composed of parliamentarians from
  different nations, met in the same city. Both were presided over
  by Frederic Passy. An unofficial connection was thus established
  between the two groups, and it became customary thereafter for
  the international peace congresses and the interparliamentary
  conferences to meet periodically (almost annually in fact) at
  practically the same time in the same city. The peace congresses
  were variously called "international", "universal", or "world"-
  terms often used interchangeably.</p>
