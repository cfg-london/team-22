  <h1>Johannes Stark - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="stark.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Johannes Stark</b> was born on April
  15, 1874 in Schickenhof, Bavaria; his father was a landed
  proprietor. He was educated at the Gymnasium (grammar school) in
  Bayreuth and later in Regensburg and proceeded to Munich
  University in 1894 to read physics, mathematics, chemistry
  and crystallography. Stark graduated in 1897 on the basis of his
  doctoral dissertation on Newton's electrochronic rings in a
  certain type of dim media. He worked as assistant to von Lommel
  at the Physics Institute at Munich University from 1897 until
  1900 and then became unsalaried university lecturer of physics at
  the University of G&ouml;ttingen. In 1906 he was
  appointed extraordinary professor at the Technische Hochschule in
  Hannover and in 1909 he followed the invitation of the Technische
  Hochschule in Aachen to become Professor there. A similar
  appointment at the University of Greifswald followed in 1917.
  Three years later he moved to the Physics Institute of the
  University
  of W&uuml;rzburg, where he stayed until 1922.<br>
  <br>
  Stark's scientific works cover three large fields: the electric
  currents in gases, spectroscopic analysis, and chemical valency.
  His spectroscopic work deals with the connection between the
  alteration in the structure and in the spectrum of chemical
  atoms. In 1919 Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for
  his "discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the
  splitting of spectral lines in electric fields". The prize
  enabled him to set up his own private laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1933 Stark was elected President of the
  Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Physico-Technical
  Institute) as successor to von Paschen, where he remained until
  his retirement in 1939. At the same time he held the post of
  President of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research
  Association).<br>
  <br>
  Stark was a prolific writer and published more than 300
  scientific papers. His book <i>Die Elektrizit&auml;t in Gasen</i>
  (Electricity in gases) was published in 1902. This was followed
  by works on elementary radiation and electrical spectroscopic
  analysis of chemical atoms. In connection with his work on
  chemical valency he wrote a book <i>Die Elektrizit&auml;t im
  chemischen Atom</i> (Electricity in the chemical atom). Stark
  founded the <i>Jahrbuch der Radioaktivit&auml;t und
  Elektronik</i> (The Year Book of Radioactivity and Electronics)
  and edited this publication from 1904 until 1913.<br>
  <br>
  Johannes Stark was a corresponding member of the Academies in
  G&ouml;ttingen, Rome, Leyden, Vienna and Calcutta, and was
  awarded the Baumgartner Prize of the Vienna Academy of Sciences
  in 1910 and the Vahlbruch Prize of the G&ouml;ttingen Academy of
  Sciences in 1914, and also the Matteucci Medal of the Rome
  Academy.<br>
  <br>
  During the last years of his life Stark, in his private
  laboratory on his country estate Eppenstatt near Traunstein in
  Upper Bavaria, investigated the effect of light deflection in an
  unhomogeneous electric field.<br>
  <br>
  He was married to Luise Uepler. They had five children. His
  recreations were forestry and cultivation of fruit trees.<br>
  <br>
  Stark died on June 21, 1957.</p>
