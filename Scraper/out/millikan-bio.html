  <h1>Robert A. Millikan - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="millikan.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Robert Andrews Millikan</b>
  was born on the 22nd of March, 1868, in Morrison, Ill. (U.S.A.),
  as the second son of the Reverend Silas Franklin Millikan and
  Mary Jane Andrews. His grandparents were of the Old New England
  stock which had come to America before 1750, and were pioneer
  settlers in the Middle West. He led a rural existence in
  childhood, attending the Maquoketa High School (Iowa). After working
  for a short time as a court reporter, he entered Oberlin College
  (Ohio) in 1886. During his undergraduate course his favourite
  subjects were Greek and mathematics; but after his graduation in
  1891 he took, for two years, a teaching post in elementary
  physics. It was during this period that he developed his interest
  in the subject in which he was later to excel. In 1893, after
  obtaining his mastership in physics, he was appointed Fellow in
  Physics at Columbia University. He afterwards received his
  Ph.D. (1895) for research on the polarization of light emitted by
  incandescent surfaces - using for this purpose molten gold and
  silver at the U.S. Mint.<br>
  <br>
  On the instigation of his professors, Millikan spent a year
  (1895-1896) in Germany, at the Universities of Berlin and
  G&ouml;ttingen. He returned at the invitation of A.
  A. Michelson, to become assistant at the newly established
  Ryerson Laboratory at the University of Chicago (1896). Millikan was an
  eminent teacher, and passing through the customary grades he
  became professor at that university in 1910, a post which he
  retained till 1921. During his early years at Chicago he spent
  much time preparing textbooks and simplifying the teaching of
  physics. He was author or co-author of the following books: <i>A
  College Course in Physics,</i> with S.W. Stratton (1898);
  <i>Mechanics, Molecular Physics, and Heat</i> (1902); <i>The
  Theory of Optics,</i>with C.R. Mann translated from the German
  (1903); <i>A First Course in Physics,</i> with H.G. Gale (1906);
  <i>A Laboratory Course in Physics for Secondary Schools,</i>with
  H.G. Gale (1907); <i>Electricity, Sound, and Light,</i>with J.
  Mills (1908); <i>Practical Physics</i> - revision of <i>A First
  Course</i>(1920); <i>The Electron</i>(1917; rev. eds. 1924,
  1935).<br>
  <br>
  As a scientist, Millikan made numerous momentous discoveries,
  chiefly in the fields of electricity, optics, and molecular
  physics. His earliest major success was the accurate
  determination of the charge carried by an electron, using the
  elegant "falling-drop method"; he also proved that this quantity
  was a constant for all electrons (1910), thus demonstrating the
  atomic structure of electricity. Next, he verified experimentally
  Einstein's all-important photoelectric equation, and made the
  first direct photoelectric determination of Planck's constant h
  (1912-1915). In addition his studies of the Brownian movements in
  gases put an end to all opposition to the atomic and kinetic
  theories of matter. During 1920-1923, Millikan occupied himself
  with work concerning the hot-spark spectroscopy of the elements
  (which explored the region of the spectrum between the
  ultraviolet and X-radiation), thereby extending the ultraviolet
  spectrum downwards far beyond the then known limit. The discovery
  of his law of motion of a particle falling towards the earth
  after entering the earth's atmosphere, together with his other
  investigations on electrical phenomena, ultimately led him to his
  significant studies of cosmic radiation (particularly with
  ionization chambers).<br>
  <br>
  Throughout his life Millikan remained a prolific author, making
  numerous contributions to scientific journals. He was not only a
  foremost scientist, but his religious and philosophic nature was
  evident from his lectures on the reconciliation of science and
  religion, and from his books: <i>Science and Life</i>(1924);
  <i>Evolution in Science and Religion</i> (1927); <i>Science and
  the New Civilization</i> (1930); <i>Time, Matter, and Values</i>
  (1932). Shortly before his death he published <i>Electrons (+ and
  &#8211;), Protons, Photons, Neutrons, Mesotrons, and Cosmic
  Rays</i> (1947; another rev. ed. of The Electron, previously
  mentioned,) and his <i>Autobiography</i>(1950).<br>
  <br>
  During World War I, Millikan was Vice-Chairman of the National
  Research Council, playing a major part in developing
  anti-submarine and meteorological devices. In 1921, he was
  appointed Director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at
  the California
  Institute of Technology, Pasadena; he was also made Chairman
  of the Executive Council of that institute. In 1946 he retired
  from this post. Professor Millikan has been President of the
  American Physical Society, Vice-President of the American
  Association for the Advancement of Science, and was the American
  member of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League
  of Nations, and the American representative at the International
  Congress of Physics, known as the Solvay Congress, at Brussels in
  1921. He held honorary doctor's degrees of some twenty-five
  universities, and was a member or honorary member of many learned
  institutions in his country and abroad. He has been the recipient
  of the Comstock Prize of the National Academy of Sciences, of the Edison Medal of
  the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, of the Hughes
  Medal of the Royal Society of Great Britain, and of the Nobel
  Prize for Physics 1923. He was also made Commander of the Legion
  of Honour, and received the Chinese Order of Jade.<br>

  Millikan was an enthusiastic tennis player, and golf was also one
  of his recreations.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Millikan married Greta Erwin Blanchard in 1902; they
  had three sons: Clark Blanchard, Glenn Allen, and Max
  Franklin.<br>
  <br>
  He died on the 19th of December, 1953, in San Marino,
  California.</p>
