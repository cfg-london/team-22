  <h1>Adolf von Baeyer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="baeyer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer</b> was
  born on October 31, 1835, in Berlin, as the son of Johann Jakob
  Baeyer and Eugenie n&eacute;e Hitzig. He came from a family
  distinguished both in literature and the natural sciences. His
  father, a lieutenant-general, was the originator of the European
  system of geodetic measurement. Even as a child Baeyer was
  interested in chemical experiments and at the age of twelve found
  a new double salt of copper.<br>
  <br>
  Baeyer devoted his first two years as a student at the University
  of Berlin (1853-1855) chiefly to physics and mathematics. By
  1856, however, his old love for chemistry re-awakened and drew
  him to Bunsen's laboratory in Heidelberg. His studies here on
  methyl chloride resulted in his first published work which came
  out in 1857. During the next year he worked in Kekul&eacute;'s
  private laboratory in Heidelberg and was associated with his
  ingenious structure theory. Baeyer's life work was soon to bring
  this indeed most brilliant of chemical theories much resounding
  success. In 1858, in Berlin, he received his doctorate for his
  work on cacodyl compounds which had been done in Kekul&eacute;'s
  laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  For the next year or two Baeyer was again working with
  Kekul&eacute; who had meanwhile become Professor at Ghent. A study of
  uric acid, which also led him to the discovery of barbituric
  acid, provided the thesis by which he qualified as a university
  teacher in 1860. In the same year he became a lecturer in organic
  chemistry at the "Gewerbe-Akademie" (Trade Academy) in Berlin. He
  received little money but was given a spacious laboratory. In
  1866 the University of Berlin, at the suggestion of A.W. Hofmann,
  conferred on him a senior lectureship, which, however, was
  unpaid.<br>
  <br>
  It was during the Berlin period that Baeyer began most of the
  work that was to bring him fame later. In 1865 he started his
  work on indigo - the blue dye had fascinated him since his
  youth-and this soon led to the discovery of indole and to the
  partial synthesis of indigotin. His pupils Graebe and Liebermann,
  with the help of the zinc-dust distillation developed by Baeyer,
  clarified the structure of alizarin and worked out the synthesis
  used industrially. Studies were initiated on condensation
  reactions which, after Baeyer had gone to Strassburg as Professor
  in the newly established University (1871) brought to light that
  important category of dyestuffs - the phthaleins. Baeyer's theory
  of carbon-dioxide assimilation in formaldehyde also belongs to
  this period.<br>
  <br>
  On the death of Justus von Liebig in 1873, Baeyer was called to
  his Chair in the University of Munich and there, over many years,
  built up an excellent new chemical laboratory. With his tenure at
  Munich came elegant total syntheses of indigo, as well as work on
  acetylene and polyacetylene, and from this derived the famous
  Baeyer strain theory of the carbon rings; there were studies of
  the constitution of benzene as well as comprehensive
  investigations into cyclic terpene. In this connexion the
  Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones by means of per-acids was
  discovered. Especial interest was aroused theoretically by his
  work on organic peroxides and oxonium compounds and on the
  connexion between constitution and colour.<br>
  <br>
  Von Baeyer's work was at once pioneering and many-sided. With
  admirable penetration and extraordinary experimental skill he
  combined dogged perseverance and, even at 70 years old, a
  youthful buoyancy in his work. He was careful never to
  overestimate the value of a theory. While Kekul&eacute; sometimes
  approached Nature with preconceived opinions, von Baeyer would
  say: "I have never set up an experiment to see whether I was
  right, but to see how the materials behave". Even in old age his
  views did not become fixed, and his mind remained open to new
  developments in chemical science.<br>
  <br>
  Like Berzelius and Liebig, von Baeyer distinguished himself by
  forming a school which alone nurtured fifty future university
  teachers. Honours were heaped upon him, including the Nobel Prize
  for Chemistry in 1905. On his fiftieth birthday he was raised to
  the hereditary nobility.<br>
  <br>
  Adolf von Baeyer married Adelheid (Lida) Bendemann in 1868. They
  had one daughter, who became the wife of the chemist Oskar
  Piloty, and two sons, both university lecturers, Hans in medicine
  at Munich, and Otto in physics at Berlin. He was still young in
  spirit when he succumbed to a seizure at his country house at
  Starnberger See on August 20, 1917.</p>
