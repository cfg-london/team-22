  <h1>Philip S. Hench - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hench.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Philip
  Showalter Hench</b> was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on
  February 28, 1896, the son of Jacob Bixler Hench and Clara
  Showalter. After attending local schools he entered Lafayette
  College, Easton, Penn., where he graduated Bachelor of Arts
  in 1916. He enlisted in the Medical Corps of the United States
  Army in 1917 but was transferred to the reserve corps to finish
  his medical training. In 1920 he received his doctorate in
  medicine from the University of Pittsburgh. After a year as an interne
  at Saint Francis Hospital, Pittsburgh, he became a Fellow of the
  Mayo
  Foundation, the graduate school of the University of
  Minnesota's Department of Medicine. His association with the
  Mayo Clinic began in 1923 when he became first an assistant,
  then, three years later, Head of its Department of Rheumatic
  Diseases. Between 1928 and 1929, Dr. Hench studied abroad, at
  Freiburg
  University and at the von M&uuml;ller Clinic, Munich. He was
  appointed an instructor in the Mayo Foundation in 1928, Assistant
  Professor 1932, Associate Professor 1935 and, in 1947, Professor
  of Medicine, a position which he still holds.<br>
  <br>
  In 1942 Dr. Hench entered military service as a
  lieutenant-colonel in the Medical Corps, becoming Chief of the
  Medical Service and Director of the Army's Rheumatism Centre at
  the Army and Navy General Hospital. Leaving the army with the
  rank of colonel, in 1946, he became expert consultant to the Army
  Surgeon General, which position is still held by him.<br>
  <br>
  At the Mayo Clinic he specialized in arthritic disease. In the
  course of his work he observed the favourable effects of jaundice
  on arthritic patients, causing a remission of pain. Other bodily
  changes, for example pregnancy, produced the same effect. These
  and other observations led him gradually to the conclusion that
  the pain-alleviating substance was a steroid.<br>
  <br>
  In the period 1930-1938, Dr. <a href="index.html">E. C.
  Kendall</a> had isolated several steroids from the adrenal gland
  cortex. After several years of collaboration with Dr. Kendall, it
  was decided to try the effect of one of these substances,
  Compound E (later named cortisone), on arthritic patients. Delay
  in implementing this decision was caused by Dr. Hench's military
  service in World War II and by the costly and complicated
  isolation of the substance. In 1948-1949, cortisone was
  successfully tested on arthritic patients. Hench also treated
  patients with ACTH, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland
  which stimulates the adrenal gland.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Hench is the author of several papers in the field of
  rheumatology, contributed mainly to <i>Hygeia</i> and the
  <i>Annals of Rheumatic Diseases.</i> His many awards include the
  Heberden Medal (London), the 1949 Lasker Award, presented by the
  American Public Health Association, the Passano Foundation Award
  and the Criss Award (1951). He has received honorary doctorates
  in science from Lafayette College, Washington and
  Jefferson College, Western Reserve University, the National University
  of Ireland and the University of Pittsburgh. He holds the degree
  of master of science from the University of Minnesota.<br>
  <br>
  A Fellow of the American Medical Association and of the American College of
  Physicians, he is one of the leaders in American
  rheumatology. He is a founder member of the American Rheumatism
  Association (President 1940-1941), and holds office in many
  rheumatism organizations. He holds honorary membership of the
  Royal
  Society of Medicine (London) and of rheumatism societies in
  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark and Spain.<br>
  <br>
  In 1927, Dr. Hench married Mary Genevieve Kahler, daughter of
  John Henry Kahler. They have two sons and two daughters. He is
  interested in music, photography and tennis, and is an authority
  on medical history.</p>
