<p><img src="fleming.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Sir
  Alexander Fleming</b> was born at Lochfield near Darvel in
  Ayrshire, Scotland on August 6th, 1881. He attended Louden Moor
  School, Darvel School, and Kilmarnock Academy before moving to
  London where he attended the Polytechnic. He spent four years in
  a shipping office before entering St. Mary's Medical School,
  London University. He qualified with distinction in 1906 and
  began research at St. Mary's under Sir Almroth Wright, a pioneer
  in vaccine therapy. He gained M.B., B.S., (London), with Gold
  Medal in 1908, and became a lecturer at St. Mary's until 1914. He
  served throughout World War I as a captain in the Army Medical
  Corps, being mentioned in dispatches, and in 1918 he returned to
  St.Mary's. He was elected Professor of the School in 1928 and
  Emeritus Professor of Bacteriology, University of London
  in 1948. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in
  1943 and knighted in 1944.<br>

  Early in his medical life, Fleming became interested in the
  natural bacterial action of the blood and in antiseptics. He was
  able to continue his studies throughout his military career and
  on demobilization he settled to work on antibacterial substances
  which would not be toxic to animal tissues. In 1921, he
  discovered in &laquo;tissues and secretions&raquo; an important
  bacteriolytic substance which he named Lysozyme. About this time,
  he devised sensitivity titration methods and assays in human
  blood and other body fluids, which he subsequently used for the
  titration of penicillin. In 1928, while working on influenza
  virus, he observed that mould had developed accidently on a
  staphylococcus culture plate and that the mould had created a
  bacteria-free circle around itself. He was inspired to further
  experiment and he found that a mould culture prevented growth of
  staphylococci, even when diluted 800 times. He named the active
  substance penicillin.<br>
  <br>
  Sir Alexander wrote numerous papers on bacteriology, immunology
  and chemotherapy, including original descriptions of lysozyme and
  penicillin. They have been published in medical and scientific
  journals.<br>
