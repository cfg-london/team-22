 <h1>J. Robin Warren - Biographical</h1>



<p><img src="warren.jpg" class="bio-img">
  I was born on the 11th of June 1937, in North Adelaide, South Australia, the
     first child of middle-class parents. I am a fifth generation South Australian.
     South Australia is a charming state, a little overfull of the fact that,
  along with 
  Victoria, it was settled by free settlers from England, who took part in
  a land 
  investment program. There were no convicts. Elsewhere in Australia, the major
     cities began as prisons for Britain's unwanted, when America became
      closed to them after the War of Independence. The original settlers arrived
      in 1836&ndash;7 and the beautiful city of Adelaide was chosen as the main
  settlement. 
  It was imaginatively designed, with the main city square mile crossed by 
  broad streets and surrounded by parkland. Adelaide rapidly expanded during
       the Victorian era, and by the end of the 19th century it was a bustling
      city  of about 100,000 people.</p>
  <p>The Warrens migrated from Aberdeen in 1840. Their eldest son, my great 
  grandfather John Campbell Warren, was a member of the local government, 
  Captain of the Light Cavalry, and patriarch of a family of 16 children. He 
  owned a large estate in the Adelaide Hills. At the turn of the century, he
  sent 
  his sons to outback South Australia (Anna Creek) and Western Australia 
  (Katanning) to open up huge areas for cattle and wheat. My father, Roger 
  Warren, studied viticulture and became one of Australia's leading winemakers.</p>
  <p>My mother's ancestors migrated from England to Adelaide with the first 
  settlers in 1836&ndash;7. My grandfather, Sydney Verco, belonged to a dynasty
  of 
  doctors. The Verco family still make up many of Adelaide's doctors.
  He died 
  young, leaving my grandmother, Alice, with no income and four children to 
  feed and educate. Somehow with the help of the extended family, she managed 
  to send all the children to private schools. She scratched and saved to 
  get enough money to send her son, Luke, through medical school. My mother, 
  Helen, had desperately wanted to be a doctor, but could not be similarly
  financially supported. She eventually trained as a nurse instead. I cannot
  remember 
  my mother ever pressuring me to study medicine, but somehow this 
  always seemed to be my aim. We were all very proud of my uncle Luke Verco, 
  who was a captain in the Army Medical Corps during the Second World War. 
  I still have clear memories of him in his uniform. After the war, he became
  a 
  country general practitioner, and my favourite uncle.</p>
  <p>My parents married during the depression. Life was not easy. When I was 
  born, we lived at the seaside suburb of Brighton, which I only remember 
  from photographs taken by my father. In 1939, we moved to my grandmother's 
  old home in the southern suburb of Unley. My earliest memories 
  were of riding my little tricycle to a local private school, which would
  have 
  roughly coincided with Japan's entry into World War II. For me, the
  war was 
  rather unreal. We knew it was something to do with the Japanese up north, 
  who were bombing Northern Australia. I recall attending an exhibition of 
  Japanese submarines caught in Sydney Harbour. There were books about our 
  brave soldiers fighting Germans in North Africa. For children in quiet little 
  Adelaide these were all faraway events, almost an adventure story.</p>
  <p>Other things that we saw, without really understanding them, were the almost 
  total absence of cars, and the impossibility of getting electrical goods
   for 
  the home. One car on our street used a 'gas producer', which
  burnt coke and 
  produced carbon monoxide to fuel the motor. We used to watch these cars, 
  with rusty black burners attached to the back, in some wonderment. A car 
  near our home had a gas bag on top of the roof, as big as the car itself,
  filled 
  with coal gas. Petrol was almost unavailable, but this had little effect
  on me. 
  Food and clothing were rationed, but my mother seemed to be able to keep 
  the family well fed and clothed, even if our idea of luxury was 'bread
  and 
  dripping', made with fat and meat juices from the roasting dish, smeared
  on 
  bread. When the war ended, we were able to buy a refrigerator. Previously, 
  food was kept cool in an ice chest.</p>
  <p>During and after the war, I attended the local public primary school, 
  Westbourne Park School. Education in those days was much more by rote 
  than today, particularly learning how to spell columns of words and memorize 
  multiplication tables. I suspect the balance now has tilted too far the other 
  way. With the onset of calculators and then computers, arithmetic was no 
  longer done in the head, although I never regret the ability. Rote learning 
  was actually only a small part of our education &ndash; certainly not all
  of it, as the 
  media often seems to suggest today. My children seemed to be expected to 
  pick up spelling as they went along, reading and studying literature, but
  with 
  the onset of increasing home entertainment they seem to read less than we 
  did. We used to listen to the radio, and I made myself a crystal radio set, 
  which enabled me to hear the radio in bed. My mother made sure that I 
  could get any books I wanted, and I was an avid reader of all the usual boy's 
  adventure stories, both new and classic. I also used to read books about
  science.</p>
  <p>As I grew older, I obtained my first bicycle, which I used to ride to school 
  and visit my friends. In those days, the Adelaide suburbs were remarkably 
  safe. You hardly needed to lock the house to go out (although mother always 
  did). There seemed to be no worry about children being attacked. There 
  were still very few cars on the roads, and the idea that it was unsafe for
  children 
  to ride alone was a generation away. I also used to amuse myself riding 
  in the Adelaide foothills, sometimes picking wild blackberries (which my 
  mother made into beautiful jam) or catching occasional 'yabbies' (the
  local 
  wild freshwater lobsters). I watched my father take family photographs with 
  his old Voitlander camera, and I finally persuaded him to buy me a Kodak 
  box camera for my 10th birthday. I soon obtained developing dishes and 
  printing paper, and my lifelong hobby of photography was definitely started.</p>
  <p>I was never good at sports at school, although I enjoyed a game of cricket 
  (played at a pretty low level), but I did become more adventurous with my
   bicycle 
  and camera, touring around the Adelaide Hills and taking landscape 
  photographs. I was a bit of a loner, riding on my own and doing whatever
  I 
  wanted, not having to worry about how fast or slow companions were. This 
  did somewhat hinder my social skills, but no doubt made my eventual profession 
  in pathology much easier.</p>
  <p>As I entered my teenage years, I began my secondary education. This was
  at 
  the oldest school in Adelaide, St Peter's College, the same school
  Lord Florey 
  attended. At least two previous generations of Warrens went there. I found
     my father's name carved into a desk and dated 1917. Life there was
  quite different 
  from the local primary school. It was much more competitive. The best 
  students were in the top level, with four levels in each grade (year). They
  had 
  an arrangement similar to English league football, with the bottom students
     in each term exams being relegated to the class below. This happened to
    me  once, to my extreme annoyance, and I vowed to return to level one and
    stay  there. Most students who later attended university were in the top
    class. The 
  curriculum there included English literature, two foreign languages (usually
     Latin and French), mathematics (my favourite subject), physics and chemistry.
     All were required for matriculation to the science oriented university 
  schools such as medicine or engineering.</p>
  <p>Sport was an important part of the school curriculum. Unfortunately, I was 
  never much good at it, and did not really enjoy it. However, I continued
   my 
  weekend cycling and photography. I attended the school's army cadet
  unit, 
  where I learned army skills and, presumably, instant obedience. I particularly 
  enjoyed the rifle shooting. Target shooting, which I learnt in the school 
  cadets, became the primary sporting activity of my adult life.</p>
  <p>I matriculated from the school in 1954, gaining a Commonwealth scholarship. 
  These scholarships were the initial attempt by the Commonwealth government 
  to provide free tertiary education for the masses. I still think it was 
  an excellent idea. There were just about enough scholarships to cover anyone 
  who wanted to enter the major University schools, such as medicine or engineering, 
  so most people attending the University were provided with free 
  education. The situation is much more complex now, with the government 
  paying the fees, but requiring them to be repaid by the students when they 
  start earning money.</p>

  <p>About this time I had my first experience of girls. I only had brothers,
  and 
  somehow my mother did not count. Girls had always been very distant and 
  strange people, especially the snooty-looking ones who walked past our front 
  gate on the way to the local catholic convent school. (I married a catholic
  girl 
  from a different catholic school, who thoroughly agreed with my description 
  above!) Just before matriculation, the students were expected to attend dancing
  classes and then invite girls to the annual school ball. At first this seemed 
  a strange affair, trying to learn ballroom dancing with a lot of girls who 
  seemed just as shy as me. However, we soon got the idea, and we began to 
  have a lot of pleasure, with groups of boys and girls developing personal
  relationships. 
  There was none of the 'going steady' culture, which seems to
  dominate 
  that period in America, and certainly a generation later with my children. 
  For us, it was all very easygoing and pleasant, nothing serious.</p>
  <p>Also, during my matriculation year, an event occurred that was to mark 
  most of my life. One morning, my mother found me unconscious on the 
  back lawn. I recovered without apparent ill-effect, but some time later it
  recurred. 
  I was soon diagnosed as suffering grand mal epilepsy. I was placed on 
  phenobarbital, and then a variety of other drugs to try and control the 
  seizures, but control remained imperfect. I was unable to obtain a driving
  licence, 
  a major event for young people at that age. There were apparently numerous
     comments to my mother at the time from people, both professional, 
  friends and relatives, who should have known better. Many apparently suggested
     keeping me at home, no university, definitely no medical school, and 
  so on. Thank goodness, none of this filtered through to me at the time; it
     made life difficult and embarrassing enough as it was at that rather sensitive
     teenage period. Mother had enough sense to give me a free rein to do what
  I 
  liked, and none of this was ever mentioned. It was only years later that
  I came 
  to appreciate just how much my mother had gone through to support my independence
  and personal maturation. My cycling in the hills continued, never 
  interrupted by epileptic attacks or by admonitions that it was 'too
  dangerous.' 
  Apparently, mother was worried sick, but she never said a word about it.</p>
  <p>I obtained entry to the medical school of the Adelaide University in 1955, 
  and the next stage of my life began. The first year was a wonderful entry
   to 
  the university environment. Much of the work was a repetition of the final 
  year at school. There was far more freedom. For the first time, we learnt 
  about responsibility; we could work or not, as we liked. The only difference 
  was that at the end of the year, a pass or fail was on the student's
  own shoulders. 
  Help was always there, if we wanted it, but some of my colleagues 
  revelled in the ability to do nothing. Luckily for me, I was enjoying the
  work 
  too much to miss it. I particularly enjoyed botany and zoology, new subjects 
  for me. I remember dissecting a frog and setting up its skeleton &ndash; my 
  specimen showing a marked absence of any imagination, just bones glued to 
  a piece of cardboard!</p>
  <p>Both before and after starting university, I always read widely, including
  numerous 
  scientific books and medical history books. Astronomy was a particular 
  interest of mine at the time. I remember reading Fred Hoyle's books 
  about the universe. I read the Oxford Junior Encyclopaedia, all 12 volumes.
  I 
  probably should have spent as much time reading textbooks! Unfortunately, 
  while I found textbooks fascinating to read as my curiosity and interest
  dictated, 
  when I had to learn them for exams, they tended to lose their charm.</p>
  <p>Medicine began in earnest with the preclinical years two and three. I was
  at 
  the medical school almost full-time. The medical school was set apart from 
  the main university buildings and the direct association with the university 
  during first year was largely lost. Most of our time was spent in the anatomy 
  department dissecting a cadaver or learning bone and joint structure and 
  attachments, then the inner organs and the brain. I have never regretted
  the 
  chance to learn anatomy (and, in later years, pathology) in such detail,
  which 
  today's students do not have time for. While I do not remember all
  the anatomy, 
  it soon comes back with a glance at Gray's textbook.</p>
  <p>We also learned physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, embryology and 
  histology. I illustrated my notes for the latter two subjects with full colour 
  sketches from the practical classes, using purple and pink pencils for haematoxylin 
  and eosin. In those days there was only a very simple range of available 
  drugs and, though we did not realise at the time, pharmacy and pharmacology 
  were very simple in comparison to what the students need to know 
  today.</p>
  <p>The next adventure began with the clinical years four, five and six. In
  those 
  days, the Royal Adelaide Hospital was the only general teaching hospital
  in 
  South Australia. In both its scattered buildings and in its function, it
  was like 
  a living museum. Some of the best wards were &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; buildings
  erected 
  for World War I. One was named Verco Ward, after one of my mother's 
  uncles. Some of the more Victorian wards were like an old English moving 
  picture; a huge barn-like structure, with beds along each wall and Sister
  at the 
  high table at one end. Nobody argued with Sister, especially not the students, 
  who were assigned patients to study and follow-up and were treated as the 
  bottom of the social ladder (by everyone but the nurses &ndash; who wanted
  future 
  doctors to marry &ndash; and the patients, who generally seemed to appreciate
  our 
  attention). This three-year term of surgery, medicine and obstetrics and 
  gynaecology, passed very quickly. There always seemed to be something new 
  and interesting around the corner.</p>
  <p>After medical school, life became very busy. We were called 'Junior 
  Resident Medical Officers' &ndash; the equivalent of today's
  interns. We actually 
  were residents, living at the hospital residents' quarters. A second
  government 
  hospital opened, and I obtained a position there. At that stage in life,
  I 
  was still very much an innocent, with very little it exposure to the outside 
  world of finance and employment. All graduating medical students were given 
  Junior Resident positions. These entailed about 100 to 120 hours per week 
  working, with very little payment (I received &pound;17&ndash;10 per week).
  Nevertheless, 
  I was young and fit, and the constant work was actually very enjoyable. I 
  bought a Leica M3 camera, and started to turn my hobby to professional 
  subjects, photographing interesting clinical lesions. I do not think I have 
  ever worked in a branch of medicine that I did not enjoy.</p>
  <p>This period changed my life around again. The new hospital also provided 
  a second obstetrics facility for the medical school. The obstetrics students 
  lived in the resident's quarters. Some of the students were young women. 
  Their dormitory was near mine. We soon became good friends, and then I 
  found myself very attached to one Winifred Williams. In fact, before we knew 
  what had happened, I was spending all my spare time at her home. I remember 
  one magic day, we wandered through the Botanic Gardens together, and 
  it started to rain. Next thing we were arm in arm in the glasshouse, but
  we did 
  not notice the flowers. Soon we were engaged and, a year later, married.
  For 
  me, that was the biggest and best decision of my life, and so easy to do
  at the 
  time.</p>
  <p>I remained a little innocent about the big bad world outside. I did not 
  realise how easy it was for us, with automatic positions provided &ndash; even
  if it 
  was almost slave labour. Law students for instance, had to find clerking 
  positions with private firms to complete their Articles of Clerkship, before 
  they could practice at all. Other students had to find employment for themselves. 
  I learned a valuable lesson at the end of my resident year. I assumed it 
  was good manners to only apply for the second year position that I wanted, 
  registrar in psychiatry. I did not get the post and found myself, to my surprise, 
  unemployed. Luckily there were still a few positions available, and the one 
  which appealed to me most was Registrar in Clinical Pathology at the 
  Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, attached to the Royal Adelaide 
  Hospital.</p>
  <p>In practice, 'Clinical Pathology' meant mainly laboratory haematology, 
  which I thoroughly enjoyed. We had a good deal of freedom and responsibility. 
  Although the usual work entailed reporting on blood smears and bone 
  marrow, we had a wide range of other tasks, including examining faeces for 
  parasites, examining urine and testing skin and nails for fungus. I put my 
  drawing skills to work again, with detailed sketches of the various ova,
  amoebae 
  and other organisms we saw. It really was an excellent all-round position 
  to give one an overall feeling for pathology.</p>
  <p>By the end of that year, Win graduated MB BS, and we had our first baby 
  on the way. My pay was just about double what I earned in the intern year 
  and, in pathology, my time of work was largely during the day. Life was settling 
  into an enjoyable routine, if less adventurous. I had learnt about employment 
  by them, and I applied for every position advertised at the end of the 
  year. My first choice was Temporary Lecturer in Pathology at the Adelaide 
  University, and I obtained the position. The work there consisted largely
  of 
  morbid anatomy and histopathology, under the guidance of Professor Jim 
  Robertson, which completed my overview of pathology and convinced me to 
  go for membership of the (then) new College of Pathologists of Australia. 
  Our baby boy, John, was born and we thought he was so wonderful, we had to 
  start another. Of course, the baby soon started to crawl around, still wonderful, 
  but a constant handful. By the time we realised our mistake, it was too late 
  and our second baby was on the way. Win was still trying to fit in her intern 
  year (it took her four years in bits and pieces to finish).</p>
  <p><b>Melbourne<br>
  </b>Again I applied for every position possible, both in Australia
    and overseas. As 
  it turned out, I was offered the position of Clinical Pathology Registrar
  at the 
  Royal Melbourne Hospital. We moved to Melbourne, for one of the happiest 
  periods of our lives. The pathology community in Melbourne was much bigger
     and more active than in Adelaide, and Sydney was only a short distance 
  up the coast. Everything seemed to be at our fingertips. The work was similar
     to that at the Medical and Veterinary Institute two years before. A couple
  of 
  years of clinical pathology under the tutelage of Dr David Cowling and Dr 
  Bertha Ungar enabled me to pass the college exams in haematology and 
  microbiology.</p>
  <p>After this, I became Registrar in Pathology, for training in morbid anatomy 
  and histopathology. All hospital deaths received a post-mortem examination, 
  for which we were responsible each morning. After morning tea, we examined 
  the day's biopsy slides and presented them in a Grand Round, using
  a 
  primitive old slide projector that was lit with two arcing rods of carbon.
  It 
  really was quite an entertaining and educational show, with most of the surgeons 
  present. Dr Doug Hicks, the head of department, would bark out questions 
  to the resident and comments or answers to other questions. We had to 
  work hard and fast, but Dr Hicks was an excellent teacher, and everybody 
  learned from the show.</p>
  <p>After four years in Melbourne, I finished my College membership and was 
  a fully-fledged pathologist. Our second son, David, was born during our first 
  year in Melbourne. Win somehow managed to fit in her intern year between 
  babies. This was complicated by the unexpected arrival of twin sons, Patrick 
  and Andrew, two years later. We had four sons under 31/2 years old! After
  this 
  we decided that the Catholic Church methods of contraception needed 
  assistance! Win was now able to practice, if only part time. This was very 
  difficult, in an era when &ldquo;women stayed home&rdquo;. Part-time positions
  required 
  a lot of talking, with promises to leave if she was not suitable (she was
  never 
  asked to leave).</p>
  <p>I was trying to obtain a position as pathologist at Port Moresby in Papua 
  New Guinea, which was then in the process of obtaining independence from 
  Australia. I thought I could obtain experience with some of the more exotic 
  and unusual diseases. However, this had to be done through the Department 
  of Foreign Affairs, and government red tape was extraordinarily slow. I was 
  working in my room one afternoon, when a thickset man with a strong 
  Germanic accent walked in and said, &ldquo;You are working with me next year.&rdquo; 
  and walked out. There was no chance for explanation or argument. I discovered 
  he was Professor Rolf ten Seldam, the Professor of Pathology at the 
  University of Western Australia and the Royal Perth Hospital. He was apparently 
  a man no one argued with, or at least not twice. So I gave the 
  Department of Foreign Affairs one day to settle the position in Papua and 
  when they failed to reply, I accepted the position in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
  <p><b>Perth<br>
  </b>We arrived in Perth in January 1968. In Melbourne, we had no
    trouble renting  a flat for the family. In Perth, there was nothing to rent,
    especially with  four children. We had little money and no experience of
    buying property.  Luckily, our first real estate agent was a good choice.
    He found us a good  house to buy and a rental property in the interim. What
    I had not realised  was that he told the owners that I was 'the new doctor
    at the Royal Perth' &ndash; 
  quite true, but the owner thought he meant the new medical superintendent,
   who had received a good deal of newspaper publicity, and not just the junior
   pathologist! Life quickly settled down.</p>
  <p>Pathology at the Royal Perth Hospital was totally different from 
  Melbourne. We went along at a much more leisurely pace, but with a much 
  more flexible timetable. We did less work, but it seemed to take longer to
  do 
  it. Perth was a small and isolated community. It has doubled in size over
  the 
  last 30 years, with a population now of over one million. These days, most 
  pathology training in Australia is in a single specialty. In Perth, this
  had always 
  been the case, perhaps because of a lack of positions for training, other
  than 
  haematology or morbid anatomy. Trainees were encouraged to keep the 
  same position. In contrast, the eastern states, with most of Australia's
  population 
  in one quarter of the continent, provided numerous training positions 
  in all branches of pathology. General training was considered to be the norm, 
  to give a broad base in all branches of pathology, before specialising in
  one 
  area, as I did. I think this helped me later when dealing with <i>Helicobacter</i>,
  but 
  it made me something of an oddity to my colleagues in Perth, who had all 
  specialised in their particular branch of pathology from the start, giving
  them 
  an in-depth knowledge on a narrow base.</p>
  <p>In 1970, our last child, Rebecca, was born, our first daughter. Since Win 
  only had sisters and I only had brothers, our knowledge of the difference
   between 
  boys and girls was strangely superficial. Somewhat to our surprise, with 
  no pushing from us, our daughter was quite different from the boys. Where 
  they enjoyed running around in the dirt and pulling things to pieces, she 
  would sit inside playing with dolls. After this, Win managed to get more
  work, 
  and became quite an experienced general practitioner. She decided to specialise 
  in psychiatry, and was accepted into the college training scheme, 
  which took most of her time into the early 1980s.</p>
  <p><b>Helicobacter<br>
  </b>During the 1970s, I wrote up a few interesting cases
    and developed an interest  in the new gastric biopsies that were becoming
    frequent. I also attempted to 
  develop improved bacterial stains for use with histological sections, as
  I 
  describe more completely in my Nobel lecture. Then, in 1979, on my 42nd 
  birthday, I noticed bacteria growing on the surface of a gastric biopsy.
  From 
  then on, my spare time was largely centred on the study of these bacteria.
     Over the next two years, I collected numerous examples and showed that 
  they were usually related to chronic gastritis, usually with the active change
     described by Richard Whitehead in 1972. I attempted, with some difficulty,
  to 
  obtain a negative control series, by collecting cases reported as normal
  gastric 
  biopsies. This was more difficult than I expected, because all gastric biopsies
     were coded the same, wherever they came from in the stomach. Almost all
     so-called normal biopsies were from the corpus. Normal biopsies from the
     gastric antrum were very rare, but I eventually found 20 examples, and none
     showed the bacteria. With this material available, I began to prepare a
    paper  for publication.</p>
  <p>In 1981, I met Barry Marshall, and we agreed to undertake a more complete
     clinico-pathological study. He could cover the clinical aspects and provide
     improved biopsies, specimens for culture, clinical history and endoscopy
     findings. This resulted in our papers of 1983 and 1984, linking the infection
     to duodenal ulcer and culturing a new organism. My letter to the Lancet
    in  1983 was a summary of the paper that I was preparing when I first met
    Barry  Marshall. After this Barry and I continued our association, but he
    moved to 
  the Fremantle Hospital. I was involved with the pathology related to several
     studies: Professor Goodwin, improving the accuracy of culture to diagnose
     the infection; Dr Ivor Surveyor, producing the breath test for diagnosis;
  and 
  doctors Marshall and Morris, attempting to fulfil Koch's postulates
  to demonstrate 
  that the bacteria was a pathogen.</p>
  <p>Winifred, who was much more literate than me, used to read our papers. 
  She was able to point out clich&eacute;s or excessive jargon, and suggest
  ways of making 
  the work more widely readable. Before I met Barry, Win was the only person 
  to accept my work and encourage me. Considering that much of this 
  work was done after hours or at home, thereby stealing her husband, she had 
  every right to be annoyed. Particularly as she was a doctor, and knew the
  standard teaching that nothing grows in the stomach, and therefore that I
  was trying 
  to prove the 'impossible.' As a psychiatrist, she could have
  suggested I was 
  mad. But she stood beside me and helped me when no one else would.</p>

  <p>My last major work was the pathology for a large study by Barry Marshall
    <i>et 
  al.</i> to show the effect of eradicating the bacteria on the relapse rate of
  duodenal 
  ulcer. The study extended over seven years. It clearly showed that, after 
  successful treatment of the infection, recurrence of peptic ulcer was rare; 
  otherwise, it was usual. For me, the study provided a wealth of material
  to 
  study the associated pathology. It soon became clear that active gastritis
  was 
  very closely related to the infection. Treatment of the infection produced
  a 
  very rapid and complete resolution of the active changes in the surface 
  epithelium. Other changes, including lymphoid infiltration of the stroma 
  and some epithelial changes, disappeared more slowly or not at all. The 
  active changes varied considerably. The classic severe changes described
  by 
  Whitehead were present in about 10 to 20% of cases. At the other end of the 
  spectrum, some biopsies showed only occasional single intraepithelial 
  polymorphs. These epithelial changes were almost absolutely related to the 
  infection. With experience, I found the same features in the mucosa from
  the 
  corpus, usually much more mild, superficial and focal than the antrum. 
  Finally, the duodenal ulcers seemed to be distal pyloric ulcers rather than 
  true duodenal ulcers. They appeared to arise in the distal pyloric mucosa,
  or 
  perhaps the gastroduodenal junction.</p>

  <p>By 1990, our findings began to be recognised by the medical community. 
  We started to receive increasing numbers of honours and requests for attendances
   at meetings and lectures. It had been an interesting decade. After our 
  initial publications in 1983&ndash;84, a wealth of further studies appeared,
  most of 
  them apparently just repeating our work, with similar results. No one proved 
  we were wrong. Yet in spite of this, no one but patients and local general
  practitioners 
  appeared to believe our findings. Many patients demanded treatment, 
  and some GPs were very keen to treat them. Otherwise, it seemed that 
  only our wives stood beside us.</p>
  <p>In 1996, I was invited to Japan for a lecture tour. The following year,
  a 
  three-month tour of Germany and adjacent countries was arranged by 
  Manfred Stolte and Hansj&ouml;rg Meyer. This provided us with some real recognition 
  for our work, and it seemed the fighting was over. The tour was a wonderful 
  working holiday for Win and me. However, soon after our return, Win 
  experienced difficulty eating, and investigation showed duodenal obstruction 
  due to an inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Win gradually deteriorated and 
  died four months later. After spending this time caring for her, I decided
  the 
  time had come to retire.</p>

  <p>At first, I spent most of my time trying to return to my hobby, photography. 
  I intended to print my own pictures, using today's improved digital
  technology. 
  The early results were interesting, although more complicated than I had 
  expected. Digital pictures only provide a narrow band of information. Only 
  256 tones are available for each colour. Outside this range is either total
  black 
  or total white, with no information. This is quite unlike photographic film, 
  which shows a flattening of the curve at each end of the tonal range, with
  an 
  almost continuous variation still present in light and dark areas. I had
  to put 
  this project aside to try and digitise all my old publications, microphotographs 
  and other works, since I was receiving many requests for them. Now 
  I have to put that aside, because the Nobel Prize has brought a stream of
  requests 
  for my presence at meetings and presentations.</p>
