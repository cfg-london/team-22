  <h1>Gertrude B. Elion - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="elion.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in New York City on a cold
  January night when the water pipes in our apartment froze and
  burst. Fortunately, my mother was in the hospital rather than at
  home at the time. My father emigrated from Lithuania to the
  United States at the age of 12. He received his higher education
  in New York City and graduated in 1914 from the New York
  University School of Dentistry. My mother came at the age of 14
  from a part of Russia which, after the war, became Poland; she
  was only 19 when she was married to my father. My first seven
  years were spent in a large apartment in Manhattan where my
  father had his dental office, with our living quarters adjoining
  it.<br>
  <br>
  My brother was born about six years after I was, and shortly
  thereafter we moved to the Bronx, which was then considered a
  suburb of New York City. There were still many open lots where
  children could play and large parks, including the Bronx Zoo, to
  which I was very much devoted. My brother and I had a happy
  childhood. We went to a public school within walking distance of
  our house. Our classrooms were generally quite crowded, but we
  received a good basic education.<br>
  <br>
  I was a child with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and
  remember enjoying all of my courses almost equally. When it came
  time at the end of my high school career to choose a major in
  which to specialize I was in a quandary. One of the deciding
  factors may have been that my grandfather, whom I loved dearly,
  died of cancer when I was 15. I was highly motivated to do
  something that might eventually lead to a cure for this terrible
  disease. When I entered Hunter College in 1933, I decided to
  major in science and, in particular, chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  By this time my father was not financially well-off since he,
  like many others, had invested heavily in the stock market, and
  in the crash of 1929 had gone into bankruptcy. Fortunately, he
  still had his profession and his loyal patients. Had it not been
  that Hunter
  College was a free college, and that my grades were good
  enough for me to enter it, I suspect I might never have received
  a higher education. My brother also was able to take advantage of
  a free higher education, going to the College of the City of New
  York where he studied physics and engineering.<br>
  <br>
  I remember my school days as being very challenging and full of
  good comradery among the students. It was an all-girls school and
  I think many of our teachers were uncertain whether most of us
  would really go on with our careers. As a matter of fact, many of
  the girls went on to become teachers and some went into
  scientific research. Because of the depression, it was not
  possible for me to go on to graduate school, although I did apply
  to a number of universities with the hope of getting an
  assistantship or fellowship.<br>
  <br>
  Jobs were scarce and the few positions that existed in
  laboratories were not available to women. I did get a three-month
  job teaching biochemistry to nurses in the New York Hospital
  School of Nursing. Unfortunately, because of the trimester
  system, the same job would not have been available again for nine
  months. By chance, I met a chemist who was looking for a
  laboratory assistant. Although he was unable to pay me any salary
  at that time, I decided that the experience would be worthwhile.
  I stayed there for a year and a half and was finally making the
  magnificent sum of $20 a week. By then I had saved some money
  and, with help from my parents, entered graduate school at
  New York
  University in the fall of 1939. I was the only female in my
  graduate chemistry class but no one seemed to mind, and I did not
  consider it at all strange.<br>
  <br>
  After a year of graduate studies I had finished all the required
  courses but now needed to do the research work for my Master's
  degree. During this period, I took a job as a teacher-in-training
  and then as a substitute teacher in the New York City secondary
  schools, teaching chemistry, physics and general science for two
  years. In the meantime, I did my research work at night and on
  week-ends at New York University, and obtained my Master of
  Science degree in chemistry in 1941.<br>
  <br>
  By this time, World War II had begun and there was a shortage of
  chemists in industrial laboratories. Although I was finally able
  to get a job in a laboratory, it was not in research. I did
  analytical quality control work for a major food company. After a
  year and a half, during which I learned a good deal about
  instrumentation, I became restless because the work was so
  repetitive and I was no longer learning anything. I applied to
  employment agencies for a research job, and was chosen to go to a
  laboratory at Johnson and Johnson in New Jersey. Unfortunately,
  that laboratory was disbanded after about six months. At that
  time I was offered a number of positions in research laboratories
  but the one which intrigued me most was a position as assistant
  to <a href="index.html">George Hitchings</a>. My thirst for
  knowledge stood me in good stead in that laboratory, because Dr.
  Hitchings permitted me to learn as rapidly as I could and to take
  on more and more responsibility when I was ready for it. From
  being solely an organic chemist, I soon became very much involved
  in microbiology and in the biological activities of the compounds
  I was synthesizing. I never felt constrained to remain strictly
  in chemistry, but was able to broaden my horizons into
  biochemistry, pharmacology, immunology, and eventually
  virology.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, I was eager to get my doctorate degree and
  began to go to school at night at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.
  After several years of long range commuting, I was informed that
  I would no longer be able to continue my doctorate on a part-time
  basis, but would need to give up my job and go to school
  full-time. I made what was then a critical decision in my life,
  to stay with my job and give up the pursuit of a doctorate. Years
  later, when I received three honorary doctorate degrees from
  George Washington University, Brown University and the University
  of Michigan, I decided that perhaps that decision had been the
  right one after all. Unfortunately, neither of my parents lived
  to see this recognition.<br>
  <br>
  The work became fascinating almost from the very beginning. We
  were exploring new frontiers, since very little was known about
  nucleic acid biosynthesis or the enzymes involved with it. I had
  been assigned quite early to work on the purines and, with the
  exception of a few deviations into the pteridines and into some
  other condensed pyrimidine systems, the remainder of my work
  concentrated almost completely on the purines. Each series of
  studies was like a mystery story in that we were constantly
  trying to deduce what the microbiological results meant, with
  little biochemical information to help us. Then, in the
  mid-1950's came the work of Greenberg, Buchanan, <a href=
  "../1959/index.html">Kornberg</a> and others which elucidated the
  pathways for the biosynthesis and utilization of purines, and
  many of our findings began to fall into place. When we began to
  see the results of our efforts in the form of new drugs which
  filled real medical needs and benefited patients in very visible
  ways, our feeling of reward was immeasurable.<br>
  <br>
  Over the years, my work became both my vocation and avocation.
  Since I enjoyed it so much, I never felt a great need to go
  outside for relaxation. Nevertheless, I became an avid
  photographer and traveler. Possibly my love for travel stems from
  the early years when my family seldom went away on vacation.
  Thus, my curiosity about the rest of the world did not begin to
  be satisfied until I began to travel. I have traveled fairly
  widely over the world, but there still remain many places for me
  to explore. Another major interest is music, not because I am
  musically talented, but because I love to listen to it. I am an
  opera lover and have been a subscriber to the Metropolitan Opera
  for over 40 years. I also enjoy concerts, ballet and
  theater.<br>
  <br>
  Although I never married, my brother fortunately did, and I have
  had the pleasure of watching his three sons and daughter grow up.
  Several of them now have children of their own. We have been a
  close-knit family, although often separated by distance, and have
  shared each other's happiness, sorrows, and aspirations.<br>
  <br>
  In my professional career I was promoted frequently, and in 1967
  I was appointed Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy, a
  position which I held until I retired in 1983. This department
  was sometimes termed by some of my colleagues a "mini-institute"
  since it contained sections of chemistry, enzymology,
  pharmacology, immunology and virology, as well as a tissue
  culture laboratory. This made it possible to coordinate our work
  and cooperate in a manner that was extremely useful for
  development of new drugs.<br>
  <br>
  I have been associated with the National Cancer Institute in many capacities,
  from 1960 when I served on one of its study sections, to serving
  later on a number of its advisory committees and the Board of
  Scientific Counselors for the Division of Cancer Treatment, and
  most recently as a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board.
  I have taken an active part in the American Association for
  Cancer Research, serving on its Board of Directors, its program
  committees, and in 1983 - 84 as its President. In addition, I
  have served on Advisory Committees for the American Cancer
  Society, the Leukemia Society of America, and a number of
  committees for the Tropical Disease Research division of the
  World Health Organization, currently serving as Chairman of the
  Steering Committee on the Chemotherapy of Malaria. I am a member
  of the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry,
  the Transplantation Society, the American Society of Biological
  Chemists, the American Society of Pharmacology and Experimental
  Therapeutics, the American Association for Cancer Research, the
  American Society of Hematology, the American Association for the
  Advancement of Science, the American Association of
  Pharmaceutical Scientists, and am a Fellow of the New York
  Academy of Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  After my official retirement as Department Head from Burroughs
  Wellcome, I have remained there as a Scientist Emeritus and
  Consultant, and have tried to take an active part in the
  discussions, seminars and staff meetings relating to research. In
  addition, I have become a Research Professor of Medicine and
  Pharmacology at Duke University and each year work with one
  third-year medical student who wishes to do research in the areas
  of tumor biochemistry and pharmacology. This has been a very
  stimulating experience and one that I hope to continue for some
  time to come. I serve on a number of editorial boards and
  continue to lecture and write. In a sense, my career appears to
  have come full circle from my early days of being a teacher to
  now sharing my experience in research with the new generations of
  scientists.</p>
