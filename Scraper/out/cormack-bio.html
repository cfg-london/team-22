  <h1>Allan M. Cormack - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cormack.jpg" class="bio-img"> My parents
  went from the north of Scotland to South Africa shortly before
  World War I. My mother had been a teacher and my father was an
  engineer with the Post Office. I was born in Johannesburg in
  1924, the youngest of three children. My family moved around the
  country quite a lot, as did the families of many civil servants,
  but after my father's death in 1936 we settled in Cape Town.
  There I attended the Rondebosch Boys High School and my interests
  outside my academic work were debating, tennis, and to a lesser
  extent, acting. I became intensely interested in astronomy and
  devoured the popular works of astronomers such as Sir Arthur
  Eddington and Sir James Jeans, from which I learnt that a
  knowledge of mathematics and physics was essential to the pursuit
  of astronomy. This increased my fondness for those
  subjects.<br>
  <br>
  At that time the prospects for making a living as an astronomer
  were not good, so on going to the University of Cape Town, I followed in the
  footsteps of my father and brother and started to study
  electrical engineering. I was fortunate in that a new engineering
  curriculum had just been introduced by the then Head of the
  Electrical Engineering Department, Professor B. L. Goodlet. While
  serving with Mountbatten in the Far East he had seen the value
  for engineering of a better grounding in physics and mathematics
  than had previously been the case, and the new curriculum
  contained a lot of physics and mathematics. After a couple of
  years I abandoned engineering and turned to physics. At the
  University of Cape Town I spent most of my spare time
  mountaineering either on Table Mountain which was almost our back
  yard, or on the lovely mountain ranges of the Western Cape
  Province, and what spare time was not spent on climbing was spent
  listening to music.<br>
  <br>
  After completing my Bachelor and Masters degrees at Cape Town I
  went to St.
  John's College, Cambridge, as a Research Student. I worked at
  the Cavendish
  Laboratory under Prof. Otto Frisch on problems connected with
  He<sup>6</sup>. While I made some progress on these problems I
  did not complete them because of the following circumstances. I
  had met an American girl, Barbara Seavey, in Dirac's lectures on
  quantum mechanics, and a year and a half later I wanted to marry
  her, but I was broke. An inquiry at the Physics Department at
  Cape Town elicited not only the information that there was a
  vacancy there, but also a telegram offering me a position as
  Lecturer. So in 1950 I returned to Cape Town with a bride but no
  cyclotron, and so no further work on He<sup>6</sup>.<br>
  <br>
  Working on nuclear physics in Cape Town was lonely because there
  were very few nuclear physicists in the country, and the nearest
  one was six hundred miles away. However Professor R. W. James,
  head of the Physics Department and my mentor as a student, gave
  me my head and I learnt a lot and published a few papers. In 1956
  I by chance became interested in a problem that is now known as
  CAT-scanning, but that story will be told elsewhere in this
  volume.<br>
  <br>
  On my first Sabbatical leave it seemed only reasonable that since
  my wife had willingly come out to the wilds of Africa with me
  that I should go to the wilds of America with her. In addition
  the United States was a very good place to do research, and
  Harvard was
  a particularly good place to be in, so I spent my Sabbatical at
  the Harvard cyclotron doing experiments on nucleon-nucleon
  scattering with Professors Norman Ransey and Richard Wilson and
  then graduate student Joseph Palmieri. This was the beginning of
  a long and happy association with the people at the Harvard
  Cyclotron amongst whom I must mention particularly its present
  Director, Andreas Koehler.<br>
  <br>
  While on this Sabbatical leave I was offered a position at
  Tufts
  University by the then Chairman of the Physics Department,
  Professor Julian K. Knipp. I accepted the offer and, except for a
  brief return to South Africa and a couple of Sabbatical leaves, I
  have been there ever since, progressing up the academic ladder
  and being Chairman of the Physics Department from 1968 to 1976.
  My main interest for most of this time was in nuclear and
  particle physics and I pursued the CT-scanning problem only
  intermittently, when time permitted. In 1963 and 1964 I published
  the results of this work, but as there was practically no
  response I continued my normal course of research and teaching.
  In the period 1970-72, I became aware of a number of developments
  in, or related to CT-scanning, and since then I have devoted much
  of my time to these problems.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from a little swimming and sailing in the summer, I lead a
  rather sedentary life, spending a lot of time reading. Since my
  first discussions of ecological problems with Professor John Day
  around 1950 and since reading <a href="../1973/index.html">Konrad
  Lorenz's</a> "King Solomon's Ring", I have become increasingly
  interested in the study of animals for what they might teach us
  about man, and the study of man as an animal. I have become
  increasingly disenchanted with what the thinkers of the so-called
  Age of Enlightenment tell us about the nature of man, and with
  what the formal religions and doctrinaire political theorists
  tell us about the same subject. I recently read Edward Wilson's
  book "On Human Nature", and after this hectic two months of my
  life culminates in Nobel Week, I look forward to tackling his
  "Sociobiology".<br>
  <br>
  My wife and I have three children - Margaret, Jean and Robert.
  Since 1957 we have lived in the town of Winchester, Mass. which I
  appreciate for still being governed by that unique New England
  experiment in democracy: a (limited) Town Meeting and a Board of
  Selectmen. We enjoy the amenities of New England, particularly
  summers near, in, and on Lake Winnepesaukee, New Hampshire.</p>
