  <h1>Alan L. Hodgkin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hodgkin.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Alan Lloyd Hodgkin</b> was born in
  Banbury, Oxfordshire, on February 5th, 1914. His parents were
  George Hodgkin (who died in Baghdad in 1918) and Mary (Wilson)
  Hodgkin, now Mrs. Lionel Smith. Alan Lloyd Hodgkin was educated
  at the Downs School, Malvern (1923-1927), Greshams School, Holt
  (1927-1932), and Trinity College, Cambridge (1932-1936). His
  grandfather, Thomas Hodgkin, and uncle, Robin Hodgkin, were
  historians and to begin with Alan hesitated between history and
  science. However, he was strongly interested in natural history
  and that decided him to take up biology and chemistry. After he
  had become a scholar at Trinity, his future zoology teacher, Carl
  Pantin, advised him to learn as much mathematics and physics as
  he could. This was good, if painful, advice which has kept him
  busy ever since. As an undergraduate he started some rather
  amateur experiments on frog nerve and continued this line for
  several years, first as a research scholar and later as a fellow
  of Trinity. At that period the high table of Trinity included an
  astonishing array of scientific talent, and Hodgkin found it
  inspiring if sometimes daunting to meet people like <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/index.html">J. J. Thomson</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Rutherford</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1922/index.html">Aston</a>, Eddington,
  <a href="../1929/index.html">Hopkins</a>, G. H. Hardy and
  <a href="../1932/index.html">Adrian</a>. In the Physiological
  Laboratory he learnt about cable-theory from Rushton and about
  amplifiers from Matthews, Grey Walter and Rawdon-Smith.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="../1922/index.html">A. V. Hill</a>, who refereed his
  fellowship thesis, had lent a copy to <a href=
  "../1944/index.html">Gasser</a> and this resulted in an
  invitation to work in the latter's laboratory at the Rockefeller
  Institute in New York. During that period (1937-1938) Hodgkin
  spent several weeks with K. S. Cole at Woods Hole and there he
  learnt how to dissect squid axons. He returned to Cambridge in
  1938 and in the following year started a collaboration with
  <a href="index.html">A. F. Huxley</a>, whom he had the good
  fortune to teach.<br>
  <br>
  During the first few months of the war Hodgkin worked on aviation
  medicine with Matthews at Farnborough and from February 1940 to
  July 1945 in various parts of England on airborne radar. The
  project with which he was most concerned was the development of a
  scanning and display system for a 10-cm detection system in
  night-fighters.<br>
  <br>
  After the war Hodgkin returned to Cambridge where he held a
  teaching post in the Physiology Laboratory; A. F. Huxley returned
  a few months later and they continued the collaboration which
  started before the war. R. D. Keynes joined them a year later and
  there was soon a small group interested in ionic mechanisms in
  living cells. Lord Adrian greatly assisted the progress, partly
  by lightening the teaching load and partly by arranging with the
  Rockefeller
  Foundation for a generous grant to support the work; later
  help was received from other bodies, particularly the Nuffield
  Foundation and the Royal Society. Most of the experiments on giant
  nerve fibres had to be done at a Marine Station, and since 1947
  Hodgkin has usually spent two or three months each year at the
  Laboratory of
  the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth, where he has
  received much help from the director and the staff of that
  laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Hodgkin was elected to a fellowship of the Royal
  Society in 1948 and in 1951 became a Foulerton Research Professor
  of the Royal Society. He served on the Royal Society Council from
  1958-1960 and on the Medical Research Council from 1959-1963; he was
  foreign secretary of the Physiological Society from 1961-1967. In 1970 he was
  appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics. He has
  been President of the Marine Biological Association since 1966, and
  President of the Royal Society since December 1970. In 1971 he
  was appointed Chancellor of Leicester University.<br>
  <br>
  Among the honours and awards which have been given to Prof.
  Hodgkin the following might be mentioned: Royal Medal of the
  Royal Society, 1958; Copley Medal of the Royal Society, 1965;
  Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, 1964; Foreign
  Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the
  American Philosophical Society; Member of the
  Deutsche Akademie &laquo;Leopoldina&raquo; Honorary
  Fellow, Indian National Science Academy; Hon. M. D. of the
  Universities of Berne and Louvain; Hon. D.Sc. of the universities of Sheffield, Newcastle, E. Anglia, Manchester, Leicester
  and London.
  He was made a KBE in the New Years' Honours 1972.<br>
  <br>
  While at the Rockefeller Institute in 1938 Hodgkin met <a href=
  "../1966/index.html">Peyton Rous</a>, the distinguished
  pathologist, and he got to know his family. His daughter, Marion
  Rous, and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin were married in 1944, while he was
  on a brief war-time visit to America. They have lived in
  Cambridge since 1945 and have three daughters and one son. Mrs.
  M. R. Hodgkin is Children's Book Editor at Macmillan Publishing
  Company. His eldest daughter, Sarah (Mrs. R. Hayes), is married
  and has worked in publishing with Gollancz Ltd. His second
  daughter, Deborah, is a research student in Psychology at
  University
  College London. His son, Jonathan works in Molecular Biology
  at Cambridge, and his youngest daughter, Rachel, is also at
  Cambridge reading English.<br>
