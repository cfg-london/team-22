  <h1>Edward Tatum - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="tatum.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Edward Lawrie Tatum</b> was born on
  December 14th, 1909, at Boulder, Colorado, U.S.A. He was the
  eldest son of Arthur Lawrie Tatum, Professor of Pharmacology at
  the University of Wisconsin Medical School, and Mabel
  Webb Tatum. After the death of his mother, his father married the
  former Celia Harriman.<br>
  <br>
  Tatum was educated at the University of Chicago and Wisconsin, taking
  his A.B. degree in Chemistry in 1931, his M.S. degree in
  Microbiology in 1932 and his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry in
  1934. For the Ph.D. degree his thesis was on work on the
  nutrition and metabolism of bacteria which he had done under the
  direction of Edwin Broun Fred and William Harold Peterson. This
  work no doubt laid the foundations of his later work with
  <a href="index.html">George Wells Beadle</a>, which was to earn
  for their book, in 1958, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
  Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  After taking his doctor's degree, Tatum studied for a year at the
  University of Wisconsin and then was awarded a General Education
  Fellowship at the University of Utrecht, Holland. He then joined
  the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford
  University, California, where he was Research Associate from
  1937 until 1941, and Assistant Professor from 1941 until 1945.
  From 1945 until 1948 he was successively Assistant Professor of
  Botany and Professor of Microbiology at Yale University. In
  1948 he returned to Stanford University as Professor of Biology
  and later became Professor of Biochemistry there. It was during
  this period of his life and work at Stanford University that he
  collaborated with George Wells Beadle, who was Professor of
  Biology (Genetics) at that University until 1946.<br>
  <br>
  Tatum's research has been concerned primarily with the
  biochemistry, nutrition and genetics of microorganisms and of the
  fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. During his fruitful
  collaboration with George Wells Beadle he took charge of the
  chemical aspects of their joint work on the genetics of
  eye-colour in <i>Drosophila</i> and, when he and Beadle decided
  to give up their work on <i>Drosophila</i> and to work instead
  with the fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, it was Tatum who
  discovered that biotin was necessary for the successful
  cultivation of this fungus on simple inorganic media and thus
  provided these two workers with the genetic material that they
  needed for the work which gained them, together with <a href=
  "index.html">Joshua Lederberg</a>, the Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  In 1953, he received the Remsen Award of the American Chemical
  Society. He is a member of the Advisory Committee of the National Foundation and
  has served on research advisory panels of the American Committee
  of the National Research Council on Growth. He also served for 10
  years on the Editorial Board of the <i>Journal of Biological
  Chemistry</i>. He is now a member of the Editorial Board of
  <i>Science</i> and of <i>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Tatum is married to Viola Kantor. He has two daughters, Margaret
  and Barbara, born to him and his first wife, June Alton.</p>
