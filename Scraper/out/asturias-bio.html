  <h1>Miguel Angel Asturias - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="asturias.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Miguel Angel Asturias</b> (1899-1974)
  was born in Guatemala and spent his childhood and adolescence in
  his native country. He studied for his baccalaureate at the state
  high school and later took a law degree at the University of San
  Carlos. His thesis on "The Social Problem of the Indian" was
  published in 1923.<br>
  <br>
  After he finished his law studies, he founded with fellow
  students the Popular University of Guatemala, whose aim was to
  offer courses to those who could not afford to attend the
  national university. In 1923 he left for Europe, intending to
  study political economy in England. He spent a few months in
  London and then went to Paris, where he was to stay for ten
  years. At the Sorbonne he attended the lectures on the religions
  of the Mayas by Professor Georges Raynaud, whose disciple he
  became. Also, as correspondent for several important Latin
  American newspapers, he travelled in all the Western European
  countries, in the Middle East, in Greece, and in Egypt.<br>
  <br>
  In 1928 Asturias returned for a short time to Guatemala, where he
  lectured at the Popular University. These lecture were collected
  in a volume entitled <i>La arquitectura de la vida nueva</i>
  (Architecture of the New Life), 1928. He then went back to Paris,
  where he finished his <i>Leyendas de Guatemala</i> (Legends of
  Guatemala), 1930. Published in Madrid, the book was translated
  into French by Francis de Miomandre, who sent his translation to
  Paul Val&eacute;ry. The French poet was greatly impressed, and his
  letter to Miomandre was used as the preface to the 1931 edition
  published in the <i>Cahiers du Sud</i> series. The same year,
  <i>Leyendas de Guatemala</i> received the Silla Monsegur Prize, a
  reward for the best Spanish-American book published in
  France.<br>
  <br>
  During his stay in Paris from 1923 to 1933, Asturias wrote his
  novel <i>El Se&ntilde;or Presidente</i> (The President), which
  slashed at the social evil and malignant corruption to which an
  insensitive dictator dooms his people. Because of its political
  implications Asturias was unable to bring the book with him when,
  in 1933, he returned to Guatemala, which at the time was ruled by
  the dictator Jorge Ubico. The original version was to remain
  unpublished for thirteen years. The fall of Ubico's regime in
  1944 brought to the presidency Professor Juan Jos&eacute;
  Ar&eacute;valo, who immediately appointed Asturias cultural
  attach&eacute; to the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico, where the first
  edition of <i>El Se&ntilde;or Presidente</i> appeared in
  1946.<br>
  <br>
  In late 1947, Asturias went to Argentina as cultural attach&eacute;
  to the Guatemalan Embassy and, two years later, obtained a
  ministerial post. While in Buenos Aires, he published <i>Sien de
  alondra</i> (Temple of the Lark), 1949, an anthology of his poems
  written between 1918 and 1948. In 1948 he returned to Guatemala
  for a few months, during which time he wrote his novel <i>Viento
  fuerte</i> (Strong Wind), 1950, an indictment of the effect of
  North American imperialism on the economic realities of his
  country. That same year, the second edition of <i>El Se&ntilde;or
  Presidente</i> was published in Buenos Aires.<br>
  <br>
  When the government of President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman fell in
  1954, Asturias went into exile in Argentina, his wife's native
  country, where he remained until 1962. A year later, the
  Argentine publisher Losada brought out his novel <i>Mulata de
  tal</i> (Mulata). This story, a surrealistic blend of Indian
  legends, tells of a peasant whose greed and lust consign him to a
  dark belief in material power from which, Asturias warns us,
  there is only one hope for salvation: universal love.<br>
  <br>
  In 1966 Asturias was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. In the same
  year, he was appointed the Guatemalan ambassador to France by
  President Julio Mendez Montenegro.</p>
