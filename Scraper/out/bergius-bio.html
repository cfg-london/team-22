  <h1>Friedrich Bergius - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bergius.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Friedrich Bergius</b> was born on
  October 11, 1884, in Goldschmieden near Breslau, Silesia. He
  belonged to an old respected family of scientists, theologians,
  civil servants, army officers, and business men. His grandfather
  was Professor of Economics in Breslau and his father owned a
  chemical factory in Goldschmieden.<br>
  <br>
  Bergius was educated in Breslau and whilst still at school took
  great interest in his father's factory where he was able to study
  various working methods under the guidance of his father and thus
  became acquainted with chemicotechnical processes. The time spent
  in the laboratories and the works there later stood him in good
  stead, as already at a very early age he obtained considerable
  insight into industrial as well as scientific matters.<br>
  <br>
  Before entering University, Bergius was sent to the Ruhr for six
  months by his father, where he studied the practical aspects of a
  large metallurgical plant and profited greatly by this
  experience.<br>
  <br>
  In 1903 he entered Breslau University to read chemistry under
  Ladenburg, Abegg and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1925/index.html">Herz</a>; after doing one
  year's military service he proceeded to Leipzig
  University in 1905 and worked under Hantzsch on his thesis
  <i>&Uuml;ber absolute Schwefels&auml;ure als
  L&ouml;sungsmittel</i> (On absolute sulphuric acid as a solvent).
  This work was completed in Breslau under Abegg, and Bergius
  received his degree at Leipzig in 1907. The lively scientific
  atmosphere in the laboratories of Hantzsch and Abegg induced
  Bergius to devote himself to a career in scientific research; for
  this reason he worked for two further terms at <a href=
  "../1920/index.html">Nernst</a>'s Institute in Berlin and then
  went to Karlsruhe to study under <a href=
  "../1918/index.html">Haber</a> for one term in 1909.<br>
  <br>
  The work which was being carried out there on the chemical
  equilibrium in gas reactions, in particular that on the synthesis
  of ammonia, prompted his own research in Hanover in 1909. He
  started with a detailed investigation on the dissociation of
  calcium peroxide and developed a practical method for laboratory
  work at pressures up to 300 atmospheres.<br>
  <br>
  The equipment available in the laboratories of the Technische
  Hochschule in Hanover soon proved insufficient and in1910 Bergius
  established his own private laboratory in Hanover, which was
  gradually extended by several workshops and plants, and where he
  employed a number of collaborators. The most important result of
  his research was the hydrogenating effect of hydrogen on coal and
  heavy oils under high pressure, in 1912 and 1913.<br>
  <br>
  It was not easy to obtain the means for maintaining this
  laboratory, especially as the scale of the experiments had to be
  enlarged in order to apply the laboratory methods to a small
  industrial scale. Therefore in 1914 Bergius accepted an offer
  made already previously by Dr. Karl Goldschmidt to transfer his
  laboratory to the Essen works of the firm Th. Goldschmidt A.G.;
  shortly afterwards he also accepted an executive position in this
  firm.<br>
  <br>
  For a short time in 1911 Bergius lectured on technical gas
  reactions, equilibrium theory, and metallurgy at the Technische
  Hochschule in Hanover. However, the outbreak of the First World
  War and the increased rate of work on the problem of liquefaction
  of coal made it impossible for him to continue with his teaching
  activity. From 1914 to 1921 he lived in Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  A comparatively large industrial plant for the technical
  development of the hydrogenating process was set up in Rheinau
  near Mannheim. It was soon found that the scope of this research
  work was too large for one firm alone and after the end of the
  war Bergius endeavoured to find firms suitable for collaborating
  in the development of hydrogenation. Apart from groups of German
  companies, he also induced the Shell Trust and a number of
  British enterprises, in particular the coal industry, to
  collaborate with him. However, in critical times he still had to
  bear the whole responsibility and risk for the further
  development of the process. Finally, in 1927, he was able to
  conclude his own work on the liquefaction of coal, after the
  practical possibilities had been proved on a large scale. The
  I.G. Farbenindustrie and Imperial Chemical Industries then took
  up the work on an industrial scale.<br>
  <br>
  From that time onwards Bergius devoted himself to a process of
  obtaining sugar from cellulose in wood, on which he had already
  worked during the First World War. He succeeded after 15 years'
  work and an industrial plant was set up, also in the Rheinau
  works. It is amazing with what intensity Bergius took up the
  second part of his life's work, namely this hydrolysis of
  cellulose in wood and similar substances to sugar. It seems as if
  the well-known difficulties of working with highly concentrated
  hydrochloric acid had presented a special challenge to Bergius.
  Initially the process was taken up only in England and only
  during the thirties did Bergius manage to continue these
  experiments in Germany; his main concern was to rationalize the
  process and to ensure complete recovery of the hydrochloric acid
  used by constructing intricate devices. In 1921 he moved to
  Heidelberg, in order to be near his technical work in
  Mannheim-Rheinau, and at the same time to be in contact with
  Heidelberg University.<br>
  <br>
  His home was international, and always full of mentally alive
  people. He had done great work and had received most of the
  honours possible during the eventful epoch of his lifetime. He
  received the degree of Dr. Phil. from the University of
  Heidelberg and the honorary doctorate from the University of
  Hanover; he was awarded the Liebig Medal and was elected to
  the Board of Directors of many associations and companies
  interested in coal and oil. In 1931 he shared the Nobel Prize
  with Carl Bosch for their contributions to the invention and
  development of chemical high-pressure methods.<br>
  <br>
  After the last war it was impossible for Bergius to find a field
  of work in Germany which would have done justice to his
  abilities. He emigrated to the Argentine, where death put an end
  to his eventful career in Buenos Aires in 1949.</p>
