  <h1>Ilya Prigogine - Biographical</h1>

  <p class="smalltext"><i>Translation from the French
  text</i></p>

<p><img src="prigogine.jpg" class="bio-img">In his memorable series <i>"Etudes sur le
  temps humain"</i>, Georges Poulet devoted one volume to the
  <i>"Mesure de l'instant"</i>.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> There
  he proposed a classification of authors according to the
  importance they give to the past, present and future. I believe
  that in such a typology my position would be an extreme one, as I
  live mostly in the future. And thus it is not too easy a task to
  write this autobiographical account, to which I would like to
  give a personal tone. But the present explains the past.<br>
  <br>
  In my Nobel Lecture, I speak much about fluctuations; maybe this
  is not unrelated to the fact that during my life I felt the
  efficacy of striking coincidences whose cumulative effects are to
  be seen in my scientific work.<br>
  <br>
  I was born in Moscow, on the 25th of January, 1917 - a few months
  before the revolution. My family had a difficult relationship
  with the new regime, and so we left Russia as early as 1921. For
  some years (until 1929), we lived as migrants in Germany, before
  we stayed for good in Belgium. It was at Brussels that I attended
  secondary school and university. I acquired Belgian nationality
  in 1949.<br>
  <br>
  My father, Roman Prigogine, who died in 1974, was a chemical
  engineer from the Moscow Polytechnic. My brother Alexander, who
  was born four years before me, followed, as I did myself, the
  curriculum of chemistry at the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles. I
  remember how much I hesitated before choosing this direction; as
  I left the classical (Greco-Latin) section of Ixelles Athenaeum,
  my interest was more focused on history and archaeology, not to
  mention music, especially piano. According to my mother, I was
  able to read musical scores before I read printed words. And,
  today, my favourite pastime is still piano playing, although my
  free time for practice is becoming more and more
  restricted.<br>
  <br>
  Since my adolescence, I have read many philosophical texts, and I
  still remember the spell <i>"L'&eacute;volution cr&eacute;atrice"</i>
  cast on me. More specifically, I felt that some essential message
  was embedded, still to be made explicit, in <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1927/index.html">Bergson</a>'s
  remark:<br>
  <br>
  "The more deeply we study the nature of time, the better we
  understand that duration means invention, creation of forms,
  continuous elaboration of the absolutely new."<br>
  <br>
  Fortunate coincidences made the choice for my studies at the
  university. Indeed, they led me to an almost opposite direction,
  towards chemistry and physics. And so, in 1941, I was conferred
  my first doctoral degree. Very soon, two of my teachers were to
  exert an enduring influence on the orientation of my future
  work.<br>
  <br>
  I would first mention Th&eacute;ophile De Donder
  (1873-1957).<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> What an amiable
  character he was! Born the son of an elementary school teacher,
  he began his career in the same way, and was (in 1896) conferred
  the degree of Doctor of Physical Science, without having ever
  followed any teaching at the university.<br>
  <br>
  It was only in 1918 - he was then 45 years old - that De Donder
  could devote his time to superior teaching, after he was for some
  years appointed as a secondary school teacher. He was then
  promoted to professor at the Department of Applied Science, and
  began without delay the writing of a course on theoretical
  thermodynamics for engineers.<br>
  <br>
  Allow me to give you some more details, as it is with this very
  circumstance that we have to associate the birth of the Brussels
  thermodynamics school.<br>
  <br>
  In order to understand fully the originality of De Donder's
  approach, I have to recall that since the fundamental work by
  Clausius, the second principle of thermodynamics has been
  formulated as an inequality: "uncompensated heat" is positive -
  or, in more recent terms, entropy production is positive. This
  inequality refers, of course, to phenomena that are
  <i>irreversible</i>, as are any natural processes. In those
  times, these latter were poorly understood. They appeared to
  engineers and physico-chemists as "parasitic" phenomena, which
  could only hinder something: here the productivity of a process,
  there the regular growth of a crystal, without presenting any
  intrinsic interest. So, the usual approach was to limit the study
  of thermodynamics to the understanding of equilibrium laws, for
  which entropy production is zero.<br>
  <br>
  This could only make thermodynamics a "thermostatics". In this
  context, the great merit of De Donder was that he extracted the
  entropy production out of this "sfumato" when related it in a
  precise way to the pace of a chemical reaction, through the use
  of a new function that he was to call "affinity".<sup><a href=
  "#3">3</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  It is difficult today to give an account of the hostility that
  such an approach was to meet. For example, I remember that
  towards the end of 1946, at the Brussels IUPAP
  meeting,<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> after a presentation of the
  thermodynamics of irreversible processes, a specialist of great
  repute said to me, in substance: "I am surprised that you give
  more attention to irreversible phenomena, which are essentially
  transitory, than to the final result of their evolution,
  equilibrium."<br>
  <br>
  Fortunately, some eminent scientists derogated this negative
  attitude. I received much support from people such as Edmond
  Bauer, the successor to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1926/index.html">Jean Perrin</a> at Paris,
  and Hendrik Kramers in Leyden.<br>
  <br>
  De Donder, of course, had precursors, especially in the French
  thermodynamics school of Pierre Duhem. But in the study of
  chemical thermodynamics, De Donder went further, and he gave a
  new formulation of the second principle, based on such concepts
  as affinity and degree of evolution of a reaction, considered as
  a chemical variable.<br>
  <br>
  Given my interest in the concept of time, it was only natural
  that my attention was focused on the second principle, as I felt
  from the start that it would introduce a new, unexpected element
  into the description of physical world evolution. No doubt it was
  the same impression illustrious physicists such as
  Boltzmann<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html">Planck</a><sup><a href=
  "#6">6</a></sup> would have felt before me. A huge part of my
  scientific career would then be devoted to the elucidation of
  macroscopic as well as microscopic aspects of the second
  principle, in order to extend its validity to new situations, and
  to the other fundamental approaches of theoretical physics, such
  as classical and quantum dynamics.<br>
  <br>
  Before we consider these points in greater detail, I would like
  to stress the influence on my scientific development that was
  exerted by the second of my teachers, Jean Timmermans
  (1882-1971). He was more an experimentalist, specially interested
  in the applications of classical thermodynamics to liquid
  solutions, and in general to complex systems, in accordance with
  the approach of the great Dutch thermodynamics school of van der
  Waals and Roozeboom.<sup><a href="#note7">7</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  In this way, I was confronted with the precise application of
  thermodynamical methods, and I could understand their usefulness.
  In the following years, I devoted much time to the theoretical
  approach of such problems, which called for the use of
  thermodynamical methods; I mean the solutions theory, the theory
  of corresponding states and of isotopic effects in the condensed
  phase. A collective research with V. Mathot, A. Bellemans and N.
  Trappeniers has led to the prediction of new effects such as the
  isotopic demixtion of helium He<sup>3</sup>+ He<sup>4</sup>,
  which matched in a perfect way the results of later research.
  This part of my work is summed up in a book written in
  collaboration with V. Mathot and A. Bellemans, <i>The Molecular
  Theory of Solutions</i>. <sup><a href="#note8">8</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  My work in this field of physical chemistry was always for me a
  specific pleasure, because the direct link with experimentation
  allows one to test the intuition of the theoretician. The
  successes we met provided the confidence which later was much
  needed in my confrontation with more abstract, complex
  problems.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, among all those perspectives opened by thermodynamcis,
  the one which was to keep my interest was the study of
  irreversible phenomena, which made so manifest the "arrow of
  time". From the very start, I always attributed to these
  processes a constructive role, in opposition to the standard
  approach, which only saw in these phenomena degradation and loss
  of useful work. Was it the influence of Bergson's
  <i>"L'&eacute;volution cr&eacute;atrice"</i> or the presence in
  Brussels of a performing school of theoretical
  biology?<sup><a href="#note9">9</a></sup> The fact is that it
  appeared to me that living things provided us with striking
  examples of systems which were highly organized and where
  irreversible phenomena played an essential role.<br>
  <br>
  Such intellectual connections, although rather vague at the
  beginning, contributed to the elaboration, in 1945, of the
  theorem of minimum entropy production, applicable to
  non-equilibrium stationary states.<sup><a href="#note10">10</a></sup>
  This theorem gives a clear explanation of the analogy which
  related the stability of equilibrium thermodynamical states and
  the stability of biological systems, such as that expressed in
  the concept of "homeostasy" proposed by Claude Bernard. This is
  why, in collaboration with J.M. Wiame,<sup><a href=
  "#11">11</a></sup> I applied this theorem to the discussion of
  some important problems in theoretical biology, namely to the
  energetics of embryological evolution. As we better know today,
  in this domain the theorem can at best give an explanation of
  some "late" phenomena, but it is remarkable that it continues to
  interest numerous experimentalists.<sup><a href=
  "#12">12</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  From the very beginning, I knew that the minimum entropy
  production was valid only for the linear branch of irreversible
  phenomena, the one to which the famous reciprocity relations of
  Onsager are applicable.<sup><a href="#note13">13</a></sup> And, thus,
  the question was: What about the stationary states far from
  equilibrium, for which <a href="../1968/index.html">Onsager</a>
  relations are not valid, but which are still in the scope of
  macroscopic description? Linear relations are very good
  approximations for the study of transport phenomena (thermical
  conductivity, thermodiffusion, etc.), but are generally not valid
  for the conditions of chemical kinetics. Indeed, chemical
  equilibrium is ensured through the compensation of two
  antagonistic processes, while in chemical kinetics - far from
  equilibrium, out of the linear branch - one is usually confronted
  with the opposite situation, where one of the processes is
  negligible.<br>
  <br>
  Notwithstanding this local character, the linear thermodynamics
  of irreversible processes had already led to numerous
  applications, as shown by people such as J. Meixner,<sup><a href=
  "#14">14</a></sup> S.R. de Groot and P. Mazur,<sup><a href=
  "#15">15</a></sup> and, in the area of biology, A.
  Katchalsky.<sup><a href="#note16">16</a></sup> It was for me a
  supplementary incentive when I had to meet more general
  situations. Those problems had confronted us for more than twenty
  years, between 1947 and 1967, until we finally reached the notion
  of "dissipative structure". <sup><a href="#note17">17</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  Not that the question was intrinsically difficult to handle; just
  that we did not know how to orientate ourselves. It is perhaps a
  characteristic of my scientific work that problems mature in a
  slow way, and then present a sudden evolution, in such a way that
  an exchange of ideas with my colleagues and collaborators becomes
  necessary. During this phase of my work, the original and
  enthusiastic mind of my colleague Paul Glansdorff played a major
  role.<br>
  <br>
  Our collaboration was to give birth to a general evolution
  criterion which is of use far from equilibrium in the non-linear
  branch, out of the validity domain of the minimum entropy
  production theorem. Stability criteria that resulted were to lead
  to the discovery of critical states, with branch shifting and
  possible appearance of new structures. This quite unexpected
  manifestation of "disorder-order" processes, far from
  equilibrium, but conforming to the second law of thermodynamics,
  was to change in depth its traditional interpretation. In
  addition to classical equilibrium structures, we now face
  dissipative coherent structures, for sufficient
  far-from-equilibrium conditions. A complete presentation of this
  subject can be found in my 1971 book co-authored with
  Glansdorff.<sup><a href="#note18">18</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  In a first, tentative step, we thought mostly of hydrodynamical
  applications, using our results as tools for numerical
  computation. Here the help of R. Schechter from the University of Texas at
  Austin was highly valuable.<sup><a href="#note19">19</a></sup>
  Those questions remain wide open, but our centre of interest has
  shifted towards chemical dissipative systems, which are more easy
  to study than convective processes.<br>
  <br>
  All the same, once we formulated the concept of dissipative
  structure, a new path was open to research and, from this time,
  our work showed striking acceleration. This was due to the
  presence of a happy meeting of circumstances; mostly to the
  presence in our team of a new generation of clever young
  scientists. I cannot mention here all those people, but I wish to
  stress the important role played by two of them, R. Lefever and
  G. Nicolis. It was with them that we were in a position to build
  up a new kinetical model, which would prove at the same time to
  be quite simple and very instructive - the "Brusselator", as J.
  Tyson would call it later - and which would manifest the amazing
  variety of structures generated through diffusion-reaction
  processes.<sup><a href="#note20">20</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  This is the place to pay tribute to the pioneering work of the
  late A. Turing,<sup><a href="#note21">21</a></sup> who, since 1952,
  had made interesting comments about structure formation as
  related to chemical instabilities in the field of biological
  morphogenesis. I had met Turing in Manchester about three years
  before, at a time when M.G. Evans, who was to die too soon, had
  built a group of young scientists, some of whom would achieve
  fame. It was only quite a while later that I recalled the
  comments by Turing on those questions of stability, as, perhaps
  too concerned about linear thermodynamics, I was then not
  receptive enough.<br>
  <br>
  Let us go back to the circumstances that favoured the rapid
  development of the study of dissipative structures. The attention
  of scientists was attracted to coherent non-equilibrium
  structures after the discovery of experimental oscillating
  chemical reactions such as the Belusov-Zhabotinsky
  reaction;<sup><a href="#note22">22</a></sup> the explanation of its
  mechanism by Noyes and his co-workers;<sup><a href=
  "#23">23</a></sup> the study of oscillating reactions in
  biochemistry (for example the glycolytic cycle, studied by B.
  Chance<sup><a href="#note24">24</a></sup> and B. Hess<sup><a href=
  "#25">25</a></sup>) and eventually the important research led by
  <a href="../1967/index.html">M. Eigen</a>.<sup><a href=
  "#26">26</a></sup> Therefore, since 1967, we have been confronted
  with a huge number of papers on this topic, in sharp contrast
  with the total absence of interest which prevailed during
  previous times.<br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of the concept of dissipative structure was
  also to have other unexpected consequences. It was evident from
  start that the structures were evolving out of fluctuations. They
  appeared in fact as giant fluctuations, stabilized through matter
  and energy exchanges with the outer world. Since the formulation
  of the minimum entropy production theorem, the study of
  non-equilibrium fluctuation had attracted all my
  attention.<sup><a href="#note27">27</a></sup> It was thus only
  natural that I resumed this work in order to propose an extension
  of the case of far-from-equilibrium chemical reactions.<br>
  <br>
  This subject I proposed to G. Nicolis and A. Babloyantz. We
  expected to find for stationary states a Poisson distribution
  similar to the one predicted for equilibrium fluctuations by the
  celebrated <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> relations.
  Nicolis and Babloyantz developed a detailed analysis of linear
  chemical reactions and were able to confirm this
  prediction.<sup><a href="#note28">28</a></sup> They added some
  qualitative remarks which suggested the validity of such results
  for any chemical reaction.<br>
  <br>
  Considering again the computations for the example of a
  non-linear biomolecular reaction, I noticed that this extension
  was not valid. A further analysis, where G. Nicolis played a key
  role, showed that an unexpected phenomenon appeared while one
  considered the fluctuation problem in nonlinear systems far from
  equilibrium: the distribution law of fluctuations depends on
  their scale, and only "small fluctuations" follow the law
  proposed by Einstein.<sup><a href="#note29">29</a></sup> After a
  prudent reception, this result is now widely accepted, and the
  theory of non-equilibrium fluctuations is fully developing now,
  so as to allow us to expect important results in the following
  years. What is already clear today is that a domain such as
  chemical kinetics, which was considered conceptually closed, must
  be thoroughly rethought, and that a brand-new discipline, dealing
  with non-equilibrium phase transitions, is now
  appearing.<sup><a href="#note30">30</a>, <a href="#note31">31</a>,
  <a href="#note32">32</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  Progress in irreversible phenomena theory leads us also to
  reconsideration of their insertion into classical and quantum
  dynamics. Let us take a new look at the statistical mechanics of
  some years ago. From the very beginning of my research, I had had
  occasion to use conventional methods of statistical mechanics for
  equilibrium situations. Such methods are very useful for the
  study of thermodynamical properties of polymer solutions or
  isotopes. Here we deal mostly with simple computational problems,
  as the conceptual tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics have
  been well established since the work of Gibbs and Einstein. My
  interest in non-equilibrium would by necessity lead me to the
  problem of the foundations of statistical mechanics, and
  especially to the microscopic interpretation of
  irreversibility.<sup><a href="#note33">33</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  Since the time of my first graduation in science, I was an
  enthusiastic reader of Boltzmann, whose dynamical vision of
  physical becoming was for me a model of intuition and
  penetration. Nonetheless, I could not but notice some
  unsatisfying aspects. It was clear that Boltzmann introduced
  hypotheses foreign to dynamics; under such assumptions, to talk
  about a dynamical justification of thermodynamics seemed to me an
  excessive conclusion, to say the least. In my opinion, the
  identification of entropy with molecular disorder could contain
  only one part of the truth if, as I persisted in thinking,
  irreversible processes were endowed with this constructive role I
  never cease to attribute to them. For another part, the
  applications of Boltzmann's methods were restricted to diluted
  gases, while I was most interested in condensed systems.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the forties, great interest was aroused in the
  generalization of kinetic theory to dense media. After the
  pioneering work by Yvon<sup><a href="#note34">34</a></sup>,
  publications of Kirkwodd<sup><a href="#note35">35</a></sup>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/index.html">Born</a> and
  Green<sup><a href="#note36">36</a></sup>, and of
  Bogoliubov<sup><a href="#note37">37</a></sup> attracted a lot of
  attention to this problem, which was to lead to the birth of
  non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. As I could not remain
  alien to this movement, I proposed to G. Klein, a disciple of
  F&uuml;rth who came to work with me, to try the application of
  Born and Green's method to a concrete, simple example, in which
  the equilibrium approach did not lead to an exact solution. This
  was our first tentative step in non-equilibrium statistical
  mechanics.<sup><a href="#note38">38</a></sup> It was eventually a
  failure, with the conclusion that Born and Green's formalism did
  not lead to a satisfying extension of Boltzmann's method to dense
  systems.<br>
  <br>
  But this failure was not a total one, as it led me, during a
  later work, to a first question: Was it possible to develop an
  "exact" dynamical theory of irreversible phenomena? Everybody
  knows that according to the classical point of view,
  irreversibility results from supplementary approximations to
  fundamental laws of elementary phenomena, which are strictly
  reversible. These supplementary approximations allowed Boltzmann
  to shift from a dynamical, reversible description to a
  probabilistic one, in order to establish his celebrated H
  theorem.<br>
  <br>
  We still encountered this negative attitude of "passivity"
  imputed to irreversible phenomena, an attitude that I could not
  share. If - as I was prepared to think - irreversible phenomena
  actually play an active, constructive role, their study could not
  be reduced to a description in terms of supplementary
  approximations. Moreover, my opinion was that in a good theory a
  viscosity coefficient would present as much physical meaning as a
  specific heat, and the mean life duration of a particle as much
  as its mass.<br>
  <br>
  I felt confirmed in this attitude by the remarkable publications
  of Chandrasekhar and von Neumann, which were also issued during
  the forties.<sup><a href="#note39">39</a></sup> That was why, still
  with the help of G. Klein, I decided to take a fresh look at an
  example already studied by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schr&ouml;dinger</a>,<sup><a href="#note40">
  40</a></sup> related to the description of a system of harmonic
  oscillators. We were surprised to see that, for all such a simple
  model allowed us to conclude, this class of systems tend to
  equilibrium. But how to generalize this result to non-linear
  dynamical systems?<br>
  <br>
  Here the truly historic performance of L&eacute;on van Hove opened
  for us the way (1955).<sup><a href="#note41">41</a></sup> I remember,
  with a pleasure that is always new, the time - which was too
  short - during which van Hove worked with our group. Some of his
  works had a lasting effect on the whole development of
  statistical physics; I mean not only his study of the deduction
  of a "master equation " for anharmonic systems, but also his
  fundamental contribution on phase transitions, which was to lead
  to the branch of statistical mechanics that deals with so-called
  "exact" results.<sup><a href="#note42">42</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  This first study by van Hove was restricted to weakly coupled
  anharmonic systems. But, anyway, the path was open, and with some
  of my colleagues and collaborators, mainly R. Balescu, R. Brout,
  F. H&eacute;nin and P. R&eacute;sibois, we achieved a formulation of
  non-equilibrium statistical mechanics from a purely dynamical
  point of view, without any probabilistic assumption. The method
  we used is summed up in my 1962 book.<sup><a href=
  "#43">43</a></sup> It leads to a "dynamics of correlations", as
  the relation between interaction and correlation constitutes the
  essential component of the description. Since then, these methods
  have led to numerous applications. Without giving more detail,
  here, I will restrict myself to mentioning two recent books, one
  by R. Balescu,<sup><a href="#note44">44</a></sup> the other by P.
  R&eacute;sibois and M. De Leener.<sup><a href=
  "#45">45</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  This concluded the first step of my research in non-equilibrium
  statistical mechanics. The second is characterized by a very
  strong analogy with the approach of irreversible phenomena which
  led us from linear thermodynamics to non-linear thermodynamics.
  In this tentative step also, I was prompted by a feeling of
  dissatisfaction, as the relation with thermodynamics was not
  established by our work in statistical mechanics, nor by any
  other method. The theorem of Boltzmann was still as isolated as
  ever, and the question of the nature of dynamics systems to which
  thermodynamics applies was still without answer.<br>
  <br>
  The problem was by far more wide and more complex than the rather
  technical considerations that we had reached. It touched the very
  nature of dynamical systems, and the limits of Hamiltonian
  description. I would never have dared approach such a subject if
  I had not been stimulated by discussions with some highly
  competent friends such as the late L&eacute;on Rosenfeld from
  Copenhagen, or G. Wentzel from Chicago. Rosenfeld did more than
  give me advice; he was directly involved in the progressive
  elaboration of the concepts we had to explore if we were to build
  a new interpretation of irreversibility. More than any other
  stage of my scientific career, this one was the result of a
  collective effort. I could not possibly have succeeded had it not
  been for the help of my colleagues M. de Haan, Cl. George, A.
  Grecos, F. Henin, F. Mayn&eacute;, W. Schieve and M. Theodosopulu.
  If irreversibility does not result from supplementary
  approximations, it can only be formulated in a theory of
  transformations which expresses in "explicit" terms what the
  usual formulation of dynamics does "hide". In this perspective,
  the kinetic equation of Boltzmann corresponds to a formulation of
  dynamics in a new representation.<sup><a href="#note46">46</a>,
  <a href="#note47">47</a>, <a href="#note48">48</a>, <a href=
  "#49">49</a></sup><br>
  <br>
  In conclusion: dynamics and thermodynamics become two
  complementary descriptions of nature, bound by a new theory of
  non-unitary transformation. I came so to my present concerns;
  and, thus, it is time to end this intellectual autobiography. As
  we started from specific problems, such as the thermodynamic
  signification of non-equilibrium stationary states, or of
  transport phenomena in dense systems, we have been faced, almost
  against our will, with problems of great generality and
  complexity, which call for reconsideration of the relation of
  physico-chemical structures to biological ones, while they
  express the limits of Hamiltonian description in physics.<br>
  <br>
  Indeed, all these problems have a common element: time. Maybe the
  orientation of my work came from the conflict which arose from my
  humanist vocation as an adolescent and from the scientific
  orientation I chose for my university training. Almost by
  instinct, I turned myself later towards problems of increasing
  complexity, perhaps in the belief that I could find there a
  junction in physical science on one hand, and in biology and
  human science on the other.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, the research conducted with my friend R. Herman on
  the theory of car traffic<sup><a href="#note50">50</a></sup> gave me
  confirmation of the supposition that even human behaviour, with
  all its complexity, would eventually be susceptible of a
  mathematical formulation. In this way the dichotomy of the "two
  cultures" could and should be removed. There would correspond to
  the breakthrough of biologists and anthropologists towards the
  molecular description or the "elementary structures", if we are
  to use the formulation by L&eacute;vi-Strauss, a complementary move
  by the physico-chemist towards complexity. Time and complexity
  are concepts that present intrinsic mutual relations.<br>
  <br>
  During his inaugural lecture, De Donder spoke in these
  terms:<sup><a href="#note51">51</a></sup> "Mathematical physics
  represents the purest image that the view of nature may generate
  in the human mind; this image presents all the character of the
  product of art; it begets some unity, it is true and has the
  quality of sublimity; this image is to physical nature what music
  is to the thousand noises of which the air is full..."<br>
  <br>
  Filtrate music out of noise; the unity of the spiritual history
  of humanity, as was stressed by M. Eliade, is a recent discovery
  that has still to be assimilated.<sup><a href="#note52">52</a></sup>
  The search for what is meaningful and true by opposition to noise
  is a tentative step that appears to be intrinsically related to
  the coming into consciousness of man facing a nature of which he
  is a part and which it leaves.<br>
  <br>
  I have many times advocated the necessary dialogue in scientific
  activity, and thus the vital importance of my colleagues and
  collaborators in the journey that I have tried to describe. I
  would also stress the continuing support that I received from
  institutions which have made this work a feasible one, especially
  the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles and the University of
  Texas at Austin. For all of the development of these ideas, the
  International Institute of Physics and Chemistry founded by E.
  Solvay (Brussels, Belgium) and the Welch Foundation (Houston,
  Texas) have provided me with continued support.<br>
  <br>
  The work of a theoretician is related in a direct way to his
  whole life. It takes, I believe, some amount of internal peace to
  find a path among all successive bifurcations. This peace I owe
  to my wife, Marina. I know the frailty of the present, but today,
  considering the future, I feel myself to be a happy man.</p>
