  </blockquote>

  <p>Please understand that this is not a formal
  address, but simply a message, a message from the heart, to
  continue a talk begun here in this very city on October 21,
  1958<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>. On that day I said to you:
  "What my heart seeks this evening is to make contact with yours."
  On the tenth and fifteenth of November came the response from the
  heart of Norway like the bolt from the blue in a classic romance.
  On November 10, at 3:15 in the afternoon, a telegram arrived from
  the Chairman of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament.
  On November 15 it was followed by a note from His Majesty King
  Olav V<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a> who wrote:</p>

  <p>"My dear Father Pire,</p>

  <p>I was very glad to learn of the affection
  that you have expressed for Norway following your stay here, and
  I am all the more pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize has now been
  awarded to you in recognition of your great philanthropic work on
  behalf of displaced persons.</p>

  <p>I congratulate you most sincerely and
  tender my warmest wishes that your activities in the interest of
  humanity may continue."</p>

  <p>Of what good would another account of my
  life be? I covered the essentials on October 21. An American
  journalist once said to me: "Your life is a paradox." I refer him
  to the poet Charles P&eacute;guy<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>
  who said: "It would take me a day to write the history of a
  single second. It would take me a year to write the history of
  one minute. It would take me a lifetime, to write the history of
  one hour. It would take me an eternity to write the history of
  one day. One can write anything save the history of what one has
  done."</p>

  <p>Of what good would another lecture on peace
  be? Peace is not something to lecture about, but something to put
  into practice. My friend, Doctor Schweitzer, in this very same
  place, on November 4, 1954, said in his Nobel lecture: "The
  essential fact which we should acknowledge in our conscience and
  which we should have acknowledged a long time ago, is that we are
  becoming inhuman to the extent that we become supermen." On the
  same occasion he went on to claim "the intellectual certainty
  that the human spirit is capable of creating in our time a new
  mentality, an ethical mentality. Inspired by this certainty",
  continued our friend from Lambar&eacute;n&eacute;, "I too proclaim
  this truth in the hope that my testimony may help to prevent its
  rejection as an admirable sentiment but a practical
  impossibility. Many a truth has lain unnoticed for a long time,
  ignored simply because no one perceived its potential for
  becoming reality."<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  <p>What better way is there of making peace a
  reality than to tackle the problem of human suffering?</p>

            <p><b>I. Help All Men</b></p>

  <p>Whether or not one has won the Nobel Prize,
  each of us living in contact with our fellowmen feels a joint
  responsibility for all forms of suffering, both physical and
  moral. But no one feels capable of discharging the entire
  responsibility. Common sense and a desire to be practical soon
  force us, albeit reluctantly, to limit our activities to a
  particular aspect of the task or to a particular affliction,
  without ignoring, misunderstanding, or underestimating the
  others. From the messages, many and diverse, that have found
  their way to my desk since November 10, I should like to read you
  two which highlight the problem precisely. Both are written by
  people who have suffered much, who have at some time believed all
  to be lost, and who therefore possess the insight and detachment
  needed in order to speak with dignity of suffering. The first
  writes:</p>

  <p>"While visiting the Canadian pavilion at
  the Brussels International Exhibition, I was impressed by an
  inscription in bold lettering in the section on social service.
  The gist of its message was this: ' No way of helping is more
  important or more rewarding than that of personal initiative.' In
  this respect, the Aid to Displaced Persons<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a> is a splendid medium and an original
  one. For us who have so little influence on the great decisions
  taken at the UN and elsewhere, this is as effective a means as
  any of working for peace, albeit within Europe alone.Whereas the
  man in the street despairs of having a say in major political
  questions, he has every say and every opportunity to put his
  words into practice on the Displaced Persons problem.</p>

  <p>I am unmoved by the pessimists who say that
  the Nobel Peace Prize has failed to avert violence. I believe
  that the world is making progress spiritually, slowly no doubt
  but still making progress. We proceed, as it were, at the rate of
  three steps forward and two steps back. The important thing is to
  take that extra third step<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>. In
  this lies mankind's only chance, and you are among those who make
  it possible, who are persistently on the attack, who close ranks
  and charge again, pressing forward and persevering so that, often
  in spite of ourselves, the rest of us are swept along by the tide
  of your enthusiasm. You launch your attack with tact, with
  practical common sense, often with humour - and always with love
  and a deep respect for man, always with an acute concern for
  justice."</p>

  <p>As you can see, the suffering of refugees
  is a problem which has succeeded, as could many other problems of
  human suffering, in bringing home to many people a part that they
  can play in the struggle for peace.</p>

  <p>This concept is even more sharply
  underlined in the second letter, which reads as follows:</p>

  <p>"At first, I said to myself: What he is
  doing is admirable, bur even if he succeeds in setting up some
  ten or twenty homes for the aged, he will still have saved only a
  fraction of the Hard Core<a href=
  "#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>... You have stuck to your
  task, however, and your success has followed a geometrical
  progression. The time <i>had</i> to come, and has indeed arrived,
  when you would be in a position to solve the entire problem, or
  at least to make a start on the greater part of it.</p>

  <p>You are the living proof that the true
  solution results from this and this only: setting your whole
  heart and soul to the one task, however modest, that Providence
  suggests, and never letting go.</p>

  <p>This initial act of love, which at first
  seems to benefit only a few unknown people, eventually affects
  the whole world, becoming a bond of international solidarity.
  This is truly magnificent."</p>

  <p>The "initial act of love" to which my
  correspondent refers, helps you not only to become a man of
  single purpose (in itself a powerful attribute), but further and
  above all, to maintain contact with mankind itself. Such contact
  is rewarding both to yourself and to those you meet. No longer do
  you run the risk of allowing humanity to become a mere concept,
  increasingly abstract and theoretical until it disappears
  altogether. It becomes once again what it really is: the
  individual man, the personal crisis, the single destiny, the
  specific needs. The heart resumes its role as the source of the
  noblest virtues that initiate pacific action: Love, Initiative,
  Tenacity, Realism, Patience.</p>

  <p><i>Love.</i> Through love we come close to
  the hearts of our brothers - at the beginning, throughout the
  course of, and right up to the end of our lives. Recently, a
  refugee wrote to his godmother: "I always look forward to
  receiving your letters; the warmth that radiates from them is a
  great comfort to me. Yes, I feel that spiritual values are the
  most important things in our earthly lives and that without them
  life itself is so full of sadness that it is scarcely worth
  living. Often, when I was alone, I used to think of you beside
  me, taking my hand and stroking my forehead. I would have liked
  to put my head between your hands and to feel your warmth and
  affection flowing through me. I always had to remind myself that
  we can be together only in spirit. This thought consoled me, for
  spiritual bonds are by far the most rewarding. They never deceive
  us and they go with us to our graves, and even beyond. Thank you
  for comforting me and for having made the last years of my life
  the best. I face the end of this life with serenity, even though
  I know that my wish to be buried in Hungary can never be
  fulfilled".</p>

  <p><i>Initiative.</i> I have frequently said
  and written: "A loving heart is an inventive one." It finds a
  thousand ways to help and comfort others. It stays fresh and full
  of life; one might say it stays <i>green</i>. The editor of a
  leading Norwegian newspaper was aware of this when he wrote:
  "There is an old saying that a person who can make plants and
  flowers grow has a 'green thumb'.Father Pire, then, has a 'green
  thumb'. Whenever his heart comes in contact with other hearts,
  something immediately starts to grow."</p>

  <p><i>Tenacity.</i> In thanking me on October
  21 at the aula, Mr. Finn Moe<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>
  said: "You have explained something which strikes me as both
  essential to and characteristic of the work about which you have
  spoken tonight. That essential is an individual who decides to
  devote all his energy, faith, and enthusiasm to this task of
  restoring self-respect and faith in humanity to those who have
  been forced to flee, leaving everything behind."</p>

  <p><i>Realism.</i> Man-to-man contact teaches
  us not to expect others to be as we would have them be, but to
  accept them for what they are. This, of course, calls for
  enormous <i>patience.</i> A woman refugee from one of the Baltic
  countries wrote in a well-known Belgian<a href=
  "#not10"><sup>10</sup></a> newspaper: "Few people fully
  appreciate how much love and patience are needed in dealing with
  refugees. When these people leave their countries, their only
  possessions are their characters and their bitterness. What
  intrigue one must unravel, what caprice one must deal with every
  day in these homes for the aged, in these villages of Europe of
  the Heart<sup><a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a></sup>."</p>

  <p>Let us be wary of mass solutions, let us be
  wary of statistics. We must love our neighbors as ourselves. To
  be sure, helping men individually naturally implies that one
  cannot help them all, at least not directly. After all, who in
  one lifetime can give himself completely to everyone? But what
  one man cannot do alone, the will of many may yet achieve. There
  is perhaps no surer road to peace than the one that starts from
  little islands and oases of genuine kindness, islands and oases
  constantly growing in number and being continually joined
  together until eventually they ring the world.</p>

            <p><b>II. Let No Man Be Forgotten</b></p>

  <p>How mistaken are those who think that I
  reduce all problems of suffering in the world to the sole
  dramatic one of Displaced Persons. My friends, all the time that
  I am helping those who are but a fraction of the number of
  refugees in Europe alone, I keep seeing behind them all the other
  refugees, not only in Europe but in every corner of the world,
  whom I cannot help. Recently, I read an article entitled "The
  Seven Sorrows of the World", in which the author listed the seven
  great refugee centers of the world.</p>

  <p>Behind this multitude of refugees, however,
  I see so much other suffering: the starving, the homeless, the
  imprisoned, and legions of others; My colleague Follereau,
  champion of the leper cause<a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>,
  wrote to me on November 11 from Tokyo:</p>

  <p>"May I say how happy and proud I am to be
  counted among your friends. All who combat social injustice and
  human misery, all who wish to see peace reign on earth between
  men of goodwill, will be honored by this distinction. I am at
  present visiting the leper colonies of Japan. I shall then go on
  to Korea and Formosa. Barring unforeseen complications on my
  trip, I expect to return to Paris around Christmas. Shall I at
  last have the pleasure of seeing you? But I realize, as you wrote
  and told me, that we do not have to see each other to know one
  another. I have not forgotten my plans for the village offered me
  by Africa. I hope that events will allow us to carry them out
  soon.</p>

  <p>Once again, my heartfelt
  congratulations.</p>

  <p>Yours with devoted affection."</p>

  <p>And so it is that each of us can remain
  exactly and humbly what he is, doing whatever task God has set
  before him; this in my case is to continue with love, initiative,
  tenacity, realism, and patience, to plow my little furrow in the
  interests of Displaced Persons. We not only can, but should, stay
  each in his own place, not cutting ourselves off from the rest of
  the world, but <i>working for peace wherever we may be.</i> An
  architect wrote me: "The struggle goes on, and there are still
  millions who must be made to realize that all men are brothers,
  that each one of them is bound to the others by ties of
  brotherhood."</p>

            <p><b>III. The Sacred Union</b></p>

  <p>Speaking at Augsburg on May 5, 1957, at the
  laying of the foundation stone of our third European Village, I
  said to my listeners:</p>

  <p>"Deep-rooted as our differences may be,
  they nevertheless remain superficial. And that which divides us
  is of less significance than that which we have in common. The
  best way to live in peace, with mutual love and respect, is to
  recognize our common denominator. This common denominator carries
  a truly splendid name: Man. Let us learn, then, once and for all,
  to see a human brother in each person, no matter how greatly he
  differs from us in his ideas, his social position, his mentality,
  or his beliefs. Let us learn, also, once and for all, to assess a
  man at his true value, a value which is always infinite."</p>

  <p>He who dedicates himself with all his heart
  to saving just one of his brothers and who persuades just one
  other brother to do likewise will become immediately aware of a
  wonderful phenomenon: "the common denominator".</p>

  <p>A Norwegian whom I met here in Oslo in
  October wrote to me two days after my departure: "From the very
  first moment, you appear not as a stranger, but as a brother whom
  we have known all our lives and in whose veins flows the same
  blood as our own." An important official who had grasped my
  message wrote on November 14: "In giving aid, you begin by
  treating every man, whoever he is, as a man... The arc of the bow
  bent by spiritual force takes on greater significance than the
  trajectory of a lunar rocket. We can and we should differ on
  points of religion, philosophy, and science, but we should always
  let man be what he is: a human being, who is neither better nor
  worse than any other human being and who therefore deserves the
  same attention as any other." A lady wrote to me from Berlin: "I
  enclose an article from a Berlin newspaper which has impressed me
  very much and made me think. Many people would do well to read
  this article and take it to heart; the world would be a better
  place. We should not be satisfied merely with saying that people
  today are evil. That is easy to say. We should, instead, be doing
  our utmost to persuade them to embrace good, for dispute and
  rivalry lead only to war, and today war means the end of the
  world. Never can we emphasize too often the fact that, in the
  final reckoning, good always triumphs over evil."</p>

  <p>My friends, at such a point denominational
  disputes and national vainglory might well seem contemptible. So
  let me read to you some wonderful messages of fraternity.</p>

  <p>The message from the French Rabbi Azra
  comes in the form of a prayer<a href=
  "#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>:</p>

  <p>"Lord,</p>

  <p>Inspired by the precepts of Your Law, we
  are gathered here for the building of a new 'European Village'.
  We are here to implement a work of fraternity and love, and to
  ask You to bless the laying of the foundation stone of this
  village.</p>

  <p>Oh Lord, who hast brought us into this
  world to live in peace and harmony, You who hast endowed us with
  reason in order that we might tame the forces of nature and not
  that we might conceive of new means of desecrating the lives we
  owe to You, hasten the happy age of universal brotherhood. May
  this ceremony, Lord, which is a symbol of this brotherhood,
  herald the day, which shall be blessed a thousandfold, when the
  entire human race shall belong to one and the same family and
  when its members, Your children, shall at last be delivered from
  the suffering, the miseries, and the scourges which yet afflict
  them. Purified and ennobled by their ordeals, they will from then
  on, live together in peace and harmony. God of mercy, Master of
  our destinies, bless all those who work for good, all those who
  inspire; bless that greathearted man Father Dominique
  Pire<a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a> and crown with success the
  work he has undertaken; bless all men, our brothers, inspire them
  with reason and wisdom and fill them with the spirit of peace,
  love, and concord."</p>

  <p>Here now, is a message from a German
  burgomaster : "One is forced, in spite of oneself, to go along
  with you, to follow your example. This is what has happened to me
  since our meeting. I write to you thus, in simple terms, about my
  impressions both of our first meeting and of the later one on the
  occasion of the laying of the foundation stone, and I ask you to
  take all that I write in the truest sense of the words."</p>

  <p>A message from an American reads: "I am a
  Jewess, yet feel fellowship for all Catholics... all good people,
  regardless of their denomination."</p>

  <p>A married couple writes: "The magnificent
  example of your great work on behalf of humanity revives the
  eternal hope and belief that we all cherish, that a 'good life'
  can help the world toward recovery. In these days of gloomy
  cynicism, you symbolize the action and morality that can give new
  heart and new life to those who have lost faith as a result of
  man's inhumanity. One a Catholic, the other a Jew, both of us
  have experienced a reawakening of our hopes and ideas, our faith,
  and our love toward our fellow human beings, thanks to the way,
  worthy of Christ Himself, in which you approach men of any class
  or creed."</p>

  <p>This message comes from a woman whose
  husband was lost<a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a> in the Belgian
  concentration camp at Breendonck, whose only son died at the age
  of twenty in an extermination camp, and who herself was near
  death when she returned from the camp at Ravensbr&uuml;ck. She
  writes:</p>

  <p>"On the social level, I try to give aid -
  to the best of my ability - to all who seek it from me,
  regardless of their opinions. I deserve no special credit for
  this; it is simply my nature. Tolerance, kindness, and charity -
  that is my code; and God is good to me, for in this way He
  permits me to alleviate my utter loneliness."<a href=
  "#not16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here also is a message from an important
  French official: "Our Norwegian friends could not have made a
  better choice since they once again recognize in this way that
  love and charity are the real sources of peace."</p>

  <p>A message from a Catholic priest: "Your
  providential success is good for all since, in applauding you, we
  proclaim the very evangelic truth and charity which give life and
  salvation their being."</p>

  <p>A message from a Protestant pastor: "Please
  accept my warmest congratulations on your being chosen to receive
  the Nobel Peace Prize, to the great joy of <i>all</i> your
  friends. Personally, I am more than happy: I am, in fact,
  delighted."</p>

  <p>And this from the wife of a great
  industrialist: "It is your Christian faith, animated by true
  tolerance, which has won you so many followers."</p>

  <p>And a Norwegian woman: "This award is like
  a star shining in the dark firmament of today's world. Let me
  thank you for this ray of light which your work represents."</p>

  <p>The voice of a Protestant: "I am a
  Protestant, and it was through one of our religious publications
  that I came to hear of, to admire, and to respect your work, in
  which I have since taken the greatest interest. I think that you
  and your colleagues are endeavoring to live the beautiful prayer
  of St. Francis of Assisi<a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a> and
  that in effect, wherever there is despair, there also do you
  appear, with God's help, to bring hope."</p>

  <p>An item from a Corsican journalist:
  "Nothing gives me greater joy than this evidence that the spirit
  of Peace is not yet lost."</p>

  <p>And finally this testimony from a fellow
  countryman: "It is comforting still to be able to find, in this
  world ravaged by materialism and by its inevitable companion
  egotism, minds perspicacious enough and fearless enough to pay a
  solemn tribute to Charity."<a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

  <p>The sacred union existing between two
  brother human beings who rediscover themselves as men of true
  dignity while working together to save a third, rids us of many
  of the barriers of prejudice, narrow-mindedness, and
  discrimination that poison human love and sap its strength. We
  must now have faith in the power of love and set it to work. Let
  me point out right away that a gesture of brotherly love extended
  jointly requires no compromise of principle, but on the contrary
  is justified and indeed welcomed by the right-minded. Let us not
  speak of <i>tolerance.</i> This negative word implies grudging
  concessions by smug consciences. Rather, let us speak of mutual
  understanding and mutual respect. Every man is obliged to act in
  accordance with his conscience. If my neighbor holds an opinion
  different from mine, do I have any right to consider him
  dishonest or evil? Should I not rather believe as a matter of
  course that he is good and expect him to adhere faithfully to the
  dictates of his conscience? St. Thomas Aquinas<a href=
  "#not19"><sup>19</sup></a>, the prince of all the theologians,
  wrote in connection with the differences in religious beliefs:
  "If a man truly believes it wrong to serve Christ, he commits a
  sin if he serves Him."</p>

  <p>For ten years now, we have always acted in
  accordance with these principles, both in our work on behalf of
  Displaced Persons and for the sake of the Europe of brotherly
  love which we are endeavoring to create around the refugees. The
  award of the Nobel Peace Prize has obliged me, contrary to habit
  and against my better judgment, to look back, in spite of St.
  Paul's words: "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and
  looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."<a href=
  "#not20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

  <p>I received each journalist individually and
  calmly, as a human being ought to be received. But the paths of
  introspection and of delving into the past along which each one
  of them wanted to lead me, have given me a chance to see that,
  basically, what the last ten years have brought about is simply
  the forging of individualized human links into a solid chain of
  love, originating from the small group of friends who met in
  Brussels on February 27, 1949<a href="#not21"><sup>21</sup></a>,
  spreading to the friends of those friends and again to their
  friends in turn, and reuniting us here this evening as true
  brothers, and not as an anonymous mass. Let us hope that this
  chain of friends and many others like it will soon constitute the
  Europe of the Heart and perhaps one day, the World of the
  Heart<a href="#not22"><sup>22</sup></a>. Since November 10 I
  would have found complete joy and hope in the unanimous support
  of those who adjudge and pronounce the decision of the Nobel
  Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, were it not for the
  "curtain" behind which live other brothers like ourselves, with
  the same right to live but in even greater need of brotherly love
  than we are. What more appropriate message could we send them all
  this evening, to their leaders as well as to the humblest of
  them, than this: Brothers of the East, Brothers of Asia, I love
  you and I am willing to give my life for each one of you.</p>

            <p><b>IV Responsibility</b></p>

  <p>The 1958 Nobel Peace Prize is not the end
  of a career, but a beginning, a fresh start, the continuation
  with renewed zeal, of all that has been done in the last ten
  years. The responsibility involved is enormous. A man who once
  watched me at work wrote to me:</p>

  <p>"To the many congratulations showered on
  you on the occasion of your winning the Nobel Prize, I should
  like to add my own. I do so, even though I am sure that this
  distinction holds little significance for you personally and that
  you attribute the honor involved only to the spiritual principles
  which you stand for. All the same, you must surely admit, even if
  only to yourself, the joy it has brought you. The idea and the
  man go together. You personify your idea to such an extent that
  you are its chief bearer. You inspire faith, and in describing
  your principles, you describe yourself."</p>

  <p>And what can one reply to this writer who
  sums it up in these words: "At present, you are part of
  everyone's dream of peace."</p>

  <p>Whether you are believers or not, dear
  friends, give me your affection, your support, and help me to
  further the cause of true friendship. In concluding, I leave you
  with four simple, yet glorious, lines of verse, recently written
  by an old Russian refugee whom I restored to a decent life. He
  entitles these lines: "The Work of the Reverend Father Dominique
  Pire". Here they are:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;A kiss of Peace, a ray of light on
    earth...<br>
    A Solace to a lonely heart&#8230;<br>
    A noble Promise&#8230;<br>
    A Caress like that of God's own Hand...&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
<br><hr><br>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not" id="not"></a>* The Reverend
  Father Pire delivered this Nobel lecture in French in the
  auditorium of the Nobel Institute. The translation is based on
  the French text in <i>Les Prix Nobel en 1958.</i> Collation of
  the French text with a tape recording of the lecture shows
  certain differences between the two other than the usual minor
  verbal ones incidental to delivery. The first involves opening
  remarks not in the prepared text: in actual delivery the laureate
  begins with a salutation to the honored guests and expresses his
  gratitude for the honor done him and his hope that he may be
  worthy of it. Other differences in the lecture, as printed and as
  delivered, are noted as they occur.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not1" id="not1"></a>1 . In
  delivery, the laureate incorporates this quotation and the
  lecture's title in the lecture itself by saying: "I have entitled
  my lesson 'Brotherly Love: Foundation of Peace' and I have taken
  as introductory text the words of Newton: 'Men build too many
  walls and not enough bridges.' " He then continues with the
  lecture as printed.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not2" id="not2"></a>2. At the
  invitation of the Norwegian chapter of the European Movement, the
  laureate had spoken in the Aula or Auditorium of the University
  of Oslo, giving an account of his work.</p>

  in a way which would seem to attribute the first four sentences
  of the paragraph to Father Pire himself rather than to the letter
  writer. The punctuation of the text in <i>Les Prix Nobel</i> and
  the context itself suggest that these sentences are in fact part
  of the letter.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not8" id="not8"></a>8. "Hard Core"
  was the term used for refugees left in the D. P. camps who, I
  because of age, physical infirmities, lack of relatives, etc.,
  had little hope of clearance for emigration and resettlement.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not9" id="not9"></a>9. Finn Moe
  (1962- ), Norwegian diplomat.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not10" id="not10"></a>10. The word
  "Belgian" is omitted in the tape recording of the lecture.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not11" id="not11"></a>11. See
  biography.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not12" id="not12"></a>12. Raoul
  Follereau (1903- ), French philanthropist and man of letters,
  nicknamed the "Vagabond of Charity".</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not13" id="not13"></a>13. The tape
  includes the words : "at Augsburg".</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not14" id="not14"></a>14. The tape
  omits "Father Dominique Pire".</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not15" id="not15"></a>15. The text
  reads "perdu" (lost); the tape records "pendu" (hanged).</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not16" id="not16"></a>16. The tape
  records that at the end of this sentence the laureate inserted a
  second letter (or quotation therefrom) from the same woman, a
  letter which he had just received and which, of course, is not in
  the text; in it the writer condemns hatred and despair, praises
  Father Pire's work, urges fraternal love throughout the world,
  and sends her greetings to those Norwegian women who had been at
  Ravensbr&uuml;ck with her.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not17" id="not17"></a>17. St.
  Francis of Assisi (1182-1226), founder of the Franciscan
  order.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not18" id="not18"></a>18. The tape
  records that at this point the laureate inserted some
  transitional words not in the text: "Dear friends, you have
  appreciated these wonderful messages just as I have. They show
  that the sacred union existing..."</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not19" id="not19"></a>19. St.
  Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), Italian philosopher and
  theologian.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not20" id="not20"></a>20. See Luke
  9:62.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="not21" id="not21"></a>21. On this
  date Father Pire and a group of Girl Guides in Brussels listened
  to a talk on the plight of those in the refugee camps and decided
  to write letters to some refugees whose names the speaker
  supplied. This action initiated what eventually became Aid to
  Displaced Persons. (<i>Europe of the Heart,</i> pp. 94-96.)</p>
