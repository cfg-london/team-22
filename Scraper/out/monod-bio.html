  <h1>Jacques Monod - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="monod.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Jacques Lucien Monod</b> 
              was born in Paris on February 9th, 1910. In 1917 his parents settled 
              in the South of France, where Monod spent his early years, and he 
              therefore thinks of himself as a Southerner rather than as a Parisian. 
              His father was a painter, something of an unusual vocation for a 
              Huguenot family in which doctors, ministers of the Church, civil 
              servants, and professors predominated. His mother was American, 
              born in Milwaukee, with a father of Scottish descent - again somewhat 
              out of the ordinary considering French bourgeois tradition at the 
              end of the nineteenth century. His secondary education took place 
              at the lyc&eacute;e de Cannes, and he owes a great deal to some 
              of the masters under whom he was fortunate enough to study. Monod 
              in particular recalls Monsieur Dor de la Souch&egrave;re, well known 
              as the founder and curator of the Antibes museum. Although Monod 
              remembers nothing of the Greek grammar studied under him, the admiration 
              which he soon developed for this highly cultured and worthy man 
              was of the greatest spiritual benefit for him as a youngster. It 
              is difficult to express just how much Monod owes to his father, 
              who combined artistic sensitivity with prodigious erudition and 
              a passionate concern for intellectual affairs. He had a positivist 
              faith in the joint progress of science and society. It was through 
              his father, who used to read Darwin, that Jacques Monod developed 
              his interest in biology very early in life.<br>
              <br>
              Monod came to Paris in 1928 to begin his higher education, and registered 
              at the Faculty for a degree in Natural Sciences, not realising (as 
              he later found out) that this course was then some twenty years 
              or more behind contemporary biological science. It was from others, 
              a few years senior to himself, rather than from the professional 
              staff, that he gained his true initiation into biology. To George 
              Teissier he owes a preference for quantitative descriptions; <a href="index.html">Andr&eacute; 
              Lwoff</a> initiated him into the potentials of microbiology; to 
              Boris Ephrussi he owes the discovery of physiological genetics, 
              and to Louis Rapkine the concept that only chemical and molecular 
              descriptions could provide a complete interpretation of the function 
              of living organisms.<br>
              <br>
              Monod obtained his Science Degree in 1931, and his doctorate in 
              Natural Sciences in 1941. After lecturing at the Faculty of Sciences 
              in 1934, and spending some time at the California Institute of Technology 
              on a Rockefeller grant in 1936, Monod joined the Institut Pasteur 
              after the liberation as Laboratory Director in Lwoff's Department. 
              He was made Director of the Cell Biochemistry Department in 1954, 
              and in 1959 was appointed Professor of the Chemistry of Metabolism 
              at the Sorbonne. In 1967 he became Professor at the Coll&egrave;ge 
              de France, and in 1971 he was appointed Director of the Institut 
              Pasteur.<br>

              The following honours and distinctions were awarded to Professor 
              Monod: Montyon Physiology Prize of the Acad&egrave;mie des Sciences 
              (Paris, 1955), Louis Rapkine Medal (London, 1958), Honorary Foreign 
              Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1960), Chevalier de l'Ordre 
              des Palmes Acad&eacute;miques (1961), Charles L&eacute;opold Mayer 
              Prize of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (1962), Officier de la 
              L&eacute;gion d'Honneur (1963), Honorary Foreign Member of the Deutsche Akademie der 
              Naturforscher &laquo;Leopoldina&raquo; (1965), D. Sc. <i>h. 
              c.</i> University of Chicago (1965), Foreign Member of the Royal 
              Society (1968 ), Foreign Member of the National Academy of Sciences (Washington, 1968), Foreign Member 
              of the American Philosophical Society (1969), D. Sc. <i>h. c.</i> 
              of the Rockefeller University (1970). His military distinctions include: 
              Honorary Colonel of the Reserve, Chevalier de la L&eacute;gion d'Honneur 
              (military) (1945), Croix de Guerre (1945), and the Bronze Star Medal.<br>
              <br>
              In 1938, Jacques Monod married Odette Bruhl, now the curator of 
              the Guimet Museum. As an archeologist and orientalist with the most 
              sensitive and impeccable taste, his wife brought to the marriage 
              a culture complementary to his own. They have twin sons, Olivier 
              and Philippe. Their father did nothing to influence them to become 
              men of science like himself. On the contrary, he made every effort 
              to persuade them that the realm of knowledge and ideas is not confined 
              to the present-day connotation of the word &laquo;science&raquo;. 
              Both of them nevertheless became scientists: one a geologist, the 
              other a physicist. These two sons gave the parents what they lacked 
              before: two daughters, or rather daughters-in-law, and even a grand-daughter 
              with the pretty name of Claire. The interests of Jacques Monod include 
              almost all aspects of Arts and Sciences, his favourite recreations 
              are music and sailing.</p>
