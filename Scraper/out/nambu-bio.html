 <h1>Yoichiro Nambu - Biographical</h1>
 


 <p><img src="nambu.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in 1921 in Tokyo and grew up in the provincial city of Fukui. I
studied physics at the Imperial University of Tokyo from 1940 to 1942, graduating
at the level of M.S. Then I was drafted into an army radar laboratory.
After the end of the war, in 1946, I returned to the University of Tokyo as a
kind of research associate. I received a doctorate in 1952. In 1950 I became
professor at a newly created Osaka City University, a position I held until
1956. But from 1952 to 1954 I stayed at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, USA, as a member, and from 1954 to 1956 at the University of
Chicago as a research associate. I was made associate professor at Chicago in
1956, professor in 1958, and Distinguished Service Professor in 1971. From
1973 to 1976 I served as chairman of the department of physics. In 1976 I
became Henry Judson Distinguished Professor, from which position I retired
in 1991 and became Emeritus.</p>
 <p>I married Chieko Hida in 1945 and have a son, Jun-ichi. I have been a
citizen of the United States of America since 1970. I hold honorary degrees
from Osaka City University (1980), Northwestern University (1985), and
Osaka University (1997). I have been a member of the United States National
Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since
1971, and an honorary member of the Japan Academy since 1984.</p>
 <p>A partial list of the prizes I received in the past is:</p>
 <p>&#8226; Dannie Heineman Prize, American Physical Society (1970)<br>
   &#8226; Order of Culture, Government of Japan (1978)<br>
   &#8226; United States National Medal of Science (1982)<br>
   &#8226; Max Planck Medal, German Physical Society (1985)<br>
   &#8226; Dirac Medal, International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste (1986)<br>
   &#8226; Sakurai Prize, American Physical Society (1994)<br>
   &#8226; Wolf Prize, Government of Israel (1995)<br>
   &#8226; Gian Carlo Wick Medal, World Federation of Scientists, Lausanne (1996)<br>
    &#8226; Bogoliubov Prize, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna (2003)<br>
    &#8226; Benjamin Franklin Medal, Franklin Inst., Philadelphia (2005)<br>
     &#8226; Pomeranchuk Prize, Inst. Theoret. and Exper. Physics, Moscow (2007)</p>
 <p>My interests in physics have been mainly on the theoretical side. The
University of Tokyo was good in condensed matter physics, but I was more attracted
to nuclear and particle physics where names like Nishina, <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/tomonaga-facts.html">Tomonaga</a>,
and Yukawa in other institutions were making great contributions. As a student I was exposed to cosmic ray and particle physics by attending seminars
held by Nishina and Tomonaga at their laboratory nearby. I started my
research career at the time when Tomonaga was developing his theory of
renormalization, for which he would receive the Nobel Prize. I was able to
approach his group and start working on his theory and other topics in particle
physics. At his recommendation I obtained the position at Osaka City
University and later was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study. I owe my
move to Chicago to M. L. Goldberger.</p>
 <p>My work on spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), for which I am receiving
the Nobel Prize, started around 1959. It is a result of my experience in
both condensed matter and particle physics. The BCS theory of superconductivity
in 1957 led me to the idea of SSB as a general phenomenon in physics.
My work on its specific application to particle physics as a mechanism
for generation of the nucleon mass and the pion was first published in 1960.
Since then I have pursued the subject in various areas.</p>
