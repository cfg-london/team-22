  <h1>Hideki Yukawa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="yukawa.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Hideki Yukawa</b> was born in Tokyo,
  Japan, on 23rd January, 1907, the third son of Takuji Ogawa, who
  later became Professor of Geology at Kyoto
  University. The future Laureate was brought up in Kyoto and
  graduated from the local university in 1929. Since that time he
  has been engaged on investigations in theoretical physics,
  particularly in the theory of elementary particles.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1932 and 1939 he was a lecturer at the Kyoto University
  and lecturer and Assistant Professor at the Osaka University.
  Yukawa gained the D.Sc. degree in 1938 and from the following
  year he has been, and still is, Professor of Theoretical Physics
  at Kyoto University. While at Osaka University, in 1935, he
  published a paper entitled "On the Interaction of Elementary
  Particles. I." (<i>Proc. Phys.-Math. Soc. Japan, 17, p. 48</i>),
  in which he proposed a new field theory of nuclear forces and
  predicted the existence of the meson. Encouraged by the discovery
  by American physicists of one type of meson in cosmic rays, in
  1937, he devoted himself to the development of the meson theory,
  on the basis of his original idea. Since 1947 he has been working
  mainly on the general theory of elementary particles in
  connection with the concept of the "non-local" field.<br>
  <br>
  Yukawa was invited as Visiting Professor to the Institute for Advanced
  Study at Princeton, U.S.A., in 1948, and since July, 1949 he
  has been Visiting Professor at Columbia University, New York City.<br>
  <br>
  The learned societies of his native land have recognised his
  ability and he is a member of the Japan Academy, the Physical
  Society and the Science Council of Japan, and is Emeritus
  Professor of Osaka University. As Director of the Research
  Institute for Fundamental Physics in Kyoto University he has his
  office in the Yukawa Hall, which is named after him. He is also a
  Foreign Associate of the American National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow
  of the American
  Physical Society.<br>
  <br>
  The Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy was awarded to Yukawa in
  1940; he received the Decoration of Cultural Merit in 1943, and
  the crowning award, the Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1949.<br>
  <br>
  A large number of scientific papers have been published by him
  and many books, including <i>Introduction to Quantum
  Mechanics</i> (1946) and <i>Introduction to the Theory of
  Elementary Particles</i> (1948), both in Japanese, have come from
  his pen. He has edited a journal in English, <i>Progress of
  Theoretical Physics</i>, since 1946.<br>
  <br>
  An honorary doctorate of the University of Paris and honorary
  memberships of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Indian Academy
  of Sciences, the International Academy of Philosophy and
  Sciences, and the Pontificia Academia Scientiarum have marked the
  recognition he has earned in world scientific circles.<br>
  <br>
  A civic honour was awarded to him when he was created Honorary
  Citizen of the City of Kyoto, Japan.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932 he married, and he and his wife Sumiko have two sons,
  Harumi and Takaaki.</p>
