  <h2>On Catalysis</h2>

  <p>It has pleased no less than surprised me
  that of the many studies whereby I have sought to extend the
  field of general chemistry, the highest scientific distinction
  that there is today has been awarded for those on
  <i>catalysis</i>. The award has pleased me because in my
  innermost being I used to, and still do, consider this part of my
  work the one in which the personal quality of my method of work
  is most definitely shown up and which I therefore have more at
  heart than all the others. The award surprises me because it was
  not until a very much later period that I expected for this work
  the recognition on which I dared to place my hopes. It gives me a
  very high opinion of the unerring instinct with which the
  authorities of the Nobel Foundation perform their fine, no less
  than difficult and responsible task, that their judgement
  coincides with the one that I myself after most earnest
  self-examination must take; and since I cannot expect anyone to
  have a more thorough knowledge of my work than I myself, this
  proves that those authorities have acquired such a sure grasp of
  their function that in the future, too, the whole of
  international science can look forward to their decisions with
  confidence.</p>

  <p>There is no need for me to point out that
  these comments do not refer to the choice of my person, but only
  to the choice of the work after the decision as to person. The
  first issue is not for me to judge; all that remains for me here
  is to accept the accomplished fact with all the profound,
  heart-felt gratitude which such recognition on the part of the
  most competent body, notably that of one's own colleagues, cannot
  fail to arouse. Amongst the many happy moments of what has been a
  life filled with a profusion of gratifying occasions, I am aware
  of only one which I can compare with the present occasion, and
  that is the first scientific recognition ever which I received
  publicly at the very outset of my career. Together with the
  recognition conferred on me today it forms the two high-lights of
  these experiences since even for the future I can expect nothing
  greater.</p>

  <p>It is not quite a year ago that I wrote in
  a different context: "I myself have no cause for complaint
  whatsoever about lack of recognition of the scientific work which
  I have been so happy to perform in the field of general
  chemistry; yet the purely intellectual achievement of conceiving
  catalytic phenomena as accelerations of possible processes which
  are in progress, whereby the whole vast field of catalysis was
  first opened to exact study, lay at the time so far outside
  general scientific thought that where the broader masses of
  scientists are concerned it is today still at the incubation
  stage, notwithstanding the passing of some twenty years. I
  presume that subsequently this advance will become so naturally
  part and parcel of the overall context of scientific thought
  that, compared with before, the gap will cease to be apparent at
  all and I shall be deprived of that measure of personal glory to
  which I am justly entitled by virtue of this advance in theory.
  Yet this will not upset me any further since in the meantime I
  have come to regard such matters as object studies in the
  reactions of the collective psyche".</p>

  <p>That I have fortunately been proved wrong
  in that prediction demonstrates how far I underestimated that as
  science progressively developed and as its nature and attributes
  became more and more familiar, mankind's appreciation and
  acceptance of scientific progress has steadily accelerated.
  Whereas in former centuries it was a commonplace for a scientist
  not to be understood until long after his death, in our day this
  time-lag has almost entirely disappeared, no less so than most of
  the active opposition formerly placed in the way of free research
  by powers which feared that their rule would be threatened by the
  growth of Science. Whereas, for example, research workers were,
  at one time, obliged to endeavour to ensure that their theories
  did not contradict those of the Church, nowadays, in contrast,
  the Church is at pains to prove that its teachings are compatible
  with those of Science. In other words, the Church acknowledges
  Science as the higher authority.</p>

  <p>Similarly, an advance has been achieved
  within Science itself, namely the readier recognition of purely
  theoretical achievements. When <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/index.html">R&ouml;ntgen</a> discovered
  X-rays, his name, linked with this discovery, was carried
  throughout the whole of the civilized world within a matter of
  only a few weeks, as the experimental fact of irradiating objects
  that are opaque to normal light is so remarkable that everybody
  immediately felt, although not always appreciated, its
  implications. Yet when Willard Gibbs discovered the phase rule,
  which is of much more universal, hence of far greater,
  importance, nobody at all recognized its implications at first
  and about twenty years elapsed before it was sufficiently
  understood to be accepted into Science's regular stock of
  chemical laws. This second case was a purely intellectual or
  abstract achievement for which even the special branch of Science
  which it concerned was so ill-prepared that to some extent it had
  to be educated to accept it, a task discharged, as is well known,
  by <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/index.html">Van der Waals</a>
  and his pupils. And this education was not successful until the
  vast experimental significance of this concept had been
  demonstrated in specific experimental studies.</p>

  <p>Of course there were even greater
  difficulties fifty years previously when Berzelius made similar
  scientific advances in chemistry. We may refer to this great
  scientist as the good spirit of this building.<a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> Here he spent the largest and most
  important part of his busy life while for the second time (his
  predecessor being Linn&eacute;), he established the scientific
  hegemony of his country in Europe. From here he sent into the
  world those annual reports dealing with his science in which as
  an honest appraiser he put every item discovered by the research
  of his day into its proper perspective and thus for the first
  time brought out its value and significance. It was here through
  purely intellectual effort that he achieved incomparably more for
  his Science than he was able to achieve with all his pains in his
  simultaneous capacity as a tireless experimenter.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it would have been difficult
  for him to have achieved this degree of esteem and influence of
  his judgement had he not beforehand in practically all sectors of
  his science first examined the nature of things in person, and if
  in his hands the simplest tools had not through proper and varied
  use become ever-flowing springs of fresh knowledge. The profusion
  of his experimental discoveries, the meaning of which was as
  understandable to his contemporaries as their number was
  baffling, led to his being acknowledged the unchallenged master
  of chemistry and to his even greater gift of formulating concepts
  being first conceded, then enthusiastically recognized, and
  finally renounced. But why, later, when his electrochemical
  theory of chemical compounds was considered completely vanquished
  by the unitary theory of the biased organic chemists, were the
  concepts of positive and negative elements which he had
  formulated an unchallenged, even determinative, factor in the
  writings of those selfsame triumphing opponents? The reason was
  the simple fact that those concepts summed up a truth, the force
  of which asserted itself even when time had eroded away the
  ephemeral element. And these very same new concepts which had
  become decisive for the triumphing theories, i.e.
  i<i>somerism</i> and <i>constitution</i>, were formulated by the
  thinker whose theories his short-sighted opponents thought they
  had everywhere disposed of and vanquished.</p>

  <p>In Berzelius, therefore, we have above all
  else to honour a <i>master in the art of formulating chemical
  concepts</i> and it is no wonder that he has a decisive bearing
  on the concept formulation with which we are concerned today.
  Even the term <i>catalysis</i> which, after being for long
  misunderstood, nay despised, is now back in favour, we owe to
  Berzelius.</p>

  <p>For a deeper insight into this task of
  penetrating into scientific conceptions, a task which is still
  far too little known and to which far too little attention is
  still paid, we shall first consider a case where something
  concrete was obtained at the very outset. This is the concept of
  <i>isomerism</i>.</p>

  <p>In the first quarter of the nineteenth
  century the experimental proof for the interdependence of the
  composition and properties of chemical compounds resulted in the
  theory that they are mutually related, so that like composition
  governs like properties, and conversely. The well-known fact that
  the form of a specific substance, e.g. water, and hence its
  properties can alter without a change in composition was disposed
  of by the formal view that a physical, not a chemical, process
  was involved. As though that disposed of the actually existing
  difference in properties for the same composition ! Nevertheless,
  these differences are governed by variations in temperature and
  pressure and (with certain limitations) it is true to say that
  under given external conditions the properties of a substance of
  given composition are invariably the same.</p>

  <p>Then, in the 1830's, substances were
  quickly discovered one after another which, even under the same
  external conditions, had quite dissimilar properties while
  analysis showed them to be identical in chemical composition.
  W&ouml;hler's in many ways successful studies of cyanic acid gave
  the same analysis results for this compound as Liebig had found
  in his analysis of fulminic acid (which at the time made him a
  world-famous chemist at the age of barely twenty). The two young
  scientists had failed to notice it but it struck Berzelius when,
  in his conscientious and concise manner he abstracted the two
  papers for his annual report.</p>

  <p>There is no need for me to go into the
  familiar story of how isomerism was discovered; I should like to
  single out just one point. When the common fact became apparent
  that like composition can be accompanied by substantially
  dissimilar chemical properties, Berzelius acquired the equipment
  to investigate <i>experimentally</i> such a case as thoroughly as
  he could. In an admirable study of racemic acid and its salts he
  then established these facts with the maximum precision and
  raised the concept of isomerism to the status of a fully
  authenticated scientific concept. Since that time,
  notwithstanding the enormous advance of our knowledge about this
  very subject, it has not materially altered but only been
  expanded in the original sense. Even the then still completely
  hypothetical view that the differences in properties came about
  because "the atoms were assembled in different ways" has remained
  absolutely intact and the differences of opinion subsequently
  concerned only how the various "assemblies" are to be envisaged
  and represented.</p>

  <p>Whereas here we have a concept which has
  persisted in essentially unchanged form right up to the present
  and which appears destined for a very long life yet on its
  original basis, Berzelius was less fortunate with another. The
  explanation lies in the fact that the sum total of the knowledge
  in the field discussed above is still today at the same period of
  its development because no new fundamental ideas have sprung up
  despite vast development in breadth. With the other concept,
  <i>catalysis</i>, a decisive change has set in meanwhile whereby
  the problem itself has acquired a new basis. This has meant that
  all the peculiarities belonging to that earlier epoch have
  simultaneously had to be laid aside and thus in the light of the
  new science, chemical kinetics, the concept has acquired an
  essentially different emphasis. Yet it should be pointed out at
  once that Berzelius revealed his genius by actually formulating
  his concept almost as purely and as perfectly as possible under
  the particular conditions.</p>

  <p>Important fundamental laws governing the
  genesis of any science are involved here and hence a few words
  about these general phenomena will not be out of place. It is not
  just of general, epistemological importance to have a more
  precise knowledge of these phenomena but also of very great
  practical importance because it substantially facilitates
  estimating the particular state of any science, hence the
  inevitable discussions can be settled and shortened, and progress
  to some extent made independent of chance, i.e. organized.</p>

  <p>We know from biology that new forms of
  organisms simulate their primitive form as closely as possible at
  first, even though obliged to exist under changed internal and
  external conditions. Hence they invariably take with them into
  their new mode of life a certain number of forms and
  characteristics which are superfluous, detrimental even, for the
  new state. It is contrary to the nature of organic evolution for
  such "rudimentary" organs or characteristics to be shed at once.
  On the contrary they have to be carried for quite a long time and
  are only discarded after long and difficult evolution.</p>

  <p>The cause of this obviously inefficient
  state of affairs lies in a general characteristic which may be
  termed the law of <i>biological inertia</i> and which is a
  determining factor in the chronological events associated with
  biological phenomena, in the same way as the mechanical law of
  inertia determines dynamic phenomena. In the final analysis the
  law of biological inertia is based on the common attribute of
  living creatures, the sweeping importance of which was first
  recognized by Ewald Hering and which has been termed
  <i>memory</i> in the widest sense, i.e. the law is based on the
  fact that living creatures (as distinct from inorganic
  structures) experience or perform a process more easily, quickly
  or perfectly, the more frequently they have been subjected to it.
  After each such process the organism is in a certain sense
  altered, whereas the inorganic structure is normally reversible,
  i.e. once the former conditions have been restored it reverts
  exactly to its earlier state.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the same characteristic also
  occurs with all special activities of the organisms. Thus, we
  meet them again in the <i>new concepts</i> in science which are
  invariably so formulated as to simulate as closely as possible
  the existing concepts and therefore from the time of their
  formation and the ideas then prevailing they absorb a greater or
  lesser number of "rudimentary" elements which it is the difficult
  and laborious task of subsequent research to eliminate. For the
  furtherance of science it is therefore extremely important to
  recognize the rudimentary elements of an existing concept which
  are destined to disappear. Normally they are the ones which
  appear particularly appropriate to the thinking of the era, since
  the ephemeral and hypothetical aspects come closer to this as a
  rule than the fundamentally general aspect which invariably
  necessitates a much more penetrating process of abstraction.</p>

  <p>Referring now to the formulation of the
  <i>catalysis</i> concept, it must first of all be pointed out
  that in the days before Berzelius no one at all had ever
  conceived and felt that the individual phenomena which we have
  since learnt to regard as special cases of a general event were
  related. On the contrary they were put down as isolated facts
  which, although their existence had to be acknowledged since they
  had been ascertained by reliable observers, for the time being
  could only be taken note of and nothing further. A remarkable
  thing here is that certain of these phenomena, e.g. the formation
  of dextrin and sugar from starch by boiling with acids (the acid
  not changing permanently) had been known ever since the close of
  the eighteenth century and developed into large-scale industries,
  it being quite typical of technology not to wait at all until
  Science has tidied up a thing theoretically before applying it.
  On the contrary, it is usually ample for a start if the actual
  process mechanism is known in sufficient detail to enable the
  process to be conducted as desired and, if possible,
  quantitatively controlled too. Both conditions applied to the
  action of acids on starch.</p>

  <p>Berzelius was induced to group this
  phenomenon together with a number of other, seemingly dissimilar,
  phenomena under a single concept as a result of a work performed
  by his pupil, Mitscherlich, who had studied in detail the
  transformation (also known technically) of alcohol into ether
  under the action of 50% sulphuric acid and had equally found that
  no consumption of the sulphuric acid occurs during the process.
  Admittedly, the reaction ceases after a time but that is due only
  to secondary reactions (oxidation of the alcohol by the sulphuric
  acid) which play no direct part in the formation of ether.</p>

  <p>The processes grouped together by Berzelius
  were: the transformation of starch into dextrin and sugar by
  acids (Kirchhoff, 1811); the same transformation by malt extract
  (Kirchhoff, 1814); the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into
  water and gaseous oxygen in the presence of platinum, manganese
  dioxide, etc. (Th&eacute;nard, 1818); the action of finely divided
  platinum on inflammable gas mixtures (Davy, 1817; and
  D&ouml;bereiner, 1823); the formation of ether by the action of
  sulphuric acid (Mitscherlich, 1834). The factor which Berzelius
  regarded as being common to all these processes was that the
  substances which interact to form the product (or else which
  decompose into their cleavage products) do not do so on their own
  or spontaneously but only after the addition of a certain
  substance which is not itself consumed. Mitscherlich had termed
  the process which he studied a chemical <i>action by contact</i>;
  Berzelius introduced the name <i>catalysis</i> instead, with the
  active but unconsumed substance being termed the catalytic
  substance or <i>catalyst</i>, and the cause underlying the
  phenomena <i>catalytic force</i>. Berzelius insisted
  categorically that it had not been his intention with this
  terminology to give an explanation of the group of phenomena. On
  the contrary he defined: <i>The catalytic force actually appears
  to consist in the ability of substances to arouse the affinities
  dormant at this temperature by their mere presence and not by
  their affinity and so as a result in a compound substance the
  elements become arranged in another way such that a greater
  electrochemical neutralization is brought about.</i></p>

  <p>In the ensuing controversy with Liebig,
  which has been described elsewhere and hence need not be
  repeated, Berzelius expressly drew attention to there being no
  assumptions underlying this definition which, as far as is
  feasible, is restricted merely to specifying the facts and
  deliberately and expressly avoids attempting to account for them.
  In reply to Liebig's hypothesis that a decomposing substance
  could induce the decomposition of other substances in contact
  with it, and after he had shown the examples cited by Liebig to
  be invalid, he continues: "We thus obtain a fictitious
  explanation by which we believe to have understood that which we
  cannot yet understand, and whereby the attention is diverted away
  from the matter to be explained which then remains all the longer
  unelucidated. I should like to repeat once again what I have
  stated so often before, namely that in Science fictitious,
  prematurely enunciated explanations invariably lead astray, and
  that the only method to obtain positive knowledge is to leave the
  incomprehensible unexplained until sooner or later the
  explanation emerges of its own accord from facts which are so
  plain that divided opinions about them can scarcely arise. Not to
  believe that there is more to be seen than can clearly and
  plainly be appreciated, and to regard the rest as material for
  further investigation, is a scientific principle which should not
  be violated but it is one which precisely those persons who are
  gifted with a lively mind and a fertile imagination find most
  difficult to follow".</p>

  <p>The last phrase refers to Liebig whose
  other views were opposed more and more by Berzelius at the same
  period although with less justification than in the present case,
  for, owing to the acceptance of Liebig's clear but not rational
  views, catalysis reached a stage of almost complete stagnation.
  Knowledge of the experimental state of affairs where catalytic
  processes are concerned was increased only in occasional isolated
  instances where the facts were too obvious to be overlooked, and
  no further progress was made in understanding them.</p>

  <p>One of those who ascertained new, relevant
  facts was, surprisingly, Liebig himself who in a masterly study,
  carried out jointly with W&ouml;hler, on the decomposition of
  amygdalin into oil of bitter almonds and sugar by an apparently
  protein-like substance occurring in almonds which they termed
  emulsin, established a typical case of a very extensive series of
  catalytic phenomena, i.e. enzyme actions.</p>

  <p>Already in 1833, however, Payen and Persoz
  had found that the transformation of starch into dextrin and
  sugar by malt discovered by Kirchhoff was attributable to the
  action of a special substance which can be extracted from
  germinated barley by water and purified by repeated precipitation
  with ethyl alcohol; they had also found that the activity is
  eliminated by heating to 100&deg;C. Yet the multiple technical
  applications to which this discovery immediately gave rise had
  occupied their attention to such an extent that they did not
  arrive to study the general aspect of the phenomenon in more
  detail. This was taken in hand in the study by Liebig and
  W&ouml;hler which Berzelius in his annual report referred to as
  the most important of the year and in which the recognized the
  analogy of the reported processes with the general catalytic
  processes which Liebig at any rate was not inclined to admit. In
  contrast to Berzelius, Liebig secured general acceptance of his
  theory of molecular collisions or vibrations, two circumstances
  being instrumental in bringing about this acceptance. On the one
  hand, in contrast to the dwindling reputation of the old master
  Berzelius, there was the growing reputation acquired at the time
  by Liebig as a result of his fundamental studies in organic
  chemistry. On the other hand, however, the time was not yet ripe
  for a rational concept of catalytic phenomena <i>because the
  concept of the rate of chemical reaction was not yet
  available</i>. By far the most frequently performed chemical
  processes in those days were those between salts, and as is
  well-known they proceed at such a fast rate that even today the
  time required has defied measurement. The few slow-rate processes
  were consequently not regarded as really typical (since, of
  course, all events, chemical ones too, require time) but rather
  as inconvenient anomalies which impeded the instantaneous
  formation of the desired substances without perceptible cause.
  Accordingly we find that the oldest scientific examination of a
  catalytic process - the admirable study by Cl&eacute;ment and
  D&eacute;sormes in 1806 of the formation of sulphuric acid under
  the action of the oxides of nitrogen which, surprisingly,
  Berzelius overlooked - accounts only uncertainly for the
  promotion of sulphurous acid oxidation by stating that the oxygen
  would be supplied to the oxidizable substance by the oxides of
  nitrogen in a more convenient or suitable form</p>

  <p>The development of a rational view of the
  nature of catalysis was thus absolutely dependent on the creation
  of the concept of the <i>rate of chemical reaction</i>. The
  concept was formulated (after an inadequate attempt by
  Berthollet) by the German amateur scientist Wilhelmy and by a
  remarkable chance (or is it the intrinsic logic of historical
  evolution?) the first paper to submit a proper concept of the
  rate of chemical reaction also constitutes the first quantitative
  study of a process proceeding under catalytic action.</p>

  <p>The reaction in question was the
  <i>inversion of cane sugar</i>. The name originates from a prior
  study by Biot and Persoz who used the polarimeter designed by the
  former and established that the solution of cane sugar which
  rotates the polarization plane of light to the right, rotates it
  to the left on the addition of a dilute acid. It was found
  chemically that cane sugar absorbs the elements of water and
  changes into a mixture of two different sugars, one being weakly
  dextrorotatory and the other strongly laevorotatory, hence the
  resultant is a rotation to the left. At the same time these
  workers observed that the process is not completed
  instantaneously but requires a period of time varying with the
  nature and concentration of the added acid as well as with the
  temperature; Biot who, as a physicist, was more readily inclined
  than all the chemists of his day (Wilhelmy too was a physicist)
  to regard the observed phenomenon as a systematic transient
  process, also pointed out the importance of a more thorough
  investigation of these phenomena. However, only Wilhelmy was
  sufficiently interested to undertake not only the necessary
  experiments, but in particular also the fundamental task of
  formulating <i>concepts</i>.</p>

  <p>The ratio of the amount of substance (cane
  sugar in this case) converted in a given time to the time
  required for the process he conceived and defined as a new
  concept, the <i>rate of chemical reaction</i>, recognizing its
  appropriate mathematical definition at once to be the
  differential quotient of the amount of substance with respect to
  time. Since this parameter should be the same in any portion of a
  reacting solution, i.e. independent of the absolute amount of
  substance, the amount of substance must be related to a unit,
  e.g. volume, in other words it can most easily be conceived as a
  <i>concentration</i>.</p>

  <p>Wilhelmy then demonstrated that on the
  simplest assumption that the amount of sugar (in the sense just
  defined) converted under the given conditions in each clement of
  time is proportional to the amount remaining unchanged, there is
  a large measure of agreement between the observed changes in
  rotation and those calculated on the basis of this assumption,
  and thus he discovered the general law for the time dependence of
  the (simplest) chemical processes. It has subsequently proved to
  be the fundamental law of chemical kinetics.</p>

  <p>The influence of the acid proved to be
  (approximately) proportional to its concentration, besides being
  dependent on its chemical nature. That statement is a further
  general law, i.e. one of catalytic effect; yet in his paper
  Wilhelmy did not use or mention that concept at all but left the
  chemical aspect of the matter unsaid.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, however, we recognize that
  simultaneously with the typical case of a chemical reaction a
  typical case of catalytic effect had been studied which
  constitutes a limiting case. For, with pure water the inversion
  of cane sugar scarcely proceeds and subsequently it required very
  thorough, difficult studies before this effect and its order of
  magnitude were established.</p>

  <p>Initially Wilhelmy's paper had no
  repercussions whatsoever in Science. On the one hand there was an
  increasing number of cases of catalytic actions which, with a
  greater or lesser degree of accuracy, chemists were familiar
  with; on the other hand there was a growing knowledge of
  slow-rate chemical processes and the laws governing them. Neither
  line of development, however, had any effect on the other.
  Whereas in studies spanning practically the whole of his life,
  Sch&ouml;nbein, for example, discovered the most variegated and
  surprising cases of catalysis and notified them to his
  reluctantly listening colleagues (who in those days had devoted
  all their energies to the problems of producing and classifying
  organic compounds), expressly pointing out the inability of
  contemporary science to comprehend them, he still held that those
  processes are initiated solely by the catalysts. He was totally
  lacking the idea of the chemical rate and therefore the concept
  of chemical acceleration as well, hence his contribution to the
  knowledge of catalysis was restricted to collating a profusion of
  material highly interesting owing to its unexpectedness. And yet
  a number of chemical reactions, from which the concept of
  chemical rate and the laws of chemical kinetics were developed
  even in more complex cases, were of catalytic nature without
  particular attention being paid to that fact. The conditions were
  hence such that sooner or later both lines of research had
  necessarily to combine and it was my personal good fortune that I
  was able to apply the finishing touch.</p>

  <p>Initially I had merely been endeavouring to
  find a quantitative measure for the concept of chemical affinity,
  a concept every bit as important as it was imprecise in those
  days, and following (unwittingly at the time) a train of ideas
  enunciated by Cato Guldberg I had envisaged both static or
  equilibrium methods as well as dynamic methods for this purpose,
  based on the measurement of rates of reaction. From the
  literature of organic chemistry, of which I had to keep track in
  the exercise of my teaching duties, I remembered several cases in
  which for preparative purposes esters had been broken down into
  acid and alcohol by the action of strong acids, e.g. hydrochloric
  or sulphuric acid in concentrated form. To be able to use aqueous
  solutions I resorted to those esters which are quite readily
  soluble in water, and I can still recall the joyous excitement
  with which for the first time I followed the rapid rise in the
  acid titre in an aqueous solution of common acetic ester to which
  hydrochloric acid had been added. Methyl acetate proved even more
  suitable owing to its greater solubility and faster reaction
  rate, and so one of my first studies in chemical dynamics, in
  1883, dealt right away with a catalytic process, i.e. the
  catalytic saponification of this particular ester under the
  action of various acids.</p>

  <p>This is not the place to describe the
  development of the affinity problem, especially the measurement
  of the "strength" of acids, which were then the actual object of
  my studies. It need only be mentioned that the sought-for
  relation between the static and dynamic methods proved real, and
  the "strength" was acknowledged to be a common property of the
  particular acids independent of the nature of the special
  reaction. Soon afterwards I studied the inversion of sugar in the
  light of these considerations and immediately found that this
  classical reaction, too, was determined quantitatively by the
  same property of the acids, as was of course to be expected from
  the previous results.</p>

  <p>These studies showed up incontrovertibly
  the close relation between the strength of the acids and their
  catalytic action, and I searched for other acid catalyses with a
  view to studying this relation further on as impartial material
  as possible. Certain oxidation and reduction processes which, in
  contrast to salt formation and salt decomposition processes,
  proceed in finite, sometimes conveniently measurable times,
  seemed the most appropriate. The oxidation of hydrogen iodide by
  bromic acid recommended itself in that it was easily measured and
  it was the first to be carried out. It was then found that in
  contrast to the previously studied catalyses, here the reagents
  themselves interact at a measurable rate even before another
  substance has been added. In modern parlance the reaction is
  accelerated by the presence of hydrogen ions and these are
  already present in the reagents<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>;
  in those days, however, there could be no question of that
  because the study was conducted in 1887, immediately before the
  free-ion theory had been created and announced to the world.
  Inevitably, therefore, I was compelled to the view that the
  nature of catalysis is not be sought in the <i>inducement</i> of
  a reaction, but in its acceleration and the relevant publication
  of 1888 contains explicitly the corresponding mathematical
  arguments which were perhaps already implicitly embodied in the
  1883 paper on methyl acetate.</p>

  <p>I would be breaking my obligation to be
  frank - an obligation which for the historian in particular with
  regard to his own papers must have the force of the most
  inviolable law-were I to omit the observation that even at that
  time I was not particularly impressed at all by this advance.
  Physical chemistry had just entered on the stupendously fecund
  years, the way for which l had been paved by Van 't Hoff's theory
  of osmotic pressure and by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html">Arrhenius</a>' theory of
  free ions and electrolytic dissociation. Everywhere the
  traditional chemical theories were being remoulded in accordance
  with the new concepts, and new ideas and concepts had become such
  a commonplace for me and my few colleagues that little trouble
  was taken to single out each detail appropriately. It was not
  until somewhat later when I personally turned to energetics and
  thus freed myself from hypothetical ideas from which no direct,
  experimentally verifiable conclusions can be derived, that I also
  felt the need to put an end to the stagnation in which the study
  of catalytic phenomena had ended up as a result of such ideas. I
  recalled the naive drawings which a prominent worker at that time
  had published in order to "visualize" the catalytic effect of
  pounded glass on the combination of the constituents of
  detonating gas with moderate heating; the drawings showed how the
  sharp edges of the glass splinters cut the gas molecules into
  atoms which were then able to combine freely. And there was more
  of that sort of thing such as the late L&eacute;mery with his
  spikes and hooks on the atoms. I therefore took the opportunity
  offered to me by many reports, etc. to combat those injurious
  hypotheses and draw attention to the incomparably greater
  effectiveness of the simple definition of catalysis based on
  measurable facts which states that catalysis is a chemical
  acceleration brought about by the presence of substances which do
  not appear in the reaction product. A few general conclusions, a
  deanship programme and a widely read paper which I gave in 1901
  at the Hamburg Natural Scientists' Convention completed this side
  of the task. Its necessity emerged quite clearly at that meeting,
  for in the chemical literature of those days it is not uncommon
  to encounter the comment "that the name catalysis is not an
  explanation of these processes", and that comment was to be taken
  as a reason for rejecting the concept in question. As though
  Berzelius had not already pointed out how a premature and
  overhasty attempt at elucidation without proper experimental
  evidence must have a damaging effect on how the issue develops ;
  as though the half-century that had elapsed in the meantime had
  not afforded continuous proof of the absolute correctness of
  Berzelius' warning by its barrenness in this sector with its
  later glut of fruits!</p>

  <p>It is appropriate here to examine in terms
  of catalysis the relation of Berzelius' definition as given above
  to that found here. The outcome of this examination can be
  predicted right away: Berzelius had in fact done practically
  everything possible in keeping with the viewpoints of his age to
  characterize the essential nature of these processes.</p>

  <p>Since he had no concept for the difference
  between slow-rate and fast-rate chemical processes, he denoted
  states with the intrinsic capacity (the necessary excess of free
  energy) to change into other states by the symbolic term "dormant
  affinities". By stating that a re-arrangement takes place in the
  sense of a <i>greater electrochemical neutralization</i> he
  points out, however, that a state of higher equilibrium or lower
  free energy is attained, i.e. the process cannot occur in
  conflict with the second law of thermodynamics (a not infrequent,
  implicit assumption of the contemporary critics of that concept).
  Only the statement that the catalysts acted by their <i>mere
  presence</i> and not by their affinity can be criticized. In
  contrast none of the profounder theories of catalysis allowing
  for causal circumstances, some of which have recently been
  advanced and others revived, has prospered better than Clement
  and D&eacute;sormes' theory of <i>intermediate reactions</i>. This
  is based precisely on the participation of the catalyst in the
  reactions actually occurring, in the sum of which, however, the
  catalyst is not directly involved, although the partial reactions
  contain the catalyst as a major chemical component of the
  process. I have already stressed that there is no decisive reason
  to assume that all catalyses can be attributed to such
  intermediate reactions; yet it must be conceded that no other
  equally effective principle has hitherto been found in the theory
  of catalysis.</p>

  <p>In sum, therefore, it may be stated that
  Berzelius' definition had almost attained the acme of perfection
  possible in his day but the most important concept for a
  successful mastery in theoretical terms of the overall phenomenon
  was still lacking. Presumably this is the main reason why, in the
  struggle for survival, Liebig's much less perfect but explicit
  definition (although giving rise to a <i>false</i> opinion) had
  provisionally been victorious. At that time, when a scientific
  treatment of catalysis was still impracticable, the advantages of
  Berzelius' definition could not be shown to full effect, and it
  was only after the necessary conditions had been created that the
  methodical tact of the great Swedish scientist became brilliantly
  apparent.</p>

  <p>Conversely, in view of these facts, I need
  waste no words in stating that individual scientists who were
  apparently of the opinion that all that is required to become a
  historian of chemistry is an acquaintance with old chemical books
  and texts refused to recognize in the remoulded concept of
  catalysis a repetition of Berzelius' or Liebig's definition. The
  distinction between the old and the new formulations consisting
  in the incorporation of the concept of the rate of chemical
  reactions is so great that it immediately asserted itself in the
  objective development of catalysis.</p>

  <p>Although neither Berzelius' good definition
  nor Liebig's bad definition promoted in any way the development
  of this scientifically interesting and technically highly
  important field, the new definition had that effect at once.</p>

  <p>At first, of course, this effect was felt
  in the rather restricted sphere within which the new concept had
  arisen. For me personally the advent of this field of study came
  after I had completed extremely urgent tidying-up and
  construction work which had been necessitated by the introduction
  of the above-mentioned new, fundamental ideas into general
  chemistry at a period of my life when, after ten years' assiduous
  and unstinting work at these tasks I was experiencing profound
  exhaustion for the first time. I remember how, shortly before,
  Lothar Meyer had urgently warned against overworking since he
  himself had experienced its malicious consequences. (Not
  withstanding every sympathy of his fine, pleasing nature with the
  sudden development of the scientific field to which he had
  devoted his main life's work, he could not suppress a certain
  uneasy feeling that the direction of this development was totally
  outside the path which he had regarded as the most promising and
  therefore the most likely.) At the time I answered him with the
  rashness and enthusiasm of youth that it was more important to
  center universal interest on the whole matter as quickly as
  possible than to keep a single individual in a fit state for
  later work by sparing one's person. For even if I were worn out
  after a few years, so many young, fresh workers would have taken
  over from me in the meantime that the loss of my personal
  contribution would be replaced many times over, while conversely
  these selfsame workers, more valuable because of their greater
  energy, would be lacking because they would not have been
  attracted to the new field by a burning interest of the day.</p>

  <p>I have to confess that at the time the
  actual significance of such exhaustion brought about by keenly
  assiduous work was not very clear to me, so that I made that
  self-sacrifice with a certain amount of awareness, of course, yet
  without precise foreknowledge of its consequences. Nevertheless,
  I believe that even had I been better aware of the future in
  store for me, I would not have acted very differently since the
  logic of the consideration just mentioned is clearly not
  affected.</p>

  <p>At all events Lothar Meyer's warning went
  unheeded and the consequences which he had predicted came about a
  few years later. The worst manifestations of exhaustion were
  successfully cured by a long period of rest but it was
  immediately apparent to me that I had lost once and for all my
  former capacity for carrying out experimental work until
  physically tired. It thus came about that although towards the
  end of the 1890's my colleagues and pupils had begun on a wide
  scale to investigate catalytic phenomena, I myself was almost
  unable to take an active, personal part in the experimental work
  involved. A few years later, for reasons which I shall not
  disclose here, I had to renounce altogether my university
  professorship. In the interim the suggestions which I had made
  before then bore rich fruit and of my former colleagues I would
  single out G. Bredig as having made a manifold, successful
  contribution to the new field. At the same time biology, too,
  gave closer attention to the problem of catalysis, which is, of
  course, one of the organism's main agencies for an enormous
  variety of purposes, and again the kinetic definition proved
  superior to all other attempted generalizations, some of which
  were more figurative than objective.</p>

  <p>The point of these considerations is that
  in fact the situations to which reference has been made were
  conducive to a favourable evolution of science. It would be idle
  to speculate how they might, perhaps, have been otherwise; in
  contrast it is important that we have been able to convince
  ourselves that the present state is healthy and requires no
  special intervention or guidance whatsoever. The only debatable
  point might be whether the <i>speed</i> of the evolution is fully
  consistent with the importance of the subject; for all that,
  however, we know from catalysis how easily the intervention of a
  specific catalyst in the form, say, of a new universal
  conception, or else of a young research worker gifted with
  unusual creative powers, can increase the speed to a
  multiple.</p>

  <p>At any rate, faced with this situation, I
  felt obliged to describe its antecedents and to say a further few
  words about my personal circumstances. The unusual distinction to
  which I am indebted for the opportunity to speak here has also
  generated a certain degree of objective interest in the
  conditions which nurtured the studies considered worthy of such a
  distinction, and in the consequences ensuing for the workers
  themselves. When I consider the flourishing state of the field in
  question I can find no justification for the regrets or
  reproaches which from time to time have been addressed to me for
  abandoning this work. Only yesterday in Kocher's report on his
  fundamental studies of the functions of the thyroid gland and its
  accessory organs we heard an account of the effect of the
  secretions from this "chemical apparatus" on man, its carrier,
  which are an excellent example of how catalysts function in the
  organism. The old contrasts of the classical "temperaments",
  reducible to the contrast between the slow and the quick, appear
  in this connection to be a result of the quantitative proportion
  of two opposing catalysts. Since the proof for the importance of
  the new field is forthcoming in so unsought-for and at the same
  time in so fundamental a manner, there cannot be any shadow of
  doubt about the flourishing future of such concepts. Turning to
  the personal side I should like to comment as follows.</p>

  <p>The most general and positive result of the
  study of the brain in recent decennia has been the doctrine of
  the localization of the separate functions. It might well be
  argued that this proof was really superfluous for it conflicts
  with the first principles of logic to assume the existence of a
  multiplicity of intellectual functions without attributing to
  them correspondingly distinct multiplicity in their organ.
  Nevertheless, the experimental proof is so much more convincing
  than such a general consideration that great weight attaches to
  it in any case. Furthermore it proves the <i>individual</i>
  relation whereas the general consideration has to stop short at
  the details.</p>

  <p>In the light of this theory we now
  understand how certain parts of the brain are so worn out by
  excessive strain that subsequently they only function much less
  perfectly than before. The individual organs follow the same
  pattern as the whole organism, i.e. they have their period of
  growth, of stationary, maximum activity and then of aging
  decline. In specific circumstances the period of aging decline
  can set in earlier in a particular organ than in the organism as
  a whole which, in a certain general or theoretical sense, is left
  a <i>cripple</i> or <i>invalid</i>. I have repeatedly stressed in
  the past that this selfsame, extremely heavy strain imposed by
  research most readily produces this type of partial invalid and
  in respect of certain functions which I could once perform
  perfectly, I must count myself such an invalid.</p>

  <p>It is not without painful emotions that I
  make such an avowal although these emotions are much less painful
  if the realisation is <i>one's own</i> than if conveyed by
  <i>another person</i>. And there is a comforting side to this
  acknowledgement, namely that although individual fields have been
  exhausted, <i>other</i> fields have been left untouched to a
  proportionately greater extent precisely on account of the
  one-sidedness of the former activity which caused the damage. In
  other words, when such a contingency arises the afflicted person
  has to look for activities which he would earlier have liked to
  pursue but could not, owing to the inexorable demands of the day,
  and it is highly probable that he will find fields in which he
  will be able to perform work which not only occupies his time and
  affords him a need-felt satisfaction but possibly is of almost
  equal value to his achievements in what is now an exhausted
  specialist field.</p>

  <p>To illustrate with a practical example the
  form that such a change-over can take, I would like to mention
  that the general or philosophical side of my speciality and also
  the general problems of Science as a whole interested me from the
  very beginning. When, in about 1880, I prepared the first draft
  schemes for systematizing the then still completely chaotic
  subject of general chemistry, I knew of no better way to aid
  myself than by attempting simultaneously to formulate a universal
  system for all sciences. After the specifically chemical scope
  had been exhausted to the point where it yielded only a slow and
  meagre harvest I reverted, instinctively at first but then
  consciously, to the field where in fact I had already carried out
  quite considerable preliminary work, although that had only been
  published occasionally and in passing. Hence it was only
  necessary to make my subsidiary work my main work in order first
  subjectively to eliminate the cheerless feeling of being an
  invalid, and second objectively to derive from what remained to
  me as much useful work as possible in the prevailing
  circumstances. I would like to outline below a part of this work
  which is closely related to the special problem forming the main
  theme of this paper<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The part to which I am referring concerns
  the general issue of the types of scientific discoveries that are
  actually known and possible. The general assumption of
  <i>coherence of the world</i>, which as we know forms the basis
  of all science, provides the means to survey such types. Whether
  that coherence obtains universally is a question that need not be
  answered here since only those parts where the coherence has
  actually been found become part of Science.</p>

  <p>The existence of this coherence, and thus
  the most general problem of Science, can be expressed as the
  general function equation</p>

  <p align="center"><i>F(a,b,c,d...) = 0</i></p>

  <p>Increasing specialization of the general
  equation yields the types of scientific discoveries being
  sought.</p>

  <p>We know to start with that in theory at
  least each object is related to every other but that, owing to
  the presence of the <i>threshold</i>, i.e. the limited acuity of
  our sensory perceptions (even of such that are sharpened by
  instruments), the practical proof of existing relations is rather
  narrowly restricted. It thus follows that whereas in principle
  the above equation should relate to the whole Universe; for
  Science the general equation breaks down into a large number of
  <i>partial equations</i>, each applicable only to a finite number
  of objects <i>a,b,c</i>... It might be mentioned in passing that
  there is no need at all for these objects to be of the more
  specific character of <i>magnitudes</i>; it is sufficient for
  them to be <i>objects</i>, i.e. distinguishable one from
  another.</p>

  <p>Here arises the first task, which is to
  become familiar with the objects <i>a,b,c</i>... that are
  interrelated. The botanist, for example, studying the plants of a
  particular area establishes such a relation. This problem fills
  the deficit in the class of descriptive sciences in the stricter
  sense. Each group so related gives an appropriate concept, the
  characteristics, symbols or attributes of which are none other
  than the objects <i>a,b,c</i>...</p>

  <p>Apart from this task, the simplest, there
  is also the complementary task of proving that the function F is
  closed, in other words that no objects other than <i>a,b,c</i>
  and <i>d</i> are contained in the relation concerned. These
  relations are especially important in that they define the
  <i>natural invariants</i>, i.e. the objects which remain within
  the scope of the term in all circumstances. The chief such case
  is that of <i>energy</i> where it has been acknowledged that the
  sum total of this magnitude cannot be modified by any process
  whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Where the objects <i>a,b,c,</i> etc. are
  not simple but themselves contain many symbols (that is to say,
  that they are compound or complex concepts), further
  investigation can be made into special relations between these
  attributes of the concepts. The chief case arises where the
  objects are <i>measurable</i> in that a number can be assigned to
  them which establishes their <i>value</i>, i.e. quite definite
  relations to objects of the same kind. There, in each definite
  case of the function <i>F(a, b,c ...)</i>, definite values belong
  to its terms and to determine this <i>quantitative</i> relation
  is the corresponding scientific task. An example is the gas
  equation <i>pv - RT = 0</i>, which defines the behaviour of an
  ideal gas as a function of the various pressures, volumes,
  amounts and temperatures.</p>

  <p>The problem of determining such a relation
  is generally solved by selecting two of the parameters which are
  variable and varying them while maintaining all others constant.
  This is done with all the terms <i>a,b,c,</i> etc. in pairs until
  sufficient single equations have been obtained to formulate the
  overall equation.</p>

  <p>The number of single equations necessary is
  invariably less than that of the possible binary combinations.
  After the necessary number of single equations has been found, it
  is therefore always possible to form further pairs of relations
  (and, of course, ternary and higher if the number of independent
  variables is greater) the form and content of which is also
  defined by the single equations that have been established,
  without the need for special experimental study of them. This is
  termed the <i>deductive</i> process. Plainly it is not consistent
  with the traditional definition of deduction but is in fact the
  only process known to, and used by, science to derive unknown
  from known relations.</p>

  <p>Faced with this general consideration it
  will immediately be realized on inquiry into the particular
  position occupied within this general scheme by the scientific
  field of <i>catalysis</i> that it is in the <i>first</i> stages
  of its development. At present the main task is still essentially
  to discover and scientifically to establish the various cases of
  catalysis. For the moment it is still scarcely possible to
  summarize these cases systematically or decide which types of
  reaction are catalysed, and the relation between the chemical
  nature of the catalyst and that of the reagents. For catalysis
  based on intermediate reactions, however, it is possible to state
  that the substances must be related in a way favourable to the
  occurrence of such possible intermediate reactions which proceed
  collectively at a much faster rate than the immediate or main
  reaction. It will hence be abundantly clear again that a special
  problem of chemical kinetics is involved in the special case of
  these catalyses and that until a way has been found whereby a
  rate of chemical reaction can generally be calculated in advance
  as a function of the chemical nature of the reagents and perhaps
  of the special form of the reaction equation, the catalysis
  problem cannot satisfactorily be answered.</p>

  <p>Consequently, even in this personal special
  case, the great unity of all science stands out decisively as a
  general regulative principle.</p>
