  <h1>James Cronin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cronin.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on September 29, 1931 in
  Chicago, Illinois, while my father, James Farley Cronin, was a
  graduate student at the University of Chicago. He was a student
  of classical languages. My mother, Dorothy Watson, had met my
  father in a Greek class at Northwestern University. After a brief stay at a
  small school in Alabama, my father became Professor of Latin and
  Greek at Southern
  Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, in September 1939. My
  primary and secondary education was provided by the Highland Park
  Public School System. I received my undergraduate degree from
  Southern Methodist University with a major in physics and
  mathematics in 1951. In high school my natural interest in
  science was encouraged by an excellent physics teacher, Mr.
  Charles H. Marshall. He stressed analytical methods as applied to
  simple physical systems as well as practical experimental
  problems.<br>
  <br>
  My real education began when I entered the University of
  Chicago in September 1951 as a graduate student. I was
  fortunate to have among my classroom teachers, <a href=
  "../1938/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a>, <a href=
  "../1963/index.html">Maria Mayer</a>, Edward Teller, Gregor
  Wentzel, Val Telegdi, Marvin Goldberger and <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Murray Gell-Mann</a>. I did a thesis in
  experimental nuclear physics under the direction of Samuel K.
  Allison. While at Chicago my interest in the new field of
  particle physics was stimulated by a course given by Gell- Mann,
  who was developing his ideas about Strangeness at the time.<br>
  <br>
  It was also at the University of Chicago that I met my future
  wife, Annette Martin, in the summer of 1953. It was a wonderful,
  happy summer; I had passed my Ph.D. qualifying exams the previous
  winter, and I realized that I had met my lifetime companion. We
  were married in September 1954. The stable point in my life
  became our home. On even the worst days, when nothing was working
  at the lab, I knew that at home I would find warmth, peace,
  companionship, and encouragement. As a consequence, the next day
  would surely be better. Annette, with great patience and good
  spirit, tolerated my many long absences when experiments were
  carried out at distant laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  After receiving my Ph.D. in 1955 I had the opportunity to join
  the group of Rodney Cool and Oreste Piccioni who were working at
  the Brookhaven
  Cosmotron, a newly completed 3 GeV accelerator. That period
  was an exciting time in physics. The famous tau-teta puzzle led
  to the prediction of parity violation and the experimental
  demonstration of its violation. The long-lived K meson was
  discovered at Brookhaven.<br>
  <br>
  When the violation of parity was discovered I began a series of
  electronic experiments to investigate parity violation in hyperon
  decays. In early 1958 the Cosmotron suffered a severe magnet
  failure. As a consequence, we moved our experiment to the
  Berkeley Bevatron. Here I had the good fortune to meet William
  Wenzel and Bruce Cork. These physicists had a great influence on
  me. From their example I learned not to be intimidated by complex
  pieces of apparatus.<br>
  <br>
  While at Brookhaven I met Val Fitch who was responsible for my
  coming to Princeton University in the fall of 1958. At Princeton
  all the work in particle physics was supported through a contract
  with the Office of Naval Research. The Director of the
  Laboratory, George Reynolds, was most supportive of my efforts to
  work independently. There followed for ten years a glorious time
  for research. I was much involved in the development of the spark
  chamber as a practical research tool. During this period, with a
  series of excellent students, we further studied hyperon decays.
  Then we joined with Val Fitch to study neutral K meson decays
  which led to the discovery of CP violation.<br>
  <br>
  Following the discovery in the summer of 1964, I spent a year in
  France working at the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires at Saclay with
  Rene Turlay. In addition to the research, I enjoyed learning
  French and assimilating the culture of another country. One of
  the greatest joys in my life was giving a lecture in French at
  the College de France.<br>
  <br>
  On returning to Princeton in 1965, I began with students a series
  of experiments to study the neutral CP violating decay modes of
  the long lived neutral K meson. These experiments lasted until
  1971. In 1971 I returned to the University of Chicago as
  Professor of Physics. The fact that the new Fermilab 400 GeV
  Accelerator was being built near Chicago made this move an
  attractive one. At Fermilab, with younger associates and
  students, I carried out experiments on the production of
  particles at high transverse momentum, and on the production of
  direct leptons. At present with my colleague at Chicago, Bruce
  Winstein, I am preparing to study with much greater accuracy some
  of the CP violating parameters of the neutral K meson.<br>
  <br>
  I now live in Chicago near the campus with my wife Annette, and
  son Daniel. My oldest daughter Cathryn lives and works in New
  York City. My daughter Emily attends the University of Minnesota.
  My mother remained in Dallas, Texas, after the death of my father
  in 1959. For recreation we have a cabin in the woods in Wisconsin
  which we visit year-round. In the summer we spend some time in
  Aspen, Colorado. Our whole family assembles in Chicago at
  Christmas and usually in Aspen in the summer.</p>
