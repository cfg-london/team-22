  <h1>Roderick MacKinnon - Biographical</h1>              
<p><img src="mackinnon.jpg" class="bio-img">I 
                was born on February 19, 1956 in the middle of a snowstorm. It 
                remains one of those humorous family stories that my mother likes 
                to tell. My father the planner had rehearsed the way to the hospital 
                but apparently things looked a lot different at night in a blizzard. 
                Eventually they made it and so did I, the fourth of seven children. 
                My father was a postal worker when I was very young but studied 
                computers and became a programmer on the big IBM main frames. 
                My mother worked as a part time schoolteacher, but mostly took 
                care of the children at home. Thinking back on it now I know we 
                did not have much money but I never knew that growing up. My parents 
                provided a happy environment and made their expectations clear 
                to us. Television is bad for you, reading is good for you, and 
                you better get an A for effort in school. What you end up doing 
                in life is up to you. Just make sure you enjoy what you do because 
                then you will do it well. We all pursued completely different 
                walks of life. I became the scientist.</p>
              <p>I suppose there were some early indications 
                of my tendency to a life of curiosity. Apparently from a very 
                young age I had a habit of asking lots of questions: 'what would 
                happen if.?' was a favorite. And I liked having facts straight 
                and knowing how things work and did not hesitate to give explanations 
                to those around me, apparently to an annoying degree sometimes. 
                I remember one day my father, at the end of his patience, commenting 
                that I was a 'compendium of useless information'. I certainly 
                can understand his plight with one of the seven having way too 
                many questions and answers all the time. On the positive side, 
                I learned a new word that day when I looked up compendium in the 
                dictionary.</p>
              <p>There were probably even indications that 
                my curiosity might be scientific. Burlington Massachusetts was 
                rural when I was young and I loved to roam and explore. I had 
                rock collections and read children's books on geology and the 
                history of the earth. I made little volcanoes out of plaster of 
                paris and added baking soda and vinegar to the craters to simulate 
                volcanic eruptions. I had an accident one day that made my mother 
                laugh to my utter frustration: at that young age I failed to appreciate 
                the humor in a little boy telling his mother he had dropped a 
                volcano on his toe! In the summer I collected butterflies, turtles, 
                snakes and other living things. One summer my mother enrolled 
                me in a science enrichment class for elementary school students 
                and I was allowed to take home a microscope. I used it to look 
                at everything I could find: microorganisms from the nearby pond, 
                leaves and blades of grass. I spent hour after hour alone, mesmerized 
                by the tiny little things that I could see.</p>
              <p>My scientific curiosity took a back seat to 
                athletics through junior high and high school. Gymnastics was 
                a good match to my small build and to my solitary nature. I was 
                a member of a team but gymnastics is an individual sport. You 
                learn a technique, then a 'move', and then a 'routine'. And then 
                you perfect it through practice, working mostly alone. I had a 
                very good no nonsense teacher, coach Hayes, who really instilled 
                in me the idea of perfection through practice. I was actually 
                not all that bad, particularly at floor exercise and high bar. 
                I even considered pursuing gymnastics in college, but during my 
                final year of high school I began to wonder what I should pursue 
                for a career.</p>
              <p>I attended the University of Massachusetts 
                in Boston for one year and then transferred to Brandeis University. 
                Brandeis was an eye opening experience for me. For the first time 
                in my life I was in a seriously intellectual environment. The 
                classes tended to be small, intense, and stimulating. I discovered 
                that I had a passion for science, and that I was very good at 
                it. I chose Biochemistry as a major and a newly arrived assistant 
                professor named Chris Miller for my honors thesis advisor. He 
                had a little laboratory with big windows and lots of light shining 
                in. I studied calcium transport and learned about the cell membrane 
                as an electrode. I could see that Chris Miller was a man having 
                lots of fun in his daily life and it was inspiring to me, and 
                the memory of this stayed with me. But the biggest influence Brandeis 
                had on my life happened in Physics class. There I met my future 
                wife Alice Lee, whose sparkling eyes and sharp mind caught my 
                attention.</p>
              <p>Against Chris Miller's advice I went to medical 
                school after Brandeis. I studied at Tufts University School of 
                Medicine and then at Beth Israel Hospital Boston for house officer 
                training in Internal Medicine. I learned a lot but in the end 
                I should have taken Chris' advice to pursue science. Medicine 
                required a lot of memorization and little analytical problem solving. 
                To keep a certain part of my brain active I began to study mathematics, 
                and continue this even today, learning new methods and solving 
                problems with the same disciplined approach I had learned in gymnastics. 
                I started back to science near the end of house officer training 
                working with Jim Morgan studying calcium in cardiac muscle contractility, 
                which was very enjoyable and kept me connected to medicine. But 
                I had a yearning to work on a very basic science problem, which 
                meant I would have to break my medical ties. This was a difficult 
                decision because I had invested so many years in medical education; 
                to abandon it was to admit to myself that I had misspent a big 
                piece of my life. And there were practical considerations as well. 
                It was time finally to get a permanent job; after all, my wife 
                Alice had supported me through years of training. Not to mention 
                I was nearly 30 years old with no real basic science training 
                beyond my Brandeis undergraduate education: would I even be able 
                to make it as a scientist?</p>

      </p>
              <p>Two factors had the greatest influence on 
                my decision. Back in my first year of medical school I lost my 
                sister Elley, an artist only two years my senior. Diagnosed with 
                leukemia during my hematology clerkship as I learned about the 
                dreaded disease, she lasted only two months. This horrifying event 
                impressed upon me how fragile and precious life is, and how 
                important it is to seize the moment and enjoy what you do while 
                you can. I remember thinking when I look back upon my life at 
                the age of seventy, thirty will seem young: just go for it. And 
                the second factor was Alice. She had complete faith in my ability 
                to succeed. Never mind that postdoctoral studies meant a reduction 
                of my already piddling house officer salary. She simply said you 
                have no choice; we will manage somehow.</p>
              <p>Memories of Chris Miller's laboratory beckoned 
                so I returned for postdoctoral studies. Of course I will never 
                out live his reminding me that I should have listened to him in 
                the first place. Feeling far behind in my knowledge I approached 
                my postdoctoral studies with intensity, learning techniques and 
                theory. I felt I should be an expert in electrochemistry, stochastic 
                processes, linear systems theory, and many more subjects. I read 
                books, solved the problem sets, mastered the subjects, and carried 
                out experiments. I had the very good fortune of a coworker Jacques 
                Neyton, a postdoctoral scientist from France. Jacques is a very 
                critical thinker who would brood on a problem. We exchanged ideas 
                often. When I would tell him one of my ideas he had a tendency 
                just to listen quietly. Then, after a while, if his response started 
                with 'Hey Roddy, there's something I don't understand' I knew 
                I was in trouble - my idea was probably no good!</p>
              <p>After I completed a series of biophysical 
                studies on K<sup>+</sup> channels it came time to apply for an 
                academic position. During the late 1980s physiology departments 
                were more interested in hiring channel gene cloners than bio-physicists. 
                But Peter Hess convinced his colleagues at Harvard that my work 
                showed promise and I was offered an assistant professorship there. 
                My laboratory made good progress on K+ channels. It was exciting 
                for a while but in just a few years I began to feel that the return 
                on what we could learn from studying the functional effects of 
                mutations was diminishing. We had identified the K<sup>+</sup> channel signature 
                sequence, but without knowing its structure we never would understand 
                the chemical principles of ion selectivity in K<sup>+</sup> channels. I decided 
                at that point to learn X-ray crystallography to someday see a 
                K<sup>+</sup> channel.</p>

      </p>
              <p>I began to learn methods of protein purification 
                and X-ray crystallography while still at Harvard, initially working 
                with channel toxins and a small soluble protein called a PDZ domain. 
                However, I thought it best to move away from my familiar environment 
                at Harvard to pursue channel structure. There were really two 
                reasons motivating me to move. First was the practical issue of 
                obtaining funding to work in an area in which I had no background: 
                start-up funds associated with moving to a new university would 
                be useful for this purpose. The second and far more important 
                reason was that moving would enable me to immerse myself completely 
                in the new endeavor. A change of environment would remove the 
                distractions of everyday life, isolate me from the temptation 
                to fall back on channel physiology studies that I was already 
                good at, and allow me to focus with singular purpose on the structural 
                studies. I needed this to become an expert in membrane protein 
                biochemistry and X-ray crystallography, and to develop a 'feel' 
                for protein structure. When the president of Rockefeller University 
                <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1981/index.html">Torsten Wiesel</a> 
                heard about my scientific plans he suggested that I move to Rockefeller 
                University and I did. Rockefeller provided a wonderful environment 
                for concentrating on a difficult problem.</p>
              <p>It has been said that giving up my already 
                successful lab at Harvard in order to pursue the structure of 
                a K<sup>+</sup> channel was a risky thing to do. At the time I was told that 
                my aspirations were altogether unrealistic. From my perspective 
                I had little choice because I wanted to understand K<sup>+</sup> selectivity 
                and I knew that the atomic structure provided the only path to 
                understanding. I would rather fail trying than never try at all. 
                It helped that I was accustomed to making transitions and had 
                become good at teaching myself new subjects. I have to admit that 
                few people working with me at the time wanted much to do with 
                the new endeavor - only one new postdoctoral scientist Declan 
                Doyle was enthusiastic. My wife Alice, an organic chemist, saw 
                that I was going to be pretty lonely and decided to join me in 
                the lab. And to my good fortune she has worked with me since. 
                I have learned that most people do not like change but I do. For 
                me change is challenging, good for creativity, and it definitely 
                keeps life interesting.</p>
              <p>I think of the past eight years of my life 
                in New York at Rockefeller University as a personal odyssey. The 
                new laboratory started out very small, with only Declan, Alice 
                and me. But it grew in the first year with the addition of other 
                enthusiastic postdoctoral scientists, including João Morais Cabral 
                and John Imredy. Working with membrane proteins was very difficult 
                as expected. We had our periods of despair, but every time we 
                felt left without options something good happened and despair 
                gave way to excitement. Persistence and dedication eventually 
                paid off. The atomic structure of the K+ selectivity filter was 
                more informative and more beautiful than I ever could have imagined. 
                My laboratory now is an incredible place, overflowing with excitement 
                and ideas sustained by the continual infusion of bright young 
                scientists who come from around the world to work with me. It 
                gives me great satisfaction to know that these young scientists 
                who are sophisticated in their knowledge of protein chemistry 
                and structure will lead the field of ion channel research into 
                the future. This has been a wonderful adventure. I owe thanks 
                for the life I have: to Alice, to all my loving family of MacKinnons 
                and Lees, to my scientific family of students, postdocs and colleagues, 
                to senior colleagues who have helped me along my way to pursue 
                my passion, and to the Rockefeller University, the Howard Hughes 
                Medical Institute, and the National Institutes of Health for their 
                support. I am very thankful for my life as a scientist, for the 
                opportunity to understand in some small way the world around me. 
                I hope my best experiment and scientific ideas are yet to come. 
                This hope keeps me going.</p>
