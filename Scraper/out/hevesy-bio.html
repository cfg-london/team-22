  <h1>George de Hevesy - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hevesy.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George de Hevesy</b> was born in
  Budapest on August 1st, 1885, the son of Louis de Hevesy, Court
  Counsellor and Eug&eacute;nie, n&eacute;e Baroness Schosberger. After
  matriculating at the Gymnasium of the Piarist Order in 1903 he
  studied at Budapest
  University and Berlin Technical University and he gained his
  doctor's degree at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau in 1908.
  He worked for two years as an assistant at the Institute of
  Physical Chemistry, Technical University of Switzerland before
  having a short spell with Professor <a href=
  "../1918/index.html">Fritz Haber</a> when he was able to witness
  much of the fundamental work of Haber and Rossignol on ammonia
  synthesis. He travelled to England in 1910 to study under
  Professor <a href="../1908/index.html">Ernest Rutherford</a> at
  Manchester. He interrupted early in 1913 his studies to carry out
  jointly with Frederic Paneth the first radioactive-tracer
  experiment at the Vienna Institute of Radium Research. During his
  stay in Vienna he obtained the Venia Legendi in the University of
  Budapest. In 1915 he was drafted into the Austrian-Hungarian
  Army. After the end of the war he was teaching for 6 months in
  the University of
  Budapest and left the spring of 1919 for Copenhagen to
  discuss his future activities at <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>'s Institute
  which was to be erected. In 1920 he settled in Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
  Six years later he returned to Freiburg as Professor of Physical
  Chemistry. In 1930 he was appointed Baker Lecturer at Cornell University,
  Ithaca. Four years later he took up again his activities at Niels
  Bohr's Institute which he terminated in 1952. He was domiciled in
  Stockholm since 1943 and was an Associate of the Institute of
  Research in Organic Chemistry. In 1949 he was elected Franqui
  Professor in the University of Ghent. In his retirement, he remains
  an active scientific associate of the University of
  Stockholm.<br>
  <br>
  His early investigations involved a study of the chemical
  behaviour of molten salts and his introduction to practical
  radiochemistry came in Rutherford's laboratories at Manchester.
  His work there, and later in Vienna and Budapest, mainly
  concerned the investigation and use of radium and lead
  isotopes.<br>
  <br>
  In Copenhagen, de Hevesy's researches were initially concerned
  with isotopic separations and in 1923, together with Coster, he
  discovered the element hafnium. He was responsible for pioneer
  work in the use of isotopic indicators both in inorganic and life
  sciences and later, in Freiburg, he was involved in the first
  clinical use of isotopes. On his return to Copenhagen, he
  demonstrated the formation of new artificially radioactive
  isotopes and subsequently introduced a method of activation
  analysis based on neutron bombardment of the element to be
  investigated. This method was to replace X-ray analysis with
  fluorescent X-rays which he introduced during his stay in
  Freiburg. The year 1934 saw the beginning of numerous
  investigations in the field of plant and animal physiology, using
  labelled atoms: these researches were supported by generous
  grants made by the Carlsberg Foundation, the Rask-&Oslash;rsted
  Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and others. His work in
  Sweden has continued on the same lines and he has studied,
  amongst other things, the effect of X-rays on the formation of
  nucleic acid in tumours and in normal organs, and iron transport
  in healthy and cancerous organisms; this work is supported by the
  Swedish State Research Council and the Wallenberg
  Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Professor de Hevesy is the author of several important books on
  radiochemistry and his many scientific papers are valuable and
  accurate records of devoted work. He was awarded the Cannizaro
  Prize (Academy of Sciences, Rome) in 1929, he was the Copley
  Medallist (Royal Society, London) in 1949, Faraday Medallist in
  1950, Baily Medallist in 1951 and Silvanus Thompson Medallist in
  1955. In 1959 he received the Ford Foundation's Atoms for Peace
  Award Medal, in 1961 the Niels Bohr Medal and the Rosenberger
  Medal of the University of Chicago. Honorary degrees conferred
  upon Professor de Hevesy include Doctor of Philosophy, Uppsala,
  Freiburg, and
  Copenhagen; Doctor of Science, Ghent, Li&egrave;ge, London, and Capetown; and
  Doctor of Medicine, S&atilde;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Turin, and Freiburg. He is
  a Fellow of the Royal Society (London), the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1943/hevesy-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of
  Sciences</a>, Gothenburg Academy, and eleven other scientific
  academies. He is Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Society
  (London), the Royal Institution (London), the British Institute
  of Radiology, the Finnish Chemical Society, the German Bunsen
  Society, the German Physiological Society, the Chemical Society
  of Japan, and the American Society of Nuclear Medicine. In
  addition, he holds honorary memberships of many more learned
  societies.<br>
  <br>
  Professor de Hevesy married Pia Riis in 1924. They have one son
  and three daughters.</p>
