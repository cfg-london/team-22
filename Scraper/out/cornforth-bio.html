  <h1>John Cornforth - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cornforth.jpg" class="bio-img">I was
  born on 7 September 1917 at Sydney in Australia. My father was
  English-born and a graduate of Oxford; my mother, born Hilda
  Eipper, was descended from a German minister of religion who
  settled in New South Wales in 1832. I was the second of four
  children.<br>
  <br>
  Part of my childhood was spent in Sydney and part in rural New
  South Wales, at Armidale. When I was about ten years old the
  first signs of deafness (from otosclerosis) became noticeable.
  The total loss of hearing was a process that lasted more than a
  decade, but it was sufficiently gradual for me to attend Sydney
  Boys' High School and to profit from the teaching there. In
  particular a good young teacher, Leonard Basser, influenced me in
  the direction of chemistry; and this seemed to offer a career
  where deafness might not be an insuperable handicap.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Sydney University at the age of 16, and though by
  that time unable to hear any lecture I was attracted by
  laboratory work in organic chemistry (which I had done in an
  improvised laboratory at home since the age of 14) and by the
  availability of the original chemical literature. In 1937 I
  graduated with first-class honours and a University medal. After
  a year of post-graduate research I won an 1851 Exhibition
  scholarship to work at Oxford with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1947/index.html">Robert Robinson</a>. Two
  such scholarships were awarded each year, and the other was won
  by Rita Harradence, also of Sydney and also an organic chemist.
  This began an association which continues to this day. We were
  married in 1941, and have three children and two
  grandchildren.<br>
  <br>
  War broke out as we journeyed to Oxford and after completing our
  work (on steroid synthesis) for doctorates we became part of the
  chemical effort on penicillin which was the major chemical
  project in Robinson's laboratory during the war. We made
  contributions, and I helped to write <i>The Chemistry of
  Penicillin</i> (Princeton University Press, 1949), the record of
  a great international effort. However, I had earlier discovered
  what was to prove a key reaction for the synthesis of the
  sterols; and after the war I returned to this pursuit. The
  collaboration with Robinson continued after I joined (1946) the
  scientific staff of the Medical Research Council and worked at
  its National Institute, first at Hampstead and then at Mill Hill.
  In the end (1951) we were able to complete, simultaneously with
  <a href="../1965/index.html">Woodward</a>, the first total
  synthesis of the non-aromatic steroids.<br>
  <br>
  At the National Institute for Medical Research I came into
  contact with biological scientists and formed collaborative
  projects with several of them. In particular George Popj&aacute;k
  and I shared an interest in cholesterol. At this time <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/index.html">Konrad Bloch</a> was
  beginning his work on the biosynthesis of the sterols and
  Popj&aacute;k and I began to concert experiments in which the
  disciplines of chemistry and biochemistry could be applied to
  this subject. We were led to devise a complete carbon-by-carbon
  degradation of the nineteen-carbon ring structure of cholesterol
  and to identify, by means of radioactive tracers, the arrangement
  of the acetic acid molecules from which the system is built. As
  knowledge of the intermediate stages became more complete our
  experiments could be planned to give more and more
  information.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 Popj&aacute;k and I left the service of the Medical
  Research Council and became co-directors of the Milstead
  Laboratory of Chemical Enzymology set up by Shell Research Ltd.
  Lord Rothschild was influential in the decision to establish this
  laboratory and I was his subordinate until he left Shell in 1970.
  At Milstead a project already conceived - the study of the
  stereochemistry of enzymic reactions by means of asymmetry
  artificially introduced by isotopic substitution - was developed.
  It continued after 1968, when Popj&aacute;k left Milstead to go to
  the University of
  California at Los Angeles, until 1975, when I left to take up
  my present position of Royal Society Research Professor at the
  University of
  Sussex. In 1967 I had formed a collaboration with Hermann
  Eggerer, then of M&uuml;nchen; and together we solved the problem
  of the "asymmetric methyl group", and applied the solution in
  some of the many ways that have proved possible.<br>
  <br>
  My work has received ample recognition as it progressed: I was
  elected to the Royal Society in 1953; the Chemical Society has
  awarded me its Corday Morgan medal (1953), Flintoff medal (1965),
  and Pedler (1968) and Robert Robinson (1971) lectureships; the
  American Chemical Society gave me its Ernest Guenther award
  (1968); and I received the Prix Roussel in 1972. Popj&aacute;k and
  I were jointly awarded the Biochemical Society's Ciba medal
  (1965); the Stouffer prize (1967); and the Royal society's Davy
  Medal (1968).<br>
  <br>
  Throughout my scientific career my wife has been my most constant
  collaborator. Her experimental skill made major contributions to
  the work; she has eased for me beyond measure the difficulties of
  communication that accompany deafness; her encouragement and
  fortitude have been my strongest supports.</p>
