  <h1>Alexis Carrel - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="carrel.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Alexis
  Carrel</b> was born at Lyons, France, on June 28, 1873. He was
  the son of a business man, also named Alexis Carrel, who died
  when his son was very young.<br>
  <br>
  Alexis was educated at home by his mother Anne Ricard, and also
  at St. Joseph School, Lyons.<br>
  <br>
  In 1889 he took the degree of Bachelor of Letters at the University of
  Lyons; in 1890 the degree of Bachelor of Science and in 1900
  his Doctor's degree at the same University. He then continued his
  medical work at the Lyons Hospital and also taught Anatomy and
  Operative Surgery at the University, holding the post of
  Prosector in the Department of Professor L. Testut. Specializing
  in Surgery, Carrel began experimental work in this subject in
  Lyons in 1902, but in 1904 he went to Chicago and in 1905 worked
  in the Department of Physiology in the University of
  Chicago under Professor G. N. Stewart. In 1906 he was
  attached to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, New
  York, as an Associate Member, becoming a Full Member in 1912. In
  this Institute he carried out most of the experiments which
  earned him, in 1912, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
  Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1914-1919 War, Carrel served as a Major in the French
  Army Medical Corps and at this time he helped to devise the
  well-known Carrel-Dakin method of treating war wounds, which was
  widely used.<br>
  <br>
  Carrel's researches were mainly concerned with experimental
  surgery and the transplantation of tissues and whole organs. As
  early as 1902 he published, in the <i>Lyons Medical</i>, a
  technique for the end-to-end anastomosis of blood vessels and in
  1910 he demonstrated that blood-vessels could be kept for long
  periods in cold storage before they were used as transplants in
  surgery. Earlier, in 1908, he had devised methods for the
  transplantation of whole organs and later, in 1935, in
  collaboration with Charles Lindbergh, the airman who was the
  first to flow across the Atlantic, he devised a machine for
  supplying a sterile respiratory system to organs removed from the
  body, Lindbergh having solved the mechanical problems involved.
  He discussed this aspect of his work and its implications in his
  book <i>The Culture of Organs</i>. Carrel also published the
  well-known book entitled <i>Man, the Unknown</i> and, in
  collaboration with Georges Debelly, a book on <i>Treatment of
  Infected Wounds</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In collaboration with the French surgeon Theodore Tuffier, who
  was a pioneer of thoracic surgery, Carrel performed on the heart
  a successful series of valvotomies, and in collaboration with
  Burrows he grew sarcoma cells in tissue cultures by the technique
  of Harrison.<br>
  <br>
  Carrel was honoured by memberships of learned societies in the
  U.S.A., Spain, Russia, Sweden, The Netherlands, Belgium, France,
  Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece, and by honorary
  doctorates of the Universities of Belfast, Princeton, California and New York, and Brown and Columbia
  Universities. He was a Commander in the Legion d'Honneur of
  France and in the Leopold Order of Belgium, a Grand-Commander in
  the Swedish Order of the Polar Star, and the recipient of other
  decorations in orders from Spain, Serbia, Great Britain and the
  Holy See.<br>
  <br>
  He was married to Anne-Marie-Laure Gourlez de La Motte, the widow
  of M. de La Meyrie. They had no children.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939, when the Second World War broke out, Carrel went to
  France as a member of a special mission for the French Ministry
  of Health, a post which he held for a year. He then became
  Director of the Carrel Foundation for the Study of Human Problems
  which was set up by the Vichy Government. While holding this
  appointment he died in Paris on November 5, 1944.</p>
