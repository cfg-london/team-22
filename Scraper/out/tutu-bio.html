  <h1>Desmond Tutu - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tutu.jpg" class="bio-img">Bishop
  <b>Desmond Tutu</b> was born in 1931 in Klerksdorp, Transvaal.
  His father was a teacher, and he himself was educated at
  Johannesburg Bantu High School. After leaving school he trained
  first as a teacher at Pretoria Bantu Normal College and in 1954
  he graduated from the University of South Africa. After three years as a
  high school teacher he began to study theology, being ordained as
  a priest in 1960. The years 1962-66 were devoted to further
  theological study in England leading up to a Master of Theology.
  From 1967 to 1972 he taught theology in South Africa before
  returning to England for three years as the assistant director of
  a theological institute in London. In 1975 he was appointed Dean
  of St. Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg, the first black to hold
  that position. From 1976 to 1978 he was Bishop of Lesotho, and in
  1978 became the first black General Secretary of the South
  African Council of Churches. Tutu is an honorary doctor of a
  number of leading universities in the USA, Britain and
  Germany.<br>
  <br>
  Desmond Tutu has formulated his objective as "a democratic and
  just society without racial divisions", and has set forward the
  following points as minimum demands:<br>
  <br>
  1. equal civil rights for all<br>
  2. the abolition of South Africa's passport laws<br>
  3. a common system of education<br>
  4. the cessation of forced deportation from South Africa to the
  so-called "homelands"<br>
  <br>
  The South African Council of Churches is a contact organization
  for the churches of South Africa and functions as a national
  committee for the World Council of Churches. The Boer churches
  have disassociated themselves from the organization as a result
  of the unambiguous stand it has made against apartheid. Around 80
  percent of its members are black, and they now dominate the
  leading positions.</p>
