  <h1>Johann Deisenhofer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="deisenhofer.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on September 30, 1943
  in Zusamaltheim, Bavaria, now Federal Republic of Germany, as the
  first son of Thekla and Johann Deisenhofer. After my father's
  return from military service my parents ran the family farm. In
  1948, our family grew to its final size with the birth of my only
  sister, Antonie.<br>
  <br>
  My early youth was influenced by the environment provided by a
  little village that, after World War II, tried to find its way
  back to some kind of a normal life. Nevertheless, it was a most
  enjoyable place for a little boy. In 1949, I entered elementary
  school at Zusamaltheim, and continued to attend until 1956.
  According to the local custom, the oldest son was designated to
  take over the family's farm. However, to their great
  disappointment, my parents early noticed my lack of interest in
  farming, and made the difficult decision to send me away to
  school. My way to higher education started in 1956 at the
  "Knabenmittelschule HI. Kreuz", Donanwoerth, and continued 1957
  to 1959 at the "Staatliche Realschule Wertingen" and 1959 to 1963
  at the "Holbein Gymnasium", Augsburg. There, in 1963, I underwent
  the "Abitur" examination that allowed me to go to a university. I
  was awarded the "Stipendium f&uuml;r besonders Begabte" of the
  "Bayerische Staatsministerium f&uuml;r Unterricht und Kultus"
  which helped to lower the financial burden on my parents for my
  education.<br>
  <br>
  In the fall of 1965, after 18 months of military service in the
  German Bundeswehr, where I did not exceed the rank of private, I
  began to study physics at the Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen. A major
  reason for choosing physics was an interest in physical,
  especially astronomical problems, aroused by popular books on
  this subject. The book I most clearly remember was a popular
  review of the state of astronomy by Fred Hoyle, describing the
  impact of modern physics on astronomy, and the recent
  achievements and open questions in that field. The Technische
  Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen (TUM) was the obvious choice
  because Rudolf L. Moessbauer had just accepted a professorship at
  the TUM; moreover Munich is only about 100 km from
  Zusamaltheim.<br>
  <br>
  During my time at the TUM, I learned that physics was quite
  different from what I expected; also, my interest slowly shifted
  to solid state physics. Together with a couple of colleagues I
  started my Diplomarbeit in this field in the laboratory of Klaus
  Dransfeld. As it turned out, Klaus Dransfeld was a person almost
  as shy as myself, so that we could not establish a good personal
  contact at the time. Nevertheless, the experimental work I did
  under the supervision of Karl-Friedrich Renk in Dransfeld's lab
  was very successful, and led to a publication in Physical Review
  Letters in 1971; this was my first scientific publication. During
  my time in his lab, Klaus Dransfeld transmitted his interest in
  biophysical problems to many students. This had direct
  consequences for my career because it made me look for a suitable
  institution to get a Ph. D. in this field. From a friend I heard
  about a new group at the Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Eiweiss-
  und Lederforschung whose head, <a href="index.html">Robert
  Huber</a>, was looking for students. After a brief interview with
  Robert Huber, it was agreed that I could start my work in June
  1971, following the final examination for my physics diploma at
  the TUM. In 1972, the institute moved a few kilometers from
  Munich to Martinsried, and became the "Max-Planck-Institut
  f&uuml;r Biochemie". The work I did together with Wolfgang
  Steigemann (also one of Huber's Ph.D. students at that time) on
  the crystallographic refinement of the structure of bovine
  pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was a success, and our 1975 paper in
  Acta Crystallographica has been cited ever since.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of 1974, when I had obtained my Ph.D. degree, Robert
  Huber offered me a postdoctoral position for two years which I
  accepted. This position was converted into a permanent position
  in 1976. I joined Peter M. Colman, then a postdoctoral fellow in
  Huber's lab, and Walter Palm from the University of
  Graz, Austria, in their work on the human myeloma protein
  Kol. After the solution of this interesting structure, I
  continued, together with Robert Huber, Peter Colman's work on the
  human Fc-fragment, and its complex with an Fc-binding fragment
  from protein A from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The refinement
  of these structures was finished in 1980. In the following two
  years I joined several projects in Robert Huber's lab: human C3a,
  citrate synthase, and alpha-1 -proteinase inhibitor. During all
  my time in Martinsried I enjoyed working with computers, and
  developing and maintaining crystallographic software.<br>
  <br>
  In 1982, Hartmut Michel, who had come to Martinsried together
  with Dieter Oesterhelt, reported in one of Huber's group seminars
  about his spectacular success with the crystallization of the
  photosynthetic reaction center from <i>Rhodopseudomonas
  viridis</i>. After discussions between Hartmut and myself, and
  after Robert Huber had given his agreement, I joined the reaction
  center project in order to determine the three-dimensional
  structure of this molecule. Shortly afterwards Kunio Miki, a
  post-doctoral fellow from Osaka University, arrived in Martinsried, and helped
  us until September 1983. Later Otto Epp, a colleague and friend
  since I joined the Max Planck-Institute, made most valuable
  contributions to the project.<br>
  <br>
  In a surprisingly short time, at the end of 1983, we came to a
  point where the success of the project was at the horizon. It
  still took almost two years until we had worked out the complete
  structure, and two more years to refine the model at 2.3&Aring;
  resolution.<br>
  <br>
  The work on the photosynthetic reaction center changed my life in
  many ways. It was a special privilege to belong to the very small
  group of people who saw the structural model of this molecule
  grow on the screen of a computer workstation, and it is hard to
  describe the excitement I felt during this period of the work.
  Soon after the news of our success spread through the interested
  scientific community, we received many invitations to report our
  results during scientific meetings, in seminars, and even in TV
  shows. The wide recognition of our work also opened the
  possibility for me to move to a new place, and to build a
  research group of my own. The best of several opportunities was
  an offer from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
  Dallas which I joined in March 1988 to become Professor of
  Biochemistry, and Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical
  Institute. Almost immediately after my arrival I fell in love
  with Kirsten Fischer Lindahl, Professor of Microbiology and
  Biochemistry and Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical
  Institute; we got married in 1989.<br>
  <br>
  For the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the
  reaction center Hartmut Michel and I received the 1986 Biological
  Physics Prize of the American Physical Society, and the 1988 Otto
  Bayer Prize. The 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was followed by
  several non-scientific honors such as honorary citizenships of my
  home town Zusamaltheim and of my current residence Dallas, and a
  high order of the Federal Republic of Germany. I am a member of
  the Academia Europaea, and a Fellow of the American Association
  for the Advancement of Science.</p>
