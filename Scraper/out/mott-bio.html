  <h1>Sir Nevill F. Mott - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mott.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Nevill Francis Mott</b> was born in
  Leeds, U.K., on September 30th, 1905. His parents, Charles
  Francis Mott and Lilian Mary (n&eacute;e) Reynolds, met when
  working under <a href="../1906/index.html">J.J. Thomson</a> in
  the Cavendish
  Laboratory; his great grandfather was Sir John Richardson,
  the arctic explorer. He was educated at Clifton
  College, Bristol and St. John's College, Cambridge, where he
  studied mathematics and theoretical physics. He started research
  in Cambridge under R.H. Fowler, in Copenhagen under <a href=
  "../1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a> and in G&ouml;ttingen under
  <a href="../1954/index.html">Max Born</a>, and spent a year as a
  lecturer at Manchester with W.L. Bragg before accepting a
  lectureship at Cambridge. Here he worked on collision theory and
  nuclear problems in Rutherford's laboratory. In 1933 he went to
  the chair of theoretical physics at Bristol, and under the
  influence of H. W. Skinner and H. Jones turned to the properties
  of metals and semiconductors. Work during his Bristol period
  before the war included a theory of transition metals, of
  rectification, hardness of alloys (with Nabarro) and of the
  photographic latent image (with Gurney). After a period of
  military research in London during the war, he became head of the
  Bristol physics department, publishing papers on low-temperature
  oxidation (with Cabrera) and the metal-insulator
  transition.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 he was appointed Cavendish Professor of Physics, a post
  which he held till 1971, serving on numerous government and
  university committees. The research for which he was awarded the
  Nobel Prize began about 1965. Some of his main books are "The
  Theory of Atomic Collisions" (with H.S.W. Massey), "Electronic
  Processes in Ionic Crystals" (with R.W. Gurney) and "Electronic
  Processes in Non-Crystalline Materials" (with E.A. Davis).<br>
  <br>
  Outside research in physics he has taken a leading part in the
  reform of science education in the United Kingdom and is still
  active on committees about educational problems. He was chairman
  of a Pugwash meeting in Cambridge in 1965. He was chairman of the
  board and is now president of Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.,
  scientific publishers since 1798. He was Master of his Cambridge
  college (Gonville and Caius) from 1959-66. He was President of
  the International Union of Physics from 1951 to 1957, and holds
  more than twenty honorary degrees, including Doctor of Technology
  at Linkoping.<br>
  <br>
  In 1930 he married Ruth Eleanor Horder. They have two daughters
  and three grandchildren, Emma, Edmund and Cecily Crampin.<br>
  <br>
  For the last ten years he has lived in a village, Aspley Guise,
  next door to his son-in-law and family. During this period he has
  written an autobiography "A Life in Science" (Taylor and Francis)
  and edited a book with several authors on a religion-science
  interface "Can Scientists Believe?" (James and James, London),
  together with many scientific papers, mainly in the last 3 years
  on high-temperature superconductors.</p>
