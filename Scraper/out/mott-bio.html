  <h1>John R. Mott - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mott.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John
  Raleigh Mott</b> (May 25, 1865-January 31, 1955) was born of
  pioneer stock in Livingston Manor, New York, the third child and
  only son among four children. His parents, John and Elmira
  (Dodge) Mott, moved to Postville, Iowa, where his father became a
  lumber merchant and was elected the first mayor of the
  town.<br>
  <br>
  At sixteen, Mott enrolled at Upper Iowa University, a small Methodist
  preparatory school and college in Fayette. He was an enthusiastic
  student of history and literature there and a prizewinner in
  debating and oratory, but transferred to Cornell University
  in 1885. At this time he thought of his life's work as a choice
  between law and his father's lumber business, but he changed his
  mind upon hearing a lecture by J. Kynaston Studd on January 14,
  1886. Three sentences in Studd's speech, he said, prompted his
  lifelong service of presenting Christ to students: &laquo;Seekest
  thou great things for thyself? Seek them not. Seek ye first the
  Kingdom of God.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1886, Mott represented Cornell University's
  Y.M.C.A. at the
  first international, interdenominational student Christian
  conference ever held. At that conference, which gathered 251 men
  from eighty-nine colleges and universities, one hundred men -
  including Mott - pledged themselves to work in foreign missions.
  From this, two years later, sprang the Student Volunteer Movement
  for Foreign Missions.<br>
  <br>
  During Mott's remaining two years at Cornell, as president of the
  Y.M.C.A. he increased the membership threefold and raised the
  money for a university Y.M.C.A. building. He was graduated in
  1888, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, with a bachelor's degree in
  philosophy and history. In September of 1888 he began a service
  of twenty-seven years as national secretary of the
  Intercollegiate Y.M.C.A. of the U.S.A. and Canada, a position
  requiring visits to colleges to address students concerning
  Christian activities.<br>
  <br>
  During this period, he was also chairman of the executive
  committee of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions,
  presiding officer of the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh
  in 1910, chairman of the International Missionary Council. With
  Karl Fries of Sweden, he organized the World's Student Christian
  Federation in 1895 and as its general secretary went on a
  two-year world tour, during which he organized national student
  movements in India, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, parts
  of Europe and the North East. In 1912 and 1913, he toured the Far
  East, holding twenty-one regional missionary conferences in
  India, China, Japan, and Korea.<br>
  <br>
  From 1915 to 1928, Mott was general-secretary of the
  International Committee of the Y.M.C.A. and from 1926 to 1937
  president of the Y.M.C.A.'s World Committee. During World War I,
  when the Y.M.C.A. offered its services to <a href=
  "../1919/index.html">President Wilson</a>, Mott became general
  secretary of the National War Work Council, receiving the
  Distinguished Service Medal for his work. For the Y.M.C.A. he
  kept up international contacts as circumstances allowed and
  helped to conduct relief work for prisoners of war in various
  countries. He had already declined President Wilson's offer of
  the ambassadorship to China, but he served in 1916 as a member of
  the Mexican Commission, and in 1917 as a member of the Special
  Diplomatic Mission to Russia.<br>
  <br>
  The sum of Mott's work makes an impressive record: he wrote
  sixteen books in his chosen field; crossed the Atlantic over one
  hundred times and the Pacific fourteen times, averaging
  thirty-four days on the ocean per year for fifty years; delivered
  thousands of speeches; chaired innumerable conferences. Among the
  honorary awards which he received are: decorations from China,
  Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan,
  Jerusalem, Poland, Portugal, Siam, Sweden, and the United States;
  six honorary degrees from the universities of Brown, Edinburgh, Princeton, Toronto, Yale, and Upper Iowa; and an honorary degree from
  the Russian Orthodox Church of Paris.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Mott married Leila Ada White of Wooster, Ohio, in 1891; they
  had four children, two sons and two daughters. He died at his
  home in Orlando, Florida, at the age of eighty-nine.</p>
