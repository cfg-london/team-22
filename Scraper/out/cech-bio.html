  <h1>Thomas R. Cech - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="cech.jpg" class="bio-img">Grandfather Josef, a shoemaker,
  immigrated to the U.S. from Bohemia in 1913. My other
  grandparents, also of Czech origin, were first-generation
  Americans. My father was and is a physician, my mother the
  homemaker. I was born in Chicago on December 8, 1947.<br>
  <br>
  The safe streets and good schools of Iowa City, Iowa provided the
  backdrop for the childhood years of my sister Barbara, my brother
  Richard and myself. My father, who loved physics as much as
  medicine, interjected a scientific approach and point of view
  into most every family discussion. I discovered science for
  myself in fourth grade, collecting rocks and minerals and
  worrying about how they were formed. By the time I was in junior
  high school, I would knock on Geology professors' doors at the
  University of
  Iowa, asking to see models of crystal structures and to
  discuss meteorites and fossils.<br>
  <br>
  In 1966 I entered Grinnell College, where I was to derive as much
  enjoyment studying Homer's Odyssey, Dante's Inferno, and
  Constitutional History as Chemistry. I met Carol over the melting
  point apparatus in a make-up Organic Chemistry lab, starting the
  partnership of our lives that is now more than 20 years
  old.<br>
  <br>
  The Chemistry I appreciated the most from textbooks was physical
  chemistry. However, undergraduate research experiences at
  Argonne National
  Laboratory and at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory taught me that I didn't
  have a long enough attention span for the elaborate plumbing and
  electronics of gas-phase chemical physics. I was later attracted
  to biological chemistry because of the almost daily interplay of
  experimental design, observation, and interpretation.<br>
  <br>
  Berkeley, 1970. Carol and I chose the University of California as
  much for the excitement of life there as for the excellence of
  its Chemistry Department. My thesis advisor, John Hearst, had an
  enthusiasm for chromosome structure and function that proved
  infectious; I have not yet recovered, nor do I wish to. Long days
  in the laboratory were punctuated by occasional backpacking trips
  in the alpine splendor of the Sierra Nevada.<br>
  <br>
  In 1975 we obtained our Ph.D.'s and moved to postdoctoral
  positions in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Carol at Harvard and I at
  M.I.T. I
  strengthened my knowledge of biology in Mary Lou Pardue's
  laboratory, and enjoyed being part of the interactive scientific
  scene at M.I.T.<br>
  <br>
  We began our first faculty positions at the University of
  Colorado, Boulder in 1978. I was initially attracted by the
  enthusiasm and energy of the faculty; I have stayed because in my
  field the intellectual environment here would be very hard to
  equal. We have benefitted from very fine colleagues, with whom we
  have shared many great dinners and ski trips to the nearby Rocky
  Mountains. More recently, life has been transformed by the
  addition to our family of two energetic daughters, Allison (born
  1982) end Jennifer (1986). It promises to return to normal
  sometime in the next century.<br>
  <br>
  Because of my research group's discoveries, more than a dozen
  national and international awards preceded the Nobel Prize for
  Chemistry in 1989. Among them were the Pfizer Award in Enzyme
  Chemistry (American Chemical Society), the Award in Molecular
  Biology (U.S.
  National Academy of Sciences), the Heineken Prize (Royal Netherlands
  Academy of Arts and Sciences), and the Lasker Award. I
  received an honorary D.Sc. degree from Grinnell College in 1987
  and from the University of Chicago in 1991. I have been elected
  to the U. S. National Academy of Sciences (1987) and to the
  American Academy
  of Arts and Sciences (1988). In 1987 I was awarded a lifetime
  Professorship by the American Cancer Society, and in 1988 became
  Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>
