  <h1>Herbert S. Gasser - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gasser.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Herbert
  Spencer Gasser</b> was born in Platteville, Wisconsin, on July 5,
  1888, the son of Herman Gasser end Jane Elisabeth Griswold. After
  attending the State Normal School he went on to the University of
  Wisconsin, where he graduated A.B. in 1910 and A.M. in 1911. Here
  he studied physiology under Dr. <a href=
  "index.html">Erlanger</a>, with whom he was later to have such a
  fruitful collaboration. He then went to the Johns Hopkins
  Medical School for his clinical studies, obtaining his M.D.
  in 1915. After a year in pharmacology at Wisconsin he went to
  Washington
  University (St. Louis), where he was associated with Dr.
  Erlanger, becoming Professor of Pharmacology in 1921.<br>
  <br>
  From 1923-1925 he was granted leave of absence to study in
  Europe, working with Profs. <a href="../1922/index.html">A. V.
  Hill</a>, W. Straub and L. Lapicque and <a href=
  "../1936/index.html">Sir Henry Dale</a>. In 1931 he was appointed
  Professor of Physiology and Head of the Medical Department at
  Cornell
  University, New York City. From 1935 to 1953 he was Director
  of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, being
  later a member emeritus of the Institute.<br>
  <br>
  When he was at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Dr. Gasser worked
  for a time on a problem concerning blood coagulation. His major
  work, however, dates from his collaboration with Prof. Erlanger
  and was concerned with the electrophysiology of the nerves. The
  first paper from him on the subject dealt with action currents in
  the phrenic nerve. Later, the newly perfected low - voltage
  cathode - ray oscillograph was utilized in the work. Soon it was
  possible to demonstrate that the complexity of the oscillograph
  results was due to the different conductivity rates of different
  groups of nerve fibres. The work led to advances in our knowledge
  of the mechanism of pain and of reflex action and has inspired a
  large school of neurophysiologists.<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Gasser was a co-author of the book <i>Electrical Signs of
  Nervous Activity</i> (1937). He has also published, alone or with
  his collaborators, many scientific papers on neurophysical
  topics, being appointed an Editor of <i>The Journal of
  Experimental Medicine</i> in 1936.<br>
  <br>
  He held honorary doctorates from the Universities of Pennsylvania,
  Rochester, Wisconsin, Columbia, Oxford, Harvard, Paris, Washington (St.
  Louis), and Johns
  Hopkins. He was a doctor, honoris causa, of the Free University
  of Brussels and of the University of Paris, and honorary M.D.
  of the Catholic
  University of Louvain. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), the Philosophical
  Society, the Association of American Physicians (Kobel Medallist,
  1954), the American Physiological Society, and many others. He
  held honorary memberships of the Physiological Society (Great Britain) and
  Asociaci&oacute;n M&eacute;dica Argentina. He was a foreign member of
  several learned societies, including the Royal Society
  (London). Dr. Gasser was also President of the Board of Directors
  of the Russel Sage Institute of Pathology. He was unmarried.</p>

  <p>Dr Gasser died on May 11th, 1963.</p>
