  <h1>Walter Kohn - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kohn.jpg" class="bio-img"> I suppose I
  am not the first Nobelist who, on the occasion of receiving this
  Prize, wonders how on earth, by what strange alchemy of family
  background, teachers, friends, talents and especially accidents
  of history and of personal life he or she arrived at this point.
  I have browsed in previous volumes of "Les Prix Nobel" and I know
  that there are others whose eventual destinies were foreshadowed
  early in their lives &#8211; mathematical precocity, champion
  bird watching, insatiable reading, mechanical genius. Not in my
  case, at least not before my late teens. On the contrary: An
  early photo of my older sister and myself, taken at a children's
  costume party in Vienna &#8211; I look about 7 years old &#8211;
  shows me dressed up in a dark suit and a black top hat, toy
  glasses pushed down my nose, and carrying a large sign under my
  arm with the inscription "Professor Know-Nothing".<br>
  <br>
  Here then is my attempt to convey to the reader how, at age 75, I
  see my life which brought me to the present point: a long-retired
  professor of theoretical physics at the University of California,
  still loving and doing physics, including chemical physics,
  mostly together with young people less than half my age;
  moderately involved in the life of my community of Santa Barbara
  and in broader political and social issues; with unremarkable
  hobbies such as listening to classical music, reading (including
  French literature), walking with my wife Mara or alone, a little
  cooking (unjustifiably proud of my ratatouille); and a weekly
  half hour of relaxed roller blading along the shore, a throwback
  to the ice-skating of my Viennese childhood. My three daughters
  and three grandchildren all live in California and so we get to
  see each other reasonably often.<br>
  <br>
  I was naturalized as an American citizen in 1957 and this has
  been my primary self-identity ever since. But, like many other
  scientists, I also have a strong sense of global citizenship,
  including especially Canada, Denmark, England, France and Israel,
  where I have worked and lived with a family for considerable
  periods, and where I have some of my closest friends.<br>
  <br>
  My feelings towards Austria, my native land, are &#8211; and will
  remain &#8211; very painful. They are dominated by my vivid
  recollections of 1 1/2 years as a Jewish boy under the Austrian
  Nazi regime, and by the subsequent murder of my parents, Salomon
  and Gittel Kohn, of other relatives and several teachers, during
  the holocaust. At the same time I have in recent years been glad
  to work with Austrians, one or two generations younger than I:
  Physicists, some teachers at my former High School and young
  people (Gedenkdiener) who face the dark years of Austria's past
  honestly and constructively.<br>
  <br>
  On another level, I want to mention that I have a strong Jewish
  identity and &#8211; over the years &#8211; have been involved in
  several Jewish projects, such as the establishment of a strong
  program of Judaic Studies at the University of California in San Diego.<br>
  <br>
  My father, who had lost a brother, fighting on the Austrian side
  in World War I, was a committed pacifist. However, while the Nazi
  barbarians and their collaborators threatened the entire world, I
  could not accept his philosophy and, after several earlier
  attempts, was finally accepted into the Canadian Infantry Corps
  during the last year of World War II. Many decades later I became
  active in attempts to bring an end to the US-Soviet nuclear arms
  race and became a leader of unsuccessful faculty initiatives to
  terminate the role of the University of California as manager of
  the nuclear weapons laboratories at Los Alamos and Livermore. I
  offered early support to Jeffrey Leiffer, the founder of the
  student <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1995/index.html">Pugwash</a>
  movement which concerns itself with global issues having a strong
  scientific component and in which scientists can play a useful
  role. Twenty years after its founding this organization continues
  strong and vibrant. My commitment to a humane and peaceful world
  continues to this day. I have just joined the Board of the
  Population Institute because I am convinced that early
  stabilization of the world's population is important for the
  attainment of this objective.<br>
  <br>
                After these introductory general reflections from my present vantage 
                point I would now like to give an idea of my childhood and adolescence. 
                I was born in 1923 into a middle class Jewish family in Vienna, 
                a few years after the end of World War I, which was disastrous 
                from the Austrian point of view. Both my parents were born in 
                parts of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, my father in Hodonin, 
                Moravia, my mother in Brody, then in Galicia, Poland, now in the 
                Ukraine. Later they both moved to the capital of Vienna along 
                with their parents. I have no recollection of my father's parents, 
                who died relatively young. My maternal grandparents Rappaport 
                were orthodox Jews who lived a simple life of retirement and, 
                in the case of my grandfather, of prayer and the study of religious 
                texts in a small nearby synagogue, a Schul as it was called. My 
                father carried on a business, Postkartenverlag Brueder Kohn Wien 
                I, whose main product was high quality art postcards, mostly based 
                on paintings by contemporary artists which were commissioned by 
                his firm. The business had flourished in the first two decades 
                of the century but then, in part due to the death of his brother 
                Adolf in World War I, to the dismantlement of the Austrian monarchy 
                and to a worldwide economic depression, it gradually fell on hard 
                times in the 1920s and 1930s. My father struggled from crisis 
                to crisis to keep the business going and to support the family. 
                Left over from the prosperous times was a wonderful summer property 
                in Heringsdorf at the Baltic Sea, not far from Berlin, where my 
                mother, sister and I spent our summer vacations until Hitler came 
                to power in Germany in 1933. My father came for occasional visits 
                (the firm had a branch in Berlin). My mother was a highly educated 
                woman with a good knowledge of German, Latin, Polish and French 
                and some acquaintance with Greek, Hebrew and English. I believe 
                that she had completed an academically oriented High School in 
                Galicia. Through her parents we maintained contact with traditional 
                Judaism. At the same time my parents, especially my father, also 
                were a part of the secular artistic and intellectual life of Vienna.<br>
  <br>
  After I had completed a public elementary school, my mother
  enrolled me in the Akademische Gymnasium, a fine public high
  school in Vienna's inner city. There, for almost five years, I
  received an excellent education, strongly oriented toward Latin
  and Greek, until March 1938, when Hitler Germany annexed Austria.
  (This so-called Anschluss was, after a few weeks, supported by
  the great majority of the Austrian population). Until that time
  my favorite subject had been Latin, whose architecture and
  succinctness I loved. By contrast, I had no interest in, nor
  apparent talent for, mathematics which was routinely taught and
  gave me the only C in high school. During this time it was my
  tacit understanding that I would eventually be asked to take over
  the family business, a prospect which I faced with resignation
  and without the least enthusiasm.<br>
  <br>
  The Anschluss changed everything: The family business was
  confiscated but my father was required to continue its management
  without any compensation; my sister managed to emigrate rather
  promptly to England; and I was expelled from my school.<br>
  <br>
  In the following fall I was able to enter a Jewish school, the
  Chajes Gymnasium, where I had two extraordinary teachers: In
  physics, Dr. Emil Nohel, and in mathematics Dr. Victor Sabbath.
  While outside the school walls arbitrary acts of persecution and
  brutality took place, on the inside these two inspired teachers
  conveyed to us their own deep understanding and love of their
  subjects. I take this occasion to record my profound gratitude
  for their inspiration to which I owe my initial interest in
  science. (Alas, they both became victims of Nazi
  barbarism).<br>
  <br>
  I note with deep gratitude that twice, during the Second World
  War, after having been separated from my parents who were unable
  to leave Austria, I was taken into the homes of two wonderful
  families who had never seen me before: Charles and Eva Hauff in
  Sussex, England, who also welcomed my older sister, Minna.
  Charles, like my father, was in art publishing and they had a
  business relationship. A few years later, Dr. Bruno Mendel and
  his wife Hertha of Toronto, Canada, took me and my friend Joseph
  Eisinger into their family. (They also supported three other
  young Nazi refugees). Both of these families strongly encouraged
  me in my studies, the Hauffs at the East Grinstead County School
  in Sussex and the Mendels at the University of
  Toronto. I cannot imagine how I might have become a scientist
  without their help.<br>
  <br>
  My first wife, Lois Kohn, gave me invaluable support during the
  early phases of my scientific career; my present wife of over 20
  years, Mara, has supported me in the latter phases of my
  scientific life. She also created a wonderful home for us, and
  gave me an entire new family, including her father Vishniac, a
  biologist as well as a noted photographer of pre-war Jewish
  communities in Eastern Europe, and her mother Luta. (They both
  died rather recently, well into their nineties).<br>
  <br>
  After these rather personal reminiscences I now turn to a brief
  description of my life as a scientist.<br>
  <br>
                When I arrived in England in August 1939, three weeks before the 
                outbreak of World War II, I had my mind set on becoming a farmer 
                (I had seen too many unemployed intellectuals during the 1930s), 
                and I started out on a training arm in Kent. However, I became 
                seriously ill and physically weak with meningitis, and so in January 
                1940 my "acting parents", the Hauffs, arranged for me to attend 
                the above-mentioned county school, where &#8211; after a period 
                of uncertainty &#8211; I concentrated on mathematics, physics 
                and chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  However, in May 1940, shortly after I had turned 17, and while
  the German army swept through Western Europe and Britain girded
  for a possible German air-assault, Churchill ordered most male
  "enemy aliens" (i.e., holders of enemy passports, like myself) to
  be interned ("Collar the lot" was his crisp order). I spent about
  two months in various British camps, including the Isle of Man,
  where my school sent me the books I needed to study. There I also
  audited, with little comprehension, some lectures on mathematics
  and physics, offered by mature interned scientists.<br>
  <br>
  In July 1940, I was shipped on, as part of a British convoy
  moving through U-boat-infested waters, to Quebec City in Canada;
  and from there, by train, to a camp in Trois Rivieres, which
  housed both German civilian internees and refugees like myself.
  Again various internee-taught courses were offered. The one which
  interested me most was a course on set-theory given by the
  mathematician Dr. Fritz Rothberger and attended by two students.
  Dr. Rothberger, from Vienna, a most kind and unassuming man, had
  been an advanced private scholar in Cambridge, England,
  when the internment order was issued. His love for the intrinsic
  depth and beauty of mathematics was gradually absorbed by his
  students.<br>
  <br>
  Later I was moved around among various other camps in Quebec and
  New Brunswick. Another fellow internee, Dr. A. Heckscher, an art
  historian, organized a fine camp school for young people like
  myself, whose education had been interrupted and who prepared to
  take official Canadian High School exams. In this way I passed
  the McGill
  University junior Matriculation exam and exams in
  mathematics, physics and chemistry on the senior matriculation
  level. At this point, at age 18, I was pretty firmly looking
  forward to a career in physics, with a strong secondary interest
  in mathematics.<br>
  <br>
  I mention with gratitude that camp educational programs received
  support from the Canadian <a href=
  "../../../peace/laureates/1917/index.html">Red Cross</a> and
  Jewish Canadian philanthropic sources. I also mention that in
  most camps we had the opportunity to work as lumberjacks and earn
  20 cents per day. With this princely sum, carefully saved up, I
  was able to buy Hardy's Pure Mathematics and Slater's Chemical
  Physics, books which are still on my shelves. In January 1942,
  having been cleared by Scotland Yard of being a potential spy, I
  was released from internment and welcomed by the family of
  Professor Bruno Mendel in Toronto. At this point I planned to
  take up engineering rather than physics, in order to be able to
  support my parents after the war. The Mendels introduced me to
  Professor Leopold Infeld who had come to Toronto after several
  years with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a>. Infeld, after
  talking with me (in a kind of drawing room oral exam), concluded
  that my real love was physics and advised me to major in an
  excellent, very stiff program, then called mathematics and
  physics, at the University of Toronto. He argued that this
  program would enable me to earn a decent living at least as well
  as an engineering program.<br>
  <br>
  However, because of my now German nationality, I was not allowed
  into the chemistry building, where war work was in progress, and
  hence I could not enroll in any chemistry courses. (In fact, the
  last time I attended a chemistry class was in my English school
  at the age of 17.) Since chemistry was required, this seemed to
  sink any hope of enrolling. Here I express my deep appreciation
  to Dean and head of mathematics, Samuel Beatty, who helped me,
  and several others, nevertheless to enter mathematics and physics
  as special students, whose status was regularized one or two
  years later.<br>
  <br>
  I was fortunate to find an extraordinary mathematics and applied
  mathematics program in Toronto. Luminous members whom I recall
  with special vividness were the algebraist Richard Brauer, the
  non-Euclidean geometer, H.S.M. Coxeter, the aforementioned
  Leopold Infeld, and the classical applied mathematicians John
  Lighton Synge and Alexander Weinstein. This group had been
  largely assembled by Dean Beatty. In those years the University
  of Toronto team of mathematics students, competing with teams
  from the leading North-American Institutions, consistently won
  the annual Putman competition. (For the record I remark that I
  never participated). Physics too had many distinguished faculty
  members, largely recruited by John C. McLennan, one of the
  earliest low temperature physicists, who had died before I
  arrived. They included the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1930/index.html">Raman</a> specialist H.L.
  Welsh, M.F. Crawford in optics and the low-temperature physicists
  H.G. Smith and A.D. Misener. Among my fellow students was
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/index.html">Arthur Schawlow</a>,
  who later was to share the Nobel Prize for the development of the
  laser.<br>
  <br>
  During one or two summers, as well as part-time during the school
  year, I worked for a small Canadian company which developed
  electrical instruments for military planes. A little later I
  spent two summers, working for a geophysicist, looking for (and
  finding!) gold deposits in northern Ontario and Quebec.<br>
  <br>
  After my junior year I joined the Canadian Army. An excellent
  upper division course in mechanics by A. Weinstein had introduced
  me to the dynamics of tops and gyroscopes. While in the army I
  used my spare time to develop new strict bounds on the precession
  of heavy, symmetrical tops. This paper, "Contour Integration in
  the Theory of the Spherical Pendulum and the Heavy Symmetrical
  Top" was published in the Transactions of American Mathematical
  Society. At the end of one year's army service, having completed
  only 2 1/2 out of the 4-year undergraduate program, I received a
  war-time bachelor's degree "on &#8211; active &#8211; service" in
  applied mathematics.<br>
  <br>
  In the year 1945-6, after my discharge from the army, I took an
  excellent crash master's program, including some of the senior
  courses which I had missed, graduate courses, a master's thesis
  consisting of my paper on tops and a paper on scaling of atomic
  wave-functions.<br>
  <br>
  My teachers wisely insisted that I do not stay on in Toronto for
  a Ph.D, but financial support for further study was very hard to
  come by. Eventually I was thrilled to receive a fine Lehman
  fellowship at Harvard. Leopold Infeld recommended that I should
  try to be accepted by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Julian Schwinger</a>, whom
  he knew and who, still in his 20s, was already one of the most
  exciting theoretical physicists in the world.<br>
  <br>
  Arriving from the relatively isolated University of Toronto and
  finding myself at the illustrious Harvard, where many faculty and
  graduate students had just come back from doing brilliant
  war-related work at Los Alamos, the MIT Radiation Laboratory, etc., I felt very
  insecure and set as my goal survival for at least one year. The
  Department Chair, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1977/index.html">J.H. Van Vleck</a>, was very
  kind and referred to me as the Toronto-Kohn to distinguish me
  from another person who, I gathered, had caused some trouble.
  Once Van Vleck told me of an idea in the band-theory of solids,
  later known as the quantum defect method, and asked me if I would
  like to work on it. I asked for time to consider. When I returned
  a few days later, without in the least grasping his idea, I
  thanked him for the opportunity but explained that, while I did
  not yet know in what subfield of physics I wanted to do my
  thesis, I was sure it would not be in solid state physics. This
  problem then became the thesis of Thomas Kuhn, (later a renowned
  philosopher of science), and was further developed by myself and
  others. In spite of my original disconnect with Van Vleck, solid
  state physics soon became the center of my professional life and
  Van Vleck and I became lifelong friends.<br>
  <br>
  After my encounter with Van Vleck I presented myself to Julian
  Schwinger requesting to be accepted as one of his thesis
  students. His evident brilliance as a researcher and as a
  lecturer in advanced graduate courses (such as waveguides and
  nuclear physics) attracted large numbers of students, including
  many who had returned to their studies after spending "time out"
  on various war-related projects.<br>
  <br>
  I told Schwinger briefly of my very modest efforts using
  variational principles. He himself had developed brilliant new
  Green's function variational principles during the war for
  wave-guides, optics and nuclear physics (Soon afterwards Green's
  functions played an important role in his Nobel-Prize-winning
  work on quantum electrodynamics). He accepted me within minutes
  as one of his approximately 10 thesis students. He suggested that
  I should try to develop a Green's function variational method for
  <i>three</i>-body scattering problems, like low-energy
  neutron-deuteron scattering, while warning me ominously, that he
  himself had tried and failed. Some six months later, when I had
  obtained some partial, very unsatisfactory results, I looked for
  alternative approaches and soon found a rather elementary
  formulation, later known as Kohn's variational principle for
  scattering, and useful for nuclear, atomic and molecular
  problems. Since I had circumvented Schwinger's beloved Green's
  functions, I felt that he was very disappointed. Nevertheless he
  accepted this work as my thesis in 1948. (Much later L. Fadeev
  offered his celebrated solution of the three-body scattering
  problem).<br>
  <br>
  My Harvard friends, close and not so close, included <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1977/index.html">P.W. Anderson</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1981/index.html">N. Bloembergen</a>, H.
  Broida (a little later), K. Case, F. De Hoffman, J. Eisenstein,
  R. Glauber, T. Kuhn, R. Landauer, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/index.html">B. Mottelson</a>, G. Pake,
  F. Rohrlich, and C. Slichter. Schwinger's brilliant lectures on
  nuclear physics also attracted many students and Postdocs from
  MIT, including J. Blatt, M. Goldberger, and J.M. Luttinger. Quite
  a number of this remarkable group would become lifelong friends,
  and one &#8211; J.M. "Quin" Luttinger &#8211; also my closest
  collaborators for 13 years, 1954-66. Almost all went on to
  outstanding careers of one sort or another.<br>
  <br>
  I was totally surprised and thrilled when in the spring of 1948
  Schwinger offered to keep me at Harvard for up to three years. I
  had the choice of being a regular post-doctoral fellow or
  dividing my time equally between research and teaching. Wisely
  &#8211; as it turned out &#8211; I chose the latter. For the next
  two years I shared an office with Sidney Borowitz, later
  Chancellor of New
  York University, who had a similar appointment. We were to
  assist Schwinger in his work on quantum electrodynamics and the
  emerging field theory of strong interactions between nucleons and
  mesons. In view of Schwinger's deep physical insights and
  celebrated mathematical power, I soon felt almost completely
  useless. Borowitz and I did make some very minor contributions,
  while the greats, especially Schwinger and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Feynman</a>, seemed to be on
  their way to unplumbed, perhaps ultimate depths.<br>
  <br>
                For the summer of 1949, I got a job in the Polaroid laboratory 
                in Cambridge, Mass., just before the Polaroid camera made its 
                public appearance. My task was to bring some understanding to 
                the mechanism by which charged particles falling on a photographic 
                plate lead to a photographic image. (This technique had just been 
                introduced to study cosmic rays). I therefore needed to learn 
                something about solid state physics and occasionally, when I encountered 
                things I didn't understand, I consulted Van Vleck.<br>
  <br>
  It seems that these meetings gave him the erroneous impression
  that I knew something about the subject. For one day he explained
  to me that he was about to take a leave of absence and, "since
  you are familiar with solid state physics", he asked me if I
  could teach a course on this subject, which he had planned to
  offer. This time, frustrated with my work on quantum field
  theory, I agreed. I had a family, jobs were scarce, and I thought
  that broadening my competence into a new, more practical, area
  might give me more opportunities.<br>
  <br>
  So, relying largely on the excellent, relatively recent monograph
  by F. Seitz, "Modern Theory Of Solids", I taught one of the first
  broad courses on Solid State Physics in the United States. My
  "students" included several of my friends, N. Bloembergen, C.
  Slichter and G. Pake who conducted experiments (later considered
  as classics) in the brand-new area of nuclear magnetic resonance
  which had just been opened up by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1952/index.html">E. Purcell</a> at Harvard
  and <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1952/index.html">F. Bloch</a> at
  Stanford. Some of my students often understood much more than I,
  they were charitable towards their teacher.<br>
  <br>
  At about the same time I did some calculations suggested by
  Bloembergen, on the recently discovered, so-called Knight shift
  of nuclear magnetic resonance, and, in this connection, returning
  to my old love of variational methods, developed a new
  variational approach to the study of wavefunctions in periodic
  crystals.<br>
  <br>
  Although my appointment was good for another year and a half, I
  began actively looking for a more long-term position. I was a
  naturalized Canadian citizen, with the warmest feelings towards
  Canada, and explored every Canadian university known to me. No
  opportunities presented themselves. Neither did the very meager
  US market for young theorists yield an academic offer. At this
  point a promising possibility appeared for a position in a new
  Westinghouse nuclear reactor laboratory outside of Pittsburgh.
  But during a visit it turned out that US citizenship was required
  and so this possibility too vanished. At that moment I was
  unbelievably lucky. While in Pittsburgh, I stayed with my
  Canadian friend Alfred Schild, who taught in the mathematics
  department at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon
  University). He remarked that F. Seitz and several of his
  colleagus had just left the physics department and moved to
  Illinois, so that &#8211; he thought &#8211; there might be an
  opening for me there. It turned out that the Department Chair, Ed
  Creutz was looking rather desperately for somebody who could
  teach a course in solid state physics and also keep an eye on the
  graduate students who had lost their "doctor-fathers". Within 48
  hours I had a telegram offering me a job!<br>
  <br>
  A few weeks later a happy complication arose. I had earlier
  applied for a National Research Council fellowship for 1950-51
  and now it came through. A request for a short postponement was
  firmly denied. Fortunately, Ed Creutz agreed to give me a
  one-year leave of absence, provided I first taught a compressed
  course in solid state physics. So on December 31, 1950 (to
  satisfy the terms of my fellowship) I arrived in
  Copenhagen.<br>
  <br>
                Originally I had planned to revert to nuclear physics there, in 
                particular the structure of the deuteron. But in the meantime 
                I had become a solid state physicist. Unfortunately no one in 
                Copenhagen, including <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a>, had even heard the expression 
                "Solid State Physics". For a while I worked on old projects. Then, 
                with an Indian visitor named Vachaspati (no initial), I published 
                a criticism of Froehlich's pre-BCS theory of superconductivity, 
                and also did some work on scattering theory.<br>
  <br>
  In the spring of 1951, I was told that an expected visitor for
  the coming year had dropped out and that the Bohr Institute could
  provide me with an Oersted fellowship to remain there until the
  fall of 1952. Very exciting work was going on in Copenhagen,
  which eventually led to the great "Collective Model of the
  Nucleus" of A. Bohr and B. Mottelson, both of whom had become
  close friends. Furthermore my family and I had fallen in love
  with Denmark and the Danish people. A letter from Niels Bohr to
  my department chair at Carnegie quickly resulted in the extension
  of my leave of absence till the fall of 1952.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1951, I became a substitute teacher, replacing
  an ill lecturer at the first summer school at Les Houches, near
  Chamonix in France, conceived and organized by a dynamic young
  French woman, C&eacute;cile Morette De Witt. As an "expert" in
  solid state physics, I offered a few lectures on that subject.
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Wolfgang Pauli</a>,
  who visited, when he learned of my meager knowledge of solids,
  mostly metallic sodium, asked me, true to form, if I was a
  professor of physics or of sodium. He was equally acerbic about
  himself. Some 50 years old at the time, he described himself as
  "a child-wonder in menopause" ("ein Wunderkind in den
  Wechseljahren"). But my most important encounter was with Res
  Jost, an assistant of Pauli at the ETH in Zurich, with whom I
  shared an interest in the so-called inverse scattering problem:
  given asymptotic information, (such as phase-shifts as function
  of energy), of a particle scattered by a potential V(r), what
  quantitative information can be inferred about this potential?
  Later that year, we both found ourselves in Copenhagen and
  addressed this problem in earnest. Jost, at the time a senior
  fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, had to
  return there before we had finished our work. A few months later,
  in the spring of 1952, I received an invitation from Robert
  Oppenheimer, to come to Princeton for a few weeks to finish our
  project. In an intensive and most enjoyable collaboration, we
  succeeded in obtaining a complete solution for S-wave scattering
  by a spherical potential. At about the same time I.M. Gel'fand in
  the Soviet Union published his celebrated work on the inverse
  problem. Jost and I remained close lifelong friends until his
  death in 1989.<br>
  <br>
  After my return to Carnegie Tech in 1952, I began a major
  collaboration with N. Rostoker, then an assistant of an
  experimentalist, later a distinguished plasma theorist. We
  developed a theory for the energy band structure of electrons for
  periodic potentials, harking back to my earlier experience with
  scattering, Green's functions and variational methods. We showed
  how to determine the bandstructure from a knowledge of purely
  geometric structure constants and a small number (~ 3) of
  scattering phase-shifts of the potential in a single
  sphericalized cell. By a different approach this theory was also
  obtained by J. Korringa. It continues to be used under the
  acronym KKR. Other work during my Carnegie years, 1950-59,
  includes the image of the metallic <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html">Fermi</a> Surface in the
  phonon spectrum (Kohn anomaly); exponential localization of
  Wannier functions; and the nature of the insulating state.<br>
  <br>
  My most distinguished colleague and good friend at Carnegie was
  G.C. Wick, and my first PhD's were D. Schechter and V.
  Ambegaokar. I also greatly benefitted from my interaction with T.
  Holstein at Westinghouse.<br>
  <br>
  In 1953, with support from Van Vleck, I obtained a summerjob at
  Bell Labs as assistant of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html">W. Shockley</a>, the
  co-inventor of the transistor. My project was radiation damage of
  Si and Ge by energetic electrons, critical for the use of the
  recently developed semiconductor devices for applications in
  outer space. In particular, I established a reasonably accurate
  energy threshold for permanent displacement of a nucleus from its
  regular lattice position, substantially smaller than had been
  previously presumed. Bell Labs at that time was without question
  the world's outstanding center for research in solid state
  physics and for the first time, gave me a perspective over this
  fascinating, rich field. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html">Bardeen</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html">Brattain</a> and Shockley ,
  after their invention of the transistor, were the great heroes.
  Other world class theorists were C. Herring, G. Wannier and my
  brilliant friend from Harvard, P.W. Anderson. With a few
  interruptions I was to return to Bell Labs every year until 1966.
  I owe this institution my growing up from amateur to
  professional.<br>
  <br>
                In the summer of 1954 both Quin Luttinger and I were at Bell Labs 
                and began our 13-year long collaborations, along with other work 
                outside our professional "marriage". (Our close friendship lasted 
                till his death in 1997). The all-important impurity states in 
                the transistor materials Si and Ge, which govern their electrical 
                and many of their optical properties, were under intense experimental 
                study, which we complemented by theoretical work using so-called 
                effective mass theory. In 1957, I wrote a comprehensive review 
                on this subject. We (mostly Luttinger) also developed an effective 
                Hamiltonian in the presence of magnetic fields, for the complex 
                holes in these elements. A little later we obtained the first 
                non-heuristic derivation of the Boltzman transport equation for 
                <i>quantum mechanical</i> particles. There followed several years 
                of studies of many-body theories, including Luttinger's famous 
                one-dimensional "Luttinger liquid" and the "Luttinger's theorem" 
                about the conservation of the volume enclosed by a metallic Fermi 
                surface, in the presence of electron electron interaction. Finally, 
                in 1966, we showed that superconductivity occurs even with purely 
                repulsive interactions &#8211; contrary to conventional wisdom 
                and possibly relevant to the much later discovery of high-Tc superconductors.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960, when I moved to the University of California San Diego,
  California, my scientific interactions with Luttinger, then at
  Columbia
  University, and with Bell Labs gradually diminished. I did
  some consulting at the nearby General Atomic Laboratory,
  interacting primarily with J. Appel. My university colleagues
  included G. Feher, B. Maple, B. Matthias, S. Schultz, H. Suhl and
  J. Wheatley, &#8211; a wonderful environment. During my 19-year
  stay there I typically worked with two postdocs and four graduate
  students. A high water mark period were the late 1960s, early
  1970s, including N. Lang, D. Mermin, M. Rice, L.J. Sham, D.
  Sherrington, and J. Smith.<br>
  <br>
  I now come to the development of density functional theory (DFT).
  In the fall of 1963, I spent a sabbatical semester at the
  &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris, as guest and in the
  spacious office of my friend Philippe Nozi&egrave;res. Since my
  Carnegie days I had been interested in the electronic structure
  of alloys, a subject of intense experimental interest in both the
  physics and metallurgy departments. In Paris I read some of the
  metallurgical literature, in which the concept of the effective
  charge e* of an atom in an alloy was prominent, which
  characterized in a rough way the transfer of charge between
  atomic cells. It was a <i>local</i> point of view in
  <i>coordinate space,</i> in contrast to the emphasis on
  <i>delocalized</i> waves in <i>momentum space,</i> such as
  Bloch-waves in an average periodic crystal, used for the rough
  description of substitutional alloys. At this point the question
  occurred to me whether, in general, an alloy is <i>completely</i>
  or only partially characterized by its electronic density
  distribution n(r): In the back of my mind I knew that this was
  the case in the Thomas-Fermi approximation of interacting
  electron systems; also, from the "rigid band model" of
  substitutional alloys of neighboring elements, I knew that there
  was a 1-to-1 correspondence between a weak perturbing potential
  <sub><img src="biofig1.gif" width="11" height="12" alt=
  "delta"></sub>v(r) and the corresponding small change <sub><img src=
  "biofig1.gif" width="11" height="12" alt="delta"></sub>n(r) of the
  density distribution. Finally it occurred to me that for a single
  particle there is an explicit elementary relation between the
  potential v(r) and the density, n(r), of the groundstate. Taken
  together, these provided strong support for the conjective that
  the density n(r) completely determines the external potential
  v(r). This would imply that n(r) which integrates to N, the total
  number of electrons, also determines the total Hamilton H and
  hence <i>all</i> properties derivable from H and N, e.g. the
  wavefunction of the 17th excited state, <sub><img src=
  "biofig2.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="psi"></sub><sup>17</sup>
  (r<sub>1</sub>,...,r<sub>N</sub>)! Could this be true? And how
  could it be decided? Could two different potentials,
  v<sub>1</sub>(r) and v<sub>2</sub>(r), with associated different
  groundstates <sub><img src="biofig2.gif" width="12" height="12"
  alt="psi"></sub><sub>1</sub> (r<sub>1</sub>,...,r<sub>N</sub>) and
  <sub><img src="biofig2.gif" width="12" height="12" alt=
  "">2</sub> (r<sub>1</sub>,...,r<sub>N</sub>) give rise to the
  <i>same</i> density distribution? It turned out that a simple
  3-line argument, using my beloved Rayleigh Ritz variational
  principle, confirmed the conjecture. It seemed such a remarkable
  result that I did not trust myself.<br>
  <br>
  By this time I had become friends with another inhabitant of
  Nozi&egrave;re's office, Pierre Hohenberg, a lively young American,
  recently arrived in Paris after a one-year fellowship in the
  Soviet Union. Having completed some work there he seemed to be
  "between" problems and I asked if he would be interested in
  joining me. He was. The first task was a literature search to see
  if this simple result was already known; apparently not. In short
  order we had recast the Rayleigh-Ritz variational theorem for the
  groundstate energy in terms of the density n (r) instead of the
  many electron wave function <sub><img src="biofig2.gif" width=
  "12" height="12" alt="psi"></sub>, leading to what is now called
  the Hohenberg Kohn (HK) variational principle. We fleshed out
  this work with various approximations and published it.<br>
  <br>
  Shortly afterwards I returned to San Diego where my new
  postdoctoral fellow, Lu J. Sham had already arrived. Together we
  derived from the HK variational principle what are now known as
  the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations, which have found extensive use by
  physicists and chemists, including members of my group.<br>
  <br>
  Since the 1970s I have also been working on the theory of
  surfaces, mostly electronic structure. The work with Lang in the
  early 1970s, using DFT, picked up and carried forward where J.
  Bardeen's thesis had left off in the 1930s.<br>
  <br>
  In 1979, I moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara
  to become the initial director of the National Science
  Foundation's Institute for Theoretical Physics (1979-84). I have
  continued to work with postdoctoral fellows and students on DFT
  and other problems that I had put aside in previous years. Since
  the middle 1980s, I have also had increasing, fruitful
  interactions with theoretical chemists. I mention especially
  Robert Parr, the first major theoretical chemist to believe in
  the potential promise of DFT for chemistry who, together with his
  young co-workers, has made major contributions, both conceptual
  and computational.<br>
  <br>
  Since beginning this autobiographical sketch I have turned 76. I
  enormously enjoy the continuing progress by my younger DFT
  colleagues and my own collaboration with some of them. Looking
  back I feel very fortunate to have had a small part in the great
  drama of scientific progress, and most thankful to all those,
  including family, kindly "acting parents", teachers, colleagues,
  students, and collaborators of all ages, who made it
  possible.</p>
