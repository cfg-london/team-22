  <h2>The Organizer-Effect in Embryonic Development</h2>

  <p>The experiments which finally led to the
  discovery of the phenomena which are now designated as
  "organizer-effect" were prompted by a question which actually
  goes back to the beginnings of developmental mechanics, indeed to
  the beginnings of the history of evolution in general. How does
  that harmonious interlocking of separate processes come about
  which makes up the complete process of development? Do they go on
  side by side independently of each other (by
  "self-differentiation", Roux), but from the very beginning so in
  equilibrium that they form the highly complicated end product of
  the complete organism, or is their influence on each other one of
  mutual stimulation, advancement or limitation?</p>

  <p>These questions, various answers to which
  constitute the theories of preformation or epigenesis, were
  lifted out of the realm of speculation up into that of an exact
  science when first Wilhelm Roux and then Hans Driesch used
  experimental methods in their research into development. The
  first experiments consisted in separating the individual parts of
  the embryo from each other and culturing them in isolation. This
  would show what each part was capable of by itself, while at the
  same time showing how far the developmental processes depending
  on them were dependent on or independent of each other.</p>

  <p>In this way Roux was able after taking a
  frog's egg, pricking and destroying one of its two blastomeres,
  to obtain half an embryo from the other. Driesch, on the other
  hand, took a sea-urchin's egg, separated one segmental cell from
  the other and obtained a smaller but complete embryo. Further
  experiments showed that the differing results depended not on the
  material but on the method. The completely isolated segmental
  cell which has been reduced by half can grow into a whole in the
  case not only of the sea-urchin's egg, but also of amphibian's
  egg. This growth is inhibited if the dead cell is left attached;
  when this happens, the cell grows in accordance with its original
  determination, forming, first at least, half an embryo.</p>

  <p>Even in those early days of research into
  developmental mechanics a second method of enquiry into this same
  question was discovered - that of "embryonic transplantation".
  Gustav Born observed that portions of young larval amphibians
  united if their freshly cut edges happened to come into contact
  with each other. He followed up this phenomenon and found that
  the individual portions were capable of self-differentiation to
  an astonishing degree.</p>

  <p>It was from these premises that I began my
  experiments. They were all carried out on young amphibian
  embryos, mostly those of the common striped newt (<i>Triton
  taeniatus</i>). To make these experiments intelligible to the
  non-specialist it will be necessary in the first place to
  describe the main features in the normal development of these
  eggs.</p>

  <p>Development begins immediately after
  fertilization, with a fairly protracted period of cell division
  which is called segmentation on account of the furrowing which
  appears on the surface. By the formation of an inner cavity or
  blastocoele, the blastocyst or blastula comes into being. Its
  lower, vegetative half (the thick floor of the blastocyst)
  consists of large cells rich in yolk, while the upper, animal
  half (the thin roof) is made up of numerous small cells poorer in
  yolk. Between the two is the marginal zone - a ring of
  medium-sized cells.</p>

  <p>Next begins a very complicated and in many
  ways puzzling process: the so-called gastrulation. The end result
  of it is that all the material of the marginal zone and of the
  vegetative half of the blastula becomes invaginated and is thus
  covered over by animal material. Then along the line of
  invagination, i.e. the primitive orifice or blastopore, runs the
  outer layer of cells or ectoderm into the two invaginated layers,
  the mesoderm (originating from the marginal zone), and entoderm
  (corresponding to the vegetative half of the blastula, rich in
  yolk).</p>

  <p>With this the primordia of the most
  important organs, the skin and central nervous system, vertebral
  column and musculature, gut and body cavity have in the main
  achieved their final dispositions. Their visible differentiation
  occupies the next phase of development.</p>

  <p>The primordium of the central nervous
  system originates in the ectoderm of the dorsal surface, starting
  from the blastopore and coming forward as a thickened plate
  shaped like a shield with its anterior half broader than its
  posterior. This is the neural plate, and its lateral margins rise
  up as the neural folds. The neural folds are brought closer to
  each other and fused together so that the neural plate becomes a
  tube - the neural tube. This becomes separated from the epidermis
  and sinks below the surface. Its front end, which is thicker and
  originated in the broader anterior part of the neural plate will
  become brain; its thinner posterior part will become spinal cord.
  The neural plate lies over mesoderm. When the plate forms the
  neural tube, separates off and sinks below the surface, the
  mesoderm divides into five longitudinal strips lying side by
  side. The median strip is destined to be the axial skeleton or
  notochord. To the right and left of it is a row of mesodermal
  blocks or somites. These in turn are flanked on either side by
  the lateral plates from which arises the primordium of the
  coelum.</p>

  <p>Finally, the entoderm first forms a broad
  open gutter, which is shaped like a trough. Its margins then bend
  inward towards the middle, and, along the mid-line - that is,
  just beneath the notochord - it completes the intestinal
  tube.</p>

  <p>All these processes which, given a
  favourable temperature, go forward surprisingly quickly depend
  essentially not on the production of new material from the embryo
  substance but on the rearrangement of what is already there. It
  is therefore possible, and W. Vogt did this to perfection by
  means of staining, to show in the blastula or early gastrula, as
  it were, a topography of the rudiments of the presumptive
  organs.</p>

  <p>In the face of this sort of topographical
  map we are again confronted with the question whether there is a
  real diversity in these parts which corresponds to the pattern of
  the presumptive rudiments in the early gastrula; whether they are
  more or less predestined, i.e. "determined", for their subsequent
  fate or whether they are still indifferent and do not have their
  ultimate determination impressed on them until later.</p>

  <p>The first answer to this question was given
  by experiments in isolation. Thus, if the bisection is not made
  as early as between the two cells after the first segmentation
  but later, even at the blastula stage, or at that of the very
  young gastrula, you can still get twins. So up to this stage the
  cell material must still be to a large degree indifferent and
  capable of being used for various purposes in constructing the
  body. This becomes especially clear when the bisection is made in
  such a way that it separates the ventral half of the embryo from
  the dorsal half. Even then the latter half can develop into a
  miniature embryo of normal proportions. Here the new allocation
  of the material becomes perfectly clear. According to the
  evidence of our topographical map, the dorsal half contains
  almost all the material for the neural plate, i.e. much too much
  for a half-sized embryo; on the other hand, it lacks all of the
  presumptive epidermis. This latter must therefore be made good by
  material from the former.</p>

  <p>Now if presumptive neural plate and
  presumptive epidermis are interchangeable, they must therefore
  also be interchangeable without prejudicing further normal
  development. Embryonic transplantation at this early stage must
  therefore produce different consequences than it would if
  performed in the later stages in which Gustav Born
  experimented.</p>

  <p>It was on these thoughts and on the
  development of a way to facilitate the manipulation of these
  uncommonly fragile young embryos and operation upon them that the
  success of the new experiments rested.</p>

  <p>The first experiment consisted in
  exchanging a portion of presumptive epidermis and neural plate
  between two embryos of the same age, each being at the beginning
  of gastrulation. The grafts took so smoothly and development
  proceeded so normally that their margins left no trace except
  that the grafted tissue itself was distinguishable for a while by
  means of its natural pigmentation, or by artificial vital
  staining. From this it was obvious hat, as we had expected, the
  portions were interchansable - that is to say, presumptive
  epidermis could become neural plate and presumptive neural plate
  could become epidermis.</p>

  <p>From this we can infer not only the very
  indifferent nature of the cells at this early stage of
  development; the result allows the much more important conclusion
  that the transplanted portion must in its new environment be
  subjected to some kind of influence which determines its
  subsequent development.</p>

  <p>It is here that the analytical superiority
  of this experiment is shown over the previous ones, whereby use
  was made of the regulation power of the embryo. For it was now
  possible to examine all the parts of the embryo separately for
  their active and reactive induction capacity, and also to vary
  the age and species of the implant with great latitude.</p>

  <p>At the same time this opens important fresh
  possibilities: first of all in the matter of procedures. The
  interchangeability may be undertaken not only between embryos of
  the same species but also between those of different species,
  e.g. between embryos of <i>Triton taeniatus</i> which have a fair
  amount of pigmentation and those of <i>Triton cristatus</i> which
  have little or none. This allows us to distinguish the implant
  more or less clearly for a very long time even in sections and
  often to define its limits in terms of its cells. Let me describe
  a case of this kind in more detail.</p>

  <p>A portion of presumptive neural plate was
  removed from an embryo <i>Triton taeniatus</i> at the beginning
  of gastrulation and exchanged with a portion of presumptive
  epidermis from a <i>Triton cristatus</i> embryo of the same age.
  The embryo in which the host was taeniatus later showed
  anteriorly and to the left in the neutral plate a smoothly
  grafted oblong area of white cristatus tissue which developed
  further into parts of the brain and eye. The other embryo with
  cristatus as the host showed on the right-hand side in the
  epidermis of the gill area a long streak of dark taeniatus tissue
  which developed further as epidermis and formed the covering of
  the outer gills. Since the portions have been exchanged, and
  since one portion is now settled where the other came from, we
  can see at once from sections that brain substance has come from
  presumptive epidermis, and epidermis has come from presumptive
  brain substance.</p>

  <p>Because the implant in this "heteroplastic"
  transplantation remains distinguishable for a fairly long time it
  is possible to test the interchangeability of those parts of the
  embryo which develop inwards during gastrulation. We can, for
  example, establish whether the exchange is feasible not only as
  between one and the same layer of cells but also as between two
  different layers.</p>

  <p>By and large this is in fact the case. So
  O. Mangold was able to show that mesodermal organs such as
  notochord, somites and pronephric ducts could arise from
  presumptive ectoderm by suitable transplantation at the beginning
  of gastrulation.</p>

  <p>Now, when random samples were taken from
  the whole surface of the gastrula and transplanted in this way in
  an indifferent place it became apparent that a limited area,
  namely the region of the upper and lateral blastopore lip did not
  conform. A portion of this kind, transplanted in an indifferent
  place in another embryo of the same age did not develop according
  to its new environment but rather persisted in the course
  previously entered upon and constrained its environment to follow
  it. It invaginates altogether as if it were still in its old
  place, builds up part of the axial organs and completes itself
  out of the mesodermal environment. Above all, it induces in the
  overlying ectoderm a neural plate which closes to a tube, in
  favourable cases bulges out into optical vesicles and adds lenses
  and auditory vesicles.</p>

  <p>First carried out at my instigation by
  Hilde Mangold, this experiment shows, therefore, that there is an
  area in the embryo whose parts, when transplanted into an
  indifferent part of another embryo, there organize the primordia
  for a secondary embryo. These parts were therefore given the name
  of "organizers" and the region of the embryos in which they are
  gathered together at the beginning of gastrulation was called the
  "centre of organization". H. Bautzmann has defined the limits of
  this area by systematic probing outwards and has found that it
  coincides more or less with the area of the presumptive
  notochord-mesoderm which invaginates later.</p>

  <p>From these two facts - the development of
  an indifferent piece in conformity with its location and the
  inductive effect of an organizer - several series of experiments
  proceeded, connected with obvious questions. We will just touch
  on a few of them.</p>

  <p>Since at first the organizer becomes
  invaginated, that is, completes the gastrulation it has begun, so
  that material in the neighbourhood can be included in the
  process, one might suppose that it is this process itself which
  causes further determination of the parts it has affected. But
  this is, to say the least, extremely unlikely, because the
  induction of neural plate takes place even though it has not
  itself been invaginated. This can be proved by a method which is
  highly significant for the whole progress of research. That is to
  say, those parts of the embryo which are being examined for their
  inductive capacity can be made to bypass the activte invagination
  and can be made effective by inserting them in the blastocoele
  through a small slit in the roof of the blastula or young
  gastrula which quickly heals over. The gastrulation does not
  suffer any essential disturbance from this and while it goes on,
  the blastocoele disappears and the piece we are examining comes
  to lie directly under the ectoderm and there shows what it is
  capable of. Thus a portion of the upper marginal zone of the
  blastula or early gastrula, or else a piece of the roof of the
  archenteron of the mature gastrula was planted in the blastocoele
  of a young gastrula and so brought beneath the ectoderm from the
  beginning; it was demonstrated that these portions were able to
  induce neural plate.</p>

  <p>Now, these methods made it also possible to
  examine for their inductive capacity pieces which could not be
  embodied in the host embryo by any other means, either because
  they differed too much in age and origin or else because they
  were no longer living, or even not of living origin. We will have
  a look at these experiments next.</p>

  <p>It had already been demonstrated in my
  early experiments that host and donor did not need to be exactly
  the same age in order to be able to work together. It was O.
  Mangold in particular who followed up this question and made the
  important discovery that the inductive reaction capacity is
  strictly limited in time while the inductive action capacity
  remains for a long time, far beyond the stage necessary for
  normal development.</p>

  <p>This is true not only, as H. Bautzmann
  showed, for the notochord which normally induces in the earlier
  stages, but strangely enough also for a portion of embryo in
  which there would otherwise be no question if this kind of
  induction, viz. the neural plate. Both O. Mangold and I found
  simultaneously but independently, and starting from different
  lines of enquiry, that it can induce after transplantation. To
  this, O. Mangold added the important statement that the inductive
  capacity of this tissue persists into late stages, until there is
  a functioning brain in the hatched out larva.</p>

  <p>Associated with this is the question
  whether and how far the inductive influence is specific in
  nature. Also, and this is connected with the other question, what
  role the action and reaction system plays in bringing about the
  highly complicated product of development. I had already
  expressed the opinion earlier that the inductive stimulus does
  not prescribe the specific character but releases that already
  inherent in the reaction system. The inductive potential already
  adduced of parts which have far exceeded the stage of observed
  normal effectiveness also points in the same direction. Still
  more is this true of the more recent experiments by Holtfreter
  which prove the extensive diffusion of factors which are able to
  induce a neural plate in the ectoderm of the young gastrula. So
  pretty well the whole animal kingdom from tapeworms to human
  beings was examined by the implantation method and shown to be
  capable of induction.</p>

  <p>However, this does not only make obvious
  the largely unspecific character of the inducting agent; it also
  seems probable that it is chemical in nature. It was always
  thought to be so from the beginning. To make quite sure,
  experiments had to be made in which the inductor had been
  destroyed in various ways - by desiccation, freezing, or boiling.
  We got no clearly positive result from these first experiments;
  not until later similar ones by Holtfreter. It became apparent
  that this kind of treatment did not destroy the capacity of the
  inductors and, further, quite paradoxically, that this can in
  fact call forth such capacity in non-inductors.</p>

  <p>The first experiment with a chemically
  treated inductor was carried out by Else Wehmeier and proved that
  an inductor immersed in 96% alcohol for 3f minutes did not lose
  its capacity.</p>

  <p>After this, the chemical analysis was
  tackled in various quarters: in Germany by F. G. Fischer and E.
  Wehmeier, later with H. Lehmann, L. J&uuml;hling, and K.
  Hultzsch; in England by J. Needham, D. M. Needham, and C. H.
  Waddington. From the large number of separate results which still
  seem to be coming in I should like to draw attention to one only
  which is of the utmost importance in this connection. Chemically
  simple substances as, for example, synthetic oleic acid can
  nevertheless induce a complicated and in a certain sense complete
  structure such as a neural plate which will close over into a
  neural tube. Again, that would therefore indicate, as do some of
  the results from abnormal inductors, that most of the
  complication is based in the structure of the reaction system,
  and that the inductor has only a triggering and in some
  circumstances directing effect. Whether and, if so, how far and
  in what way such "unorganized inductors" (for it would be a
  contradiction in terms to speak here of "organizers") determine
  the direction is at the moment one of the most interesting but
  also most difficult questions.</p>

  <p>But this broaches a new complex of
  questions which goes right back to the first induction
  experiments. It had already turned out in Hilde Mangold's
  experiments that the induced embryonic primordia were in the main
  arranged in the same direction as the primary ones and on a level
  with them. This seemed to emerge either from a general structural
  plan of the embryo or else from an influence of the primary
  embryonic primordia.</p>

  <p>To investigate the former phenomenon, the
  similarity of direction of the constituents of the two embryos,
  two different experiments were set up. Upper blastopore lip still
  engaged in invagination was implanted in a different orientation
  in relation to the host embryo - crosswise and opposite to the
  orientation of the later primary primordia. With crosswise
  implantation it was shown that the invaginating cells of the
  graft were carried along by the gastrulating movements of the
  host and that thus the substratum was laid down along the long
  axis of the embryo. With opposite implantation the cells of the
  graft migrating against the stream get jammed but are not
  deflected. A controlling structure of the embryo, therefore, only
  works in so far as it determines the direction of the
  gastrulation movements both of the host embryo and the graft. It
  becomes even more obvious when a piece of the roof of the
  archenteron is planted in the blastocoele. The graft does not lie
  fixed in the cell formation of the host embryo so it can rather
  keep its original position and the induced secondary embryo
  primordia can be either crosswise or entirely opposite to those
  of the primary.</p>

  <p><br>
  Of even greater interest, perhaps, is the result of the
  experiments which were to explain how the secondary primordia of
  the embryo were on the same level. For example, it can be seen
  that the auditory vesicles of both lie in nearly the same cross
  section of the embryo. In order to find out the cause of this
  regional determination or at least to establish its position the
  implantation was varied in two ways. To understand this we must
  remember one simple fact about development. In the course of
  gastrulation the invaginating material is rolled inwards around
  the upper lip of the blastopore. Thus, the material first
  invaginated lies farthest towards the front underneath the
  subsequent brain, while material invaginating later underlies the
  future spinal cord. Now it could be that the substratum of the
  head also determines the brain character of the anterior end of
  the neural plate ("head-organizer") and the substratum of the
  trunk area determines the character of the spinal cord
  ("trunk-organizer"). In order to test this, a portion of upper
  blastopore lip at the beginning of gastrulation (head-organizer)
  and one from an advanced and mature gastrula (trunk-organizer)
  were transplanted in the same place in an early gastrula, i.e. at
  the site where the lower blastopore lip would later develop; this
  was done also at <i>different</i> sites - in the head and trunk
  areas. It was shown that in fact something like a head- and
  trunk-organizer does exist, since the former is able to induce a
  brain also in the trunk region. It was shown moreover that the
  level in the embryo at which the induction takes place
  co-determines its nature, since at the head level even a
  trunk-organizer can induce a brain.</p>

  <p>We have already indicated above that this
  last could have two different reasons. It could be that the
  disposition for building the head surrounds the whole embryo at
  head level in a broad circular band. But it could equally well be
  that a regional differentiating influence is exerted by the
  primary embryo primordia which co-determines the shape of the
  secondary embryo. In the region of the primary brain,
  respectively its primordia, there would be a "brain area" in
  which neural substance which had been stimulated by induction
  would develop into brain.</p>

  <p>On the basis of definite facts established
  by experiment, Holtfreter has decided against the first and in
  favour of the second possibility. Moreover he has in addition
  discovered some more extremely interesting examples of these
  "embryonic areas". As we have seen, inducing tissues retain their
  induction capacity for a long time, and far beyond the stage of
  development required in the normal course. That being so, in a
  normal-embryo neural substance would have to be induced afresh in
  the epidermis which lies over the neural tube or the somites,
  unless that tissue had already exceeded its ephemeral period of
  reaction capacity. We could therefore infer, what Holtfreter
  discovered in a different enquiry, that a young portion still
  capable of reaction would in fact behave differently in this
  site. And it really is true that in particles of ectoderm from
  early gastrula implanted superficially at different levels in
  older gastrula a great variety of inherent potencies is
  activated. It depends on the region, so that in an anterior area,
  brain with optic and aural vesicles is induced, while further
  back, notochord and pronephric ducts are induced, and further
  back still, little tails. That shows that even the older embryo
  is still riddled with "embryonic areas" which do not normally
  come to light but can be detected at any time by indicators rich
  in potencies.</p>

  <p><br>
  These inductions between parts of different ages do not complete
  the embryo by replacing what has been taken away; they are not
  "complementary" (O. Mangold) as in the case of a graft of the
  same age from an exactly similar site. Rather do the induced
  parts develop according to site only in a general sense, through
  "autonomic" induction; they are produced in excess and have a
  certain independence (O. Mangold).</p>

  <p>A still further series of questions and
  experiments arose out of the first induction experiments and we
  will just touch on these in conclusion. As said earlier the
  induction effect is also possible with heteroplastic
  transplantation, i.e. between embryos of different species. For
  example; presumptive brain of a <i>Triton taeniatus</i> embryo
  can be made into epidermis in the gill area of a <i>Triton
  cristatus</i>. But the outer gills covered by it will have
  taeniatus properties; that is to say, they will be similar not to
  those of the species which has caused their development (instead
  of that of brain) but will resemble that of the species from
  which the implant originates. Potencies are not transferred to
  the "gill area" of the host; it is merely that those potencies
  relevant to its location are awakened. And in heteroplastic
  transplantation these diverge somewhat from those of the host. If
  an exchange between samples of different genus or even between
  systematic groups remote from each other (xeno-plastic) were
  possible and followed by induction effects, very valuable
  conclusions could be expected.</p>

  <p>In this respect there is another question
  that must be dealt with which cropped up during those first
  experiments: whether in fact the induced organ is laid down part
  for part or as a whole. From the example of the outer gills we
  were not able to answer the question, but we could do so from two
  other organs - the lens and the balancers.</p>

  <p>In the Triton, as with most amphibia, the
  lens of the eye arises as a sequel to the optic cup and its size
  depends strictly on it. Thus, if the optic cup diminishes in size
  so does the lens. So it follows that the smaller eye of the
  <i>Triton taeniatus</i> has a smaller lens than the larger eye of
  <i>Triton cristatus</i> at the same stage of development. E.
  Rotmann now interchanged presumptive lens epidermis with
  presumptive ventral epidermis in each of the two species at the
  beginning of gastrulation. The lenses which are formed at a
  certainmoment thereafter follow the size and degree of
  development of the donor. This can be seen very clearly in the
  constricted lens primordia with early fibre development; but even
  quite early stages show lens growth in the epidermis which in one
  case is too large for the optic cup and in the other case too
  small. The lens potencies therefore react in the field that
  activates them not only qualitatively but also quantitatively in
  accordance with the heredity of the species to which they belong.
  The lens potencies are not stimulated by the optic cup to the
  extent within which, with its drawn-in retina layer, it comes
  into contact with the epidermis. Rather is the lens more or less
  put in hand as a whole with the epidermis.</p>

  <p>The balancers behave in the same way in a
  further completely analogous experiment of Rotmann's. In its
  structure and in its angle to the head it is similar to the
  species from which the transplanted ectoderm is derived and not
  to the other from which the induction has proceeded.</p>

  <p>Added to this problem of uniformity
  according to species there is another in those cases of
  xenoplastic transplantation in which organs of different
  morphological significance are situated in the same region. This
  is so, for instance, when the ectoderm of the presumptive mouth
  region is exchanged between the embryos of Urodela and Anura. In
  the newt larva, lateral to the head and beneath the eyes are two
  balancers, while the tadpole has beneath the mouth near the
  ventral mid-line two lower suction cups. Moreover, the newt has
  real teeth in its mouth which both in origin and structure are
  comparable to our own teeth. The tadpole's mouth, on the other
  hand, is furnished with horny jaws and little horny processes.
  These are quite different in origin and structure from real teeth
  and indeed have nothing to do with them morphologically. It has
  been an old dream of mine to substitute for the presumptive mouth
  region of a newt the foreign ectoderm which comes from a frog
  early in gastrulation, since I wanted to find out what kind of
  "armoury" the mouth would form then. This experiment has now been
  successfully carried out several times since then, and also the
  other way round. It was first performed at my instigation and in
  my Institute by O. Schottt, later by Holtfreter, O. Mangold, and
  E. Rotmann with results we expected but hardly dared hope for. In
  the mouth region of a Triton larva there arose from transplanted
  Anura ectoderm of the early gastrula, suction cups and horny
  jaws; in a tadpole, balancers arose from Urodela ectoderm. When
  the foreign implant was so narrow that it left the place of
  origin of the characteristic organs wholly or partly free, these
  could then themselves develop alongside.</p>

  <p>After these results we can say with all
  certainty of the inducing stimulus that as regards <i>what</i>
  arises, it must be of a very special nature; but as to <i>how</i>
  it arises, it must be of a very general character. We have,
  however, no idea at all how the "mouth area" releases potencies
  of the "mouth structures", even when they are of an entirely
  different species.</p>
