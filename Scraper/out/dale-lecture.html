  <h2>Some Recent Extensions of the Chemical Transmission of the
  Effects of Nerve Impulses</h2>

  <p>The transmission of the effects of nerve
  impulses, by the release of chemical agents, first became an
  experimental reality in 1921. In that year Otto Loewi published
  the first of the series <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote2">2</a>, <a href="#footnote3">3</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote4">4</a>, <a href="#footnote5">5</a>, <a href=
  "#footnote6">6</a></sup> of papers from his laboratory, which, in
  the years from 1921-1926, established all the principal
  characteristics of this newly revealed mechanism, so far as it
  applied to the peripheral transmission of effects from autonomic
  nerves to the effector units innervated by them. Of the general
  history of this discovery, of the speculations which preceded it,
  and of its more recent developments in detail in many
  laboratories, as regards one aspect of it particularly by Cannon
  and his co-workers in Boston, you have heard from Professor Loewi
  himself. I propose to deal with a wider application of this
  conception of chemical transmission, which has resulted from
  researches carried out during the past three years in my own
  laboratory, by a number of able investigators - J.H. Gaddum, W.
  Feldberg, A. Vartiainen, Marthe Vogt, G.L. Brown, Z.M. Bacq.
  These investigations have made it possible to suggest that a
  fundamentally similar chemical mechanism is concerned in the
  transmission of excitatory effects at the synapses in all
  autonomic ganglia, and at the motor nerve endings in ordinary,
  voluntary muscle.</p>

  <p>You will see that, according to this
  relatively new evidence, a chemical mechanism of transmission is
  concerned, not only with the effects of autonomic nerves, but
  with the whole of the efferent activities of the peripheral
  nervous system, whether voluntary or involuntary in function.
  This extension of the principle of chemical transmission has come
  as a surprise to many; the relative ease, with which the evidence
  justifying it can be obtained, has been surprising to ourselves.
  But the basic conception, which encouraged us to undertake
  experiments in this direction, was no novelty to me; and for its
  origin I must ask you to look briefly at some experiments which I
  had already made and published in 1914<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> . My chemical collaborator at that
  time, Dr. Ewins<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, had
  isolated the substance responsible for a characteristic activity
  which I had detected in certain ergot extracts, and it had proved
  to be acetylcholine, the very intense activity of which had been
  observed by Reid Hunt<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
  already in 1906. Since we had found this substance in nature, and
  it was no longer merely a synthetic curiosity, it seemed to me of
  interest to explore its activity in greater detail. I was thus
  able to describe it as having two apparently distinct types of
  action. Through what I termed its "muscarine" action, it
  reproduced at the periphery all the effects of parasympathetic
  nerves, with a fidelity which, as I indicated, was comparable to
  that with which adrenaline had been shown, some ten years
  earlier, to reproduce those of true sympathetic nerves. All these
  peripheral muscarine actions, these parasympathomimetic effects
  of acetylcholine, were very readily abolished by atropine. When
  they were thus suppressed, another type of action was revealed,
  which I termed the "nicotine" action, because it closely
  resembled the action of that alkaloid in its intense stimulant
  effect on all autonomic ganglion cells, and, as later appeared,
  on voluntary muscle fibres. I am tempted here to quote some words
  which I wrote in that paper, in 1914.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"It is clear, then, that the distinction
  between <i>muscarine</i> and <i>nicotine</i> activity cannot be
  made with absolute sharpness... Nor is there any evidence
  enabling us to regard one group of the molecule as responsible
  for the one type of action, and another for the other. One can
  merely conclude that there is some degree of biochemical
  similarity between the ganglion cells of the whole involuntary
  system and the terminations of voluntary nerve fibres in striated
  muscle, on the one hand, and the mechanism connected with the
  peripheral terminations of craniosacral involuntary (i.e.
  parasympathetic) nerves on the other."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the same paper I had speculated on the
  possible occurrence of acetylcholine in the animal body, and on
  its physiological significance if it should be found there; and
  had pointed out the extraordinary evanescence of its action,
  suggesting that an esterase probably contributed to its rapid
  removal from the blood.</p>

  <p>When, therefore, some seven years later,
  Loewi described his beautiful experiments, showing that
  stimulation of the vagus nerve produced its inhibitor effects on
  the frog's heart by the liberation of a chemical substance; and
  when his successive papers provided cumulative evidence of the
  similarity of this substance to acetylcholine, including its
  extreme liability to destruction by an esterase, which Loewi
  extracted from the heart muscle; I believe that I was more ready
  than most of my contemporaries for immediate acceptance of the
  evidence for this "Vagusstoff", and more eager, almost, than
  Professor Loewi himself, to assume its identity with
  acetylcholine. There was wanting, it seemed to me, only one item
  of evidence to justify certainty as to the nature of this
  substance, namely, a proof that acetylcholine itself, and not
  merely some choline ester of closely similar properties, was an
  actual constituent of the animal body.</p>

  <p>Professor Loewi has already mentioned the
  extraction and identification of acetylcholine, as a natural
  constituent of a mammalian organ, by my late and deeply lamented
  colleague, H.W. Dudley, and myself<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>, in 1929. He has also dealt with
  the general rule that parasympathetic effects are transmitted by
  acetylcholine, and true sympathetic effects by what his own most
  recent experiments appear definitely to identify as adrenaline.
  He has mentioned also the important exceptions to that rule. In
  view of such exceptions, it seemed to me desirable to have a
  terminology enabling us to refer to a nerve fibre in terms of the
  chemical transmission of its effects, without reference to its
  anatomical origin; and, on this functional basis, I<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> proposed to refer to nerve fibres
  and their impulses as "cholinergic" or "adrenergic", as the case
  might be. Such a functional terminology seemed to me the more
  important, in view of the evidence which was already coming from
  our experiments, that acetylcholine had a much wider function as
  a transmitter of nervous excitation, than that concerned with the
  post-ganglionic fibres of the autonomic system, and their effects
  on involuntary muscle and gland cells. For all such effects of
  acetylcholine, directly analogous to those which Loewi discovered
  in relation to the heart vagus, were covered by what I had termed
  the "muscarine" action of acetylcholine, and were all very
  readily suppressed by atropine. But there remained, as yet
  without any corresponding physiological significance, the other
  type of action of acetylcholine, so similar in distribution to
  that of nicotine, which had come to my notice nearly twenty years
  earlier. Was it credible, I asked myself, that this sensitiveness
  of ganglion cells, and of voluntary muscle fibres, to the
  substance now known to be the transmitter of peripheral
  parasympathetic effects, was entirely without physiological
  meaning? I could not believe it. At the same time, it had to be
  recognized that the transmission of nervous excitation at
  ganglionic synapses, and at motor nerve endings in voluntary
  muscle, was a phenomenon of a different order from any of those
  in connexion with which the intervention of a chemical
  transmitter had hitherto been demonstrated, or even considered.
  Acetylcholine, released at the peripheral endings of the vagus or
  the chorda tympani, could be pictured as reaching the heart cells
  or those of the salivary gland by diffusion, and there inhibiting
  an automatic rhythm, or exciting glandular secretion. At a
  ganglionic synapse or a motor ending on a voluntary muscle fibre,
  on the other hand, the evidence was clear, that a single impulse,
  reaching the end of the preganglionic or motor nerve fibre,
  caused the passage from the ganglion cell, along its
  post-ganglionic axon, of a single nerve impulse, and no more; or
  caused the passage, from the motor end plate of the muscle fibre,
  of a single wave of excitation, of propagated contraction, and no
  more. In both cases, the phenomenon had the appearance of a
  direct, unbroken conduction, to ganglion cell or muscle fibre, of
  the same propagated wave of physico-chemical disturbance as had
  constituted the preganglionic or the motor nerve impulse, with
  only a slight, almost negligible retardation in its passage
  across the ganglionic synapse or the neuromuscular junction. And,
  indeed, such continuity of the conduction, in both cases, had
  generally been assumed, and, in the case of the neuromuscular
  conduction, in particular, had been implicit in the
  interpretation of a great body of detailed evidence, which the
  ingenuity and the labours of two generations of physiologists had
  produced.</p>

  <p>Could the stimulating action of
  acetylcholine on ganglion cells and on muscle fibres, its
  "nicotine" actions, be pictured as intervening in these rapid and
  strictly limited transmissions of excitation across ganglionic
  and neuro-muscular synapses? We could only imagine such
  intervention, if we could think of acetylcholine as appearing and
  disappearing in a manner entirely different from that involved in
  its transmission of peripheral parasympathetic effects. We must
  suppose that an impulse, arriving at the ending of a
  preganglionic or a voluntary motor nerve fibre, releases with a
  flashlike suddenness a small charge of acetylcholine, in
  immediate contact with the ganglion cell or the motor end plate
  of the muscle fibre. We must suppose that this sudden rise in
  concentration of acetylcholine stimulates the ganglion cell to
  the discharge of a postganglionic impulse, or initiates a
  propagated wave of excitation along the muscle fibre. And we must
  suppose, further, that the acetylcholine then disappears with a
  suddenness comparable to that of its liberation, so that it has
  vanished by the end of the brief refractory period of the
  ganglion cell or the muscle fibre, which is thus left fully
  responsive to another discharge of acetylcholine, by another
  nerve impulse. Such a sequence of events seems to involve two
  things. The first is a depot, closely related to the
  preganglionic or motor nerve ending<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, in which acetylcholine may be
  held in some association which prevents its action and protects
  it from destruction, and from which it can be immediately
  liberated by the arrival of a nerve impulse. Professor Loewi has
  mentioned the evidence for such storage of acetylcholine, waiting
  for liberation, at parasympathetic nerve endings; and Brown and
  Feldberg<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>, in my
  laboratory, have obtained evidence that nearly the whole of the
  acetylcholine, obtainable by extraction from a normal sympathetic
  ganglion, disappears when the preganglionic nerve fibres are
  caused to degenerate by section; so that its maintenance is, in
  fact, dependent on the integrity of the preganglionic nerve
  endings. The second thing required, by the suggested action of
  acetylcholine in transmitting the kind of excitation we are
  discussing, is a mechanism for its very rapid removal, so that it
  disappears completely within the few milliseconds of the
  refractory period of muscle fibre or ganglion cell. One naturally
  thinks of the specific cholinesterase, first detected by Loewi in
  heart muscle, and since found to be widely distributed in the
  blood and tissues. Even when obtained in solution this potent
  enzyme destroys acetylcholine with a quite remarkable rapidity;
  and if we could suppose it to be concentrated on surfaces at
  preganglionic or motor nerve endings, in immediate relation to
  the site of liberation and action of acetylcholine, it might
  furnish an adequate mechanism for the complete destruction of
  this substance, even during the very brief interval of the
  refractory period. Here, again, I am permitted to make
  preliminary mention of experiments which Dr. Franz Briicke, who
  earlier worked under Prof. Loewi, is even now making in my
  laboratory, and which have already given uniform evidence that a
  large amount of cholinesterase is present in a sympathetic
  ganglion, and that this, like the acetylcholine obtainable from
  such a ganglion, disappears largely when the preganglionic
  fibres, and their endings in the ganglion, are caused to
  degenerate. We have evidence, then, that both the reserve of
  acetylcholine, and the esterase required for its destruction, are
  in fact associated with the preganglionic nerve endings, as our
  hypothesis demands. I am departing, however, too far from the
  true historical order, and presenting recent and confirmatory
  details of evidence, before I have described the initial
  observations, which opened this new field to our experimental
  exploration.</p>

  <p>Although from the time when it first became
  clear that Loewi's Vagusstoff was acetylcholine, I had begun to
  consider the possible significance of its "nicotine" actions, it
  was long before the possibility of its intervention as
  transmitter at ganglionic synapses, or at voluntary motor nerve
  endings, seemed to be accessible to investigation. Experiments on
  the ganglion came first in order. Chang and Gaddum<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> had found, confirming an earlier
  observation by Witanowski, that sympathetic ganglia were rich in
  acetylcholine. Feldberg, just before he returned to my laboratory
  for a stay of some years, had observed, with Minz and
  Tsudzimura<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>, that the
  effects of splanchnic nerve stimulation are transmitted to the
  cells of the suprarenal medulla by the release of acetylcholine
  in that tissue. Now these medullary cells are morphological
  analogues of sympathetic ganglion cells, and Feldberg, continuing
  this study in my laboratory, found that this stimulating _ action
  of acetylcholine on the suprarenal medulla belonged to the
  "nicotine, side of its actions. Clearly we had to extend these
  observations to the ganglion; and a method of perfusing the
  superior cervical ganglion of the cat, then recently described by
  Kibjakov<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>, made the
  experiment possible. Feldberg and Gaddum<a href=
  "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>, though unable to reproduce
  effects obtained by Kibjakow with pure Locke's solution, found
  that, when eserine was added to the fluid perfusing the ganglion,
  stimulation of the preganglionic fibres regularly caused the
  appearance of acetycholine in the venous effluent. It could be
  identified by its characteristic instability, and by the fact
  that its activity matched the same known concentration of
  acerylcholine in a series of different physiological tests,
  covering both "muscarine" and "nicotine" actions. It appeared in
  the venous fluid in relatively high concentrations, so strong,
  indeed, that reinjection of the fluid into the arterial side of
  the perfusion caused, on occasion, a direct stimulation of the
  ganglion cells. It was clear that, if the liberation took place
  actually at the synapses, the acetylcholine liberated by each
  preganglionic impulse, in small dose, indeed, but in much higher
  concentration than that in which it reached the venous effluent,
  <i>must</i> act as a stimulus to the corresponding ganglion
  cells. Feldberg and Vartiainen<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> then showed that it was, in fact,
  only the arrival of preganglionic impulses at synapses which
  caused the acerylcholine to appear. They showed, further, that
  the ganglion cells might be paralysed by nicotine or curarine, so
  that they would no longer respond to preganglionic stimulation or
  to the injection of acetylcholine, but that such treatment did
  not, in the least, diminish the output of acetylcholine caused by
  the arrival of preganglionic impulses at the synapses. There was,
  in this respect, a complete analogy with the paralysing effect of
  atropine on the action of the heart vagus, which, as Loewi and
  Navratil had shown many years before, stops the action of
  acetylcholine on the heart, but does not affect its liberation by
  the vagus impulses.</p>

  <p>My colleagues have added other chapters of
  interest to this story of chemical transmission at the synapses
  in the ganglion. I may just mention Brown and Feldberg's<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> observation that potassium ions,
  the mobilization of which is so intimately connected with the
  nervous impulse, will liberate acetylcholine from its depot in
  the ganglion, in a manner closely recalling the effect of
  preganglionic impulses; and their more recent finding<a href=
  "#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> that, with prolonged
  preganglionic stimulation, the ganglion sheds into the fluid
  perfusing it several times as much acetylcholine as can be
  obtained from a similar, unstimulated ganglion by artificial
  extraction. The effects of eserine, on the transmission of
  excitation in the ganglion, are complicated by a paralyzing
  action of this alkaloid on the ganglion cells, and still need
  further elucidation. I can more usefully pass to our recent work
  on voluntary muscle, in which such effects are much clearer.</p>

  <p>The difficulty facing us in the case of the
  voluntary muscle was largely a quantitative one. In a sympathetic
  ganglion, the synaptic junctions, at which the acetylcholine is
  released by the incident preganglionic impulses, form a large
  part of the small amount of tissue perfused. In a voluntary
  muscle the bulk of tissue, supplied by a rich network of
  capillary blood vessels, is relatively enormous in relation to
  the motor nerve endings, of which only one is present on each
  muscle fibre. The volume of perfusion fluid necessary to maintain
  functional activity is, therefore, relatively very large, in
  relation to the amount of acerylcholine which the scattered motor
  nerve endings can be expected to yield when impulses reach them.
  With the skilled and patient co-operation of Dr. Feldberg and
  Miss Vogt<a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>, however, it was
  possible to overcome these difficulties, and to demonstrate that,
  when only the voluntary motor fibres to a muscle are stimulated,
  to the complete exclusion of the autonomic and sensory components
  of the mixed nerve, acetylcholine passes into the Locke's
  solution, containing a small proportion of eserine, with which
  the muscle is perfused. If, by calculation, we estimate the
  amount of acetylcholine thus obtained from the effect of a single
  motor impulse, arriving at a single nerve ending, the quantity is
  of the same order as that similarly estimated for a single
  preganglionic impulse and a single ganglion cell; in both cases
  10<sup>-15</sup> gram, which corresponds to about three million
  molecules of acetylcholine. We found that, if the muscle was
  denervated by degeneration, direct stimulation, though evoking
  vigorous contractions, produced no trace of acetylcholine. If, on
  the other hand, the muscle was completely paralysed to the
  effects of nerve impulses by curarine, stimulation of its motor
  nerve fibres caused the usual output of acerylcholine, though the
  muscle remained completely passive. Again there is a complete
  analogy with Loewi's observations on the heart vagus and
  atropine.</p>

  <p>With this demonstration, that acetylcholine
  was liberated at the endings of motor nerve fibres in voluntary
  muscle, in immediate relation to the motor end plates of the
  muscle fibres, only one side of our problem had been solved.
  Acetylcholine, injected into the vessels of a ganglion, could be
  shown to stimulate the ganglion cells to the discharge of
  postganglionic impulses. In the case of normal voluntary muscle,
  on the other hand, the evidence before us suggested only that
  certain muscles of frogs, reptiles and birds responded to the
  application of acetylcholine, not by quick, propagated
  contractions like those evoked by motor nerve impulses, but by
  slow, persistent contractures, of low tension. As for the normal
  muscles of mammals, on which our evidence of acetylchohne
  liberation had been obtained, these were supposed, on evidence
  provided by myself among others, to give no response at all to
  acetylchohne, except in large doses, and then only irregularly.
  The denervated mammalian muscle was known to be highly sensitive
  to acetylcholine, but the evidence, again from myself among
  others, suggested that its response was of the nature of a
  contracture, and not of a quick, propagated contraction.</p>

  <p>Considering the manner in which
  acetylcholine must reach the motor end plates of the muscle
  fibres, if it were indeed the transmitter of motor nerve
  excitation - that it must appear with a flash-like suddenness, in
  high concentration, simultaneously at every nerve ending - we
  concluded that the ordinary method of injecting acerylcholine, so
  that it reached the muscle by slow diffusion from the general
  circulation, could not possibly reproduce this abrupt appearance
  at the points responsive to its action. We attempted a nearer
  approach to these supposed conditions of its natural release, by
  a method which enabled us, after a brief interruption of the
  arterial blood supply, to inject a small dose of acetylcholine,
  in a small volume of saline solution, directly and rapidly into
  the empty blood vessels of the muscle<a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>. The responses which we thus
  obtained were of an entirely different kind from any which had
  previously been recorded. A dose of about 2 gamma of
  acetylcholine, thus injected at close range into the vessels of a
  cat's gastrocnemius, produced a contraction with a maximal
  tension equal to that of the twitch produced by a maximal motor
  nerve volley, and of a rapidity but little less than that of the
  motor nerve twitch. We have direct evidence that only a small
  part of the acetylcholine so injected actually reaches the muscle
  end plates by diffusion from the vessels; and we argued that, in
  any case, it could not reach them simultaneously, but only in
  rapid succession; so that the response, in spite of its
  superficial resemblance to a rather slow twitch, must actually be
  a brief, asynchronous tetanus. My colleague, G.L. Brown, using a
  strictly localized electrical lead from the muscle, involving
  only a few fibres, has obtained clear evidence that the response
  has, indeed, that nature. It is a brief burst of unsynchronized
  and repetitive responses of the individual muscle fibres; but
  these individual responses are, without doubt, quick, propagated
  contractions, and there is no semblance of contracture about the
  phenomenon. Unlike the response of the denervated muscle to
  acetylcholine, this quick response of normal mammalian muscle is
  suppressed with great ease by curarine.</p>

  <p>At this point I must briefly refer to some
  observations made only in the past few weeks, and still in
  progress. The normal mammalian muscle had seemed to present us
  initially with the greatest difficulty, being supposed not to
  react to acetylcholine at all. This difficulty being removed by a
  more adequate technique, we had to face the fact that the
  function of acetylcholine, as transmitter of voluntary motor
  nerve impulses, could not be confined to the case of mammalian
  muscle. The muscle of the frog, the classical object of
  innumerable studies of neuromuscular conduction, had been found
  to respond to acetylcholine, indeed, but only by contractures of
  low tension, and not by propagated contractions comparable to
  those evoked by nerve-volleys. Here again, we reflected that the
  method which had been used for the application of acetylcholine,
  the immersion of the excised muscle in a suitable dilution of the
  substance, could hardly be expected to reproduce that rapidity of
  access to the appropriate points on the fibres, which its
  simultaneous liberation at all nerve endings would achieve. The
  patient skill of my colleague, G.L. Brown, has now made it
  possible to apply acetylcholine to the frog's muscle by direct
  injection of a small dose into its empty blood vessels, in a
  manner quite analogous to that which produced such significant
  results in the mammalian muscle. If 1 gamma of acetylcholine, for
  example, dissolved in 0.1 cc of Ringer's solution, is thus
  injected suddenly into the artery supplying the frog's
  gastrocnemius, the surface of the muscle, covered with its
  glistening aponeurosis, shows immediately the ripple and shimmer
  of innumerable, unsynchronized contractions, propagated along the
  fibres and fascicles of the muscle; at the height of the effect a
  tension of several hundred grams is developed; and the electrical
  record gives decisive evidence that this response is an
  irregular, asynchronous tetanus, and not a contracture. With
  larger doses this tetanus is cut short and extinguished by the
  contracture - the only effect of acetylcholine on frog's muscle
  which earlier work had recognized.</p>

  <p>From the study of the mammalian muscle we
  have also obtained what seems to be clear evidence concerning a
  mechanism by which acetylcholine, suddenly liberated at the nerve
  ending to transmit the excitatory effect of a motor impulse to
  the muscle fibre, may, with a comparable suddenness, be removed
  completely during the refractory period. If this removal is due,
  as we have suggested, to the destructive action of
  cholinesterase, concentrated on surfaces at the nerve ending, we
  should expect that eserine, with its depressant effect on the
  action of the cholinesterase, discovered by Loewi and Navratil,
  would delay the disappearance, from the neighbourhood of the
  motor end plates of the muscle fibres, of the acetylcholine
  liberated by a single nerve volley, and would thereby modify the
  response of the muscle. The effect is easy to demonstrate.
  Eserine causes, in fact, a great increase of the maximum tension
  attained by the contraction of the muscle in response to a
  maximal nerve volley. The all-or-none principle forbade us to
  suppose that such a potentiated response was a single twitch; and
  the electrical records showed that it was, indeed, repetitive,
  and had the nature of a brief, diminishing tetanus<a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The eserine has so depressed the action of
  the esterase at the nerve endings, that the acetylcholine
  liberated by a single nerve volley lingers there, and reexcites
  the muscle at each emergence from successive refractory periods,
  until the concentration falls at last below the stimulation
  threshold. Bacq and Brown<a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>
  have more recently extended these observations to a series on
  artificial eserine analogues, and have found that the
  potentiating action on the response of mammalian muscle to single
  nerve volleys is, in fact, proportional, in the different
  compounds of the series, to the anticholinesterase action, as
  independently determined.</p>

  <p>There are many other aspects of these
  phenomena, some of them still under active investigation in my
  laboratory. I must be content today to have presented the main
  headings of the evidence, which, as it seems to me, is forcing
  upon us the conclusion, in spite of the preconceptions which made
  the idea initially so difficult to entertain, that acetylcholine
  does actually intervene as a chemical transmitter of excitation,
  in the rapid and individualized transmission at ganglionic
  synapses and at the motor endings in voluntary muscle; that, in
  the terminology which I have proposed, the preganglionic fibres
  of the autonomic system, and the motor nerve fibres to voluntary
  muscle, are also "cholinergic".</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>You will see that we are thus led to the
  conclusion that nearly all the efferent neurones of the whole
  peripheral nervous system are cholinergic; only the
  postganglionic fibres of the true sympathetic system are
  adrenergic, and not even all of these. As I have earlier pointed
  out, on more than one occasion<sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a>,
  <a href="#footnote23">23</a></sup>, before the evidence for the
  cholinergic function of voluntary motor nerves was nearly as
  strong as it has now become, this new classification of nerve
  fibres, by chemical function, renders at once intelligible the
  formerly puzzling evidence as to the functional compatibility of
  different types of nerve fibre, in replacing one another in
  experimental regeneration. The whole of the evidence of such
  replacement, obtained by Langley and Anderson early in the
  present century, can now be summarized by the simple statement
  that any cholinergic fibres can replace any other cholinergic
  fibres, and that adrenergic fibres can replace adrenergic fibres,
  but that no fibre can be functionally replaced by one which
  employs a different chemical transmitter. The chemical function,
  as I have expressed it, seems to be characteristic of the
  neurone, and unchangeable. In that connexion, particular interest
  appears to me to attach to the recent observations of
  Wybauw<a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>, which seem to
  provide clear evidence that the antidromic vasodilatation,
  generally believed to be produced through peripheral axon
  branches from sensory fibres, also employs a cholinergic
  mechanism. If this is substantiated, and if my suggestion holds
  good that the chemical mechanism is characteristic of the
  neurone, the question at once presents itself, whether at
  transmission of excitation will be found.</p>

  <p>Hitherto the evidence concerning a chemical
  transmission in the central nervous system, of the type which we
  have found prevailing at all peripheral synapses, is scattered
  and insufficiently uniform in its indications. The basal ganglia
  of the brain are peculiarly rich in acetylcholine, the presence
  of which must presumably have some significance; and suggestive
  effects of eserine and of acetylcholine, injected into the
  ventricles of the brain, have been described. I take the view,
  however, that we need a much larger array of well authenticated
  facts, before we begin to theorize. It is here, especially, that
  we need to proceed with caution; if the principle of chemical
  transmission is ultimately to find a further extension to the
  interneuronal transmission in the brain itself, it is by patient
  testing of the groundwork of experimental fact, at each new step,
  that a safe and steady advance will be achieved. The possible
  importance of such an extension, even for practical medicine and
  therapeutics, could hardly be overestimated. Hitherto the
  conception of chemical transmission at nerve endings and neuronal
  synapses, originating in Loewi's discovery, and with the
  extension that the work of my colleagues has been able to give to
  it, can claim one practical result, in the specific, though alas
  only short, alleviation of the condition of myasthenia gravis, by
  eserine and its synthetic analogues.</p>
