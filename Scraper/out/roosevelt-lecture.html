  <h2>International Peace</h2>

  <p>It is with peculiar pleasure that I stand
  here today to express the deep appreciation I feel of the high
  honor conferred upon me by the presentation of the Nobel Peace
  Prize. The gold medal which formed part of the prize I shall
  always keep, and I shall hand it on to my children as a precious
  heirloom. The sum of money provided as part of the prize by the
  wise generosity of the illustrious founder of this world-famous
  prize system, I did not, under the peculiar circumstances of the
  case, feel at liberty to keep. I think it eminently just and
  proper that in most cases the recipient of the prize should keep
  for his own use the prize in its entirety. But in this case,
  while I did not act officially as President of the United States,
  it was nevertheless only because I was President that I was
  enabled to act at all; and I felt that the money must be
  considered as having been given me in trust for the United
  States. I therefore used it as a nucleus for a foundation<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> to forward the cause of industrial
  peace, as being well within the general purpose of your
  Committee; for in our complex industrial civilization of today
  the peace of righteousness and justice, the only kind of peace
  worth having, is at least as necessary in the industrial world as
  it is among nations. There is at least as much need to curb the
  cruel greed and arrogance of part of the world of capital, to
  curb the cruel greed and violence of part of the world of labor,
  as to check a cruel and unhealthy militarism in international
  relationships.</p>

  <p>We must ever bear in mind that the great
  end in view is righteousness, justice as between man and man,
  nation and nation, the chance to lead our lives on a somewhat
  higher level, with a broader spirit of brotherly goodwill one for
  another. Peace is generally good in itself, but it is never the
  highest good unless it comes as the handmaid of righteousness;
  and it becomes a very evil thing if it serves merely as a mask
  for cowardice and sloth, or as an instrument to further the ends
  of despotism or anarchy. We despise and abhor the bully, the
  brawler, the oppressor, whether in private or public life, but we
  despise no less the coward and the voluptuary. No man is worth
  calling a man who will not fight rather than submit to infamy or
  see those that are dear to him suffer wrong. No nation deserves
  to exist if it permits itself to lose the stern and virile
  virtues; and this without regard to whether the loss is due to
  the growth of a heartless and all-absorbing commercialism, to
  prolonged indulgence in luxury and soft, effortless ease, or to
  the deification of a warped and twisted sentimentality.</p>

  <p>Moreover, and above all, let us remember
  that words count only when they give expression to deeds, or are
  to be translated into them. The leaders of the Red Terror<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> prattled of peace while they
  steeped their hands in the blood of the innocent; and many a
  tyrant has called it peace when he has scourged honest protest
  into silence. Our words must be judged by our deeds; and in
  striving for a lofty ideal we must use practical methods; and if
  we cannot attain all at one leap, we must advance towards it step
  by step, reasonably content so long as we do actually make some
  progress in the right direction.</p>

  <p>Now, having freely admitted the limitations
  of our work and the qualifications to be borne in mind, I feel
  that I have the right to have my words taken seriously when I
  point out where, in my judgment, great advance can be made in the
  cause of international peace. I speak as a practical man, and
  whatever I now advocate I actually tried to do when I was for the
  time being the head of a great nation and keenly jealous of its
  honor and interest. I ask other nations to do only what I should
  be glad to see my own nation do.</p>

  <p>The advance can be made along several
  lines. First of all there can be treaties of arbitration. There
  are, of course, states so backward that a civilized community
  ought not to enter into an arbitration treaty with them, at least
  until we have gone much further than at present in securing some
  kind of international police action. But all really civilized
  communities should have effective arbitration treaties among
  themselves. I believe that these treaties can cover almost all
  questions liable to arise between such nations, if they are drawn
  with the explicit agreement that each contracting party will
  respect the others territory and its absolute sovereignty within
  that territory, and the equally explicit agreement that (aside
  from the very rare cases where the nation's honor is vitally
  concerned) all other possible subjects of controversy will be
  submitted to arbitration. Such a treaty would insure peace unless
  one party deliberately violated it. Of course, as yet there is no
  adequate safeguard against such deliberate violation, but the
  establishment of a sufficient number of these treaties would go a
  long way towards creating a world opinion which would finally
  find expression in the provision of methods to forbid or punish
  any such violation.</p>

  <p>Secondly, there is the further development
  of the Hague Tribunal, of the work of the conferences and courts
  at The Hague. It has been well said that the first Hague
  Conference framed a Magna Charta for the nations; it set before
  us an ideal which has already to some extent been realized, and
  towards the full realization of which we can all steadily strive.
  The second Conference made further progress; the third should do
  yet more<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Meanwhile the
  American government has more than once tentatively suggested
  methods for completing the Court of Arbitral Justice constituted
  at the second Hague Conference and for rendering it effective. It
  is earnestly to be hoped that the various governments of Europe,
  working with those of America and of Asia, shall set themselves
  seriously to the task of devising some method which shall
  accomplish this result. If I may venture the suggestion, it would
  be well for the statesmen of the world, in planning for the
  erection of this world court, to study what has been done in the
  United States by the Supreme Court. I cannot help thinking that
  the Constitution of the United States, notably in the
  establishment of the Supreme Court and in the methods adopted for
  securing peace and good relations among and between the different
  states, offers certain valuable analogies to what should be
  striven for in order to secure, through the Hague courts and
  conferences, a species of world federation for international
  peace and justice. There are, of course, fundamental differences
  between what the United States Constitution does and what we
  should even attempt at this time to secure at The Hague; but the
  methods adopted in the American Constitution to prevent
  hostilities between the states, and to secure the supremacy of
  the Federal Court in certain classes of cases<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, are well worth the study of those
  who seek at The Hague to obtain the same results on a world
  scale.</p>

  <p>Finally, it would be a masterstroke if
  those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of
  Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to
  prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others. The
  supreme difficulty in connection with developing the peace work
  of The Hague arises from the lack of any executive power, of any
  police power to enforce the decrees of the court. In any
  community of any size the authority of the courts rests upon
  actual or potential force: on the existence of a police, or on
  the knowledge that the able-bodied men of the country are both
  ready and willing to see that the decrees of judicial and
  legislative bodies are put into effect. In new and wild
  communities where there is violence, an honest man must protect
  himself; and until other means of securing his safety are
  devised, it is both foolish and wicked to persuade him to
  surrender his arms while the men who are dangerous to the
  community retain theirs. He should not renounce the right to
  protect himself by his own efforts until the community is so
  organized that it can effectively relieve the individual of the
  duty of putting down violence. So it is with nations. Each nation
  must keep well prepared to defend itself until the establishment
  of some form of international police power, competent and willing
  to prevent violence as between nations. As things are now, such
  power to command peace throughout the world could best be assured
  by some combination between those great nations which sincerely
  desire peace and have no thought themselves of committing
  aggressions. The combination might at first be only to secure
  peace within certain definite limits and on certain definite
  conditions; but the ruler or statesman who should bring about
  such a combination would have earned his place in history for all
  time and his title to the gratitude of all mankind.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote*"></a>* President
  Roosevelt spoke in the National Theatre in Oslo to an audience of
  over 2,000. This text is taken from <i>Les Prix Nobel en
  1909</i>; it is identical to that in <i>The Works of Theodore
  Roosevelt</i>, Vol. 18, and to that, save for paragraphing, in
  the <i>New York Times</i>, May 6, 1910. After his salutation, Mr.
  Roosevelt prefaced his formal remarks with a tribute to
  Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson, Norwegian author and member of
  the Nobel Committee which awarded Roosevelt the prize, who had
  died only nine days before. The reporter for the <i>New York
  Times</i> says that Roosevelt read the speech, departing from the
  script to repeat in the same words or in somewhat different words
  the ideas he had just expressed. On the evening of May 5, despite
  hoarseness which became evident during the course of his speech
  in the afternoon, Roosevelt spoke at a banquet in his honor,
  reviewing his presidential actions concerning problems in Cuba,
  Santo Domingo, Panama, and the Philippines. This speech, recorded
  stenographically and printed under the title "The Colonial Policy
  of the United States" in <i>African and European Addresses by
  Theodore Roosevelt</i>, taken in conjunction with the Nobel
  address, constitutes what may be called his theory of "peace with
  action".</p>

  The $36,734.79 prize was held in trust for Roosevelt's intention
  by a committee which included the Chief Justice of the Supreme
  Court and the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor.
  They made no use of the money, and it gathered interest until
  1917 when Roosevelt asked Congress to return it to him for
  distribution among various charities in the United States and
  Europe which were providing relief to victims of the World War.
  In August of that year, the total sum - $45,482.83 - was so
  distributed.</p>

  (September, 1793-July, 1794), sometimes identified as the "Red
  Terror" to distinguish it from the short-lived "White Terror",
  which was an effort by the Royalists in 1795 to destroy the
  Revolution.</p>
