  <h1>Rodney R. Porter - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="porter.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Rodney Robert Porter</b> born 8 October
  1917 at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England.<br>
  <br>
  He was educated at the Ashton-in-Makerfield Grammar School taking
  his Hons.B.Sc. (Biochemistry) in 1939 at the University of
  Liverpool and his Ph.D. at the University of
  Cambridge in 1948.<br>
  <br>
  After one year's postdoctoral work at Cambridge, Professor Porter
  joined the scientific staff of the National Institute
  of Medical Research in 1949 and was there until 1960 when he
  joined St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London University as
  the first Pfizer Professor of Immunology.<br>
  <br>
  In 1967, he was appointed Whitley Professor of Biochemistry in
  the University of
  Oxford and Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.<br>
  <br>
  Amongst his awards are those of:<br>
  <br>
  Fellow of the Royal Society, 1964<br>
  Gairdner Foundation Award of Merit, 1966<br>
  Ciba Medal (Biochemical Society), 1967<br>
  Karl Landsteiner Memorial Award from the American Association of
  Blood Banks, 1968<br>
  National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., Foreign
  Member 1972<br>
  <br>
  He took his Ph.D. at Cambridge under the supervision of Dr.
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1958/index.html">F. Sanger</a>
  investigating protein chemistry. In 1948 Professor Porter started
  to investigate the structure of antibodies, but on moving to Mill
  Hill he worked on methods of protein fractionation collaborating
  with Dr. <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1952/index.html">A. J. P.
  Martin</a>. The particular interest was in chromatographic
  methods of fractionation.<br>
  <br>
  He returned to the study of the chemical structure of antibodies
  leading to the finding of the three fragments produced by
  splitting with papain in 1958-59. He continued this work at St.
  Mary's Hospital Medical School and put forward the peptide chain
  structure of antibodies in 1962.<br>
  <br>
  Since moving to Oxford he has been concerned with the structure
  of antibody combining site, of the genetic markers of
  immunoglobulins and recently in the chemical structure of some of
  the early complement components.<br>
  <br>
  During the war years 1940-46 Professor Porter was in the army
  serving with the R.A., R.E., and R.A.S.C., finishing with the
  rank of Major. He was with the First Army in 1942 in the invasion
  of Algeria and with the 8th Army during the invasion of Silicy
  and then Italy. He remained with the Central Mediterranean Forces
  in Italy, Austria, Greece and Crete until January 1946.</p>
