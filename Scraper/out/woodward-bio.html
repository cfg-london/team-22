  <h1>Robert B. Woodward - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="woodward.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Robert Burns Woodward</b> was
  born in Boston on April 10th, 1917, the only child of Margaret
  Burns, a native of Glasgow, and Arthur Woodward, of English
  antecedents, who died in October, 1918, at the age of
  thirty-three.<br>
  <br>
  Woodward was attracted to chemistry at a very early age, and
  indulged his taste for the science in private activities
  throughout the period of his primary and secondary education in
  the public schools of Quincy, a suburb of Boston. In 1933, he
  entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he
  was excluded for inattention to formal studies at the end of the
  Fall term, 1934. The Institute authorities generously allowed him
  to re-enroll in the Fall term of 1935, and he took the degrees of
  Bachelor of Science in 1936 and Doctor of Philosophy in 1937.
  Since that time he has been associated with Harvard University,
  as Postdoctoral Fellow (1937-1938), Member of the Society of
  Fellows (1938-1940), Instructor in Chemistry (1941-1944),
  Assistant Professor (1944-1946), Associate Professor (1946-1950),
  Professor (1950-1953), Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry
  (1953-1960), and Donner Professor of Science since 1960. In 1963
  he assumed direction of the Woodward Research Institute at Basel.
  He was a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology (1966-1971), and he is a Member of the Board of
  Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science.<br>
  <br>
  Woodward has been unusually fortunate in the outstanding personal
  qualities and scientific capabilities of a large proportion of
  his more than two hundred and fifty collaborators in Cambridge,
  and latterly in Basel, of whom more than half have assumed
  academic positions. He has also on numerous occasions enjoyed
  exceptionally stimulating and fruitful collaboration with
  fellow-scientists in laboratories other than his own. His
  interests in chemistry are wide, but the main arena of his
  first-hand engagement has been the investigation of natural
  products - a domain he regards as endlessly fascinating in
  itself, and one which presents unlimited and unparalleled
  opportunities for the discovery, testing, development and
  refinement of general principles.<br>
  <br>
  Prof. Woodward holds more than twenty honorary degrees of which
  only a few are listed here: D.Sc. Wesleyan
  University, 1945; D. Sc. Harvard University, 1957; D. Sc.
  University of
  Cambridge (England), 1964; D. Sc. Brandeis
  University, 1965; D. Sc. Israel Institute of Technology (Haifa), 1966;
  D.Sc. University of
  Western Ontario (Canada), 1968;D.Sc. Universite de Louvain
  (Belgium), 1970.<br>
