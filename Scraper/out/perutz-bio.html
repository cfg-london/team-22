  <h1>Max F. Perutz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="perutz.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Max Ferdinand Perutz</b> was born in
  Vienna on May 19th, 1914. Both his parents, Hugo Perutz and Dely
  Goldschmidt, came from families of textile manufacturers who had
  made their fortune in the 19th century by the introduction of
  mechanical spinning and weaving into the Austrian monarchy. He
  was sent to school at the Theresianum, a grammar school derived
  from an officers academy of the days of the empress Maria
  Theresia, and his parents suggested that he should study law in
  preparation for entering the family business. However, a good
  schoolmaster awakened his interest in chemistry, and he had no
  difficulty in persuading his parents to let him study the subject
  of his choice.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932, he entered Vienna University, where he, in his own words,
  "wasted five semesters in an exacting course of inorganic
  analysis". His curiosity was aroused, however, by organic
  chemistry, and especially by a course of organic biochemistry,
  given by F. von Wessely, in which Sir F.G. Hopkins' work at
  Cambridge was
  mentioned. It was here that Perutz decided that Cambridge was the
  place where he wanted to work for his Ph.D. thesis. With
  financial help from his father he became a research student at
  the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge under J.D. Bernal in
  September 1936, and he has stayed at Cambridge ever since.<br>
  <br>
  After Hitler's invasion in Austria and Czechoslovakia, the family
  business was expropriated, his parents became refugees, and his
  own funds were soon exhausted. He was saved by being appointed
  research assistant to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html">Sir Lawrence Bragg</a>,
  under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, on January 1st,
  1939. The grant continued, with various interruptions due to the
  war, until 1945, when Perutz was given an Imperial Chemical
  Industries Research Fellowship. In October 1947, he was made head
  of the newly constituted Medical Research Council Unit for
  Molecular Biology, with J.C. Kendrew representing its entire
  staff. He continued holding this post until he was made Chairman
  of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology,
  in March 1962. His collaboration with Sir Lawrence Bragg has
  continued through all these years.<br>
  <br>
  The scientific work of Perutz on the structure of haemoglobin
  started as a result of a conversation with F. Haurowitz in
  Prague, in September 1937. G.S. Adair made him the first crystals
  of horse haemoglobin, and Bernal and I. Fankuchen showed him how
  to take X-ray pictures and how to interpret them. Early in 1938,
  Bernal, Fankuchen, and Perutz [<i>Nature</i>, 141 (1938) 523]
  published a joint paper on X-ray diffraction from crystals of
  haemoglobin and chymotrypsin. The chymotrypsin crystals were
  twinned and therefore difficult to work with, and so Perutz
  continued with haemoglobin. D. Keilin, then Professor of Biology
  and Parasitology at Cambridge, soon became interested in the work
  and provided Perutz and his colleagues with the biochemical
  laboratory facilities which they lacked at the Cavendish. Thus
  from 1938 until the early fifties the protein chemistry was done
  at Keilin's Molteno Institute and the X-ray work at the
  Cavendish, with Perutz busily bridging the gap between biology
  and physics on his bicycle. The rest of the story is well-known
  and forms the subject of his Nobel discourse.<br>
  <br>
  Perutz has persued one sideline concerned with glaciers, studying
  their crystal texture and mechanism of flow, but this was mainly
  an excuse for working in the mountains: he is a keen mountaineer,
  his other recreations being walking, skiing and gardening.
  Scientifically, his overwhelming interest lies on the side of
  molecular biology. He is grateful for having had the good fortune
  of being joined by colleagues of great ability, several of whom
  have now been honoured with the Nobel Prize at the same time as
  Perutz himself. Kendrew came in 1946, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Crick</a> in 1948, and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html">Watson</a> arrived
  as a visitor in 1951. Recently <a href="../1958/index.html">F.
  Sanger</a>, who received the Nobel Prize in 1958, also joined
  forces with them. Perutz is extremely happy at the generous
  recognition given by the Swedish Academy of Sciences and the
  Royal Karolinska Institute to their great common adventures and
  hopes that it will spur them to new endeavours.<br>
  <br>
  Perutz, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society, was made Commander of the
  British Empire in 1962. He is also an honorary member of the
  American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  In 1942, Perutz married Gisela Peiser. They have two children,
  Vivien (b. 1944) and Robin (b. 1949).</p>
