  <h2>Security and Disarmament</h2>

  <p>The two problems treated in this essay are
  the most delicate and current of present-day politics. They have
  also for a long time been fundamental problems of pacifism. It is
  not by chance that they are treated together here; on the
  contrary it is impossible to separate them, for each is dependent
  upon the other.</p>

  <p>The popular, and one may say naive, idea is
  that peace can be secured by disarmament and that disarmament
  must therefore precede the attainment of absolute security and
  lasting peace. This idea prevailed in the early days of the
  organized peace movement. <i>Lay Down Your Arms</i> was the title
  that our great pioneer, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1905/index.html">Bertha von Suttner</a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, gave her famous book - a book
  which, in German-speaking countries at least, has done more to
  popularize our cause than all our congresses and pamphlets. This
  title was generally understood to mean: "Lay down your arms and
  we shall have peace."</p>

  <p>It is to the credit of the peace movement
  that it demonstrated before the war<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> that this was a misconception.
  Lightly armed nations can move toward war just as easily as those
  which are armed to the teeth, and they will do so if the usual
  causes of war are not removed. Even a total and universal
  disarmament does not guarantee the maintenance of peace. Should
  the occasion arise, flails and scythes would again come into
  their own as weapons. Disarmed nations embroiled in war would
  obtain modern weapons as quickly as possible by converting
  peacetime industry.</p>

  <p>The relationship of the two problems is
  rather the reverse. To a great extent disarmament is dependent on
  guarantees of peace. Security comes first and disarmament
  second.</p>

  <p>Armaments are necessary - or are maintained
  on the pretext of necessity - because of a real or an imagined
  danger of war. Let us assume that the ideal were reached; let us
  imagine a state of international life in which the danger of war
  no longer exists. Then no one would dare to demand a penny for
  obviously completely superfluous armaments. The theory held by us
  pacifists, particularly by Alfred Fried<a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, was: "Disarmament will be the
  result of secure peace rather than the means of obtaining
  it."</p>

  <p>The security of which we speak is to be
  attained by the development of international law through an
  international organization based on the principles of law and
  justice. So long as peace is not attained by law (so argue the
  advocates of armaments) the military protection of a country must
  not be undermined, and until such is the case disarmament is
  impossible.</p>

  <p>One can take exception to this idea on the
  grounds that a method of disarmament exists which does not
  interfere with military security. The present level of armaments
  could be taken as the starting point. It could be stipulated in
  an international treaty that these armaments should be
  simultaneously and uniformly reduced by a certain proportion in
  all countries. The military security would remain unchanged since
  it is dependent on the relative, rather than the absolute, level
  of armaments. The ratio of 100 to 100 gives no more security than
  10 to 10. Thus, if armaments were curtailed without a secure
  peace and all countries disarmed proportionately, military
  security would have been in no way affected.</p>

  <p>This is logically sound, but it
  misunderstands psychology. In life, particularly in public life,
  psychology is more powerful than logic. When distrust exists
  between governments, when there is a danger of war, they will not
  be willing to disarm even when logic indicates that disarmament
  would not affect military security at all.</p>

  <p>Time and time again we have experienced
  efforts directed toward this popular and simple concept of
  securing peace by means of disarmament. The famous Rescript of
  the Czar in 1898<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> did not
  speak of organized international law, only of the necessity to
  restrict armaments. It was the criticism from the pacifists and
  from the Interparliamentary Union<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> which brought about the inclusion
  of peaceful settlement of disputes on the agenda of the first
  Hague Conference<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The same observation could be made of the
  conference which the trade unions called at The Hague in
  December, 1922, to organize cooperation between workers and
  pacifists. Leaders of the trade unions, who were at that time new
  to these problems, spoke, as had the Czar in 1898, of the
  necessity of disarming to secure peace. On the other hand, it is
  very interesting that Mr. Levinson<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, the originator of the "Outlawry of
  War" movement, should emphatically declare in Chicago that he was
  not a pacifist because he did not seek to attain peace through
  disarmament! So little did he know of the peace movement and so
  self-revealing did the popular error appear to him.</p>

  <p>Some pacifists have carried the sound idea
  of the prime importance of security too far, to the point of
  declaring that any consideration of disarmament is superfluous
  and pointless as long as eternal peace has not been attained.</p>

  <p>That is a doctrinaire view which does not
  take the facts into account. Limitation of armaments in itself is
  economically and financially important quite apart from security.
  This argument is so well known and so often discussed that there
  is no need to linger over it. It will be sufficient to point to
  the enormous burdens which armaments place on the economic,
  social, and intellectual resources of a nation, as well as on its
  budget and taxes.</p>

  <p>But that is not all. Disarmament or
  limitation of armaments, which depends on the progress made on
  security, also contributes to the maintenance of peace. The
  increase in armaments, the endless arms race - this in itself is
  a potential cause of war. Influential military men want to
  demonstrate that their profession has some use. Many people who
  are disturbed by the terrible growth of armaments become
  accustomed and resigned to the belief that war is inevitable.
  They say, "Better a terrible end than an endless terror." That is
  the greatest cause of war. Every success in limiting armaments is
  a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists, and
  every such success thus supports the fight for international law
  and order.</p>

  <p>Among pacifists it was above all the
  English who always insisted on the importance of disarmament.
  They said that the man in the street would not understand the
  kind of pacifism that neglected to demand immediate restriction
  of armaments. The smallest success achieved in this field would
  have a greater effect on public opinion than the most striking
  progress in international law. The friends of peace on the
  Continent, primarily the French and Germans represented by such
  men as &Eacute;mile Arnaud<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> and
  Alfred Fried, concentrated their efforts more on the problems of
  organization for international justice.</p>

  <p>Apart from these differences, which have
  reappeared at the present time more sharply and seriously until
  they have become irreconcilable conflicts, the outcome of
  discussion has been not only an understanding of the enormous
  importance of the two problems each considered separately from
  the other, but also a recognition of their complete
  interdependence. Let us now review the individual development of
  each before the war: first disarmament, then security.</p>

  <p>In any consideration of disarmament, a
  distinction must be drawn between the positions of pacifists, of
  members of parliament, and of governments. We pacifists have not
  ceased to point to the grave danger of armaments and to insist on
  their curtailment. We have proposed resolutions and plans to the
  public and to governments. The conclusion reached in our studies
  was that the best and perhaps the only way to limit armaments
  would be through the creation of an international treaty
  embracing all the great powers and the contention that national
  budgets provide the only practicable yardstick for the limitation
  of armaments. We who were pacifists before the war became very
  moderate in our demands so as not to be regarded as utopian
  idealists. Often we spoke not of disarmament but of the
  "limitation of armaments", and because of this terminology the
  question was placed on the agenda of the congresses.</p>

  <p>Although I am myself its originator, I must
  mention a proposal which came at the end of this prewar
  development. I do so because the people most competent to judge
  have recognized it as the only proposal from the prewar period
  which is to be taken seriously and which could serve as a basis
  for further studies<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>. This
  proposal was a draft for an international disarmament treaty
  which I presented to the International Peace Congress in 1913 and
  then to the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union, both of
  which were held at The Hague. The draft dealt only with the
  maintenance of the status quo by keeping budgets at their present
  normal level, with automatic five-percent reductions over
  six-year periods. Detailed proposals were given for a machinery
  of arbitration to cover all doubtful cases and all unavoidable
  differences of opinion.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the
  Interparliamentary Union deserve great credit in the field of
  international law, the Union has always been very reticent
  concerning disarmament. The report which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1909/index.html">d'Estournelles de
  Constant</a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> delivered in
  Geneva in 1912 on behalf of a study group was nothing more than a
  very eloquent indictment of the evils and dangers of armaments
  and militarism, without even a mention of the terms on which arms
  might be restricted.</p>

  <p>The following year, after I had prepared my
  draft, the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union at The
  Hague decided to set up a special commission to study the problem
  seriously. The French were to be represented by their former war
  minister, Messimy<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>. I had
  suggested Erzberger as the German representative because the
  problem in Germany was to win over the Center Party<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>. As author of the draft, I was
  attached to the commission. The date on which it was to convene
  in Stockholm had already been set, but then the war broke
  out.</p>

  <p>The Czar's Rescript forced governments to
  tackle the question of disarmament. The result at the first Hague
  Conference was merely a resolution which was ineffective but
  nevertheless of great importance because of its recognition of a
  principle which the governments had previously opposed. They
  acknowledged in a resolution approved unanimously that
  restriction of armaments was desirable for the economic and moral
  well-being of the nations. As long as it was only we poor
  pacifists who said that kind of thing we were treated as
  lunatics, as incurable utopians, or even as traitors. It was of
  immense significance to our propaganda that governments
  themselves now accepted our postulates.</p>

  <p>At the second Hague Conference the
  obstinate opposition of the German government kept the
  disarmament question off the agenda. It required a very adroit
  maneuver by the British government to get even one resolution
  passed. There was no discussion. The resolution confirmed the one
  approved by the first Hague Conference and bound the governments
  to continue their studies. "To continue their studies" was a very
  euphemistic way of putting it. Actually, they had not yet begun.
  This chain of events was broken off by the war. The situation
  today has altered completely.</p>

  <p>Let us now return to the problem of
  security as it was before the war.</p>

  <p>For a long time practically the only
  solution visualized was a court of arbitration. This is the older
  method, one by which conflicts apparently not soluble through
  diplomatic channels are placed before an ad hoc court of
  arbitration. Great progress was made when arbitration treaties
  were concluded in which the contracting powers pledge in advance
  to submit all conflicts to an arbitration court, treaties which
  not only specify the composition of the court, but also its
  procedure.</p>

  <p>Pacifist propaganda and the resolutions of
  the parliamentarians encouraged such treaties, and toward the end
  of the nineteenth century their number had increased
  considerably. The next step appeared to be a worldwide
  international treaty and the establishment of a permanent
  international court of arbitration. It is the great
  accomplishment of the Interparliamentary Union, the apostle of
  this idea, that it devised a positive recommendation in the form
  of Descamp's draft<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>. It was
  on the basis of this draft that the first Hague Conference worked
  out its great Convention<a href=
  "#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to overestimate the
  importance of this result of the first Hague Conference, a result
  that has not been swept away by the war. No one ever suggested
  that ultimate success had been achieved. Use of the international
  court of arbitration set up by the conference was optional; there
  was no obligation to go to it. That meant that it was left to the
  discretion of the powers concerned whether they availed
  themselves of this means of settling disputes between states by
  legal process. In each. case of conflict the goodwill of both
  parries was necessary before a special agreement could be made to
  use these facilities. In spite of their inadequacies, however,
  the organizations which the conference created were of valuable
  service in preventing war. The best known example is the Dogger
  Bank incident<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>But this service is not the really
  important thing. The great significance of the first Hague
  Conference lies in the fact that, for the first time in the
  history of mankind, the representatives of all the states of the
  civilized world united to create an organization whose purpose
  was the maintenance of universal peace and the settlement of
  international disputes. That was the beginning of world
  international organization. I am convinced that when the history
  of international law comes to be written centuries hence, it will
  be divided into two periods: the first being from the earliest
  times to the end of the nineteenth century, and the second
  beginning with the Hague Conference. Everything which has been
  achieved so far is based on the ideas of this conference.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the conference came the
  problem of making recourse to the arbitration court obligatory.
  There were two possibilities: the completion of the Hague
  Convention with a new general convention, and the conclusion of
  special complementary treaties.</p>

  <p>The first method was attempted at the
  second Conference in 1907. It failed. Man or special treaties
  between two states were made, but nearly all included a clause
  stipulating that questions affecting national honor or the vital
  interests of a state should be exempted from compulsory reference
  to an arbitration court. Of a very interesting special type were
  the treaties patterned after the Bryan model<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. These attempted to guarantee
  peaceful settlement of all disputes and to combine the
  arbitration court with mediation.</p>

  <p>I must say a few words about mediation. It
  has been gradually realized that it is not possible to entrust
  the maintenance of peace to the jurisdiction of arbitration
  courts alone. Arbitration courts can be used for those cases
  which are suitable for litigation. But the most serious and
  dangerous disputes arise over conflicts of interest which are not
  subject to the rules of legal process. In such cases, mediation
  is needed to decide what is equitable and fair, taking into
  consideration the interests at stake. A parallel can be found in
  the social sphere. Dangerous disputes between employers and
  employees, which can lead to great strikes, are settled by
  mediation rather than by the courts. It is the same in the
  international sphere. International mediation needs to be
  organized just as much as does arbitration.</p>

  <p>We pacifists can boast of having been among
  the first to recognize the necessity of setting up a system for
  mediation alongside that for arbitration. The Lucerne Congress of
  1905 passed the Fried-Quidde motion calling attention to the
  importance of an organized means of mediation. Seven years later,
  at the 1912 Conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Geneva,
  Mr. Kovalevsky, on behalf of Mr. Efremov, the leader of the
  Russian group, submitted a report on this question. I recall,
  however, that this resolution evoked little attention. Most
  parliamentary members had not yet realized how important this
  problem is and how fundamental it is for the maintenance of
  peace.</p>

  <p>If an organized machinery for compulsory
  mediation had existed, the World War would probably not have
  erupted. For the two problems - that of disarmament and peace
  organization and that of security - the war created a completely
  new set of conditions. Today it would be ridiculous if we
  pacifists were to put forward a disarmament program as modest as
  that of prewar days. Drastic and complete disarmament is now our
  goal. In terms of practical politics the problem is to know in
  what way and in how many stages we can approach this
  objective.</p>

  <p>During the war it was Pope Benedict<a href=
  "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> who was the first to propose a
  radical disarmament program. In his note of August 15, 1917, he
  said that after the war justice must replace force and that
  armaments should be reduced to what is adequate and necessary for
  the maintenance of internal order and the protection of national
  boundaries. In other words: no armaments against the possibility
  of war! That constitutes drastic and complete disarmament. There
  would no longer be an army or navy; these would be replaced by a
  domestic police force. The cause of drastic and complete
  disarmament is now advocated by the Soviet delegation. Public
  life frequently offers the spectacle of strange alliances.</p>

  <p>After the war, the Peace Treaties and the
  creation of the League of Nations put the disarmament question on
  an entirely new basis.</p>

  <p>Article 8 of the Covenant commits the
  members of the League to reduce their armaments to a specified
  level. The preamble to Part V of the Treaty of Versailles states
  that disarmament is imposed on Germany in order to open the way
  to universal disarmament. In their letter of June 16, 1919,
  signed by Clemenceau, the Allies declare in the most formal and
  solemn terms that it is their genuine intention not to stop with
  unilateral disarmament by Germany alone<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>If we ask how the disarmament promised in
  the Covenant is to be achieved and what the limits are within
  which armaments are to be permitted, we will find that the text
  of the Covenant gives us no useful answer. The two criteria
  mentioned are that the admissible armaments shall guarantee
  national security and the fulfillment of obligations to the
  League. These limits are not absolute but purely relative.</p>

  <p>First, consider national security. In his
  draft for the League of Nations Covenant, Wilson had said that
  armaments should be reduced to the level necessary for keeping
  internal order. His was a clear-cut and definite program: drastic
  disarmament, as had been advocated by Pope Benedict and is now
  advocated by the Bolsheviks. But Wilson's text for the Covenant
  was altered significantly<a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>
  "National security" was substituted for "internal order". This is
  nonsense.</p>

  <p>The volume of armaments necessary to
  guarantee the military aspect of national security is entirely
  dependent on the armaments of the other powers. It will be said
  that national security calls for heavy armaments whenever the
  powers which must be reckoned with in framing national policy are
  heavily armed. If these powers reduce their armaments, national
  security will allow their example to be followed.</p>

  <p>The second criterion is the fulfillment of
  obligations to the League of Nations. In certain circumstances
  the Council of the League can call on members to participate in
  military sanctions against a member who has violated the
  Covenant. Members should therefore be in a position to place
  their contingents at the League's disposal.</p>

  <p>I am not calling into question the merits
  of this provision. It does exist, and it apparently assumes the
  existence of armaments. But within what limits? The higher the
  general level of armaments of the various countries, the greater
  must be the armed force at the disposal of the League. The
  further disarmament goes, the fewer are the military requirements
  of the League. In other words, both criteria acknowledge that the
  limits of armaments are dependent on disarmament.</p>

  <p>The absolute limits which we do not find in
  Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant are given in the
  Peace Treaties: the disarmament of Germany and of the other
  defeated nations is supposed to open the way to general
  disarmament. The inference is that eventually the general level
  of armament of the whole world is to be aligned with that of the
  Central Powers.</p>

  <p>No one can assume that it would be possible
  to maintain forever two formulas for armaments, one applicable to
  the victors of 1918, the other to the vanquished. It is true that
  Maginot, the French minister of war<a href=
  "#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>, referring to the infamous
  Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles<a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a>, recently called for just that.
  But no one who considers the problem seriously would agree with
  him. That kind of thing can be done for a number of years,
  perhaps for a generation, but not forever. Since it would violate
  the spirit of the Treaties to allow the Central Powers to rearm,
  it follows that their disarmament is to be taken as a model for
  international disarmament.</p>

  <p>Pacifists from all countries have
  unanimously voted for this program at their peace congresses.
  British, French, Danes, Norwegians, Dutch, Swiss, Poles joined in
  this vote. The British pacifists were the first to propose the
  formula of "the standard of 1919", that is, the level of
  armaments specified in the Peace Treaties of 1919. This is not
  the final program of the pacifists, for we naturally reserve the
  right to insist on drastic disarmament. But it is the program -
  under the Covenant and the Treaties - which the victorious powers
  are duty bound to recognize as their own.</p>

  <p>In the area of security the most important
  advance since the war has been the founding of the League of
  Nations. Certainly, the Covenant does not go far enough. It is
  not necessary to review its shortcomings for the benefit of us
  pacifists. A fundamental defect is that in certain circumstances
  it recognizes war as a legitimate means of protecting national
  interests. If a resolution is not passed unanimously, states
  reserve the right to protect their own interests by those means
  which they deem appropriate.</p>

  <p>An attempt has been made to rectify this
  defect in the Covenant. I have in mind the famous Geneva Protocol
  of 1924 in which war was declared to be a crime and provisions
  were most carefully worked out to make peaceful settlement of all
  disputes obligatory. This Protocol, for which Mr. Politis<a href=
  "#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> and Mr. Ben&ecirc;<a href=
  "#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> must be given the primary credit,
  was unanimously approved with great enthusiasm<a href=
  "#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>. That seemed to be the final
  triumph of pacifism.</p>

  <p>But the 1924 Protocol foundered: in Britain
  a Conservative cabinet replaced that of Ramsay MacDonald<a href=
  "#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>; the Dominions protested against
  involvement in European affairs; and the British government
  refused to sign it. The Protocol perished, but the ideas
  contained in it are not dead; on the contrary, each year gives
  fresh evidence of their vitality. Various proposals which have
  been placed before the League of Nations or before the forum of
  public opinion have the common objective of creating guarantees
  for the peaceful solution of all quarrels. The formulas change;
  the idea remains the same. From the deliberations of the
  Committee on Arbitration and Security, which was set up by the
  Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, came the
  suggestions which the League incorporated in the so-called
  General Act of the autumn of 1928<a href=
  "#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In France the belief is prevalent that the
  guarantees of security must be perfected before disarmament takes
  place. The French say that a Germany with regained natural
  strength would be obsessed with nullifying the consequences of
  the war, either by peaceful means or by a war of retribution.
  Nationalist demonstrations in Germany have contributed to this
  anxiety. The French have received information on secret arming.
  Along with pure fabrications and fantastic exaggerations, there
  have been genuine grievances. I can speak openly on this matter
  in the expectation that what I say will be accepted, for I was
  one of those who campaigned in Germany against secret arming, and
  in March, 1924, I was imprisoned in Munich under the emergency
  regulations then in force in Bavaria.</p>

  <p>I can say that this secret arming, like
  everything not in accordance with the obligations accepted, is
  utterly deplorable and is a manifestation of intentions
  absolutely irreconcilable with the official policy supported by
  the great majority of the people and the Reichstag. However, when
  considered in relation to a war, the material significance of
  this illegal arming was practically nil. The time when it was
  concealed by the authorities is gone. And even then, although it
  was a great danger to internal peace, to the constitution, to the
  Republic, it was not a danger to other countries, particularly
  not to France. In accordance with the Treaty of Versailles,
  Germany is completely disarmed as far as heavy armaments are
  concerned. These cannot be produced secretly. Heavy artillery
  cannot be manufactured by cottage industry. So as preparation for
  war this secret arming was just childish nonsense.</p>

  <p>France's need for special security against
  the still so remote danger of a war of retribution was satisfied
  in the fall of 1925 by the Locarno Pact<a href=
  "#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>. It is not necessary to dwell on
  this at length. The guarantees of peace are reciprocal, and I
  think it is important to emphasize this. But from the French
  point of view the most important result was that Germany
  voluntarily recognized its western boundaries as those stipulated
  in the Treaty of Versailles. Since Locarno the security of
  western and central Europe is provided for to the extent that
  treaties are ever capable of guaranteeing security. We can draw
  our conclusions from this fact.</p>

  <p>There occurred in 1928 an event of primary
  importance for the progress of international security: the
  conclusion of the Kellogg Pact<a href=
  "#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>. It may be said that this pact,
  rather like the resolution of the first Hague Conference which
  condemned armaments, is nothing more than a declaration, an
  endorsement of a principle. Nevertheless, the fact that the
  principle of renunciation of war as an instrument of national
  policy was formally proclaimed by all states is of the utmost
  significance. You can be sure that we shall make profitable use
  of this declaration to remind governments of their obligations
  and to tell the peoples of the world that it is their duty to
  deny their allegiance to a government which declares war in
  contravention of the Treaty.</p>

  <p>And still, whether the Kellogg Pact will
  open a new epoch in the history of international law or whether
  it will be just an episode, depends on the consequences the
  signatories draw from it. If it is not to become a dead letter,
  the Kellogg Pact must be supplemented: first, by revision of the
  Covenant of the League of Nations in the spirit of the Protocol
  of 1924 or the General Act of 1929<a href=
  "#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a>; second, by general disarmament;
  third, by eradicating from the constitutions and laws of
  individual states the right to declare war; fourth, by altering
  criminal law to conform with the fact that it is a crime to
  declare war; fifth, by a national and international program of
  education that is harmonious with the concept of banning war.</p>

  <p>Now, at the end of this historical and
  abstract analysis comes the most interesting part of the story.
  We should examine, weigh, and size up the present situation; we
  should determine what the League has achieved and what it has
  left undone with regard to disarmament. But the space available
  will not allow me to go into the details of this question. I must
  confine myself to a few summary observations.</p>

  <p>In present-day international politics the
  problems of security and disarmament are more intimately
  intertwined than in the theoretical treatment I have just given
  them. When the 1924 Protocol was passed, no one doubted that
  disarmament must accompany the guarantee of peace. An
  international disarmament conference was planned for the
  following year. The United States, Russia, and Germany, which
  were not members of the League, were invited to participate. This
  conference was postponed repeatedly from one year to another.
  Now, it is finally to assemble on February 2, 1932<a href=
  "#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A Preparatory Commission, set up to clear
  the way for the Disarmament Conference, has tried to work out the
  text of an international treaty, leaving the insertion of the
  actual figures to the Disarmament Conference.</p>

  <p>The first reading took place in the spring
  of 1927. I described the outcome of this in a memorandum entitled
  "The First Step toward World Disarmament"<a href=
  "#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>, which I prepared at the request
  of the Deutsche Friedenskartell [German Peace Cartel] and which
  was forwarded to the Secretariat of the League by the
  International Peace Bureau. The work of the Preparatory
  Commission was concluded at the beginning of December, 1930. In
  the April, 1931, issue of <i>Friedennswarte</i> I attempted to
  outline the negotiations, the main points of disagreement, and
  the results. Here I will recount only the most important points
  and their relationship with the question of security and the
  overall problem of international understanding.</p>

  <p>It is significant that in Article 1 of the
  draft the purpose of the disarmament treaty is said to be to
  limit armaments and "as far as possible" to reduce them. This "as
  far as possible" is truly deplorable when considered in the light
  of the obligation to disarm stipulated in Article 8 of the League
  of Nations Covenant and of the pledge given in the Peace Treaties
  to bring world disarmament gradually into line with the treaties'
  armaments provisions, and in the light of the general expectation
  that disarmament would finally be earnestly pursued.</p>

  <p>Opposition to disarmament comes
  particularly from <i>France and her allies</i>. France claims to
  have disarmed because the duration of military service has been
  reduced to one year, but this is more than offset by the increase
  in the size of the regular army. Again, we hear that disarmament
  can be considered only when France has achieved complete
  security. Security is here understood to mean not security in the
  sense of a peace secured by law, but security in terms of
  military safety, completion of the fortified belt, and so on.
  This means therefore that we must arm before we are in a position
  to disarm. This one-sided, purely national view ignores the fact
  that all national defensive arming "to protect peace" will be
  interpreted, and must be interpreted, by neighboring states or
  other potential enemies as a menace, as a danger to peace;
  whereas on the other hand international disarmament strengthens
  one's own military security through the disarmament of
  others.</p>

  <p>So long as predominant French public
  opinion makes disarmament dependent on this one-sided view of
  national security, no progress is possible. Unless Mr. Maginot's
  remark mentioned above is merely a slip of the tongue, any
  agreement is impossible. The League of Nations Assembly of 1928
  declared that the security situation now would permit an initial
  universal treaty for the reduction and limitation of arms, which
  incidentally would itself contribute to increasing international
  security.</p>

  <p>Certain German proposals which failed to
  secure general acceptance are so patently reasonable that there
  is no need to waste words on them. I refer in particular to the
  proposal to take into account the number of trained reservists or
  the number of recruits trained annually and their length of
  service, as well as the inventory of war equipment of all types
  whether for war by land, sea, or air. We do not wish to give the
  German delegation any particular credit for propounding these
  ideas, for they grow out of Germany's interest in bringing the
  armament level of other countries as nearly as possible into line
  with her own. This does not alter the fact that they are also
  demands made by pacifists throughout the world. They reappear in
  the resolutions of the <i>D&eacute;l&eacute;gation permanente</i> of
  the French peace societies, and the Directorate of the
  International Peace Bureau has brought them to the notice of the
  various peace societies.</p>

  <p>The British delegation which had aligned
  itself with the Germans in 1927 did not do so in 1929 and 1930.
  Even <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/index.html">Lord
  Cecil</a><a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a> altered his
  stand on such points as the question of trained reservists, in
  order to reach agreement with France. Even British pacifists, who
  moreover had been the first to propose the "standard of 1919",
  take offense at the dissatisfaction of the German delegation with
  the outcome of the Preparatory Commission. Under the influence of
  Lord Cecil, they are tending more and more to the view that the
  main thing is that the Conference should achieve something.
  However inadequate it may be, they claim it will still be better
  than nothing and a great and fundamental advance over the anarchy
  which has existed up to the present, that it will at least
  provide a basis on which to build.</p>

  <p>I would like to direct a word of warning to
  our British friends and to others who hold the same opinion. They
  overlook the fact that if the Conference results in fixing the
  level of armaments by treaty at about its present level, with no
  significant reduction, there will be deep disappointment and
  bitterness evoked throughout the world, particularly in Germany,
  and that the consequences within Germany will be of the greatest
  significance internationally and will inevitably endanger the
  task of international reconciliation. Such an outcome would
  produce an overwhelming movement advocating Germany's withdrawal
  from the League and the renunciation of the disarmament
  provisions of the Treaty of Versailles<a href=
  "#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a>. I need not describe further
  consequences. In any case the pacification of Europe would not be
  possible for a long time - not even under the most favorable
  conditions.</p>

  <p>I am, by the way, very skeptical about
  whether it will be possible to reach the goal along the trail
  blazed by the Preparatory Commission. A treaty is supposed to be
  concluded regulating in detail a large number of matters
  concerning armaments. Even if it were successful in improving the
  stipulations by enlarging their compass to cover limitation of
  all important elements of military equipment, and even if it
  should be successful in establishing an acceptable ratio between
  the armaments of states with universal conscription and of those
  relying on regulars: then there would still be the task of
  working the statistics of more than fifty states into the
  framework of the treaty. I greatly fear that the Conference will
  not be capable of achieving this. There is but one ratio which is
  perfectly acceptable to everyone: nothing to nothing. But the
  Conference certainly will not produce total disarmament. It is to
  be feared that through haggling over figures it will produce no
  results at all. The Conference must not be allowed to fail on
  this account. If the complicated system proposed by the
  Preparatory Commission does not succeed an attempt must be made
  to devise a simpler process, perhaps a uniform proportional
  reduction based on the present armament level or on that of a few
  years ago. The fact that this would conform roughly with the
  suggestion of the Russian delegation should scare no one. It must
  be acknowledged at the same time that the ultimate goal to strive
  for is a world level of armaments complying with the disarmament
  provisions of the Peace Treaties.</p>

  <p>Very recently the discussion, particularly
  within the League of Nations Societies, has made gratifying
  progress. Lord Cecil has proposed that the overall armaments
  budget be reduced by twenty-five percent. The Commission set up
  by the Executive Committee of the International Federation of
  League of Nations Societies, which met in Paris under his
  chairmanship on March 21 and 22, has recognized the French desire
  for further consolidation of security (generally understood as
  security under international law and not as military security),
  but nevertheless has called on the Disarmament Conference for a
  substantial reduction in armaments even though the status of the
  security question is just what it is now. The Commission linked
  Lord Cecil's suggestion of a twenty-five percent reduction of the
  overall armaments budget with the German proposal that a start
  should be made by restricting individual elements of armaments
  (personnel establishments and war equipment) according to the
  suggestions made in the Peace Treaties<a href=
  "#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In conclusion let us consider an obvious
  objection to the whole concept of disarmament. The time is
  probably close (or perhaps it is already here?) when the
  development of technology will render useless the entire armory
  which is now being discussed - the mass armies, the stocks of
  artillery and other arms, the navies and fortifications - because
  frontal war will be supplanted by aerial war from behind the
  front, war which will use explosives and, despite all the
  treaties, gas, once the war has started. Disarmament treaties
  will be militarily useless, for they are practically worthless
  for air and gas warfare since the necessary war material can be
  supplied by peacetime industry. If we want to avoid the
  unthinkable horror of aerial and gas warfare, then we must not
  make war; we must secure peace. Thus, the problem of disarmament
  brings us back to the problem of security.</p>

  <p>Does the proposal for international
  disarmament therefore lose its significance? From the military
  technical point of view perhaps, but not from the economic and
  political-ethical standpoint. We could release billions of marks
  for cultural and social work. They could be used to combat
  destitution and misery. At the same time we would manifest and
  strengthen the will to preserve the peace by means of
  disarmament. Therein lies the great significance of a disarmament
  treaty even when the treaty itself, considered from the purely
  military viewpoint, may be useless.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, for the sake of the
  League of Nations it is absolutely essential to achieve some
  result. When Lord Robert Cecil was speaking about this question
  some years ago, he said that if the League did not undertake
  something worthwhile for disarmament, its whole reputation would
  be endangered and it would risk losing the confidence of the
  nations of the world. He recently made a similar statement,
  placing great emphasis on this idea. If the governments, the
  expert advisers, and the delegates to the Disarmament Conference
  do not do their duty, then we must appeal to the people, because
  it is the people who suffer from armaments and all their
  consequences.</p>

  <p>Along with working for disarmament we must
  work toward securing peace. We must learn to recognize that
  Europe has a choice only between the total devastation that will
  result from a future war employing gas and other such modern
  methods of war, and peace secured by rule of law. In his Zum
  ewigen Frieden Kant<a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a>
  discussed how it might be possible to ensure peace. He did not
  present the point of view of the moral philosopher who bases his
  hopes on an improvement in mankind. Oh, no! Kant found the only
  assurance for peace in the idea that war would become so terrible
  and unbearable that human beings, even though they remain as
  morally weak as they now are, would be forced to work together
  for peace.</p>

  <p>That moment has already come, and at the
  very hour in which we live the organizing of international life
  is a possibility. In Kant's lifetime the world was too large for
  such a thing. Seas, mountain ranges, and deserts separated
  nations from one another, and it took months to circulate a
  message throughout the world. These difficulties have now
  disappeared. The same technology which has made war so terrible
  has given us the means to bring the whole world within one
  international organization. Naturally, the moral basis of such an
  organization must not be merely the fear of war. It must be the
  conviction that it is a moral duty to do away with war and to
  secure peace. Only on this basis can we hope to reach complete
  disarmament and a peace secured by treaties.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="footnote*"></a>* Mr. Quidde
  delivered a lecture at 2:00 p.m. on December 12, 1927, in the
  auditorium of the Nobel Institute in Oslo. The <i>Aftenposten</i>
  for December 13, 1927, published in Oslo, carries a report of the
  speech but not the full text. Nor does the text appear in <i>Les
  Prix Nobel</i>, although the 1927 volume states that the lecture
  was delivered. Correspondence in the files of the Nobel Institute
  indicates that the script was sent to Mr. Quidde at his request
  for editing; presumably it was not returned. This translation is
  based on a text in German that appeared in <i>Europl&auml;ische
  Gespr&auml;che</i>, April, 1931. A footnote to this text says:
  "This essay is based on a speech given by the author in Oslo in
  December, 1927, when he received the Nobel Peace Prize and also
  given in French in February, 1929, in Paris by invitation of the
  Carnegie Foundation." Minor changes and editorial emendations
  were no doubt made to adapt. to the conventions of a printed
  essay, and certain additions were incorporated to bring the
  material up to date - two examples, among others, being the brief
  discussion of the Kellogg Pact concluded in 1928, eight months
  after Mr. Quidde had given his Nobel lecture, and the longer
  discussion of the Disarmament Conference at the end of the essay.
  But in the argument presented and the basic points made, the
  essay version in German is quite similar to that reported as the
  speech version in the <i>Aftenposten</i>. The title of the Oslo
  speech noted in <i>Les Prix Nobel</i> on p. 67 is "Abr&uuml;stung
  und Friede". But the title as noted on p. 83 in <i>Les Prix
  Nobel</i>, "Abr&uuml;stung und Sicherheit", is more probably the
  correct one, for the report in the <i>Aftenposten</i> begins
  "...there was almost a full house to hear Professor Quidde's
  speech on disarmament and security at the Nobel ceremony today".
  The title in the essay version is simply reversed to become
  "Sicherheit und Abr&uuml;stung".</p>
