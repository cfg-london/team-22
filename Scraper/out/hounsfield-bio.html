  <h1>Godfrey N. Hounsfield - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hounsfield.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was
  born and brought up near a village in Nottinghamshire and in my
  childhood enjoyed the freedom of the rather isolated country
  life. After the first world war, my father had bought a small
  farm, which became a marvellous playground for his five children.
  My two brothers and two sisters were all older than I and, as
  they naturally pursued their own more adult interests, this gave
  me the advantage of not being expected to join in, so I could go
  off and follow my own inclinations.<br>
  <br>
  The farm offered an infinite variety of ways to do this. At a
  very early age I became intrigued by all the mechanical and
  electrical gadgets which even then could be found on a farm; the
  threshing machines, the binders, the generators. But the period
  between my eleventh and eighteenth years remains the most vivid
  in my memory because this was the time of my first attempts at
  experimentation, which might never have been made had I lived in
  a city. In a village there are few distractions and no pressures
  to join in at a ball game or go to the cinema, and I was free to
  follow the trail of any interesting idea that came my way. I
  constructed electrical recording machines; I made hazardous
  investigations of the principles of flight, launching myself from
  the tops of haystacks with a home-made glider; I almost blew
  myself up during exciting experiments using water-filled tar
  barrels and acetylene to see how high they could be waterjet
  propelled. It may now be a trick of the memory but I am sure that
  on one occasion I managed to get one to an altitude of 1000
  feet!<br>
  <br>
  During this time I was learning the hard way many fundamentals in
  reasoning. This was all at the expense of my schooling at Magnus
  Grammar School in Newark, where they tried hard to educate me but
  where I responded only to physics and mathematics with any ease
  and moderate enthusiasm.<br>
  <br>
  Aeroplanes interested me and at the outbreak of the second world
  war I joined the RAF as a volunteer reservist. I took the
  opportunity of studying the books which the RAF made available
  for Radio Mechanics and looked forward to an interesting course
  in Radio. After sitting a trade test I was immediately taken on
  as a Radar Mechanic Instructor and moved to the then RAF-occupied
  Royal College of Science in South Kensington and later to
  Cranwell Radar School. At Cranwell, in my spare time, I sat and
  passed the City and Guilds examination in Radio Communications.
  While there I also occupied myself in building large-screen
  oscilloscope and demonstration equipment as aids to instruction,
  for which I was awarded the Certificate of Merit.<br>
  <br>
  It was very fortunate for me that, during this time, my work was
  appreciated by Air Vice-Marshal Cassidy. He was responsible for
  my obtaining a grant after the war which enabled me to attend
  Faraday House Electrical Engineering College in London, where I
  received a diploma.<br>
  <br>
  I joined the staff of EMI in Middlesex in 1951, where I worked
  for a while on radar and guided weapons and later ran a small
  design laboratory. During this time I became particularly
  interested in computers, which were then in their infancy. It was
  interesting, pioneering work at that time: drums and tape decks
  had to be designed from scratch. The core store was a relatively
  new idea which was the subject of considerable experiment. The
  stores had to be designed and then plain-threaded by hand
  (causing a few frightful tangles on occasions). Starting in about
  1958 I led a design team building the first all-transistor
  computer to be constructed in Britain, the EMIDEC 1100. In those
  days the transistor, the OC72, was a relatively slow device, much
  slower than valves which were then used in most computers.
  However, I was able to overcome this problem by driving the
  transistor with a magnetic core. This increased the speed of the
  machine so that it compared with that of valve computers and
  brought about the use of transistors in computing earlier than
  had been anticipated. Twenty-four large installations were sold
  before increases in the speed of transistors rendered this method
  obsolete.<br>
  <br>
  When this work finished I transferred to EMI Central Research
  Laboratories, also at Hayes. My first project there was hardly
  covered in glory: I set out to design a one-million word
  immediate access thin-film computer store. The problem was that
  after a time it was evident that this would not be commercially
  viable. The project was therefore abandoned and, rather than
  being immediately assigned to another task I was given the
  opportunity to go away quietly and think of other areas of
  research which I thought might be fruitful. One of the
  suggestions I put forward was connected with automatic pattern
  recognition and it was while exploring various aspects of pattern
  recognition and their potential, in 1967, that the idea occurred
  to me which was eventually to become the EMI-Scanner and the
  technique of computed tomography.<br>
  <br>
  The steps in my work between this initial idea and its
  realisation in the first clinical brain-scanner have already been
  well documented. As might be expected, the programme involved
  many frustrations, occasional awareness of achievement when
  particular technical hurdles were overcome, and some amusing
  incidents, not least the experiences of travelling across London
  by public transport carrying bullock's brains for use in
  evaluation of an experimental scanner rig in the
  Laboratories.<br>
  <br>
  After the initial experimental work, the designing and building
  of four original clinical prototypes and the development of five
  progressively more sophisticated prototypes of brain and whole
  body scanner (three of which went into production) kept me fully
  occupied until 1976. Since then I have been able to broaden my
  interest in a number of projects which are currently in hand in
  the Laboratories, including further possible advances in CT
  technology and in related fields of diagnostic imaging, such as
  nuclear magnetic resonance.<br>
  <br>
  As a bachelor, I have been able to devote a great deal of time to
  my general interest in science which more recently has included
  physics and biology. A great deal of my adult life has centred on
  my work, and only recently did I bother to establish a permanent
  residence. Apart from my work, my greatest pleasures have been
  mainly out-of-doors, and although I no longer ski I greatly enjoy
  walking in the mountains and leading country rambles. I am fond
  of music, whether light or classical, and play the piano in a
  self-taught way. In company I enjoy lively way-out
  discussions.</p>
