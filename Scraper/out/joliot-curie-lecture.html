  <h2>Artificial Production of Radioactive Elements</h2>

  <p>It is a great honour and a great pleasure
  to us that the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1935/joliot-curie-lecture.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/en/" target="_blank">Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has awarded us
  the Nobel Prize for our work on the synthesis of radio-elements,
  after having presented it to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Pierre and Marie Curie</a>
  in 1903, and to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1911/index.html">Marie Curie</a> in 1911,
  for the discovery of the radio-elements.</p>

  <p>I would like here to recall the
  extraordinary development of radioactivity, this new science
  which had its origin, less than forty years ago in the work of
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/index.html">Henri Becquerel</a>
  and of Pierre and Marie Curie.</p>

  <p>It is known that the efforts of chemists of
  the last century established as a fundamental fact the extreme
  solidity of the atomic structures which go to make up the
  ninety-two known chemical species. With the discovery of the
  radio-elements, physicists found themselves for the first time
  confronted with strange substances, minute generators of
  radiation endowed with an enormous concentration of energy; alpha
  rays, positively charged helium atoms, beta rays, negatively
  charged electrons, both possessed of a kinetic energy which it
  would be impossible to communicate to them by human agency, and
  finally, gamma rays, akin to very penetrating X-rays. Chemists
  had no less astonishment as they recognized in these radioactive
  bodies, elements which had undergone modifications of the atomic
  structure which had been thought unalterable.</p>

  <p>Each emission of an alpha or beta ray
  accompanies the transmutation of an atom; the energy communicated
  to these rays comes from inside the atom. As long as they
  continue to exist, radio-elements have well-defined chemical
  properties, like those of ordinary elements. These unstable atoms
  disintegrate spontaneously, some very quickly, others very
  slowly, but in accordance with unchanging laws which it has never
  been possible to interfere with. The time necessary for the
  disappearance of half the atoms, called the half-life, is a
  fundamental characteristic of each radio-element; according to
  the substance the value of the half-life varies between a
  fraction of a second and millions of years.</p>

  <p>The discovery of radio-elements has had
  immense consequences in the knowledge of the structure of matter;
  the study of the materials themselves, and the study of the
  powerful effects produced on atoms by the rays they emit occupy
  scientific workers of numerous great research institutes in all
  countries.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, radioactivity remained a
  property exclusively associated with some thirty substances
  existing naturally. The artificial creation of radio-elements
  opens a new field to the science of radioactivity and so provides
  an extension of the work of Pierre and Marie Curie.</p>

  <p>After the discovery of the spontaneous
  transmutations of radio-elements, the achievement of the first
  artificial transmutations is due to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Lord Rutherford</a>.
  Fifteen years later, by bombarding with alpha rays certain of the
  lighter atoms, nitrogen and aluminium for example, Lord
  Rutherford demonstrated the ejection of protons, or positively
  charged hydrogen nuclei; this hydrogen came from the bombarded
  atoms themselves: it was the result of a transmutation. The
  nature of the nuclear transformation could be firmly established:
  the aluminium atom, for example, captures the alpha particle and
  is transformed, after expelling the proton, into an atom of
  silicon. The amount of matter transformed cannot be weighed and
  the study of radiation alone has led to these conclusions.</p>

  <p>In the course of recent years various
  artificial transmutations of different types have been
  discovered; some are produced by alpha rays, others by protons or
  deuterons, hydrogen nuclei of weight 1 or 2, others by neutrons,
  neutral particles of weight 1 about which <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/index.html">Professor Chadwick</a> has
  just spoken. The particles expelled when the atom explodes are
  protons, alpha rays or neutrons.</p>

  <p>These transformations constitute true
  chemical reactions which act upon the innermost structure of the
  atom, the nucleus. They can be represented by simple formulae as
  Monsieur Joliot will be telling you in a moment.</p>

  <p>I shall now speak to you of the experiments
  which have led us to obtain by transmutation new radioactive
  elements. These experiments have been made together by Monsieur
  Joliot and me, and the way in which we have divided this lecture
  between us is a matter of pure convenience.</p>

  <p>In our study of the transmutations with
  emission of neutrons produced in the light elements irradiated
  with alpha rays, we have noticed some difficulties in
  interpretation in the emission of neutrons by fluorine, sodium,
  and aluminium. Aluminium can be transformed, by the capture of an
  alpha particle and the emission of a proton, into a stable
  silicon atom. On the other hand, if a neutron is emitted the
  product of the reaction is not a known atom.</p>

  <p>Later on, we observed that aluminium and
  boron, when irradiated by alpha rays do not emit protons and
  neutrons alone, there is also an emission of positive electrons.
  We have assumed in this case that the emission of the neutron and
  the positive electron occurs simultaneously, instead of the
  emission of a proton; the atom remaining must be the same in the
  two cases.</p>

  <p>It was at the beginning of 1934, while
  working on the emission of these positive electrons that we
  noticed a fundamental difference between that transmutation and
  all the others so far produced; all the reactions of nuclear
  chemistry induced were instantaneous phenomena, explosions. But
  the positive electrons produced by aluminium under the action of
  a source of alpha rays continue to be emitted for some time after
  removal of the source. The number of electrons emitted decreases
  by half in three minutes.</p>

  <p>Here, therefore, we have a true
  radioactivity which is made evident by the emission of positive
  electrons.</p>

  <p>We have shown that it is possible to create
  a radioactivity characterized by the emission of positive or
  negative electrons in boron and magnesium, by bombardment with
  alpha rays. These artificial radio-elements behave in all
  respects like the natural radio-elements.</p>

  <p>Returning to our hypothesis concerning the
  transformation of the aluminium nucleus into a silicon nucleus,
  we have supposed that the phenomenon takes place in two stages:
  first there is the capture of the alpha particle and the
  instantaneous expulsion of the neutron, with the formation of a
  radioactive atom which is an isotope of phosphorus of atomic
  weight 30, while the stable phosphorus atom has an atomic weight
  of 31. Next, this unstable atom, this new radio-element which we
  have called "radio-phosphorus" decomposes exponentially with a
  half-life of three minutes.</p>

  <p>We have interpreted in the same way the
  production of radioactive elements in boron and magnesium; in the
  first an unstable nitrogen with a half-life of II minutes is
  produced, and in the second, unstable isotopes of silicon and
  aluminium.</p>
