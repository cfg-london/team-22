  <h2>The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction</h2>

  <p>In investigating the mechanism involved in
  the activity of striated muscle two points must be borne in mind,
  firstly, that the mechanism, whatever it be, exists separately
  inside each individual fibre, and secondly, that this fibre is in
  principle an isothermal machine, i.e. working practically at a
  constant temperature. There are several ways of studying this
  machine - the mechanical, the thermodynamic, the chemical, and
  the electrical, and of course any combination of these. In the
  case of nerve, much information has been acquired from a study of
  its electrical properties especially recently in the hands of
  Keith Lucas, Adrian, and Erlanger and Gasser. In the muscle
  fibre, however, as distinguished from muscular tissue in general,
  comparatively little has been discovered by studying the electric
  change. The apparent exception of the heart is not a real one,
  since here the electric change has been used to analyse, not so
  much the behaviour of the individual fibre - that is, of the
  ultimate mechanism itself - as the distribution and
  interconnection of the fibres to form the complete working organ.
  We will not therefore consider the electrical phenomena further
  in our discussion of the mechanism of the muscle fibre.</p>

  <p>Much investigation has been devoted in the
  past to the mechanical response and characteristics of muscles,
  and it might have appeared that this subject is to some degree
  worked out and unlikely to yield further results of value.
  Actually, however, in combination with thermodynamical
  observations and considerations, much information has been
  derived recently from a study of the mechanical output and
  behaviour of muscles. Indeed, in the last two or three years the
  investigation of the connection between the rate of shortening,
  the work done and the heat production has pointed to new,
  hitherto unsuspected, mechanisms in muscle which are of
  considerable theoretical interest and practical importance.</p>

  <p>The chief advances, however, during recent
  years have come from a study of the thermal and the chemical
  changes which occur in excised muscle. These two sides of the
  investigation are the ones which Professor Meyerhof and I will
  discuss today.</p>

  <p>One of the fundamental characteristics of
  striated muscle, and the one involving the greatest difficulty in
  investigation, is the great rapidity with which changes take
  place in it. There is no doubt that ultimately the muscle is a
  chemical mechanism, in the same way for example as a Daniell's
  cell or an accumulator is a chemical mechanism. If we were aware
  of all the chemical events, we should know all that was necessary
  about the machine which we are studying. Unfortunately, the
  investigation of chemical events is a slow and laborious process.
  Undoubtedly lactic acid, as Fletcher and Hopkins showed some
  fifteen years ago, is an essential part of the machinery, but it
  is impossible to measure the production and removal of lactic
  acid instantly and contemporaneously during and after a single
  unit of muscular response. It is necessary to evoke a long series
  of responses and finally to study the gross changes of
  accumulation or removal of the acid. Attempts have been made to
  follow the chemical processes involved in muscular activity by
  studying the changes of hydrogenion concentration by physical
  instruments. This would appear to be more hopeful than the
  possibility of quickening up the study of the reactions by
  ordinary chemical means, but unfortunately - so far - it has been
  completely unsuccessful. The instantaneous and contemporary study
  of the events occurring inside the muscle fibre appears to be
  possible only in two ways, the mechanical and thermal. As regards
  the mechanical, the technique is obvious, namely, connecting the
  muscle to suitable recorders, ergometers and levers. The
  mechanical changes occurring in muscle are, however, only the
  end-products of activity, and if we wish to get inside the
  mechanism, it is necessary to study some inter-mediate process,
  something occurring between the stimulus and the response itself,
  something associated with the chemical events which evoke
  contraction. This is provided by the investigation of the heat
  production. It is obvious of course that the picture provided by
  thermodynamics is only a partial one; the certainty, however,
  with which the principle of the conservation of energy may be
  applied, gives us firm ground on which to start our
  investigations, and there would seem to be no doubt that the
  outline provided by thermodynamics, once established, must
  remain, and must finally have the complete chemical picture
  painted into it. The advantage of the study of the thermodynamics
  of muscle is that heat may be measured in absolute units, rapidly
  and at once, and the time-course of its evolution analysed by
  suitable means.</p>

  <p>In the study of the thermal changes the
  most consistent and valuable results have been obtained by
  utilizing the isometric contraction of the sartorius muscle of
  the frog. The sartorius muscle is a very suitable medium for this
  investigation, insofar as it is practically of uniform
  cross-section and consists of straight fibres running along its
  length. The isometric contraction has the advantage, firstly,
  that energy is not liberated in it in any other form than heat,
  so that no complications arise by having to sum the thermal
  changes with the mechanical work, and secondly, that in it
  movements of the instruments are prohibited, which on the small
  scale of temperature with which we are dealing is of value in
  avoiding errors due to temperature differences along the
  muscle.</p>

  <p>The fundamental difficulty in myothermic
  observations is the smallness of the changes involved and their
  rapidity. In the muscle twitch of a frog's sartorius at 20&deg;C
  the rise of temperature is not more than 0.003&deg;, and the
  time occupied in the earlier phases (as distinguished from the
  recovery process) is only a few hundredths of a second. The first
  requisite therefore is a very sensitive thermometric apparatus
  and great freedom from temperature changes, the second is extreme
  rapidity and lightness in the recording instruments. Neglecting
  for obvious reasons the use of ordinary mercury thermometers,
  there are two possible methods available, those of the resistance
  thermometer and the thermopile respectively. The resistance
  thermometer has not been employed successfully in myothermic
  observations. Calculation with the requisite physical constants
  shows the existence of a certain fundamental difficulty, which is
  confirmed by actual experiment. Were it possible to use the
  resistance thermometer, it would be exceedingly advantageous, as
  such an instrument may be made very small and light, so that it
  will respond with great quickness to the temperature changes in
  its neighbour-hood. Moreover, unlimited sensitivity may be
  obtained by increasing the current in the resistance wire. The
  fundamental difficulty is that heat is thereby produced in that
  wire, which is conducted into the muscle and warms it up, causing
  serious disturbances of the zero, and enormous negative
  deflections when the smallest movement of the muscle occurs. I
  have attempted recently to use a resistance thermometer for
  myothermic observations and found it completely impossible, owing
  to the errors produced by the heat production in the resistance
  thermometer itself. There remains, there-fore, only one method,
  that of the thermopile, which we will now discuss.</p>

  <p>It is possible to make a small light
  thermopile, suitable for myothermic observations, containing one
  hundred couples, each providing 50 micro-volts for a difference
  of temperature of 1&deg;C. With a suitable sensitive
  galvanometer this gives us a scale of temperature in which
  1&deg;C is about one kilometre in length. Ample sensitivity,
  therefore, is available. Such thermopiles are laborious to make
  by the ordinary method of soldering the wires together, though
  practically all the work hitherto recorded has been done with
  instruments thus constructed. Recently, however, an ingenious
  device has been published by Hamilton Wilson, by which a
  continuous piece of constantan wire is coated with silver in
  successive sections by electroplating, and each pair of junctions
  between a silver-plated and an unplated portion acts as a
  silver-constantan couple. By this device very small, light
  thermopiles may be constructed with great ease, and recently Drs.
  Fenn and Azuma have used such thermopiles in their work with
  me.</p>

  <p>The developments of the technique appear to
  lie in refining and lightening hermopiles, in improving their
  sensitivity, and in the use of more sensitive and rapidly moving
  galvanometers. It may conceivably be possible to amplify the
  electromotive force produced by such thermopiles, and so to use a
  galvanometer of short period in order to quicken the recording.
  The possibilities already available of myothermic investigation
  are mainly due to improvements in galvanometers and
  thermopiles.</p>

  <p>It is not practicable to register the
  changes of temperature in a muscle as they occur, without lag or
  loss : the recording instruments are too slow, they possess too
  great a heat capacity, the flow of heat is not rapid enough and
  the galvanometer - which must be sensitive - has too long a
  period. It is necessary to carry out an analysis of the results
  obtained, preferably after photographic recording of the
  galvanometer deflection. The possibility of analysing the
  time-course of the evolution of heat in a muscle contraction
  depends upon certain fortunate physical properties of the system
  employed. The conduction of heat, the relation between e.m.f. and
  temperature, the movements of the galvanometer, its dynamics, the
  control on it for small movements, and its damping, indeed, all
  the factors connected with the deflection of the galvanometer
  resulting from the change of temperature of an object in contact
  with the thermopile, are governed by linear differential
  equations with constant coefficients. It is not necessary to know
  what these coefficients are, as I shall show shortly - they can
  be eliminated by a control experiment - it is essential only that
  the system employed should possess this general property. Its
  consequence may be expressed in a very simple form. If there be
  two productions of heat recorded separately, then the deflections
  produced, if summed together, are the same as the single
  deflection which would have been produced if the two heat
  productions had been summed together. If the damping had been
  proportional to the square of the angular velocity of the magnet
  system, or if the conduction of heat had been proportional to the
  square of the temperature difference, this fact would not have
  been true. Expressing the matter mathematically: if <i>y</i> = f
  (<i>t</i>) be the equation relating the deflection <i>y</i> to
  the time t for a certain heat distribution<a href=
  "#footnote*">*</a> <i>H</i>, and <i>y'</i> = f' (<i>t</i>) be the
  equation for another heat distribution <i>H'</i>, then for a
  combined distribution of heat, <i>H</i> + <i>H'</i>, the
  deflection will be <i>Y</i> = <i>y</i> + <i>y'</i> = f (<i>t</i>)
  +f ' (<i>t</i>). This property of the system seems to be a very
  exact one, and it makes possible an analysis of the evolution of
  heat which would otherwise have been very difficult.</p>

  <p>Owing to the heat capacity of the recording
  instruments and the lag in the conduction of heat and in the
  galvanometer deflection, the readings actually obtained with
  myothermic apparatus are considerably smaller than those
  calculated from the physical data of thermoelectromotive force,
  number of junctions, and galvanometer sensitivity. Indeed the
  calculation of heat production directly from such data gives
  results very far from the truth, and it is impossible without
  some direct method of calibration to compare work expressed in
  mechanical units with heat expressed in galvanometer deflections.
  Fortunately it is possible to make a direct calibration of the
  instruments by liberating in the same muscle, in the identical
  position on the thermopile at the close of an experiment, a known
  amount of heat. A muscle must first be killed by chloroform, and
  then an alternating current of known strength must be passed for
  a known time through the measured resistance of the muscle, so
  that a definite amount of heat may be liberated, and the
  resulting deflection of the galvanometer read. A comparison of
  the two gives h the value in absolute units (calories or ergs) of
  one scale division of the galvanometer. There are various
  technical difficulties in this calibration which need not be
  discussed now, but in one modification or another it serves as
  the basis of all experiments relating heat to work. To some of
  these I will refer later. I wish to speak at present rather of
  the analysis of the time-course of the evolution of heat in
  muscle when stimulated. An amount of heat liberated suddenly at a
  given time leads to a certain deflection of the galvanometer,
  <i>y</i> = f(<i>t</i>), which rises to a maximum and falls slowly
  to zero again owing to conduction away of the heat, etc. A live
  muscle would give the same shape of deflection, if the heat
  produced in it were liberated at, or immediately after, the
  moment of stimulus. In point of fact the "live" deflection
  differs largely from the "control" one, a fact which can be
  explained only by supposing that the heat production in the live
  muscle is not instantaneous at the beginning, but distributed in
  time, there being production or absorption of heat later on. I
  may say at once that neither I nor any of my colleagues have ever
  found an absorption of heat at any stage in the process, so that
  apparently nothing but production of heat need be taken account
  of. One of my earliest observations on the subject was that the
  galvanometer deflection persists much longer in a live muscle
  than in a control experiment: it remains away from its zero for
  periods up to ten minutes, whereas, if the production of heat
  were instantaneous at the beginning, it would be back to its zero
  in two or three minutes. This phenomenon can be due only to a
  delayed production of heat, and I found that this "recovery"
  heat, as we called it, is appreciable only in oxygen, being
  abolished by keeping the muscle in nitrogen, or by previous
  exercise violent enough to use up the oxygen dissolved in the
  muscle. My original analysis was rough and revealed little but
  the facts themselves and their order of quantities. It certainly,
  however, did establish the existence of a recovery heat
  production, which it was natural to associate - rightly, as it
  has proved since - with the oxidative removal of lactic acid
  discovered by Fletcher and Hopkins. A rough estimate of the
  magnitude of the recovery heat production made it approximately
  equal to the total initial heat. This estimate appeared to answer
  unequivocally a question long debated, on the fate of lactic acid
  in the recovery process. Fletcher and Hopkins had found that
  lactic acid is removed in the presence of oxygen, though the same
  muscle at the end of the recovery process can liberate during
  exercise or rigor the same amount of lactic acid as before. Was
  lactic acid removed by oxidation, or by restoration to the
  precursor from which it came? Previous experiments of my own had
  shown that the production of one gram of lactic acid in rigor
  leads to the liberation of about 500 calories. Experiments by
  Peters had proved that the production of 1 gram of lactic acid in
  exercise, or in exercise followed by rigor, leads to the
  liberation of about the same quantity of heat. Hence, if the
  recovery heat were equal to the initial heat, the oxidative
  removal of one gram of lactic acid would lead to the production
  of about 500 calories, which is less than 1/7th of the heat of
  oxidation of the acid. The conclusion, which was not universally
  accepted at first, seemed to me to be inevitable - that the
  lactic acid is not removed by oxidation. This conclusion has been
  amply confirmed by the later experiments of Meyerhof which he
  will himself describe.</p>

  <p>In a large mass of muscle deprived of its
  circulation, the rate at which the recovery process can go on,
  after severe stimulation, depends on the rate at which oxygen can
  reach the fibres by diffusion. Such are the conditions in
  calorimetrical experiments. The myothermic method, however,
  employing small thin muscles subjected only to very light
  stimulation makes it possible to follow the recovery process
  under conditions where the rate is quite uninfluenced by any
  possible lack of oxygen. In such small contractions there is
  sufficient oxygen already dissolved inside the muscle to account
  for far more heat than the total amount liberated in recovery. It
  is possible therefore to follow the chemical dynamics of the
  recovery process uninterfered with by considerations of oxygen
  supply. The study of the actual time-course of the recovery heat
  production has required more elaborate and careful experiments
  than I made alone in 1913, and since the War, I have had the
  cooperation in this and other matters of my friend W. Hartree,
  whose skill in experimental work and calculation has made it
  possible to reach a degree of certainty in the analysis which I
  could never have attained alone. By photographic recording and
  accurate numerical analysis of the deflection for ten minutes
  after stimulation, it has been possible to describe the whole of
  the time-course of the heat production in recovery. Its absolute
  magnitude is 1.5 times the total initial heat; its rate is
  influenced by temperature in the way usual in biochemical
  reactions. It starts from a low rate, rises to a maximum, and
  declines to zero again. It seems to occur with a velocity
  approximately proportional to the square of the concentration of
  the bodies whose removal constitutes recovery. Taking Meyerhof's
  value for the heat per gram of lactic acid, we find that 1/5 to
  1/6 only of the lactic acid is oxidized in recovery.</p>

  <p>It is clear that the recovery process is a
  fundamental part of the whole mechanism of muscle. As we shall
  see later, oxygen is used only in the recovery process, a fact
  which has led to a new conception of the nature of the muscular
  machine.</p>

  <p>The analysis of the recovery heat
  production is comparatively simple because its evolution is slow.
  It is desirable, however, also to analyse the production of heat
  in the earlier phases of contraction, a far more difficult
  matter. After a single shock the muscle shows two phases of
  contraction, namely, the development and the disappearance of the
  mechanical response - contraction and relaxation. Tetanus shows
  three phases, contraction, relaxation, and maintenance. It was
  desirable to analyse the chemical break-down processes associated
  with each of these phases. It will be simpler if I describe
  phenomena actually seen and recorded with the instruments.</p>

  <p>A muscle is stimulated, the galvanometer
  deflects, a curve is recorded on a moving photographic paper. A
  control curve is made later, after the muscle is dead, for which
  a known small amount of heat is liberated rapidly, e.g. in 0.1
  second, and another deflection is recorded. It is found even in
  the earliest phases, long before the development of the recovery
  process, that the two curves differ from one another. The curve
  for the live muscle rises less steeply and falls less steeply
  than the control curve, a fact which can be due only to a
  spreading out of the heat production. The curves do not differ
  largely from one another because the whole time occupied in the
  initial phase is so short compared with the time relations of the
  galvanometer and ther-mopile themselves. The difference, however,
  is sufficient to make the analysis practicable, and by keeping
  the muscle at a low temperature it is possible to slow down the
  events and to attain a greater degree of accuracy in the
  analysis. The result that appears is that during the development
  of the contraction there is a large outburst of heat, during the
  maintenance of the contraction there is a continued production of
  heat, reaching a constant rate as the contraction is prolonged,
  and a comparatively large and sudden evolution of heat during
  relaxation. An excited muscle behaves like an excited
  electromagnet: energy is required to magnetize the iron and to
  make it develop its pull; energy is required to cause it to
  maintain its magnetic condition and to continue its pull; heat is
  liberated when the magnetic condition, and the energy associated
  with it, disappear as the current is cut off. In the muscle,
  energy is required to set up the contraction, and, as we shall
  see later, more energy is required if work be done. Energy is
  needed to maintain a contraction, as, indeed, we know in our own
  bodies when we try to hold a weight for a long time. During
  relaxation the potential energy of strain possessed by a muscle
  during contraction has to disappear, and we find it as heat.</p>

  <p>The most important point brought out by
  this analysis of the initial heat production is that relating to
  the influence, or rather to the absence of influence, of oxygen.
  The essential conclusion can be drawn without any analysis,
  merely by comparing the curves of deflection with and without
  oxygen. The proof that oxygen has no effect whatever on the
  time-course of the initial heat production complements an
  observation by my friend Weizs&auml;cker, working with me in
  1914, that the presence or absence of oxygen has equally no
  effect on the magnitude of the initial heat production. No
  difference whatever can be detected between the curves obtained:
  (<i>a</i>) from a muscle in pure oxygen, and (<i>b</i>) from one
  which has been deprived of oxygen in the most rigorous manner for
  several hours. The conclusion is important and supplements the
  observations previously described on the recovery heat
  production. Oxygen is not used in the primary breakdown at all:
  it is used simply in the recovery process. A muscle is like an
  accumulator, which can be discharged without any kind of
  combustion or any kind of provision of energy from without: it
  requires external energy only when it is being recharged. It has
  long been known, of course, that muscles can go on working for
  some time in the absence of oxygen, but it was open to anybody to
  suppose that the processes in the presence and in the absence of
  oxygen were different. So they are, to the extent that recovery
  takes place in the one case but not in the other, but the
  complete absence of any effect of oxygen on the initial processes
  of contraction shows that those initial processes are identical
  in both cases. The analogy of the accumulator is exact.</p>

  <p>These conceptions arrived at by studying
  isolated muscle have an obvious application to man. One knows
  that after violent exercise one breathes heavily for some time:
  the more violent the exercise, the longer one's respiration is
  laboured. If a man runs a hundred metres as fast as he possibly
  can, he requires about four litres of oxygen extra, in the
  succeeding five minutes, to enable him to recover from his
  effort. In other words 11 seconds of exercise has caused him to
  use in recovery as much oxygen as he would require for about
  fifteen minutes at rest, as much oxygen as he could get during
  one minute of the most laboured respiration. The matter is a
  simple one to investigate by means of Douglas bags and gas
  analysis. One takes a reading of the resting oxygen consumption,
  and during the recovery process one measures the oxygen used in
  excess of the resting value. By employing a series of bags, and
  collecting the expired air for various short intervals during
  recovery, it is possible also to study the time-course of that
  process. Unlike the case of the isolated muscle on the thermopile
  the rate at which oxidative recovery occurs in man is determined
  largely by considerations of oxygen supply and not merely by the
  actual chemical reactions. At the end of exercise, when the
  oxygen consumption is at its maximum, it begins immediately to
  fall, and after moderate exertion reaches its resting value in
  about five minutes. After severe exercise, however, it remains
  high for a long time, only reaching its resting value after an
  hour or two of recovery. This condition of prolonged recovery
  from severe, or prolonged, exercise is associated with the
  presence of lactic acid in the blood, as can be shown by direct
  analysis. The lactic acid produced by the muscles in moderate
  exercise is oxidized there in recovery before it can diffuse into
  the blood in appreciable amount. Consequently, recovery is rapid.
  In severe exercise, however, the lactic acid accumulates in the
  muscles to a high value, escaping thence into the blood and other
  tissues of the body, from which it can only slowly be removed,
  after diffusion back into the muscles, during the process of
  recovery.</p>

  <p>Similar methods may be employed for
  measuring the maximum intake of oxygen, and recent experiments
  have shown that a man may use as much as 4.2 litres of oxygen per
  minute, after his circulation and respiration have been worked up
  by running fast for three or four minutes. This, you will
  remember, is about the amount which the body requires in recovery
  from 11 seconds of severe exertion. Were it not for the fact that
  the body is able, so to speak, to take its exercise on "credit",
  instead of paying for it out of "income", it would be impossible
  for a man to take anything but quite moderate exercise. The body
  is capable of running up an oxygen "debt" which must be repaid
  during the recovery process. The maximum "debt" which we have
  found is 15 litres, which is nearly four minutes supply at the
  maximum rate. We have little doubt that a first-class athlete, in
  the height of training, could run up a debt considerably greater
  than this. There is every reason to suppose that this process of
  "running into debt" for oxygen is associated with the
  accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle. Lactic acid is found
  in blood in comparatively large quantities after severe exercise:
  this acid must have come from the muscles. The respiratory
  quotient reaches values which are quite impossible on any
  supposition other than that the CO, is at first driven out from
  bicarbonate by lactic acid, and later restored to bicarbonate as
  the lactic acid is removed in recovery. This removal of lactic
  acid requires oxygen and corresponds to the recovery process
  which we have found in frog's muscle. Experiments by my
  colleagues Long and Lupton have shown that the ratio of lactic
  acid removed to lactic acid oxidized is about the same as in
  isolated frog's muscle, namely about 6 : 1.</p>

  <p>This application to human muscular exercise
  is perhaps a digression, but I feel rather an interesting one. It
  shows that the purely academic study of the isolated frog's
  muscle may be applied to the extremely important practical case
  of muscular exercise in man: it explains many of the well-known
  phenomena of athletics. We will return now to the frog and to the
  myo-thermic experiments made upon it.</p>

  <p>If we take the case of the prolonged
  isometric contraction, heat is liberated in each of the three
  initial phases of contraction, maintenance, and relaxation. If
  the contraction be maintained for a long time, there is a steady
  heat production during the whole of that time, proportional to
  the tension developed. We may describe the phenomenon
  mathematically in the formula:</p>

  <table width="72" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="formelh.gif" width="72" height="24" alt=
      ""></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>where <i>H</i> is total heat production,
  <i>T</i> is force developed, <i>l</i> is length of muscle,
  <i>t</i> is time during which the contraction is maintained,
  <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are constants. It is found that <i>A</i> is
  independent of temperature, having, in the case of the sartorius
  muscle, always a value of about 1/6; <i>B</i>, which we may
  regard as the inverse of the "efficiency of maintaining a
  contraction", depends on the type of muscle, on temperature, on
  fatigue, and on many other factors. If we take the important
  practical case of human movements, so much energy is required to
  set them up, so much to maintain them for a given time. The
  amount required to set up a given contraction is constant, the
  amount required to maintain it is variable, depending on the
  nature of the muscle and its condition at the time. Anything
  which slows the single twitch of a muscle makes summation more
  easy and <i>B</i> smaller: the muscle becomes more efficient for
  maintaining a contraction. The quickest muscles of all are the
  least efficient when it comes to exerting a force for a long
  time. There is an important effect of temperature on the rate at
  which the total heat production increases as the muscle continues
  to be tetanized - the rate of heat production is greater at the
  higher temperature. It would appear as though there were some
  ready store of energy which is, so to speak, exploded by the
  first few shocks, and that later a steady stream of energy must
  be maintained to keep up the contraction. Possibly Embden's
  lactacidogen is the explosive substance used in the first few
  twitches of the summed contraction, the store which has been
  exploded being reformed continually by chemical reactions, from
  its precursor glycogen. If so, we should expect the rate at which
  restoration can go on to have a temperature coefficient of a
  chemical kind.</p>

  <p>We have dealt so far, for several reasons,
  with the simple case of the isometric contraction : firstly,
  because it involves us in one less variable, namely, the length
  of the muscle, and secondly, because myothermic experiments on
  the isometric contraction are so much simpler and freer from
  error. Recent developments, however, of the technique have made
  it possible to study the heat production in a muscle which is
  allowed to shorten as much as one desires, and provided that
  stringent precautions be taken, reliable results are obtained.
  The temperature equilibrium in the muscle chamber must be so good
  that shortening over the junctions of the thermopile does not
  bring cooler or warmer parts of the muscle in contact with them.
  It must be remembered that this constancy of temperature must be
  to the nearest 1/100,000 of a degree because our scale of
  temperature is so small. During the last year Dr. W.O. Fenn has
  studied the effects of shortening and doing work upon the total
  liberation of energy by a muscle. He has found that when work is
  done, there is an "excess". liberation of energy over and above
  that necessary in an isometric contraction of the same duration.
  The muscle is excited and allowed to shorten from one length to
  another, to lift various loads from one level to the other. The
  work done is proportional to the load, and the "excess" energy is
  also proportional to the load. If the load be held up at the end
  of the contraction so that the muscle relaxes unloaded, the
  excess energy is just about equal to the work done. If the muscle
  contracts freely and then lowers the load, excess energy is
  liberated of the same order of size as the work done by the load
  in falling: the muscle requires energy both to lower and to raise
  a weight. This is only one of the curious and unexpected results
  which Fenn has found. If a muscle be caused to lengthen during
  the development of its contraction, it gives out less energy than
  in an isometric twitch. If it be held fast and allowed to shorten
  only during relaxation, then again it will give out less heat.
  Shortening during contraction, lengthening during relaxation,
  appear to require excess liberation of energy. Lengthening during
  contraction, shortening during relaxation, appear to cause an
  excess "absorption" of energy, i.e. to lead to a total energy
  liberation less than that of the isometric twitch.</p>

  <p>We are studying here the curious power
  which a muscle possesses of adapting its liberation of energy to
  the work it has to do. The subject is new and results are only
  now beginning to appear, but it is certain that we are dealing
  with a very fundamental property of the muscular machine. I
  should like shortly to illustrate the new principles which are
  emerging by some further examples.</p>

  <p>Let us stimulate a muscle and allow its
  tension to develop isometrically until it has reached a maximum.
  Let us then, by a quick-release mechanism, allow the muscle to
  shorten suddenly and let us hinder its contraction by opposing it
  to the inertia of a mass; the mass employed may be either a
  fly-wheel, or an equilibrated beam, or a weight hanging on a long
  string and pulled horizontally. The greater the mass which
  opposes the contraction of the muscle, the more slowly will the
  muscle contract; the less the mass, the more rapidly will it
  contract. If a stimulated muscle were an elastic body, as Fick
  and others sometimes, as I always till recently, supposed, it
  would do the same work against a small mass as against a large
  one. It would turn the whole of the potential energy of strain
  which it possesses into kinetic energy in the mass. In muscle
  this is not so. The greater the speed of shortening, the less
  will be the work done. In the case of human-arm muscles the work
  does not attain anything near the maximum value unless the
  contraction has been opposed by a mass large enough to make it
  occupy at least two seconds. Even an unloaded contraction
  occupies about 0.25 seconds, in which case of course no work is
  done. Dependence of work on speed of movement I ascribed
  originally to the viscosity of the muscle substance: the greater
  the speed, the greater would be the fraction of the potential
  energy of the muscle which would be wasted in changing the
  muscle's own form. The original experiments were made on man, and
  it was possible that the form of the curve was to be ascribed to
  the central nervous system, adjusting the innervation of the
  muscle to the work which it had to perform. This possibility is
  eliminated by the fact that the same identical phenomenon is
  found in the frog, as Gasser recently has shown. A frog's muscle
  is stimulated and held fast, then suddenly released against the
  inertia of a mass. The kinetic energy produced is greater if the
  contraction be slow, and less if the contraction be fast, in a
  muscle subjected to a maximal tetanus. The phenomenon appears to
  be a genuine property of muscle. Gasser has found that the time
  relations of the frog's muscle in this respect are totally
  different from those of man. Relatively speaking, the frog's
  muscle is ten times quicker than that of man: it can do the same
  fraction of its maximum work when it contracts in about 1/10th of
  the time. This fact seems to indicate a curious and interesting
  application of the theory of dimensions, but I cannot discuss it
  further now. The difference in the time-scales of the two types
  of muscle makes one regard it as improbable that physical
  viscosity alone is the determining factor. One cannot see why
  viscosity should have ten times the effect in a human muscle than
  it has in a frog's, and probably one hundred or one thousand
  times as much as it has in a fly's. It would seem that we are
  dealing here with a fundamental mechanical property of a muscle
  which is actually shortening after stimulation.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the facts we have just discussed
  are related to Fenn's work, who found that the greater the work,
  the greater the excess heat. They suggest an adaptation of the
  chemical break-down of the muscle to the work performed. There
  may be some kind of positive physiological machinery in the
  muscle to regulate the speed of contraction to the requirements
  of the animal. I have no time now to go into the matter further,
  but I believe that we are beginning here to see a further
  striking adaptation of the body to its needs, of the muscle to
  its load. For those who like mechanical and electrical analogies
  I will refer to the case of the electric motor. If the motor be
  unloaded, a certain amount of energy is used: increase the load
  and the motor automatically takes more current: try to drive the
  motor from with-out and a back e.m.f. is produced, causing less
  current to be taken. It is clear, in any case, that the
  "all-or-none" principle is not completely applicable to the
  muscle fibre, <i>if we state the principle in the form that the
  response depends only on the stimulus and on the initial
  circumstances</i>. The amount of energy which the muscle gives
  out obviously depends on factors which come in only after the
  muscle has begun to shorten, on the inertia opposing its
  contraction, on the load it has to lift. State it in the form
  that the response cannot be varied by varying the stimulus and it
  still holds. It is clear also that those of us who supposed that
  a stimulated muscle is simply a new elastic body were wrong. A
  muscle may possess some elastic properties, but it requires more
  energy to do more work, a fact which is fundamentally in
  opposition to the elastic body theory.</p>

  <p>There are many sides of this entrancing
  subject, on which I have no time to touch: there are many
  experiments which must still be done. We are dealing here with a
  genuine physical problem, involving statics, dynamics,
  thermodynamics, the design and employment of instruments: and it
  would seem that in the study of the mechanism of muscle we have a
  better opportunity of exploiting the use of these exact tools
  than perhaps on any other side of the investigation of living,
  working material. Our study, however, needs light also from
  another aspect, it requires the skilled labours of the organic
  and biochemists. We who have worked on the physical problems
  provided by the muscles could never have progressed, had Fletcher
  and Hopkins not put us on the trail: we should have been lost and
  bewildered had not Meyerhof, in the brilliant researches which he
  will now describe, ably led us through a part of the forest where
  our own methods are helpless. To take another analogy, the
  completion of the drawing will rest with the chemists: we
  physicists can only provide a sketch; we can indicate the type of
  machine and its properties, the chemists must describe it in
  detail.</p>
