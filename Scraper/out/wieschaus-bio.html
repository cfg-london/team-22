  <h1>Eric F. Wieschaus - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wieschaus.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in South Bend, Indiana on June
  8, 1947, one of that large bumper crop of babies born in the
  United States after World War II. My family moved to Birmingham
  Alabama in 1953 when I was six. Although Birmingham was already a
  major industrial center in the South, the city still had the
  small town character of most Southern cities at the time. My
  brother, my three sisters and I could go exploring in the woods
  near our house, and collect frogs, turtles and crayfish from the
  local streams and lake. I went to Catholic grade schools and,
  when I was fourteen, took a 6:45 bus every morning across the
  city to make it to the only Catholic high school by 8:30. Though
  I did well in my science and math courses, I did not see myself
  in a career in science. I played piano and read books, but spent
  most of my time painting and drawing pictures. I dreamed of
  becoming an artist when I grew up.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer between my junior and senior years, I went to
  Lawrence, Kansas, to a program funded by the National Science
  Foundation to encourage high school kids to become scientists.
  For the first time in my life I was with kids who were smarter
  than I, who cared about science, and who talked about books and
  art. I felt as though I had finally found a group to which I
  belonged; in these surroundings I was able to conquer the shyness
  and insecurity that plagued me in my own high school back in
  Birmingham. In the laboratory associated with the Zoology course,
  I dissected animals for the first time, from fish up the
  vertebrate ladder to fetal pigs. I was invited back the following
  summer to work in the neurobiology lab of Nancy and Dennis Dahl.
  My work involved more dissection, this time removing vagus nerves
  from large land tortoises, stripping off the outer sheaths and
  recording the electrical depolarization when they were
  stimulated. The Dahls' generosity in opening their lab to a high
  school senior still amazes me. I can't believe I produced much
  useful data, but the experience was enough to convince me that I
  wanted to become a scientist. By the time I started college at
  Notre Dame, there was no doubt in my mind that I would major in
  biology.<br>
  <br>
  In my sophomore year at Notre Dame, I needed money and found a
  job preparing fly food in a Drosophila laboratory run by
  Professor Harvey Bender. In Bender's lab, I encountered my first
  fruit flies and learned basic genetics. Though I liked working in
  a lab, genetics did not excite me as much as the embryology
  courses I was then taking from Kenyon Tweedel. Tweedel seemed to
  have a continuous supply of living embryos from a variety of
  different species. I will never forget the thrill of seeing
  cleavage and gastrulation for the first time in living frog
  embryos. I immediately wanted to understand why cells in
  particular regions of the developing embryo behaved the way they
  did. What were the mechanisms that made them different from each
  other? What forces drove such dramatic rearrangements in the
  cytoplasm and the shape of cells?<br>
  <br>
  In my last years at Notre Dame, I became increasingly active in
  the student effort against the war in Vietnam. I collected
  petitions, joined in protest demonstrations and applied for
  conscientious objector status to avoid being sent to Vietnam. It
  was, however, very unlikely that my local draft board would grant
  me such status, given that I had not been raised in one of the
  traditionally pacifist religions. In spite of my somewhat
  uncertain future, I decided to begin graduate school in biology
  and was accepted to Yale University. Bender was worried about my
  draft status and wrote to Donald Poulson, the only Drosophila
  geneticist he knew at Yale, telling him about my problems and
  asking him to look after me while I was in New Haven. When I
  arrived in New Haven, Poulson had a place set up for me in his
  lab. He was so very kind that I didn't have the courage to tell
  him that after three years of washing fly bottles at Notre Dame,
  I never wanted to see another fly, much less work on flies for my
  thesis.<br>
  <br>
  In the 30's and early 40's, Poulson had described the basic
  embryology of Drosophila and had characterized one of the first
  mutants with an interesting interpretable phenotype during
  embryonic development (the neural defects associated with
  deletions of the <i>Notch</i> locus). Until that point, I had
  thought all developmental genetics of flies involved eye colors
  and bristles and other aspects of adult morphology. It had never
  occurred to me that flies had embryos, or that Drosophila
  embryogenesis was characterized by the same kinds of spectacular
  cell movements seen in the classically studied embryos of
  vertebrates. I learned all that from Poulson.<br>
  <br>
  In my second year in graduate school, I switched to Walter
  Gehring's lab to learn <i>in vivo</i> techniques for culturing
  embryos. Gehring had just set up his lab in the medical school,
  so it was still very small, much smaller than what it was to
  become after his return to Basel two years later. Because I was
  his only student, working directly with him was a wonderful
  opportunity to learn how experimental science is done. For my
  first experiments in his lab, I set out to investigate whether
  cells at the blastoderm stage were already determined to form
  specific discs. My plan was to remove single cells from defined
  regions of the blastoderm and culture them in adult abdomens
  surrounded by genetically marked "feeder cells." My last years in
  New Haven and almost all my time in Basel were spent dissociating
  embryos and trying different culturing procedures, but I was
  never able to get single isolated cells to survive. Fortunately,
  at some point along the way, I had decided I needed to know what
  normal cells did in embryos that weren't homogenized or subjected
  to my in vivo culturing techniques. It was those experiments,
  initially planned as controls for my more ambitious cultures, that
  eventually constituted my thesis. I used X-ray induced mitotic
  recombination to mark clones derived from single cells. In
  contrast to the restricted clones produced by irradiation of
  larvae, such clones extended between the wing and leg of the
  adult fly, indicating that the blastoderm cell that gave rise to
  the clone could not yet have been determined with respect to
  either disc. On the other hand I could never find clones that
  overlapped adjacent legs. Because legs were derived from
  different segments, my results suggested that if blastoderm cells
  were determined for anything, they were determined for segments
  rather than discs.<br>
  <br>
  In my last year in Basel I started a collaboration with Elisha
  Van Deusen and Larry Marsh using pole cell transplantation to
  make genetically mosaic ovaries. We wanted to use such mosaics to
  determine whether particular maternal effect mutants block gene
  activities in the germ cells themselves, or whether they
  identified genes that were active in the overlying follicle
  cells. Although most of the mutants we tested did not have
  interesting phenotypes, there was one, <i>fs(1)k10</i>, that
  caused an abnormal pattern in the egg shell. Since the shell is
  secreted by the follicle cells during oogenesis, we expected the
  defect to depend on the genotype of those cells. To our surprise,
  the mutant was germ line dependent. Those transplants provided
  the first evidence for an organizing principle that emanated from
  germ cells and controlled patterning of the overlying follicle
  cells. The embryos that developed in <i>k10</i> eggs were also
  abnormal, but in a way that I did not understand at the time. It
  took <a href="index.html">Christiane N&uuml;sslein-Volhards</a>'s
  work on <i>dorsal</i> for me to re-interpret it in terms of
  dorsal ventral polarity.<br>
  <br>
  I met Christiane (Janni) N&uuml;sslein-Volhard two months before
  I left Basel to begin my postdoctoral work with Rolf
  N&ouml;thiger in Zurich. Janni had come to Basel to learn
  Drosophila embryology and we thus had many interests in common.
  Even after I had left for my postdoctoral work in Zurich, I would
  come back to Basel, in part to finish experiments, but also
  always to have dinner with her. We would talk science and plan
  experiments we eventually wanted to do together.<br>
  <br>
  In much of my work in Zurich, I continued to use the cell lineage
  techniques of my thesis work, but now to analyze the development
  of sexually dimorphic structures. Janos Szabad and I developed
  efficient procedures for making germ line mosaics using
  <i>K10</i> and mitotic recombination. In collaboration with Trudi
  Sch&uuml;pbach, we also studied the cell lineage of the embryonic
  epidermis. Those studies paralleled a similar analysis that Janni
  N&uuml;sslein-Volhard had begun with Margit Lohs using laser
  ablation. Both studies suggested that segmental units might be
  established as three to four cell wide stripes at the blastoderm
  stage. By far, however the most important thing that happened to
  me at Zurich was my deepening relationship with Trudi
  Sch&uuml;pbach, who became my close friend and occasional
  scientific collaborator, but also an enormous emotional support
  throughout my life. We eventually married, in Princeton in 1983.
  Life with her, and with our three daughters Ingrid, Eleanor and
  Laura, has kept me busy and provided a needed balance to the
  demands of the lab.<br>
  <br>
  In 1978, I moved on to my first independent job, at the European
  Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. The lab had just been
  built and was intended as an international meeting ground for
  scientists from the various member nations. Although there were
  no permanent contracts at the time, the position as group leader
  gave me independence to pursue my interest in embryos, without
  major teaching obligations or being required to explain every
  step in my experimental plans to get the necessary funding. The
  job was as extraordinary opportunity, one that I regret is not
  given to more young scientists at the beginning of their careers.
  The most attractive feature of the move to Heidelberg, however,
  was that the EMBL had also offered a similar position to Janni.
  This gave us the chance to realize many of the experiments, and
  test many of the speculations developed over the long dinner
  conversations in Basel.<br>
  <br>
  Although we tried to keep our own individual research projects
  going, most of our time at the EMBL was spent on the joint
  mutagenesis experiment. Because handling large numbers of flies
  was essential if we were going to saturate the fly genome for
  mutations affecting embryonic development, we first had to test
  genetic selections to kill off specific genotypes at particular
  generations, and establish techniques for making large numbers of
  microscope preparations. We also continued to discuss
  developmental issues, recent models for patterning in embryos
  and, as the mutagenesis screens got underway, the interpretation
  of the particular defects observed in the various mutant lines.
  Those years were probable the most exciting, intellectually
  stimulating ones of my entire scientific career. A special
  feature of those mutagenesis experiments was that almost every
  day we could expect to encounter a new phenotype, a phenotype
  that would force us to re-evaluate some long held assumption
  about embryonic development.<br>
  <br>
  I moved from Heidelberg to Princeton in 1981. Since then I have
  taught genetics and development courses at the graduate and
  undergraduate level. The Heidelberg experiments continue to
  provide a rich source of inspiration for further research. After
  arriving in Princeton, Trudi Sch&uuml;pbach and I carried out
  similar large scale mutagenesis screens for maternal effect
  mutants. The loci identified in those screens, as well as in a
  comparable screen made by Janni's lab in T&uuml;bingen, allowed
  Drosophila oogenesis to come to rival embrogenesis as a ideal
  system for studying patterning. I have also continued to be
  interested in segmentation genes, as well as genes affecting
  segmental identity. Peter Gergen, Jym Mohler and Doug Coulter
  began their analyses of <i>runt, hedgehog</i> and
  <i>oddskipped</i> in my lab at Princeton and the extradenticle
  gene was analysed by Mark Peifer and Cordelia Rauskolb. Our work
  on the <i>armadillo</i> was started by Bob Riggleman and Paul
  Schedl, and was continued by Mark Peifer.<br>
  <br>
  Much of my current work centers on genes controlling cell shape
  changes during gastrulation (with Sue Zusman, Suki Parks, Dari
  Sweeton, Mike Costa), and genes for the establishment of the
  early cytoskeleton (work with Lesilee Rose, Eyal Schejter, Marya
  Postner). The mutagenesis experiments in Heidelberg were less
  successful in identifying genes directly involved in such
  specific morphological changes. We have consequently designed
  alternate genetic procedures involving translocations to identity
  such genes and have initiated an analysis of their roles within
  the cell. Overall the Princeton years have seen an increasingly
  cell biological turn to my research. My work has always had a
  strong visual component (probably to assuage my suppressed
  teenage desires to be an artist or painter). What I did not
  realize until late in my development as a scientist is that
  morphology and cell biology are actually the same scientific
  areas, or at least that the latter provides the molecular
  explanation of the former.</p>
