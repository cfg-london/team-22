  <h1>Robert Schrieffer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="schrieffer.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John Robert Schrieffer</b> was
  born in Oak Park, Illinois on May 31, 1931, son of John H.
  Schrieffer and his wife Louis (n&eacute;e Anderson). In 1940, the
  family moved to Manhasset, New York and in 1947 to Eustis,
  Florida where they became active in the citrus industry.<br>
  <br>
  Following his graduation from Eustis High School in 1949,
  Schrieffer was admitted to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where for two
  years he majored in electrical engineering, then changed to
  physics in his junior year. He completed a bachelor's thesis on
  the multiple structure in heavy atoms under the direction of
  Professor John C. Slater. Following up on an interest in solid
  state physics developed while at MIT, he began graduate studies
  at the University of Illinois, where he immediately began
  research with Professor John Bardeen. After working out a problem
  dealing with electrical conduction on semiconductor surfaces,
  Schrieffer spent a year in the laboratory, applying the theory to
  several surface problems. In the third year of graduate studies,
  he joined Bardeen and Cooper in developing the theory of
  superconductivity, which constituted his doctoral
  dissertation.<br>
  <br>
  He spent the academic year 1957-58 as a National Science
  Foundation fellow at the University of Birmingham and the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where
  he continued research in superconductivity. Following a year as
  assistant professor at the University of Chicago, he returned to the
  University of Illinois in 1959 as a faculty member. In 1960 he
  returned to the Bohr Institute for a summer visit, during which
  he became engaged to Anne Grete Thomsen whom he married at
  Christmas of that year.<br>
  <br>
  In 1962 Schrieffer joined the faculty of the University of
  Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where in 1964 he was appointed
  Mary Amanda Wood Professor in Physics. In 1980 he was appointed
  Professor at the University of
  California, Santa Barbara and to the position of Chancellor
  Professor in 1984. He served as Director of the Institute for
  Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara from 1984-89. In 1992 he was
  appointed University Professor at Florida State University and Chief Scientist
  of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  He holds honorary degrees from the Technische
  Hochschule, Munich and the Universities of Geneva, Pennsylvania,
  Illinois, Cincinnati, Tel-Aviv, Alabama. In 1969 he was appointed by Cornell to a
  six-year term as a Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large.<br>
  <br>
  He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of
  Sciences of which he is a member of their council, the
  American Philosophical Society, the Royal Danish Academy of
  Sciences and Letters and the Academy of Sciences of the
  USSR.<br>
  <br>
  His awards include the Guggenheim Fellowship, Oliver E. Buckley
  Solid State Physics Prize, Comstock Prize, National Academy of
  Science, the Nobel Prize in Physics shared with John Bardeen and
  Leon N. Cooper in 1972, John Ericsson Medal, American Society of
  Swedish Engineers, University of Illinois Alumni Achievement
  Award, and in 1984 the National Medal of Science. The main thrust
  of his recent work has been in the area of high-temperature
  superconductivity, strongly correlated electrons, and the
  dynamics of electrons in strong magnetic fields.<br>
  <br>
  The Schrieffers have three children, Bolette, Paul, and
  Regina.</p>
