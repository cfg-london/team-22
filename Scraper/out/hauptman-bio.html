  <h1>Herbert A. Hauptman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hauptman.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in New York City on
  February 14, 1917, the oldest child of Israel Hauptman and Leah
  Rosenfeld. I have two brothers, Manuel and Robert.<br>
  <br>
  I married Edith Citrynell on November 10, 1940. We have two
  daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950).<br>
  <br>
  My interest in most areas of science and mathematics began at an
  early age, as soon as I had learned to read, and continues to
  this day. I obtained the B.S. degree in mathematics from the
  City College
  of New York (1937) and the M.A. degree in mathematics from
  Columbia
  University (1939).<br>
  <br>
  After the war I made the decision to obtain an advanced degree
  and pursue a career in basic scientific research. In furtherance
  of these goals I commenced a collaboration with Jerome Karle at
  the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. (1947) and at
  the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of
  Maryland. The collaboration with Dr. Karle proved to be fruitful
  because his background in physical chemistry and mine in
  mathematics complemented each other nicely. Not only did this
  combination enable us to tackle head-on the phase problem of
  X-ray crystallography, but this work suggested also the topic of
  my doctoral dissertation, "An N-Dimensional Euclidean Algorithm".
  By 1954 I had received my Ph.D. degree and Dr. Karle and I had
  laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray
  crystallography. Our 1953 monograph, "Solution of the Phase
  Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal", contains the main ideas,
  the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic
  methods, in particular the joint probability distributions of
  several structure factors, as the essential tool for phase
  determination. In this monograph we introduced also the concepts
  of the structure invariants and seminvariants, special linear
  combinations of the phases, and used them to devise recipes for
  origin specification in all the centrosymmetric space groups. The
  extension to the non-centrosymmetric space groups was made some
  years later. The notion of the structure invariants and
  seminvariants proved to be of particular importance because they
  also serve to link the observed diffraction intensities with the
  needed phases of the structure factors.<br>
  <br>
  In 1970 I joined the crystallographic group of the Medical
  Foundation of Buffalo<a href="#footnote">*</a> of which I was
  Research Director in 1972, replacing Dr. Dorita Norton. My work
  on the phase problem continues to this day. During the early
  years of this period I formulated the neighborhood principle and
  extension concept, the latter independently proposed by
  Giacovazzo under the term "representation theory". These ideas
  laid the groundwork for the probabilistic theories of the higher
  order structure invariants and seminvariants which were further
  developed during the late seventies by myself and others. During
  the eighties I initiated work on the problem of combining the
  traditional techniques of direct methods with isomorphous
  replacement and anomalous dispersion in the attempt to facilitate
  the solution of macromolecular crystal structures. This work
  continues to the present time. More recently I have formulated
  the phase problem of X-ray crystallography as a minimal principle
  in the attempt to strengthen the existing direct methods
  techniques. Together with colleagues Charles Weeks, George
  DeTitta and others, we have made the initial applications with
  encouraging results.</p>
