  <h1>Tobias Asser - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="asser.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Tobias
  Michael Carel Asser</b> (April 28, 1838-July 29, 1913) was born
  in Amsterdam into a family with a tradition in the field of law,
  both his father and his grandfather having been well-established
  lawyers and his uncle having served as the Dutch minister of
  justice. A brilliant student, young Asser won a competition in
  1857 with his thesis <i>On the Economic Conception of Value</i>.
  Although this achievement may have confirmed an early decision to
  take up a career in the business world, he changed his mind and
  went on to study law at the Athenaeum in Amsterdam, taking a
  doctor's degree in 1860 at the age of twenty-one. In that same
  year, the Dutch government appointed him a member of an
  international commission which was to negotiate the abolition of
  tolls on the Rhine River.<br>
  <br>
  Asser practiced law for a brief period but devoted his life
  mainly to teaching, scholarship, and politics. In 1862 he
  accepted a teaching position at the Athenaeum as professor of
  private law; in 1876, when the institution became the University of Amsterdam,
  he continued as a professor of international and commercial law
  while continuing a reduced legal practice.<br>
  <br>
  Early in his scholarly career, Asser turned to the problems of
  international law, dedicating himself particularly to the area of
  international private law in which he soon acquired a position of
  leadership. Believing that legal conflicts between nations could
  best be solved by international conferences which would agree on
  common solutions to be implemented by each participating nation,
  he persuaded the Dutch government to call several conferences of
  European powers to work out a codification of international
  private law. Attended by representatives of most of the countries
  of Europe, the first two of these conferences, held at The Hague
  in 1893 and 1894 and over which Asser presided, drew up a treaty,
  made effective in May, 1899, establishing a uniform international
  procedure for conducting civil trials. Asser also presided over
  the conferences of 1900 and 1904, which resulted in several
  important treaties governing international family law, including
  matters relating to marriage, divorce, legal separation, and
  guardianship of minors.<br>
  <br>
  Asser's interest in international law led him, along with the
  Belgian Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns and the Englishman John
  Westlake, to found a journal of international law, <i>Revue de
  droit international et de l&eacute;gislation compar&eacute;e</i> in
  1869. Four years later he was one of those invited by
  Rolin-Jaequemyns to take part in the small international
  conference at Ghent which founded the Institute of International
  Law, an organization which Asser later headed. Active in efforts
  to establish an academy of international law, Asser died before
  such an academy became a reality at The Hague in 1923.<br>
  <br>
  Asser's contributions to the literature of law were a vital part
  of his efforts. Among his more important works are <i>Schets van
  het internationaal Privatrecht</i> (1877) and <i>Schets van het
  Nederlandsche Handelsrecht</i> (1904).<br>
  <br>
  Asser also participated in the practical politics of
  international affairs. He accepted a position as legal adviser to
  the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1875; became a
  member of the Council of State, the highest administrative body
  in the government, in 1893; served as president of the State
  Commission for International Law beginning in 1898; acted as his
  country's delegate to the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and
  1907, there urging that the principle of compulsory arbitration
  be introduced in the economic area; held a post as minister
  without portfolio from 1904 until his death.<br>
  <br>
  Noted as a negotiator, Asser was involved during this period from
  1875 to 1913 in virtually every treaty concluded by the Dutch
  government. One of his triumphs was the securing of a seat for
  Spain and for The Netherlands beside France, England, Germany,
  Austria, Italy, Russia, and Turkey on the Suez Canal Commission,
  the body that drew up the Suez Canal Convention of 1888
  guaranteeing the canal's neutrality. Noted also as an arbiter of
  international disputes, he sat as a member of the Permanent Court
  of Arbitration that heard the first case to come before that
  court - the Pious Fund dispute between the United States and
  Mexico (1902).<br>
  <br>
  Asser was an accomplished linguist, handling effectively the
  German, French, and English languages, as well as his native
  Dutch. For his scholarship and its application to the affairs of
  government he was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of
  Edinburgh,
  Cambridge,
  Bologna, and
  Berlin. Housed in the Peace Palace at The Hague, a library of
  international law which he gathered with the help of
  contributions from twenty countries has been named &laquo;The
  Asser Collection&raquo;.</p>
