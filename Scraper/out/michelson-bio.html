  <h1>Albert A. Michelson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="michelson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Albert Abraham Michelson</b>
  was born in Strelno, Prussia, on December 19, 1852. Two years
  later his family emigrated to the United States to settle at
  Virginia City, Nevada, but they eventually moved to San Francisco
  where Michelson received his early education in public schools,
  matriculating from the High School in 1869. He was appointed by
  President Grant to the U.S. Naval Academy and, after graduation as
  Ensign in 1873 and a two-years' cruise in the West Indies, he
  became an instructor in physics and chemistry at the Academy
  under Admiral Sampson. In 1879, he was posted to the Nautical
  Almanac Office, Washington, to work with Simon Newcomb, but in
  the following year, he obtained leave of absence to continue his
  studies in Europe. He visited the Universities of Berlin and
  Heidelberg, and the College de France and &Eacute;cole
  Polytechnique in Paris. He resigned from the Navy and in 1883
  returned to America to take an appointment as Professor of
  Physics in the Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio.
  In 1890 he accepted a similar position at Clark University,
  Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1892 he became Professor of
  Physics and the first Head of Department at the new University of
  Chicago. He rejoined the Navy during World War I, and in 1918
  returned to Chicago where in 1925 he was appointed to the first
  of the Distinguished Service Professorships. Michelson resigned
  in 1929 to work at the Mount Wilson Observatory, Pasadena.<br>

  During his career, Michelson touched on many departments of
  physics but, perhaps due to a special instinct which he appeared
  to possess, he excelled in optics. He performed early
  measurements of the velocity of light with amazing delicacy and
  in 1881 he invented his interferometer for the purpose of
  discovering the effect of the Earth's motion on the observed
  velocity. In cooperation with Professor E.W. Morley, and using
  the interferometer, it was shown that light travels at a constant
  speed in all inertial systems of reference. The instrument also
  enabled distances to be measured with greater accuracy by means
  of the length of light-waves. At the request of the International
  Committee of Weights and Measures, Michelson measured the
  standard metre in terms of wavelength of cadmium light. He
  invented the echelon spectroscope and during his wartime service
  in the Navy he performed research work on devices for naval use -
  he developed a rangefinder which was adapted as part of U.S. Navy
  equipment. On his return to civilian life, Michelson became more
  interested in astronomy and in 1920, using light interference and
  a highly developed version of his earlier instrument, he measured
  the diameter of the star Betelgeuse: this was the first
  determination of the size of a star that could be regarded as
  accurate.<br>

  Michelson has contributed numerous papers to many scientific
  periodicals and among his more substantial works are the
  classics, Velocity of Light (1902) Light Waves and their Uses
  (1899-1903); and Studies in Optics (1927).<br>

  Michelson was honoured by memberships of many learned societies
  throughout America and ten European countries, and he received
  honorary science and law degrees from ten American and foreign
  universities. He was President of the American Physical Society
  (1900), the American Association for the Advancement of Science
  (1910-1911), and the National Academy of Sciences (1923-1927). He was
  also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal
  Society of London and the Optical Society, an Associate of
  l'Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise and among the many awards he has
  received are the Matteucci Medal (Societ&aacute; Italiana), 1904;
  Copley Medal (Royal Society), 1907; Elliot Cresson Medal
  (Franklin
  Institute), 1912; Draper Medal (National Academy of
  Sciences), 1916; Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute) and the
  Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1923; and the Duddell
  Medal (Physical Society), 1929.</p>

  <p>Michelson married Edna Stanton of Lake
  Forest, Illinois in 1899. They had one son and three daughters.
  He died in 1931.</p>
