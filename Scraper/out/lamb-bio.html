  <h1>Willis E. Lamb - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lamb.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Willis
    Eugene Lamb, Jr.</b> was born
  on July 12, 1913 in Los Angeles, California. His father Willis
  Eugene Lamb, born in Minnesota, was by profession a telephone
  engineer and his mother Marie Helen Metcalf came from
  Nebraska.<br>
  <br>
  Except for three years schooling in Oakland, Calif., he was
  educated in the public schools of Los Angeles, Calif. In 1930 he
  entered the University of California at Berkeley and received a
  B.S. (Chemistry) in 1934. His graduate work in theoretical
  physics at the same university led to the Ph.D. degree in 1938.
  His thesis research on the electromagnetic properties of nuclear
  systems was directed by Professor J.R. Oppenheimer.<br>
  <br>
  He went to Columbia University as Instructor in Physics in
  1938, became an Associate (1943), Assistant Professor (1945),
  Associate Professor (1947) and Professor in 1948. From 1943 to
  1951, he was associated also with the Columbia Radiation
  Laboratory where the research described in the Nobel Lecture was
  done. In 1951 he went to Stanford University in California as
  Professor of Physics. During 1953-1954 he was Morris Loeb
  Lecturer at Harvard University. From 1956 to 1962 he was a
  Fellow of New College and Wykeham Professor of Physics at the
  University of
  Oxford, England. In 1962 he became Henry Ford II Professor of
  Physics at Yale
  University, New Haven, Conn.<br>
  <br>
  His research has been on the following subjects: theory of the
  interactions of neutrons and matter, field theories of nuclear
  structure, theories of beta decay, range of fission fragments,
  fluctuations in cosmic ray showers, pair production,
  order-disorder problems, ejection of electrons by metastable
  atoms, quadrupole interactions in molecules, diamagnetic
  corrections for nuclear resonance experiments; theory and design
  of magneton oscillators, theory of a microwave spectroscope,
  study of the fine structure of hydrogen, deuterium and helium;
  theory of electrodynamic energy level displacements.<br>
  <br>
  In 1953 he received the Rumford Premium of the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences. The University of Pennsylvania conferred an honorary
  degree of D.Sc. upon him in 1954. He received the Research
  Corporation Award in 1955. He is a member of the National Academy
  of Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society.<br>
  <br>
  In 1939 he married Ursula Schaefer, a student from Germany.</p>
