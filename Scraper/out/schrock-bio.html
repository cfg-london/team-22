  <h1>Richard R. Schrock - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="schrock.jpg" class="bio-img">I
   was born in Berne, a northeast Indiana farming community proud of its Swiss
   heritage. Life was not easy for my parents, Noah J.  Schrock, the second of
   six children, and Martha A. Habegger, the second of ten children. They married
   in 1933 during the Depression.  My oldest brother, Luther, was born in 1934,
   Theodore in 1939.  A few months after I appeared in 1945, the family moved
   to Decatur, about 13 miles north of Berne, where we lived until the summer
 after my fifth birthday. My most lasting memory of our first home
 is its proximity to the city swimming pool where I spent many happy
 summer days.</p>


 
 <p>We moved into an old house on the west side of South 13th Street
 in 1950. The house required a good deal of work, but my father,
 who had been a carpenter for fifteen years, accomplished the renovation
 over a period of several years. The house was located on what seemed
 to me to be an enormous plot of land (one acre); the backyard
 took forever to mow on a steamy summer day and the vegetable garden
 produced quantities of corn, strawberries, melons, tomatoes, and
 raspberries. A large vacant lot extended south toward a small railroad
 that dove beneath the highway on its way east to a mill where tiles
 were made from the clay dug on the west side of the road. The process
 of mining the clay created ponds, which I explored along with the
 surrounding woods at length. In the summer I would fish, catch
 snakes and frogs, and build simple huts in the woods, which probably
 were the first indications of my love for designing and building,
 and for the outdoors. In the winter I learned how to ice skate
 and often (so it seemed) would come close to actually freezing
 toes and fingers. We never had much money, but the house was comfortable
 (except during the first, and especially cold, winter) and the
 food (fresh in the summer, canned in the winter) was plentiful
 for the five of us.</p>

 <p>My father built a woodworking shop in the two car garage at the
 rear of the house where I also spent much time discovering, among
 other things, that it is not easy to drive nails into maple. I
 was not allowed to operate power tools at a young age, but my father
 introduced me to several as I became older, except his prize 1941
 Delta table saw, which I eventually inherited when he died of leukemia
 in 1980 at age 69. He was a patient teacher even though I did not
 fully appreciate the difference between a chisel and a screwdriver
 or clear pine and a prized piece of birds eye maple when I was
 young. I learned many things by trial and error but nevertheless
 grew to appreciate what one can do with wood and the right tools
 used the right way. I maintain that interest to this day. Like
 most young Hoosier men at that time, I played on the school basketball,
 baseball, and football teams. Although I did not continue to play
 organized sports beyond age ten or eleven, sports provided me with
 a respect and need for physical exercise that I still have.</p>
 
 <p>My curiosity and love of building things played into the hand
 of my older brother Theodore who presented me with the proverbial
 chemistry set on my eighth birthday. He was thirteen at the time
 and beginning to appreciate the beauties of science. His interest
 in chemistry continued through his college years but he eventually
 studied medicine instead and became a highly successful surgeon. 
 I was hooked. I created a small laboratory at the end of a storage
 area for canned goods and used my budding woodworking skills to
 build shelves for the ever expanding collection of test tubes,
 beakers, and flasks. I obtained most of my equipment through a
 mail order supply house with money earned from an early morning
 paper route. I carried out simple experiments (combining acids
 and bases to make salts, making pleasant smelling esters, etc.)
 following the directions in chemistry laboratory texts handed down
 to me. When I reached the age of thirteen, Harry Dailey, the high
 school chemistry teacher, stoked my interest in chemistry with
 more textbooks and discarded equipment. I thought all equipment
 wonderful to behold. As I became aware of the power of burning
 natural gas, the lowly alcohol burner was replaced by the common
 Bunsen burner, and the Bunsen burner ultimately by a high tech
 broad-headed model capable of putting out a good deal of heat,
 enough to melt metals in a porcelain crucible and even sodium chloride.</p>
 
 <p>After we moved to a house on Jackson Street in 1958, my laboratory
 grew in size, diversity, and complexity. I now had at my disposal
 relatively sophisticated and, if misused, dangerous substances
 in a small room in the basement. I was often interested in testing
 recipes for mixtures of oxidizing agents and oxidizeable materials
 as well as nitrating common household substances. Thankfully, there
 were no serious mishaps, although my mother tells stories that
 belie that statement, including one in which the local fire department
 was called to our home; fortunately only a small rug was burning,
 not the house. At least I also was quick to think and act.</p>
 
 <p>My father went to San Diego, California, in the fall of 1958
 to work in the construction industry with his brother, Clarence,
 and to explore the feasibility of moving west. In 1959 my mother
 and I joined him. She drove and I navigated cross country with
 my laboratory carefully packed in the trunk of the car. By the
 time I finished Mission Bay High School in 1963, both my parents
 had also fulfilled their dreams of finishing high school, something
 they had not been allowed to do in their youth. My interest in
 chemistry expanded in San Diego. I found a laboratory supply house
 where I could buy classic equipment (a 250 mL retort was coveted
 and purchased) and a drugstore where I could buy basic chemicals
 with some adult help of course. I discovered many wonderful things
 such as how to make bromine from KBr and sulfuric acid, how to
 make sodium (and chlorine) by electrolizing molten sodium chloride,
 and how to analyze for metals by making sulfides with brilliant
 and characteristic colors. I took up surfing and skin diving, and
 continued my interest in woodworking by designing, making, and
 selling fins for surfboards. I entered a regional science fair
 with a project that concerned osmotic processes in sea urchin eggs
 and managed to win a prize for it. I collected the sea urchins
 at low tide and harvested the eggs myself. That, and dissection
 of a sheep's brain (which I greatly enjoyed) in physiological
 psychology later in college, was the closest I would come to following
 my brother into medicine.</p>
 
 <p>I always assumed I would attend college and study chemistry. 
 The only financially viable option was the University of California. I was accepted
   at Berkeley but chose to attend Riverside, a relatively new campus about 90
   miles north of San Diego, because I thought that a smaller school might allow
   me to do more independent research earlier in my career. That proved to be
   the case. After the first exam in my first chemistry course at UCR, I was
   approached by Professor James Pitts who asked if I wanted a summer job. I
 agreed and began research in what broadly could be called atmospheric
 chemistry, a hot topic in the smog ridden Los Angeles basin and
 surrounding area at that time. In actuality, I spent my time learning
 to blow glass and construct vacuum lines, and to measure low concentrations
 of photolysis products using a temperamental, delicate, almost
 impossible to align, multi-pass Perkin-Elmer IR machine connected
 to a vacuum line. (Fourier Transform machines were not yet known.)
 A paper entitled &quot;The Detection of Ethylketen and enol-Crotonaldehyde
 in the Vapour-phase Photolysis of <i>trans</i>-Crotonaldehyde&quot; reported
 some of my work in 1968 after I had moved on to graduate school. 
 I also worked &quot;up the hill&quot; with Dr. E.A. (Ed) Schuck
 and in 1966 found my name on a paper entitled &quot;Rate Constant
 Ratios During Nitrogen Dioxide Photolysis.&quot; I learned many
 things, scientific and otherwise, that need not be detailed here. 
 One that I might mention was the joy (and sometimes discomfort)
 of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I still enjoy mountain
 hiking, although the frequency has decreased considerably. I capitalized
 on my knowledge of IR spectroscopy during a summer of research
 at Dow in Midland, Michigan, where my oldest brother Luther was
 an engineer.</p>

</p>
 <p>At Riverside I was influenced by a talented and enthusiastic
 teacher in physical chemistry named Jerry Bell. Jerry decided that
 I had enough ability to attend Harvard University for graduate
 study where he had received his Ph.D. I liked the idea, applied,
 and was accepted. I celebrated by listening to Rachmaninoff's
 second piano concerto played by Byron Janis, loudly, through a
 Fischer amplifier and large home built speakers, each with a volume
 approaching 12 cubic feet; an arts in western civilization course
 at UCR had boosted my interest in music that I had acquired in
 high school. During the last semester at UCR I took an inorganic
 chemistry course taught by Fred Hawthorne who appropriately spent
 a good deal of time discussing boron compounds. Although I enjoyed
 organic chemistry, the possibility of exploring the chemistry of
 all elements in the periodic table was fascinating to me. Yet for
 some reason I still regarded myself as a physical chemist.</p>
 
 <p>When I arrived at Harvard, I was scheduled to live in Perkins
 Hall, a graduate student dormitory. I was offered several possible
 roommates, among them David Swickard, a childhood friend from Decatur,
 who unknown to me was beginning graduate school in political science. 
 Needless to say, he was surprised to find me in the dorm room when
 he arrived. I lived in Perkins for the first year and then moved
 to an apartment with several other friends near Central Square
 in Cambridge. The apartment was adequately furnished, convenient
 to Harvard, and cheap. I spent most of my time in the lab anyway. 
 I was one of the constant residents in the apartment for the next
 three years, although from time to time I was uncertain how many
 roommates I actually had.</p>
 
 <p>I had not visited Harvard or researched the faculty before arriving
 and had no plan concerning the kind of physical chemistry I wanted
 to pursue. My desire to permute compositions of matter did not
 seem to fit with the physical chemistry being done at Harvard at
 that time. Perhaps I had the wrong impression of what I wanted
 to do or what &quot;physical chemistry&quot; was. Therefore picking
 a research supervisor proved problematic. One day while walking
 dejectedly down the main hall of Mallinckrodt Laboratory I passed
 a long office/lab (in fashion in years past) where a recently arrived
 assistant professor sat at the desk. I entered and talked with
 John Osborn, who told me about transition metal chemistry, about
 the excitement of creating new, colorful, crystalline compounds,
 and about catalysis by transition metal species such as the rhodium
 catalysts he had developed as part of his doctoral study with Geoffrey
 Wilkinson at Imperial College. That sounded like what I wanted
 to do, make new compounds with potential uses, so I signed on. 
 I am not sure John was totally pleased that I chose to work on
 rhodium since he may have felt that it was too close to his own
 doctoral work, although in the end the cationic complexes that
 I discovered turned out to be quite useful for asymmetric hydrogenation,
 at least those that contained the appropriate enantiomerically
 pure phosphine ligand. I also met <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/index.html">Ryoji
 Noyori</a> who was exploring
 catalysis by transition metal species in <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1990/index.html">E.J.
 Corey's</a> group,
 and Mike Strem, who had started Strem Chemicals and for whom I
 made a sample of deuterated Zeise's salt for the fantastic
 wage of $100, half a month's pay at that time.</p>
 
 <p>The late sixties were wild in Cambridge as in other university
 areas, with the Vietnam war escalating, and rebellions seething,
 or actually erupting. I decided I needed a break and had to see
 the world. I informed John that I would be traveling abroad for
 fifteen weeks during the summer of 1968 on a grand European tour. 
 The mantra was $5 a day. I think I almost achieved that goal. Hitchhiking
 was still acceptable and helped the budget greatly, as did youth
 hostels and a diet of bread and cheese. I could not believe I actually
 was in Europe, visiting all the famous museums and practicing
 my high school Spanish and college German. My success with French
 was more modest. While I am eager to learn other languages, I do
 not have the special talent required to achieve that goal without
 actually having lived abroad.</p>
 
 <p>In November of 1969, the 16th I believe, I meandered to a party
 near Davis Square where I met a tall blond school teacher named
 Nancy Carlson. She not only was beautiful but also bright and seemed
 attracted to me, which I found refreshing. We saw each other regularly
 that year and most of the next, and married in August of 1971,
 shortly after I finished and defended my Ph.D. thesis and she completed
 a master's degree in library science. Only one job was available
 in 1971, for which there were several hundred applicants, so I
 considered myself fortunate to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship
 from the National Science Foundation to work at Cambridge University
 in the laboratory of Jack Lewis, later Lord Lewis. The year in
 England was the beginning of a long relationship with England that
 continues today. Our present house is graced by a brass rubbing
 of Roger de Trumpington (gold and silver wax on black paper), one
 of the oldest brasses in England. It took some time to rub a brass
 that size, and the church in the village of Trumpington south of
 Cambridge around Christmas time was unrelentingly cold. I discovered
 a great deal about the relative heat capacity of my body versus
 a stone floor. We rubbed other brasses, but that particular event
 remains in my memory because of the cold and the boy's choir
 practicing their Christmas program in the background. I returned
 to the U.S. in the winter to look for permanent employment. Job
 offerings were still relatively meager, although I garnered a couple
 of offers. Upon returning to Cambridge I met Earl Muetterties,
 an associate director at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware,
   who was on a sabbatical at Cambridge, which was unusual for a nonacademic.
   He interviewed me and ultimately gave me an offer to work at the Central Research
   Department, which I accepted.  At that time CRD was an academic department
   in an industrial setting; nothing close to it exists today. Nancy and I moved
   to Wilmington in August of 1972 with two bicycles purchased in England. I
   still have mine and ride it occasionally.</p>

 <p>At DuPont I shared a lab with the remarkable Fred Tebbe, who
 was studying, among other things, reactions of ethyl aluminum reagents
 with titanocene dichloride. His most important and surprising discovery
 was what has become known as Tebbe's reagent, a species made
 through the reaction of titanocene dichloride with trimethylaluminum. 
 The most remarkable feature of Tebbe's reagent is a methylene
 group bridging between titanium and aluminum, which could replace
 the oxygen in a carbonyl group in a Wittig-like reaction. I dabbled
 in cyclooctatetraene chemistry and synthesized compounds such as
 the anion of triscyclooctatetraene niobium, and blue Ta(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)Me<sub>3</sub>,
 prepared through addition of the dianion of cyclooctatetraene to tantalum trimethyldichloride,
 the only known alkyl of tantalum, which had been reported by G. L. Juvinall
 in 1964. I found TaMe<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> to
 be easy to prepare on a large scale from TaCl<sub>5</sub> and dimethylzinc,
 which at that time could be purchased neat in large quantities. I became interested
 in the possibility of preparing other tantalum alkyl complexes. I was heavily
 influenced by <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1973/index.html">G.
 Wilkinson's</a> synthesis of hexamethyltungsten. Wilkinson was
 a consultant for DuPont at the time. On a trip to DuPont in the spring of 1973
 he told us about the synthesis and properties of that remarkable compound. 
 I subsequently concentrated on the synthesis of tantalum pentaalkyl
 complexes and soon had made highly volatile and highly unstable
 pentamethyltantalum by treating TaMe<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> with methyllithium.
  By July the attempted synthesis of pentaneopentyltantalum led to
 trineopentylneopentylidenetantalum, Ta[CHC(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] [CH<sub>2</sub>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>3</sub> instead.
 That compound marked the beginning of high oxidation state carbene, or alkylidene
 chemistry, as stated in a book by Bill Nugent and Jim Mayer (<i>Metal-Ligand
 Multiple Bonds</i>,
 1988) in which the actual DuPont notebook page which describes
 that discovery was reproduced. (Fortunately, that particular page
 also was an example of how to keep a proper notebook.) Shortly
 thereafter I prepared the first isolable terminal methylene complex,
 the structure of which was solved by Lloyd Guggenberger. George
 Parshall, my group leader, allowed me to do what I thought interesting
 and to work after normal hours, which greatly increased my productivity. 
 In the fall of 1972 I first heard the term &quot;olefin metathesis&quot; from
 Earl Muetterties, who remained interested in the subject after
 he moved to Cornell in the summer of 1973. I started to follow
 the metathesis literature and began to suspect that the new alkylidene
 complexes that I discovered in 1973 might be relevant to that process,
 even though tantalum was not a known catalyst for olefin metathesis.</p>

 <p>I was impressed by the high oxidation state chemistry of osmium
 imido complexes being carried out by <a href="/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/index.html">K.
 Barry Sharpless</a> at MIT
 and invited him to DuPont to give a talk, probably in late 1974. 
 He was excited about the potential of the new alkylidene compounds
 I had discovered. He and several others at MIT pushed for an offer
 from MIT, which came in the spring of 1975. I accepted, even though
 I took a cut in salary. I do not recall salary being much of an
 issue. MIT fulfilled my dream of obtaining an academic position
 at a top institution. I looked forward to exploring tantalum chemistry
 further and teaching. Nancy and I moved to Brighton (part of Boston) in August
 of 1975. While I pushed ahead with research at MIT, Nancy added a master's degree
 in art history to her graduate degree in library science and learned bookbinding
 through an apprenticeship.</p>

 <p>I was fortunate to obtain support from the National Science Foundation
 early in my career at MIT and to build a group of ten students
 by the end of my third year. I could not have been happier. High
 oxidation state organometallic chemistry developed rapidly, thanks
 to the talented students and support for them from the National
 Science Foundation. By 1980 we had transferred the principles behind
 tantalum chemistry to tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium, and had
 shown what type of tungsten species would metathesize olefins. 
 By the mid 1980's we had developed what I call well-defined
 catalysts for both the olefin and acetylene metathesis reactions
 that contained sterically protecting imido and/or alkoxide ligands. 
 I became interested in dinitrogen chemistry around 1980, and polymer
 chemistry (first ring-opening metathesis polymerization and later
 olefin and acetylene polymerization) a few years after that. In
 the mid 1990's I began a fruitful collaboration with Amir
 H. Hoveyda on asymmetric metathesis reactions and their applications
 to organic chemistry, which was and still is supported by the National
 Institutes of Health. With support of the NIH I also was able to
 achieve in 2003 a long sought goal for hundreds of researchers
 over a period of 40 years, the catalytic reduction of dinitrogen
 with protons and electrons at room temperature and pressure. It
 turns out that a single molybdenum center within a properly designed
 protective ligand is sufficient. Time will tell whether these findings
 are relevant to how dinitrogen is reduced to ammonia in nature
 on a huge scale by nitrogenase enzymes.</p>

</p>
 <p>My son Andrew was born in 1978 and Eric in 1981. The family became
 too large for the house in Brighton so in 1983 we moved to Winchester, Massachusetts,
   where we slowly renovated a 1904 Arts and Crafts style house. A bindery on
   the third floor allowed Nancy to practice book conservation while our sons
   were growing up. Half the basement became my woodworking shop; the other half
   became at various stages a cub scout den, a teenage getaway, and later a finishing
   room for items built in my shop.</p>

 <p>In 1997 Nancy accepted a position as the Chief Collections Conservator
 of the Harvard College Libraries in Widener Library at Harvard
 University; in the summer of 2006 she will return to the MIT Libraries
 as the Thomas F. Peterson, Jr., Conservator of the Special Collections. 
 With the children on their own we enlarged the kitchen/living area
 in 2000 and in the process expanded the basement, adding another
 room for woodworking and a small wine cellar. We enjoy cooking
 together in the new kitchen and gardening on our manageable 1/4
 acre lot.</p>

 <p>As of 2006 I have published approximately 425 papers and have
 trained ~65 graduate students and ~75 postdoctoral students. I
 still find the process of unlocking nature's secrets an enormously
 satisfying profession and hope to be fortunate enough to continue
 to practice it for some time.</p>
