  <h2>Toward Human Unity or Beyond Nationalism</h2>

  <p>It is natural to try to understand one's
  own time and to seek to analyse the forces that move it. The
  future will be determined in part by happenings that it is
  impossible to foresee; it will also be influenced by trends that
  are now existent and observable. We speculate as to what is in
  store for us. But we not only undergo events, we in part cause
  them or at least influence their course. We have not only to
  study them but to act. Especially is this true as regards peace
  in the future. The question whether the long effort to put an end
  to war can succeed without another major convulsion challenges
  not only our minds but our sense of responsibility.</p>

  <p>As to judging our own time, and thereby
  gaining some basis for a judgment of future possibilities, we are
  doubtless not only too close to it to appraise it but too much
  formed by it and enclosed within it to do so. Nevertheless, while
  we wait for the future social historian, we can make some
  provisional observations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>I. Characteristics of the Present Period</h3>

  <p>We seem to distinguish at least certain
  characteristics of our period. Without attempting to list them
  all, we note the following:</p>

  <p>(A) This is a period of change. Probably
  people always feel that they are living in a time of transition,
  but we can hardly be mistaken perhaps in thinking that this is an
  era of particularly momentous change, rapid and proceeding at an
  ever quickening rate. This change is traceable to many causes. A
  major one which no one can overlook is technological and based on
  inventions and discoveries which have altered the whole basis of
  production and deeply affected social relations. This great
  change which began with the inventions of machinery in the late
  eighteenth century doubtless is not closed with the development
  of atomic energy. The change from peasant agriculture and
  handicraft to machinery is a main dividing line in human
  history.</p>

  <p>Another cause of change, one less
  noticeable but fundamental, is the modern growth of population
  closely connected with scientific and medical discoveries. It is
  interesting that the United Nations has set up a special
  Commission to study this question<a href=
  "#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>A third and sufficiently obvious cause of
  change is the impact of the series of terrible wars that have
  recently afflicted mankind. The First World War, and especially
  the latest one, largely swept away what was left in Europe of
  feudalism and of feudal landlords, especially in Poland, Hungary,
  and the South East generally. These wars appear also to have
  given its death blow to colonialism and to imperialism in its
  colonial form, under which weaker peoples were treated as
  possessions to be economically exploited. At least we hope that
  such colonialism is on the way out. What will be the conditions
  of so-called "satellite countries" we cannot yet know.</p>

  <p>These wars also greatly altered the
  relative standing of the leading countries. The role of Italy and
  of Austria has diminished as has that of France and Britain;
  Germany and Japan have suffered catastrophically. Meanwhile
  Russia and America have increased in stature. The world looks
  with interest to see what may come out of Asia, with a new India
  and (one hopes) a new China; and also out of Australia. While
  Europe is hard hit and lies at the moment almost prostrate, there
  is on the horizon promise of a long needed integration which, if
  it succeeds, may mean a new European Epoch in which she will
  remain "a mother of culture" and no longer be also a "mother of
  wars".</p>

  <p>In a plastic period like this it seems as
  though anything could happen. Such a time is hard on those who
  lack resilience and capacity to readjust themselves, and on those
  who depend for their inner stability on accustomed conditions and
  old habits. On the other hand, it has immense appeal for the
  adventurous. Those who are rooted in the depths that are eternal
  and unchangeable and who rely on unshakeable principles, face
  change full of courage, courage based on faith.</p>

  <p>(B) A second characteristic of our time is
  the prevalence of nationalism. This is still spreading, affecting
  new communities, more peripheral regions and so-called backward
  peoples. Like all great movements it has its good and its bad
  sides. As the particularism of the feudal Middle Ages in Europe
  was outgrown, great national states united men in larger and more
  reasonably constituted units than those brought together by
  inheritance and conquest. Politically it was, insofar, a cohesive
  and constructive force. In its cultural and romantic aspects,
  also, there is in it much that is precious especially in the
  fields of literature, art, and folklore in its widest sense. On
  the other hand, nationalism has proved excessively dangerous in
  its divisiveness and its self-adulation. It has given us an
  anarchic world of powerful armed bodies, with traditions steeped
  in conquest and military glory, and of competing commercial
  peoples as ruthless in their economic self-seeking as in their
  wars. It has given us a considerable number of states, each
  claiming complete and unlimited sovereignty, living side by side
  without being integrated in any way or under any curb, governed
  by an uneasy balance of power manipulated by diplomatic
  maneuvering, based not on principles accepted by all but on
  reasons of state, recognizing no common religious or ethical
  control nor any accepted rules of conduct and united by no common
  purpose. At the same time they are, alas, furnished with vastly
  increased powers of physical destruction and with the latest and
  most dreadful of modern weapons - psychological control of men's
  minds through the arts of propaganda and "thought control", by
  means of censorship and otherwise.</p>

  <p>This divided condition of a nationalistic
  world is in marked contrast to the relative universalism of
  various earlier historical periods. We recall for instance the
  eighteenth-century <i>&eacute;claircissement</i> when human reason
  and gentle manners were exalted and the French language was the
  joint possession of civilized people.</p>

  <p>We recall the universalism of the Christian
  Middle Ages which recognized one dogma, one authoritative church
  commanding large revenues, and one language for all who could
  read and write.</p>

  <p>We recall still earlier the period of the
  great Roman peace, with one classic tradition, one political
  model, and one literary medium.</p>

  <p>The dangers of this divided nationalist
  world have been experienced, they have been studied and
  investigated, but it has been easier to see the need of some new
  way of uniting the peoples than to realize it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>II. Unifying Trends</h3>

  <p>It is, however, easy to exaggerate the
  degree to which modern peoples are divided and unrelated. Without
  a common loyalty to either a state or a church they have
  nevertheless a vast deal in common. This brings us to a new
  division of our subject - an effort to analyse some of the trends
  which run like common threads through the unorganised mass of the
  population of the world.</p>

  <p>(1) First let us consider the urge toward
  liberty. In the shape of revolt from alien domination and of
  demand for independence this has been a major shaping force in
  modern history. The desire for liberty has also made itself felt
  as struggle against domestic tyranny or arbitrary rule.</p>

  <p>At the same time, liberty, as a personal
  ideal, as a revolt against authority in the realm of ideas, has
  enriched men's minds and strengthened their character and
  self-dependence. It has been a great current of fresh air
  quickening the atmosphere. The sense that freedom, in this sense,
  is a supreme value for the individual, a necessity for advance
  and growth, is not shared by all peoples; the acceptance or
  refusal of this ideal of freedom is perhaps the deepest cleft
  between the communist and non-communist worlds.</p>

  <p>At the same time it is fair to realize that
  it is not easy to be consistent. "Founding fathers" of the
  American Republic were able to say that men were born equal and
  at the same time uphold Negro slavery. Men who are scandalized at
  the lack of freedom in Russia do not ask themselves how real is
  liberty among the poor, the weak, and the ignorant in capitalist
  society. In the same way men who are aghast at what they call
  "wage slavery" tolerate in their social system the hideous
  infringement on human personality of a totalitarian police
  state.</p>

  <p>(2) Democracy is a second ideal widely
  influential throughout our whole modern world. Doubtless the word
  has different meanings to different people. We say that to the
  Russians "democratic" means favourable to the Soviet system and
  that to the Western peoples it means friendly to the
  parliamentary form of government. There is nevertheless a basic
  area of common meaning in spite of the fact that each is
  concerned with a different aspect of one immensely challenging
  and difficult ideal. They both mean by a democratic system one
  which serves the interest of all men alike and not that of
  privileged persons, and one in which the ultimate power is in the
  hands of the entire population and wielded in their name, a
  society in which inequities and inequalities are reduced to a
  minimum. May we not say that this democracy was the aim of both
  Lenin and Lincoln<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>, though in
  different forms and in vastly different settings?</p>

  <p>(3) A third ideal that has made its way in
  the modern world is reliance on reason, especially reason
  disciplined and enriched by modern science. An eternal basis of
  human intercommunication is reason. "Come let us reason
  together." Modern science, and not least modern psychology, is a
  powerful solvent of ideas and superstitions and prejudices that
  keep men apart, and a scientific code has been evolved which is
  at once a tool and a commandment. It demands honest objectivity,
  scrupulously clean of any influence except the desire for the
  truth. (This does not mean of course that all men of science are
  free from all bias.) One of the most alarming of modern
  developments has been the rise in Nazi Germany and now, to some
  extent at least, in Russia, of the belief that political
  expediency, not truth, must guide research and that loyalty is
  owed not to truth but to a preaccepted dogma. Yet even so,
  science is a very real bond.</p>

  <p>(4) A fourth element of the one world in
  which we more and more consciously live is a growing humaneness,
  a revolt against all avoidable suffering, a new concern for
  social welfare in all its aspects. This motive has increased in
  both Christian and non-Christian communities. One of its most
  striking manifestations was the revolt against chattel slavery
  and slave trading<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a> which led to
  international repudiation of these abuses. Another aspect was the
  effort to humanize the conditions of labour, at first within the
  national framework, beginning with the earliest factory
  legislation in England<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and later
  internationally, especially through the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1969/index.html">ILO</a><a href=
  "#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> and through trade union action.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to do more than allude to
  the growth of the assistance offered in time of catastrophe and
  at all times to the poor, the needy, the sick, the delinquent.
  The Red Cross, the Save the Children work<a href=
  "#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>, in which Scandinavian countries have
  been so active - these and many other movements constitute strong
  and sensitive ties which tend to make one society of all the
  people of the world. It looks as though the systematic assistance
  proposed in the Marshall Plan to help Europe to recover
  economically<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a> after the shock of
  the war, might be the means of knitting Europe together as it has
  never been before.</p>

  <p>(5) Another thing - men are everywhere
  becoming less "private-minded". There is a growing community
  sense. It is as though the urge which found expression in
  monasteries and nunneries in the Middle Ages were finding new
  expression. In the political field this consciousness of the
  common interest and of the rich possibilities of common action
  has embodied itself in part in the great movements toward
  economic democracy, cooperation, democratic socialism, and
  communism. I am sure we make a great mistake if we underrate the
  element of unselfish idealism in these historic movements which
  are today writing history at such a rate.</p>

  <p>A dark and terrible side of this sense of
  community of interests is the fear of a horrible common destiny
  which in these days of atomic weapons darkens men's minds all
  around the globe. Men have a sense of being subject to the same
  fate, of being all in the same boat. But fear is a poor motive to
  which to appeal, and I am sure that "peace people" are on a wrong
  path when they expatiate on the horrors of a new world war. Fear
  weakens the nerves and distorts the judgment. It is not by fear
  that mankind must exorcise the demon of destruction and cruelty,
  but by motives more reasonable, more humane, and more heroic.</p>

  <p>(6) Another very interesting trend which it
  is not easy to classify is the growing repudiation of coercion,
  especially of violent or physical coercion. This is related to
  the championship of liberty, especially to respect for the
  liberty of others; it is related to the growth of compassion and
  helpfulness, but it is distinct. I think it is not yet rated at
  its full value and that it is to have a very deep
  significance.</p>

  <p>In this regard there has been an
  astonishing silent revolution unorganised and spontaneous.
  Consider as an aspect of this the relation of husband and wife,
  in which the idea of authority and coercion has given way to the
  ideal of a relation quite free from these elements. The "Doll's
  House" is gone or going<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>. In the
  relation of parents and children a parallel change has come
  about, perhaps even more strikingly. In education, reliance on
  fear has been abandoned and reliance on rivalry and competition
  is increasingly repudiated. In the treatment of crime the best
  practice is directed not toward punishment but toward
  re-education. In the political structure likewise every effort is
  made to replace coercion by consent.</p>

  <p>The most dramatic exponent of this refusal
  of violence is the great-souled Indian Gandhi<a href=
  "#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>. He gave his life trying to find ways to
  oppose domination and coercion without resort to hate or
  violence.</p>

  <p>(7) In listing these tendencies making for
  a new world, we must not forget developments in the religious or
  spiritual thinking and feeling of mankind, where also we feel a
  strong unifying trend. There is a revulsion from dogmatic creeds
  and from the sectarianism of Protestant Christianity. There is a
  great interest in comparative religion and a desire to understand
  faiths other than our own and even to experiment with exotic
  cults. There is a tolerance which (where it is not mere apathy
  and indifference) means unwillingness to force one's belief,
  however precious it seems to oneself, on others. Where our
  forbears not so long ago held that those who did not accept the
  correct faith were bound for literal hell fire, we feel the
  development of a new spiritual climate. The Christian reads
  Rabindranath <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1913/index.html">Tagore</a><a href=
  "#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and the Hindu Gandhi reads the Sermon
  on the Mount, and wise men from every quarter of the globe
  discuss their differences fraternally and humbly.</p>

  <p>I have been much interested in Professor
  Ernest Hocking's book <i>Living Religions and a World
  Faith</i><a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>, in which he tries to
  chart the wide, and widening, area of religious agreement across
  religious frontiers.</p>

  <p>(8) I have no idea of making a
  comprehensive list of unifying tendencies and can barely refer to
  one of the master qualities of our common human endowment, desire
  for beauty - desire to perceive and, above all, to create beauty.
  Art in its myriad forms - music, literature, architecture,
  sculpture, painting, and handicraft - endows mankind, at least
  potentially, with common treasures in words or colour or
  harmonies, which modern technical inventions, from photography to
  radio, tend to spread without limit.</p>

  <p>(9) We have been speaking of forces making
  for unity mainly on a psychological level. But an influence which
  is not ideological so much as practical and external is of
  absolutely prime importance. I refer to the technical advances
  which are so rapidly and widely remaking the world.
  Industrialization based on machinery, already referred to as a
  characteristic of our age, is but one aspect of the revolution
  that is being wrought by technology. Under modern conditions our
  physical setting tends towards sameness. More and more we have
  the same trains and the same airplanes, the same bathrooms and
  the same picture galleries, the same hospitals, the same food,
  and the same fashion in clothes. These develop the same habits
  and with these the same ideas and same mind set. To take a tiny
  example, a population where everyone has a watch is deeply
  affected in the way it conducts its activities, economic and
  social, by this simple fact. Technology gives us the facilities
  that lessen the barriers of time and distance - the telegraph and
  cable, the telephone, radio, and the rest. But technology is a
  tool, not a virtue. It may be used for good or bad ends, and
  bringing men closer does not make them love one another unless
  they prove lovable. Multiplying contacts can mean multiplying
  points of friction.</p>

  <p>(10) Dissemination. Under modern conditions
  the spreading of ideas, of hard-won knowledge, of achieved beauty
  goes on unceasingly and is largely spontaneous. There is also an
  endless network of organized cooperation among specialists in
  every field, through learned societies, technical journals,
  exhibitions, literary reviews, all of which tends to make
  accessible to all whatever has been created or learned.</p>

  <p>"Movements" too, of all sorts, universalize
  themselves in the same way by a natural osmosis and by deliberate
  propaganda.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>III. Divisive Trends</h3>

  <p>Considering much that tends toward the
  unity of mankind, we have noted such matters as liberty,
  democracy, humaneness, public spirit, repudiation of coercion and
  violence, spiritual universalism, common cultural treasures,
  sameness of physical environment and habits, technical control of
  time and space, and the tendency to universalize both
  achievements and ideas.</p>

  <p>In thinking of trends to unify mankind, we
  must face squarely, without underrating them, all that tends to
  the contrary, tends to divide men, to separate and hold them
  apart, to array them consciously and passionately against one
  another. Not only democracy and the cult of humaneness mark our
  age, but also greed, violence, the self-adulation of national and
  racial groups, the fanaticism of political cults like fascism or
  nazism, the glorification of might and power for their own sake,
  the blind reliance on violence as that before which all idealism
  is but a dissolving mist. All these things we know only too
  well.</p>

  <p>We have lived through the flood time of
  fascism and of the nazism which ran its meteoric course at a cost
  to mankind in suffering and waste beyond all computation. These
  ideas are not yet as dead as they may appear on the surface, as
  we know.</p>

  <p>Totalitarianism is another force that seems
  still to be gaining ground. It may be due partly to the urge for
  effective and rapid political techniques and impatience of
  political democracy with its often provokingly slow and fumbling
  processes. It may be due largely to cynicism regarding liberalism
  and individualism in the economic process. It seems, however, to
  be emphatically on the wrong path.</p>

  <p>A most dangerous aspect of totalitarianism
  is that which is typified in the phrase "the iron curtain", the
  endeavour to shut off the contagion of the ideas that are now
  interpenetrating the rest of the world. It is hard to believe
  that the natural spread of ideas and experiences can be cut off
  either totally or for a very long time.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>IV. Both Unifying and Differentiating Forces Needed, but Not
  War</h3>

  <p>We know so well these things that divide us
  that it has seemed useful to stop and sort out and examine more
  especially threads that run through society drawing it
  together.</p>

  <p>We must not be discouraged that the threads
  of our social texture cross one another. We must remember that
  nothing can be woven out of threads that all run the same way.
  This figure of speech can easily be abused - I only want to point
  out that differences as well as likenesses are inevitable,
  essential, and desirable. An <i>unchallenged</i> belief or idea
  is on the way to death and meaninglessness.</p>

  <p>That these clashes of ideals and purposes
  should take the form of war is, however, intolerable. Indeed in
  the light of all that mankind has achieved and desired it seems
  almost incomprehensible that it is today so largely occupied in
  preparing for war in more hideous forms than ever before. Huge
  sums of money and treasures of human cleverness and industry are
  invested in inventing new and more ghastly poisons, methods of
  disseminating diseases and perfecting instruments of destruction
  instantaneous and almost unlimited.</p>

  <p>The attempt to put an end to war is a
  special and urgent task which we must solve and solve soon. It is
  a necessary complement to the forces that are bringing men closer
  together if these are to prevail over those that divide men into
  hostile camps.</p>

  <p>The ideas that men share and the needs that
  they all feel, need a suitable organ. They need an institutional
  body to make them effective. The nation created the national
  state. The world community must create a political expression for
  itself.</p>

  <p>This is the subject of the second part of
  this discourse.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Second Part</h3>

  <p>We come, then, to the second part of this
  topic, the effort to organize world society.</p>

  <p>Many individuals and many movements have
  directed efforts to this end. They form a considerable part of
  the whole body of work for peace, though not the whole of it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>The Peace Movement</h3>

  <p>The peace movement or the movement to end
  war has been fed by many springs and has taken many forms. It has
  been carried on mainly by private unofficial organizations,
  local, national, and international. I would say that peace
  workers or pacifists have dealt mainly with two types of issue,
  the moral or individual, and the political or institutional. As a
  type of the former we may take those who are now generally known
  specifically as pacifists. Largely on religious or ethical
  grounds they repudiate violence and strive to put friendly and
  constructive activity in its place.</p>

  <p>There has been personal refusal of war
  service on grounds of conscience on a large scale and at great
  personal cost by thousands of young men called up for military
  service. While many people fail to understand and certainly do
  not approve their position, I believe that it has been an
  invaluable witness to the supremacy of conscience over all other
  considerations and a very great service to a public too much
  affected by the conception that might makes right. It is
  interesting that at the Nuremberg war guilt trials the court
  refused to accept the principle that a man is absolved from
  responsibility for an act by the fact that it was ordered by his
  superiors or his government. This is a legal affirmation of a
  principle that conscientious objectors maintain in action.</p>

  <p>It is to me surprising that the repudiation
  of the entire theory and practice of conscription has not found
  expression in a wider and more powerful movement drawing strength
  from the widespread concern for individual liberty. We are
  horrified at many slighter infringements of individual freedom,
  far less terrible than this. But we are so accustomed to
  conscription that we take it for granted. A practical and
  political form of opposition to conscription is the proposal,
  first put forward, so far as I know, by an American woman,
  Dorothy Detzer, long secretary of the United States Section of
  the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom<a href=
  "#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>. She urged something that suggests the
  Kellogg Pact but is quite specific, namely a multilateral treaty
  between governments to renounce the use of conscription. A bill
  to this effect is now in the United States Congress but attracts
  little attention.</p>

  <p>I feel it rather surprising also that
  refusal of war has never taken the form, on any large scale, of
  refusal to pay taxes for military use, a refusal which would have
  involved not only young men but (and mainly) older men and women,
  holders of property.</p>

  <p>Peace work of this first type relies mainly
  on education. The work done and now being done to educate men's
  minds against war and for peace is colossal, and can only be
  referred to.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is under this head that the
  Nobel Foundation and the work of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1905/index.html">Bertha von Suttner</a><a href=
  "#not13"><sup>13</sup></a> should be listed; for this the world,
  and not alone the beneficiaries, must be grateful.</p>

  <p>The other type of "peace" activity is
  political, specifically aiming to affect governmental or other
  action on concrete issues. For instance, peace organizations
  criticized the terms of the Peace Treaties made at Versailles and
  (in America at least) opposed the demand for unconditional
  surrender in the Second World War.</p>

  <p>The Women's International League for Peace
  and Freedom (with which I have long been connected) has worked
  both as an international body and in its national sections from
  1915 till now, and I trust will long do so, in the political
  field of policies affecting peace, though not alone on the
  political level. Among its strongest supporters have always been
  Scandinavian women. I am presenting to the Nobel library, if I
  may, a brief history of this organization, <i>A Venture in
  Internationalism</i>, a pamphlet now out of print and
  consequently rare.</p>

  <p>The form of work for peace which has most
  obviously made history is the long continued effort to create
  some form of world organization which should both prevent wars
  and foster international cooperation.</p>

  <p>The efforts to secure peace by creating a
  comprehensive organ have been many and varied. One of the most
  curious was the confederation of certain tribes of Iroquois
  Indians in America known as "The Six Nations". One of the
  earliest was the ancient Amphictyonic Council in Greece. There
  has been a long series of schemes, each more or less premature
  and utopian, but each making its own contribution, from those of
  Sully and William Penn and Kant to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html">Woodrow Wilson</a> and his
  co-workers and successors<a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>.
  Wilson did not live to see the League of Nations established, nor
  did his own country ever join it. At present there is a tendency
  to underrate its importance. I, for one, would not for a great
  deal lose out of my life my years in Geneva during the first
  springtime of the hopes and activities of the League of
  Nations.</p>

  <p>As we know only too well, the, League of
  Nations, lacking Russia and the United States, was not
  sufficiently inclusive. Also when the pinch came, different
  governments proved unready to make the sacrifices or face the
  risks involved in effective opposition to imperialism in Japan,
  reaction in Spain, fascism in Italy, or nazism in Germany.</p>

  <p>The new institution, the United Nations,
  has some marked advantages over its predecessors. Its origin was
  the work, not of a small group of statesmen mainly preoccupied
  with elaborating the treaties of Versailles and the rest, but was
  worked out in careful preliminary discussion, first at Dumbarton
  Oaks, then at San Francisco<a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a>, by
  a comprehensive group of countries which included, this time, the
  United States and Russia, though not the Axis powers, and which
  owes an immense debt to President Franklin Roosevelt. It has the
  experience of the League of Nations to draw upon, and the Second
  World War offers it useful warnings. With less of a flush of
  idealism, hopefulness, and confidence than the League of Nations
  enjoyed in its early days, it is soberer, and Norway has given it
  in Trygve Lie<a href="#not16"><sup>16</sup></a> a
  secretary-general who inspires confidence and hope.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it suffers from
  handicaps that the League of Nations did not. Most serious of
  all, unlike the League of Nations, it is called upon to begin its
  active life before the peace treaties are complete. Germany and
  Austria and Japan are still occupied. A war settlement is a
  problem that, as has been said, "evokes all the appetites". The
  world is not even technically at peace; an agreement has not yet
  been reached on the absolutely crucial question of Germany. The
  United Nations is moreover faced with the necessity for immediate
  decision and action on several peculiarly poignant and
  complicated problems in Greece, in Palestine, in Korea, and
  elsewhere. Still more it operates in a world half wrecked by the
  destruction of war on an unimagined scale. We are more or less
  used to famine in India and China (though I suppose it is as
  painful there as nearer home). Now we see Europe herself hungry,
  collectively and separately, covered with masses of broken
  rubble, charred timber, and vast fields that carry white crosses
  instead of grain. Production and trade are so deeply affected
  that their reconstruction presents problems which would be almost
  insuperable even if they were not complicated by political
  difficulties. At the same time there is extraordinarily bitter
  ideological and nationalistic opposition between the Soviet
  Union, with its friends, and the Western democracies, so that two
  great powers, or blocs of powers, face one another in mutual
  suspicion and fear.</p>

  <p>That the new world organization has done as
  well as it has under such circumstances is surprising. Indeed the
  fact that it has actually been set up and is actually functioning
  is, if you think of it, a miracle.</p>

  <p>But its testing time is not yet passed. In
  the crucial matter of national disarmament and organization of
  collective security forces, either as constabulary or as
  military, it has made no obvious progress. In regard to the
  throat gripping problem of effectively controlling the use of
  atomic energy it is stalled by what seem on the surface like
  trivial differences as to how to proceed. The still uglier
  menaces of bacteriological warfare and other abusive uses of
  scientific knowledge are not, so far as I know, even under
  discussion.</p>

  <p>This failure to equip itself with force has
  led to a widespread impatience, and one of the most striking
  recent developments in the peace field is a widespread and eager
  demand for actual world government. One must feel great interest
  in this growing movement. It is doing important service in
  educating people to the need of limiting national sovereignty -
  of sacrificing national self-will and national
  self-determination, as far as may be necessary, for the sake of
  the will and purpose of the all-inclusive human group.</p>

  <p>But this movement has also its very real
  dangers. Insofar as it leads to depreciation of the United
  Nations and to the growth of a certain cynicism in regard to it,
  it must be deplored. My hesitations go further than this,
  however. I see governments as a peculiar historical type of
  organization which is not necessarily the last word in human
  wisdom. We have, I believe, yet much to learn, possibly from
  China, Russia, India, and from the Montesquieus of the future as
  to possible political forms. Do not let us force our young and
  still plastic world organization prematurely into old and rigid
  molds.</p>

  <p>Governments seem to have a bad inheritance
  behind them. They are dangerous because we personify them and
  idealize them and because they are tainted with lust for power
  and with much too great concern for prestige. Above all, they are
  the final depository of the power of physical coercion which is
  elsewhere more and more discarded. What is a government? It is
  what owns and operates armies and navies, and polices and taxes
  subjects. (As for taxes they are all right as long as they are
  for right objects and in right measure, and people in general, I
  suspect, are not taxed nearly enough quite as often as too
  much.)</p>

  <p>Sometimes what is meant by "world
  government" is a body modelled more or less closely on the Swiss
  or American pattern, with its executive and legislative branches
  and its judiciary. Sometimes the idea is a much more modest one,
  and what is proposed is merely a delegation of strictly limited
  powers to a central authority with especial view to the control
  of aggression and prevention of war. There is what seems to me a
  rather naive hope that the dangerous possibility of having to
  discipline a nation which refuses to abide by international
  legislation can be circumvented by directing coercive action
  against individuals not governments. In 1939 what individual
  would have been singled out for discipline if not Hitler? And
  would an attempt to discipline Hitler not have meant fighting a
  great people in arms?</p>

  <p>I admit the critical importance of
  organizing collective security against violence and aggression,
  and certainly a highly important function of the United Nations,
  as of the League of Nations, is to prevent situations out of
  which "shooting wars" develop, and, finally, to control by
  collective action aggression by the ill-disposed or wrongly led.
  Up to date no adequate solution has been achieved. Conceivably
  possible, conceivably adequate and effective are non-military
  controls, moral pressure, collective political pressure,
  collective economic pressure through so-called economic sanctions
  of many kinds and, finally, organized police methods and armed
  constabulary forces of a non-military type. Yet such methods are
  apparently being little studied.</p>

  <p>Disarmament, so fundamental to a really
  peaceful world, certainly does not look near or even nearer than
  it was.</p>

  <p>Yet, important as are the methods of
  preventing aggression, curbing violence, and creating collective
  security, which are the special field of the Security Council, I
  regret that there is not more vivid public interest in the other
  aspects of world organization, especially in the growth of world
  cooperation in different fields. This functional approach to
  world unity seems to hold very great promise. The organization of
  such cooperation comes not as the expression of a theory but as
  an answer to felt needs. It is the direction in which the United
  Nations is making growth spontaneously in response to the
  pressure of realities and the call to get together on common
  business that needs to be attended to. The list of the special
  commissions and other agencies already at work is long and is
  destined to be longer. Besides those in the field of security,
  there are those dealing with Labour, Trade, Transportation, Civil
  Aviation, Communications, International Law, Banking and Money,
  Human Rights, the Status of Women, Food and Agriculture, Health,
  Control of Epidemics, Refugees and Displaced Persons, Education,
  Science and Culture (with innumerable subdivisions), Trusteeship,
  the enormous question of Population, Statistics, and so on.</p>

  <p>Thomas Carlyle used to talk of "organic
  filaments" and in the cooperative organs of the United Nations we
  seem to see the time-spirit weaving a web of the peoples and
  creating, we hope, an unbreakable fabric binding all together by
  the habit of common work for common ends.</p>

  <p>The administrative aspect of the United
  Nations also seems to have great possibilities of development,
  and international administration is in this context one form of
  cooperation.</p>

  <p>The administrative function of the United
  Nations is up to now chiefly exerted in the form of
  trusteeships<a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a>. This idea of
  political trusteeship is one of the relatively rare inventions in
  the political field. It is curious that while inventions in the
  technological field, in the arts of dealing with matter, are so
  numerous and effective, men are so relatively poor in inventions
  for dealing with one another. The Greeks gave us public
  assemblies, the British their representative parliaments and
  parliamentary government. Switzerland and the United States
  created federal patterns of government combining centralization
  with decentralization. But on the whole the list is a meagre one
  and one of the latest of these, modern propaganda, is a sinister
  and portentous development of legitimate education of public
  opinion.</p>

  <p>The conception of the public trustee,
  whether an individual or a body, may prove a fruitful political
  idea. In the United States, hospitals, colleges, all sorts of
  undertakings for the public welfare are largely carried on by
  boards of trustees entrusted with their administration, and they
  have an honourable record of devotion to their trust. The same
  man, who, trading in Wall Street, prides himself on his skill in
  making money, conceives of himself when he finds himself trusted
  to carry on a public service, as a public servant, and devotes
  his ability no longer to making money for himself but to the
  welfare of the park, or the research foundation, or other matter
  with which he now identifies himself.</p>

  <p>But colonies are not the only field for
  possible international administration. It is greatly to be
  deplored that aviation, so international by its very nature, has
  thus far developed along lines of private and competing business.
  It is a thousand pities that it evolved too early, or world
  organization too late, for it to grow up from the start as the
  common business of the peoples of the world. This would have had
  an enormous influence on the character of war and on its control
  as well as on international intercourse. Atomic power likewise
  demands international administration, and it is at least
  recognized that this is so.</p>

  <p>The world of waters, the international
  waterways of the globe, are as yet unpreempted. Until yesterday
  Britannia ruled the waves, and her place has not yet been taken
  in this regard. Why should not the United Nations now create a
  supreme authority over both the "ocean seas" and the channels and
  canals, artificial and natural, which are of peculiar importance
  and create peculiar political problems?</p>

  <p>To suggest but one instance, the
  internationalization of the Dardanelles under properly equipped
  world authority would take the poison out of one of the "hottest"
  spots on the political map.</p>

  <p>The uninhabited Polar areas are another
  area that seems peculiarly fitted for international
  administration under the United Nations. They are now largely
  unappropriated, and the claimants and rivalries there are
  continually getting more numerous and more clamorous.</p>

  <p>It is to be hoped that at the next General
  Assembly some government will get these two matters put on the
  agenda and ask to have two special commissions appointed to study
  the Polar and maritime problems and make recommendations.</p>

  <p>World organization of a functional and not
  a governmental type is also beginning on the cultural level. If
  UNESCO<a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a> has not yet fully found
  itself, that is because the potentialities that lie before it in
  the field of science, music, art, religion, and education are so
  vast and as yet so undefined. Here what is wanted is not so much
  administration as contact, consultation, cooperation.</p>

  <p>If UNESCO succeeds, as it well may, in
  securing the general adoption of a universal auxiliary language,
  such as the International Language Association is now engaged in
  selecting and elaborating, it will be the dawn of a new day in
  literature such as the world has hardly dreamed of. None of the
  natural languages will be tampered with, reformed, or cut down to
  a restricted base. But all men who can read and write may command
  an idiom universally understood. This will not only be an
  enormous advantage in business, in travel, and in all sorts of
  practical ways. Far more important will be its service in the
  world of ideas. Poets and the great writers will have open to
  them a reading public including not only all European and
  American peoples but the Chinese, the Arabs, the island peoples,
  and the people of Africa, who may yet make a great contribution.
  Music and mathematics already command a universal notation not
  yet available for the expression of thought. Such a public for
  the printed and spoken word, comparable to that for music, would
  give an immense impetus to world literature.</p>

  <p>In such a world all war would be civil war,
  and we must hope that it will grow increasingly inconceivable. It
  has already become capable of such unlimited destruction and such
  fearful possibilities of uncontrollable and little understood
  "chain reactions" of all sorts that it would seem that no one not
  literally insane could decide to start an atomic war.</p>

  <p>I have spoken against fear as a basis for
  peace. What we ought to fear, especially we Americans, is not
  that someone may drop atomic bombs on us but that we may allow a
  world situation to develop in which ordinarily reasonable and
  humane men, acting as our representatives, may use such weapons
  in our name. We ought to be resolved beforehand that no
  provocation, no temptation shall induce us to resort to the last
  dreadful alternative of war.</p>

  <p>May no young man ever again be faced with
  the choice between violating his conscience by cooperating in
  competitive mass slaughter or separating himself from those who,
  endeavouring to serve liberty, democracy, humanity, can find no
  better way than to conscript young men to kill.</p>

  <p>As the world community develops in peace,
  it will open up great untapped reservoirs in human nature. Like a
  spring released from pressure would be the response of a
  generation of young men and women growing up in an atmosphere of
  friendliness and security, in a world demanding their service,
  offering them comradeship, calling to all adventurous and forward
  reaching natures.</p>

  <p>We are not asked to subscribe to any utopia
  or to believe in a perfect world just around the comer. We are
  asked to be patient with necessarily slow and groping advance on
  the road forward, and to be ready for each step ahead as it
  becomes practicable. We are asked to equip ourselves with
  courage, hope, readiness for hard work, and to cherish large and
  generous ideals.</p>
