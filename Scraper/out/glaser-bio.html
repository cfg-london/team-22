  <h1>Donald A. Glaser - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="glaser.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Donald Arthur Glaser</b> was born in
  Cleveland, Ohio, on September 21, 1926, the son of William J.
  Glaser, a businessman, and his wife Lena. He received his early
  education in the public schools of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and
  took his B.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics at the Case
  Institute of Technology in 1946. His first original research is
  described in his bachelor's thesis and consists of an electron
  diffraction study of the properties of thin metallic films
  evaporated onto crystalline metal substrates.<br>
  <br>
  After serving as a teacher of mathematics at the Case Institute of
  Technology during the spring of 1946, he began his graduate
  study at the California Institute of Technology in the autumn of
  the same year, finishing his Ph.D. work in the autumn of 1949,
  and receiving his degree in physics and mathematics officially in
  1950. His doctoral thesis research was an experimental study of
  the momentum spectrum of high energy cosmic ray and mesons at sea
  level.<br>
  <br>
  Glaser began his career of full-time teaching and research in the
  Physics Department of the University of Michigan in the autumn of 1949, being
  promoted to the rank of Professor in 1957. In 1959 he became
  Professor of Physics at the University of California, at Berkeley. His
  main research interest during this period was the elementary
  particles of physics, particularly the strange particles. He
  examined various experimental techniques that seemed useful in
  this research and constructed a number of diffusion cloud
  chambers and parallel-plate spark counters before finally
  beginning to develop the ideas that led to the invention of the
  bubble chamber in 1952. Since then he has worked on the
  development of various types of bubble chambers for experiments
  in high energy nuclear physics, besides carrying out experiments
  on elementary particles at the Cosmotron of the Brookhaven National
  Laboratory in New York and the Bevatron of the Lawrence
  Radiation Laboratory in California. These experiments gave
  information on the lifetimes, decay modes, and spins of the
  <font face="Symbol">L</font>&deg; hyperon, K&deg; meson and
  <font face="Symbol">S</font>&deg; hyperon as well as
  differential cross-sections for the production of those particles
  by pions.<br>
  <br>
  Other experiments yielded information on pion-proton scattering,
  parity violation in non-leptonic hyperon decay, and the branching
  ratios in positive K meson decay.<br>
  <br>
  All these experiments and technical developments of the past six
  years were carried out in collaboration with a number of his
  thesis students and colleagues at the University of Michigan and
  the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked from
  1959. Among his associates in research were J. Brown, H. Bryant,
  R. Burnstein, <a href="../1980/index.html">J. Cronin</a>, C.
  Graves, R. Hartung, J. Kadyk, D. Meyer, M. Perl, D. Rahm, B. Roe,
  L. Roellig, D. Sinclair, G. Trilling, J. van der Velde, J. van
  Putten and T. Zipf.<br>
  <br>
  These researches were supported originally by the University of
  Michigan and later by the National Science Foundation of the
  United States and the United States Atomic Energy
  Commission.<br>
  <br>
  Glaser has received many honours for his work, among which can be
  mentioned the Henry Russell Award of the University of Michigan,
  1953, for distinction and promise in teaching and research; the
  Charles Vernon Boys Prize of the Physical Society, London, in
  1958, for distinction in experimental physics; the American Physical
  Society Prize (sponsored by the Hughes Aircraft Company) for
  his contributions to experimental physics in 1959; and the award,
  in the same year, of the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by
  the Case Institute of Technology.<br>
  <br>
  1960, the year in which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for
  Physics, also saw Professor Glaser's marriage to Miss Ruth Bonnie
  Thompson.</p>
  <p>He has two children by his first marriage, Louise Ferris Glaser, a pediatrician,
    and William Thompson Glaser, CEO of a computer-related company. The family
    now includes four granddaughters. In 1975 he married Lynn Bercovitz, a painter and musician. 
    They reside in Berkeley, California.</p>
