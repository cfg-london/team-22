  <h1>James Chadwick - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="chadwick.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>James Chadwick</b> was born
  in Cheshire, England, on 20th October, 1891, the son of John
  Joseph Chadwick and Anne Mary Knowles. He attended Manchester
  High School prior to entering Manchester University in 1908; he
  graduated from the Honours School of Physics in 1911 and spent
  the next two years under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/index.html">Professor (later Lord)
  Rutherford</a> in the Physical Laboratory in Manchester, where he
  worked on various radioactivity problems, gaining his M.Sc.
  degree in 1913. That same year he was awarded the 1851 Exhibition
  Scholarship and proceeded to Berlin to work in the Physikalisch
  Technische Reichsanstalt at Charlottenburg under Professor H.
  Geiger.<br>
  <br>
  During World War I, he was interned in the Zivilgefangenenlager,
  Ruhleben. After the war, in 1919, he returned to England to
  accept the Wollaston Studentship at Gonville and Caius
  College, Cambridge, and to resume work under Rutherford, who
  in the meantime had moved to the Cavendish Laboratory,
  Cambridge. Rutherford had succeeded that year in
  disintegrating atoms by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles,
  with the emission of a proton. This was the first artificial
  nuclear transformation. In Cambridge, Chadwick joined Rutherford
  in accomplishing the transmutation of other light elements by
  bombardment with alpha particles, and in making studies of the
  properties and structure of atomic nuclei.<br>
  <br>
  He was elected Fellow of Gonville and Caius College (1921-1935)
  and became Assistant Director of Research in the Cavendish
  Laboratory (1923). In 1927 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
  Society.<br>
  <br>
  In 1932, Chadwick made a fundamental discovery in the domain of
  nuclear science: he proved the existence of <i>neutrons</i> -
  elementary particles devoid of any electrical charge. In contrast
  with the helium nuclei (alpha rays) which are charged, and
  therefore repelled by the considerable electrical forces present
  in the nuclei of heavy atoms, this new tool in atomic
  disintegration need not overcome any electric barrier and is
  capable of penetrating and splitting the nuclei of even the
  heaviest elements. Chadwick in this way prepared the way towards
  the fission of uranium 235 and towards the creation of the atomic
  bomb. For this epoch-making discovery he was awarded the Hughes
  Medal of the Royal Society in 1932, and subsequently the Nobel
  Prize for Physics in 1935.<br>
  <br>
  He remained at Cambridge until 1935 when he was elected to the
  Lyon Jones Chair of Physics in the University of
  Liverpool. From 1943 to 1946 he worked in the United States
  as Head of the British Mission attached to the Manhattan Project
  for the development of the atomic bomb. He returned to England
  and, in 1948, retired from active physics and his position at
  Liverpool on his election as Master of Gonville and Caius
  College, Cambridge. He retired from this Mastership in 1959. From
  1957 to 1962 he was a parttime member of the United Kingdom
  Atomic Energy Authority.<br>
  <br>
  Chadwick has had many papers published on the topic of
  radioactivity and connected problems and, with Lord Rutherford
  and C. D. Ellis, he is co-author of the book <i>Radiations from
  Radioactive substances</i> (1930).<br>
  <br>
  Sir James was knighted in 1945. Apart from the Hughes Medal
  (Royal Society) mentioned above, he received the Copley Medal
  (1950) and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia (1951). He
  is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics and, in
  addition to receiving honorary doctorate degrees from the
  Universities
  of Reading, Dublin, Leeds, Oxford, Birmingham, Montreal (McGill), Liverpool, and
  Edinburgh, he
  is a member of several foreign academies, being Associ&eacute; oft
  he Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Belgique; Foreign Member of the
  Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab and the Koninklijke
  Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen; Corresponding Member of
  the S&auml;chsische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Leipzig; Member
  of the Pontificia Academia Scientiarum and the Franklin
  Institute; Honorary Member of the American Philosophical Society
  and the American
  Physical Society.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925, he married Aileen Stewart-Brown of Liverpool. They have
  twin daughters, and live at Denbigh, North Wales. His hobbies
  include gardening and fishing.</p>
