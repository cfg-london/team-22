  <h1>Wangari Maathai - Biographical</h1>
       
<p><img src="maathai.jpg" class="bio-img">Wangari Muta Maathai was born in Nyeri, Kenya (Africa) in 1940. The first
woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. Wangari Maathai
obtained a degree in Biological Sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College
in Atchison, Kansas (1964). She subsequently earned a Master of Science degree
from the University of Pittsburgh (1966). She pursued doctoral studies in
Germany and the University of Nairobi, obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the
University of Nairobi where she also taught veterinary anatomy. She became
chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in
1976 and 1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain
those positions in the region. Wangari Maathai was active in the National
Council of Women of Kenya in 1976-87 and was its chairman in 1981-87. It
was while she served in the National Council of Women that she introduced
the idea of planting trees with the people in 1976 and continued to develop
it into a broad-based, grassroots organization whose main focus is the planting
of trees with women groups in order to conserve the environment and improve
their quality of life. However, through the Green Belt Movement she has
assisted women in planting more than 20 million trees on their farms and on
schools and church compounds.</p>
              <p>In 1986, the Movement established a Pan African Green Belt Network and
has exposed over 40 individuals from other African countries to the approach.
Some of these individuals have established similar tree planting initiatives in
their own countries or they use some of the Green Belt Movement methods
to improve their efforts. So far some countries have successfully launched
such initiatives in Africa (Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia,
Zimbabwe, etc). In September 1998, she launched a campaign of the Jubilee
2000 Coalition. She has embarked on new challenges, playing a leading global
role as a co-chair of the Jubilee 2000 Africa Campaign, which seeks cancellation
of the unpayable backlog debts of the poor countries in Africa by the year
2000. Her campaign against land grabbing and rapacious allocation of forests
land has caught the limelight in the recent past.</p>
              <p>Wangari Maathai is internationally recognized for her persistent struggle
for democracy, human rights and environmental conservation. She has addressed
the UN on several occasions and spoke on behalf of women at special sessions
of the General Assembly for the five-year review of the earth summit. She served
on the commission for Global Governance and Commission on the Future.
She and the Green Belt Movement have received numerous awards, most
notably The 2004 Nobel Peace Prize. Others include The Sophie Prize (2004),
The Petra Kelly Prize for Environment (2004), The Conservation Scientist
Award (2004), J. Sterling Morton Award (2004), WANGO Environment Award
(2003), Outstanding Vision and Commitment Award (2002), Excellence
Award from the Kenyan Community Abroad (2001), Golden Ark Award (1994),

Award for the Environment (1988), Better World Society Award (1986), Right

environmental arena. Professor Maathai has also received honorary doctoral
