  <h1>Alfred Werner - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="werner.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Alfred Werner</b>, son of factory
  foreman J.A. Werner and his wife Jeanne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tesche,
  was born on December 12, 1866, at M&uuml;lhausen in Alsace, where
  he went to school. While he was at school he showed an interest
  in chemistry and did, when he was only 18, his first independent
  chemical research.<br>
  <br>
  From 1885 until 1886 he did his military service in Karlsruhe
  and, during this, attended the lectures of Engler at the
  Technical High School in that city. In 1886 he attended lectures
  at the Federal Technical High School at Zurich and in 1889
  obtained there the Diploma in Technical Chemistry. During his
  studies there he was much influenced by Professor A.
  Hantzsch.<br>
  <br>
  In 1889 he was appointed Assistant in Professor Lunge's
  laboratory at the Zurich Technical High School and he then began
  to cooperate with Professor Hantzsch in research. In 1890 he took
  his degree in the University of Zurich with a thesis on the spatial
  arrangements of the atoms in molecules containing nitrogen.<br>
  <br>
  From 1890 until 1891 he did further work on this subject and
  visited Paris, where he worked under Professor Berthelot at the
  Coll&egrave;ge de France. In 1892 he returned to Zurich as a
  lecturer in the Technical High School, and in 1893 he was
  appointed Associate Professor in the University of Zurich, to
  succeed Victor Merz and then gave the University lectures on
  organic chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  In 1895 he became, when he was only 29 years old, Professor of
  Chemistry in the University, giving the lectures on organic
  chemistry until, in 1902, he took over the lectures on inorganic
  chemistry as well. In 1895 he was acquired Swiss nationality and
  though he was offered posts at Vienna, Basle and Wurzburg, he
  declined these, preferring to remain in Zurich.<br>
  <br>
  Werner's name will always be associated with the theory of
  coordination which he established and with his work on the
  spatial relationships of atoms in the molecule, the foundations
  of which were laid in the work he did, when he was only 24, for
  his doctorate thesis in 1892. In this work he formulated the idea
  that, in the numerous compounds of tervalent nitrogen, the three
  valence bonds of the nitrogen atom are directed towards the three
  corners of a tetrahedron, the fourth corner of this being
  occupied by the nitrogen atom. In 1891 he had published a paper
  on the theory of affinity and valence, in which he substituted
  for Kekul&eacute;'s conception of constant valence, the idea that
  affnity is an attractive force exerted from the centre of the
  atom which acts uniformly towards all parts of the surface of the
  atom.<br>
  <br>
  In 1893 he stated, in a paper on mineral compounds, his theory of
  variable valence, according to which inorganic molecular
  compounds contain single atoms which act as central nuclei around
  which are arranged a definite number of other atoms, radicals or
  other molecules in a simple, spatial, geometric pattern. The
  figure which expresses the number of atoms thus grouped round a
  central nucleus was called by Werner the coordination number, the
  most important of these coordination numbers being 3, 4, 6 and 8,
  the number 6 occurring especially often. Thousands of molecular
  compounds correspond to the number 6 type, and in the majority of these there is a central atom with coordinated atoms at the corners of
  an octahedron.<br>
  <br>
  For the next 20 years Werner and his collaborators studied and
  prepared new series of molecular compounds and studied their
  configurations, publishing many papers on them, 150 of which were
  by himself. Finally, his work culminated in the discovery of
  optically-active isomers of the complexes studied, the existence
  of which had been forecast by his hypothesis. More than 40 series
  of optically-active complexes with octahedral symmetry were
  separated in optically-active forms, with the result that the
  spatial configuration of the complexes to the coordination number
  6 was established as firmly as that of the tetrahedral carbon
  atom of <a href="../1901/index.html">van 't Hoff</a> and Le
  Bel.<br>
  <br>
  Werner also worked on complexes with other coordination numbers,
  especially 4, for which the form can be tetrahedral or a plane
  square. As Paul Pfeiffer, in his account of Werner's work
  published in <i>Great Chemists</i> (1961, Edited by Eduard
  Farber, Interscience, New York) remarks the coordination theory
  of Werner extended throughout the whole range of systematic
  inorganic chemistry and into organic chemistry as well. For his
  work on it Werner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for
  1913.<br>
  <br>
  Werner was corresponding member of the Royal Society of Sciences
  (K&ouml;nigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften) at
  G&ouml;ttingen and of the Physico-Medical Society
  (Physikalisch-medizinische Soziet&auml;t) of Erlangen. He held an
  honorary doctorate of the University of Geneva, and was an
  Honorary Member of the Society of Physics and Natural History in
  the same town, of the Physical Association (Physikalischer
  Verein) of Frankfurt/Main, of the German Bunsengesellschaft, of
  the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Vaudoise des Sciences Naturelles at
  Lausanne, and of the Chemical Society of London. He was also a
  permanent member of the Imperial Society of Friends of Natural
  History, Anthropology and Ethnography of Moscow. France conferred
  upon him the Leblanc Medal of its Societe Chimique and the
  distinction of Officier de l'Instruction Publique.<br>
  <br>
  Werner was a very sociable man, whose recreations were billiards,
  chess and the Swiss card game, Jass. He spent his holidays among
  the mountains and travelled much to attend scientific meetings
  outside Switzerland. As a lecturer he was a convincing and
  enthusiastic speaker with a gift for clear explanations of
  difficult problems. Among his pupils were such distinguished men
  as Jantsch, <a href="../1937/index.html">Karrer</a> and Pfeiffer.
  Valuable for others were his books <i>Neuere Anschauungen auf dem
  Gebiete der anorganischen Chemie</i> (New ideas in inorganic
  chemistry) and <i>Lehrbuch der Stereochemie</i> (Textbook of
  stereochemistry), both published in 1904.<br>
  <br>
  In 1894, Werner married Emma Giesker of Zurich, a member of a
  German family. They had one son, Alfred, and one daughter,
  Charlotte.<br>
  <br>
  In 1913, the year in which he received the Nobel Prize for
  Chemistry, he was already suffering from arteriosclerosis and by
  1915 this had compelled him to give up his general lectures on
  chemistry and in 1919 he had to give up his Professorship. On
  November 15, 1919, he died at the early age of 53.</p>
