  <h2><br>The Quest for Peace and Justice</h2>

  <p>It is impossible to begin this lecture
  without again expressing my deep appreciation to the Nobel
  Committee of the Norwegian Parliament for bestowing upon me and
  the civil rights movement in the United States such a great
  honor. Occasionally in life there are those moments of
  unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by
  those symbols called words. Their meaning can only be articulated
  by the inaudible language of the heart. Such is the moment I am
  presently experiencing. I experience this high and joyous moment
  not for myself alone but for those devotees of nonviolence who
  have moved so courageously against the ramparts of racial
  injustice and who in the process have acquired a new estimate of
  their own human worth. Many of them are young and cultured.
  Others are middle aged and middle class. The majority are poor
  and untutored. But they are all united in the quiet conviction
  that it is better to suffer in dignity than to accept segregation
  in humiliation. These are the real heroes of the freedom
  struggle: they are the noble people for whom I accept the Nobel
  Peace Prize.</p>

  <p>This evening I would like to use this lofty
  and historic platform to discuss what appears to me to be the
  most pressing problem confronting mankind today. Modern man has
  brought this whole world to an awe-inspiring threshold of the
  future. He has reached new and astonishing peaks of scientific
  success. He has produced machines that think and instruments that
  peer into the unfathomable ranges of interstellar space. He has
  built gigantic bridges to span the seas and gargantuan buildings
  to kiss the skies. His airplanes and spaceships have dwarfed
  distance, placed time in chains, and carved highways through the
  stratosphere. This is a dazzling picture of modern man's
  scientific and technological progress.</p>

  <p>Yet, in spite of these spectacular strides
  in science and technology, and still unlimited ones to come,
  something basic is missing. There is a sort of poverty of the
  spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and
  technological abundance. The richer we have become materially,
  the poorer we have become morally and spiritually. We have
  learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but
  we have not learned the simple art of living together as
  brothers.</p>

  <p>Every man lives in two realms, the internal
  and the external. The internal is that realm of spiritual ends
  expressed in art, literature, morals, and religion. The external
  is that complex of devices, techniques, mechanisms, and
  instrumentalities by means of which we live. Our problem today is
  that we have allowed the internal to become lost in the external.
  We have allowed the means by which we live to outdistance the
  ends for which we live. So much of modern life can be summarized
  in that arresting dictum of the poet Thoreau<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>: "Improved means to an unimproved
  end". This is the serious predicament, the deep and haunting
  problem confronting modern man. If we are to survive today, our
  moral and spiritual "lag" must be eliminated. Enlarged material
  powers spell enlarged peril if there is not proportionate growth
  of the soul. When the "without" of man's nature subjugates the
  "within", dark storm clouds begin to form in the world.</p>

  <p>This problem of spiritual and moral lag,
  which constitutes modern man's chief dilemma, expresses itself in
  three larger problems which grow out of man's ethical
  infantilism. Each of these problems, while appearing to be
  separate and isolated, is inextricably bound to the other. I
  refer to racial injustice, poverty, and war.</p>

  <p>The first problem that I would like to
  mention is racial injustice. The struggle to eliminate the evil
  of racial injustice constitutes one of the major struggles of our
  time. The present upsurge of the Negro people of the United
  States grows out of a deep and passionate determination to make
  freedom and equality a reality "here" and "now". In one sense the
  civil rights movement in the United States is a special American
  phenomenon which must be understood in the light of American
  history and dealt with in terms of the American situation. But on
  another and more important level, what is happening in the United
  States today is a relatively small part of a world
  development.</p>

  <p>We live in a day, says the philosopher
  Alfred North Whitehead<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>,"when
  civilization is shifting its basic outlook: a major turning point
  in history where the presuppositions on which society is
  structured are being analyzed, sharply challenged, and profoundly
  changed." What we are seeing now is a freedom explosion, the
  realization of "an idea whose time has come", to use Victor
  Hugo's phrase<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The deep
  rumbling of discontent that we hear today is the thunder of
  disinherited masses, rising from dungeons of oppression to the
  bright hills of freedom, in one majestic chorus the rising masses
  singing, in the words of our freedom song, "Ain't gonna let
  nobody turn us around."<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> All
  over the world, like a fever, the freedom movement is spreading
  in the widest liberation in history. The great masses of people
  are determined to end the exploitation of their races and land.
  They are awake and moving toward their goal like a tidal wave.
  You can hear them rumbling in every village street, on the docks,
  in the houses, among the students, in the churches, and at
  political meetings. Historic movement was for several centuries
  that of the nations and societies of Western Europe out into the
  rest of the world in "conquest" of various sorts. That period,
  the era of colonialism, is at an end. East is meeting West. The
  earth is being redistributed. Yes, we are "shifting our basic
  outlooks".</p>

  <p>These developments should not surprise any
  student of history. Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed
  forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself.
  The Bible tells the thrilling story of how Moses stood in
  Pharaoh's court centuries ago and cried, "Let my people
  go."<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> This is a kind of
  opening chapter in a continuing story. The present struggle in
  the United States is a later chapter in the same unfolding story.
  Something within has reminded the Negro of his birthright of
  freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be
  gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by
  the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, and with his black brothers of Africa and
  his brown and yellow brothers in Asia, South America, and the
  Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of
  great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, some significant strides have
  been made in the struggle to end the long night of racial
  injustice. We have seen the magnificent drama of independence
  unfold in Asia and Africa. Just thirty years ago there were only
  three independent nations in the whole of Africa. But today
  thirty-five African nations have risen from colonial bondage. In
  the United States we have witnessed the gradual demise of the
  system of racial segregation. The Supreme Court's decision of
  1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools gave a legal and
  constitutional deathblow to the whole doctrine of separate but
  equal<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>. The Court decreed
  that separate facilities are inherently unequal and that to
  segregate a child on the basis of race is to deny that child
  equal protection of the law. This decision came as a beacon light
  of hope to millions of disinherited people. Then came that
  glowing day a few months ago when a strong Civil Rights Bill
  became the law of our land<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
  This bill, which was first recommended and promoted by President
  Kennedy, was passed because of the overwhelming support and
  perseverance of millions of Americans, Negro and white. It came
  as a bright interlude in the long and sometimes turbulent
  struggle for civil rights: the beginning of a second emancipation
  proclamation providing a comprehensive legal basis for equality
  of opportunity. Since the passage of this bill we have seen some
  encouraging and surprising signs of compliance. I am happy to
  report that, by and large, communities all over the southern part
  of the United States are obeying the Civil Rights Law and showing
  remarkable good sense in the process.</p>

  <p>Another indication that progress is being
  made was found in the recent presidential election in the United
  States. The American people revealed great maturity by
  overwhelmingly rejecting a presidential candidate who had become
  identified with extremism, racism, and retrogression<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>. The voters of our nation rendered
  a telling blow to the radical right<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>. They defeated those elements in
  our society which seek to pit white against Negro and lead the
  nation down a dangerous Fascist path.</p>

  <p>Let me not leave you with a false
  impression. The problem is far from solved. We still have a long,
  long way to go before the dream of freedom is a reality for the
  Negro in the United States. To put it figuratively in biblical
  language, we have left the dusty soils of Egypt and crossed a Red
  Sea whose waters had for years been hardened by a long and
  piercing winter of massive resistance. But before we reach the
  majestic shores of the Promised Land, there is a frustrating and
  bewildering wilderness ahead. We must still face prodigious
  hilltops of opposition and gigantic mountains of resistance. But
  with patient and firm determination we will press on until every
  valley of despair is exalted to new peaks of hope, until every
  mountain of pride and irrationality is made low by the leveling
  process of humility and compassion; until the rough places of
  injustice are transformed into a smooth plane of equality of
  opportunity; and until the crooked places of prejudice are
  transformed by the straightening process of bright-eyed
  wisdom.</p>

  <p>What the main sections of the civil rights
  movement in the United States are saying is that the demand for
  dignity, equality, jobs, and citizenship will not be abandoned or
  diluted or postponed. If that means resistance and conflict we
  shall not flinch. We shall not be cowed. We are no longer
  afraid.</p>

  <p>The word that symbolizes the spirit and the
  outward form of our encounter is <i>nonviolence</i>, and it is
  doubtless that factor which made it seem appropriate to award a
  peace prize to one identified with struggle. Broadly speaking,
  nonviolence in the civil rights struggle has meant not relying on
  arms and weapons of struggle. It has meant noncooperation with
  customs and laws which are institutional aspects of a regime of
  discrimination and enslavement. It has meant direct participation
  of masses in protest, rather than reliance on indirect methods
  which frequently do not involve masses in action at all.</p>

  <p>Nonviolence has also meant that my people
  in the agonizing struggles of recent years have taken suffering
  upon themselves instead of inflicting it on others. It has meant,
  as I said, that we are no longer afraid and cowed. But in some
  substantial degree it has meant that we do not want to instill
  fear in others or into the society of which we are a part. The
  movement does not seek to liberate Negroes at the expense of the
  humiliation and enslavement of whites. It seeks no victory over
  anyone. It seeks to liberate American society and to share in the
  self-liberation of all the people.</p>

  <p>Violence as a way of achieving racial
  justice is both impractical and immoral. I am not unmindful of
  the fact that violence often brings about momentary results.
  Nations have frequently won their independence in battle. But in
  spite of temporary victories, violence never brings permanent
  peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and
  more complicated ones. Violence is impractical because it is a
  descending spiral ending in destruction for all. It is immoral
  because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his
  understanding: it seeks to annihilate rather than convert.
  Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than
  love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It
  leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends
  up defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and
  brutality in the destroyers.</p>

  <p>In a real sense nonviolence seeks to redeem
  the spiritual and moral lag that I spoke of earlier as the chief
  dilemma of modern man. It seeks to secure moral ends through
  moral means. Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon. Indeed,
  it is a weapon unique in history, which cuts without wounding and
  ennobles the man who wields it.</p>

  <p>I believe in this method because I think it
  is the only way to reestablish a broken community. It is the
  method which seeks to implement the just law by appealing to the
  conscience of the great decent majority who through blindness,
  fear, pride, and irrationality have allowed their consciences to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>The nonviolent resisters can summarize
  their message in the following simple terms: we will take direct
  action against injustice despite the failure of governmental and
  other official agencies to act first. We will not obey unjust
  laws or submit to unjust practices. We will do this peacefully,
  openly, cheerfully because our aim is to persuade. We adopt the
  means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with
  itself. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our words
  fail, we will try to persuade with our acts. We will always be
  willing to talk and seek fair compromise, but we are ready to
  suffer when necessary and even risk our lives to become witnesses
  to truth as we see it.</p>

  <p>This approach to the problem of racial
  injustice is not at all without successful precedent. It was used
  in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might
  of the British Empire and free his people from the political
  domination and economic exploitation inflicted upon them for
  centuries. He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul
  force, non-injury, and courage<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In the past ten years unarmed gallant men
  and women of the United States have given living testimony to the
  moral power and efficacy of nonviolence. By the thousands,
  faceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and white,
  have temporarily left the ivory towers of learning for the
  barricades of bias. Their courageous and disciplined activities
  have come as a refreshing oasis in a desert sweltering with the
  heat of injustice. They have taken our whole nation back to those
  great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding
  fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the
  Declaration of Independence. One day all of America will be proud
  of their achievements<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I am only too well aware of the human
  weaknesses and failures which exist, the doubts about the
  efficacy of nonviolence, and the open advocacy of violence by
  some. But I am still convinced that nonviolence is both the most
  practically sound and morally excellent way to grapple with the
  age-old problem of racial injustice.</p>

  <p>A second evil which plagues the modern
  world is that of poverty. Like a monstrous octopus, it projects
  its nagging, prehensile tentacles in lands and villages all over
  the world. Almost two-thirds of the peoples of the world go to
  bed hungry at night. They are undernourished, ill-housed, and
  shabbily clad. Many of them have no houses or beds to sleep in.
  Their only beds are the sidewalks of the cities and the dusty
  roads of the villages. Most of these poverty-stricken children of
  God have never seen a physician or a dentist. This problem of
  poverty is not only seen in the class division between the highly
  developed industrial nations and the so-called underdeveloped
  nations; it is seen in the great economic gaps within the rich
  nations themselves. Take my own country for example. We have
  developed the greatest system of production that history has ever
  known. We have become the richest nation in the world. Our
  national gross product this year will reach the astounding figure
  of almost 650 billion dollars. Yet, at least one-fifth of our
  fellow citizens - some ten million families, comprising about
  forty million individuals - are bound to a miserable culture of
  poverty. In a sense the poverty of the poor in America is more
  frustrating than the poverty of Africa and Asia. The misery of
  the poor in Africa and Asia is shared misery, a fact of life for
  the vast majority; they are all poor together as a result of
  years of exploitation and underdevelopment. In sad contrast, the
  poor in America know that they live in the richest nation in the
  world, and that even though they are perishing on a lonely island
  of poverty they are surrounded by a vast ocean of material
  prosperity. Glistening towers of glass and steel easily seen from
  their slum dwellings spring up almost overnight. Jet liners speed
  over their ghettoes at 600 miles an hour; satellites streak
  through outer space and reveal details of the moon. President
  Johnson, in his State of the Union Message<a href=
  "#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, emphasized this contradiction
  when he heralded the United States' "highest standard of living
  in the world", and deplored that it was accompanied by
  "dislocation; loss of jobs, and the specter of poverty in the
  midst of plenty".</p>

  <p>So it is obvious that if man is to redeem
  his spiritual and moral "lag", he must go all out to bridge the
  social and economic gulf between the "haves" and the "have nots"
  of the world. Poverty is one of the most urgent items on the
  agenda of modern life.</p>

  <p>There is nothing new about poverty. What is
  new, however, is that we have the resources to get rid of it.
  More than a century and a half ago people began to be disturbed
  about the twin problems of population and production. A
  thoughtful Englishman named Malthus wrote a book<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> that set forth some rather
  frightening conclusions. He predicted that the human family was
  gradually moving toward global starvation because the world was
  producing people faster than it was producing food and material
  to support them. Later scientists, however, disproved the
  conclusion of Malthus, and revealed that he had vastly
  underestimated the resources of the world and the resourcefulness
  of man.</p>

  <p>Not too many years ago, Dr. Kirtley Mather,
  a Harvard geologist, wrote a book entitled <i>Enough and to
  Spare</i><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>. He set forth
  the basic theme that famine is wholly unnecessary in the modern
  world. Today, therefore, the question on the agenda must read:
  Why should there be hunger and privation in any land, in any
  city, at any table when man has the resources and the scientific
  know-how to provide all mankind with the basic necessities of
  life? Even deserts can be irrigated and top soil can be replaced.
  We cannot complain of a lack of land, for there are twenty-five
  million square miles of tillable land, of which we are using less
  than seven million. We have amazing knowledge of vitamins,
  nutrition, the chemistry of food, and the versatility of atoms.
  There is no deficit in human resources; the deficit is in human
  will. The well-off and the secure have too often become
  indifferent and oblivious to the poverty and deprivation in their
  midst. The poor in our countries have been shut out of our minds,
  and driven from the mainstream of our societies, because we have
  allowed them to become invisible. Just as nonviolence exposed the
  ugliness of racial injustice, so must the infection and sickness
  of poverty be exposed and healed - not only its symptoms but its
  basic causes. This, too, will be a fierce struggle, but we must
  not be afraid to pursue the remedy no matter how formidable the
  task.</p>

  <p>The time has come for an all-out world war
  against poverty. The rich nations must use their vast resources
  of wealth to develop the underdeveloped, school the unschooled,
  and feed the unfed. Ultimately a great nation is a compassionate
  nation. No individual or nation can be great if it does not have
  a concern for "the least of these". Deeply etched in the fiber of
  our religious tradition is the conviction that men are made in
  the image of God and that they are souls of infinite metaphysical
  value, the heirs of a legacy of dignity and worth. If we feel
  this as a profound moral fact, we cannot be content to see men
  hungry, to see men victimized with starvation and ill health when
  we have the means to help them. The wealthy nations must go all
  out to bridge the gulf between the rich minority and the poor
  majority.</p>

  <p>In the final analysis, the rich must not
  ignore the poor because both rich and poor are tied in a single
  garment of destiny. All life is interrelated, and all men are
  interdependent. The agony of the poor diminishes the rich, and
  the salvation of the poor enlarges the rich. We are inevitably
  our brothers' keeper because of the interrelated structure of
  reality. John Donne interpreted this truth in graphic terms when
  he affirmed<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">No man is an Iland, intire of its selfe:
    every<br>
    man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the<br>
    maine: if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea,<br>
    Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie<br>
    were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends<br>
    or of thine owne were: any mans death<br>
    diminishes me, because I am involved in<br>
    Mankinde: and therefore never send to know<br>
    for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A third great evil confronting our world is
  that of war. Recent events have vividly reminded us that nations
  are not reducing but rather increasing their arsenals of weapons
  of mass destruction. The best brains in the highly developed
  nations of the world are devoted to military technology. The
  proliferation of nuclear weapons has not been halted, in spite of
  the Limited Test Ban Treaty<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. On the contrary, the detonation
  of an atomic device by the first nonwhite, non- Western, and
  so-called underdeveloped power, namely the Chinese People's
  Republic<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>, opens new vistas
  of exposure of vast multitudes, the whole of humanity, to
  insidious terrorization by the ever-present threat of
  annihilation. The fact that most of the time human beings put the
  truth about the nature and risks of the nuclear war out of their
  minds because it is too painful and therefore not "acceptable",
  does not alter the nature and risks of such war. The device of
  "rejection" may temporarily cover up anxiety, but it does not
  bestow peace of mind and emotional security.</p>

  <p>So man's proneness to engage in war is
  still a fact. But wisdom born of experience should tell us that
  war is obsolete. There may have been a time when war served as a
  negative good by preventing the spread and growth of an evil
  force, but the destructive power of modern weapons eliminated
  even the possibility that war may serve as a negative good. If we
  assume that life is worth living and that man has a right to
  survive, then we must find an alternative to war. In a day when
  vehicles hurtle through outer space and guided ballistic missiles
  carve highways of death through the stratosphere, no nation can
  claim victory in war. A so-called limited war will leave little
  more than a calamitous legacy of human suffering, political
  turmoil, and spiritual disillusionment. A world war - God forbid!
  - will leave only smoldering ashes as a mute testimony of a human
  race whose folly led inexorably to ultimate death. So if modern
  man continues to flirt unhesitatingly with war, he will transform
  his earthly habitat into an inferno such as even the mind of
  Dante could not imagine.</p>

  <p>Therefore, I venture to suggest to all of
  you and all who hear and may eventually read these words, that
  the philosophy and strategy of nonviolence become immediately a
  subject for study and for serious experimentation in every field
  of human conflict, by no means excluding the relations between
  nations. It is, after all, nation-states which make war, which
  have produced the weapons which threaten the survival of mankind,
  and which are both genocidal and suicidal in character.</p>

  <p>Here also we have ancient habits to deal
  with, vast structures of power, indescribably complicated
  problems to solve. But unless we abdicate our humanity altogether
  and succumb to fear and impotence in the presence of the weapons
  we have ourselves created, it is as imperative and urgent to put
  an end to war and violence between nations as it is to put an end
  to racial injustice. Equality with whites will hardly solve the
  problems of either whites or Negroes if it means equality in a
  society under the spell of terror and a world doomed to
  extinction.</p>

  <p>I do not wish to minimize the complexity of
  the problems that need to be faced in achieving disarmament and
  peace. But I think it is a fact that we shall not have the will,
  the courage, and the insight to deal with such matters unless in
  this field we are prepared to undergo a mental and spiritual
  reevaluation - a change of focus which will enable us to see that
  the things which seem most real and powerful are indeed now
  unreal and have come under the sentence of death. We need to make
  a supreme effort to generate the readiness, indeed the eagerness,
  to enter into the new world which is now possible, "the city
  which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God"<a href=
  "#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>We will not build a peaceful world by
  following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not
  wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We
  must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but
  on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating
  little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about
  Ulysses and the Sirens. The Sirens had the ability to sing so
  sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their
  island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot
  home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be
  embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses,
  determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie
  himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed
  their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better
  way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer
  Orpheus whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens.
  When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens?</p>

  <p>So we must fix our vision not merely on the
  negative expulsion of war, but upon the positive affirmation of
  peace. We must see that peace represents a sweeter music, a
  cosmic melody that is far superior to the discords of war.
  Somehow we must transform the dynamics of the world power
  struggle from the negative nuclear arms race which no one can win
  to a positive contest to harness man's creative genius for the
  purpose of making peace and prosperity a reality for all of the
  nations of the world. In short, we must shift the arms race into
  a "peace race". If we have the will and determination to mount
  such a peace offensive, we will unlock hitherto tightly sealed
  doors of hope and transform our imminent cosmic elegy into a
  psalm of creative fulfillment.</p>

  <p>All that I have said boils down to the
  point of affirming that mankind's survival is dependent upon
  man's ability to solve the problems of racial injustice, poverty,
  and war; the solution of these problems is in turn dependent upon
  man squaring his moral progress with his scientific progress, and
  learning the practical art of living in harmony. Some years ago a
  famous novelist died. Among his papers was found a list of
  suggested story plots for future stories, the most prominently
  underscored being this one: "A widely separated family inherits a
  house in which they have to live together." This is the great new
  problem of mankind. We have inherited a big house, a great "world
  house" in which we have to live together - black and white,
  Easterners and Westerners, Gentiles and Jews, Catholics and
  Protestants, Moslem and Hindu, a family unduly separated in
  ideas, culture, and interests who, because we can never again
  live without each other, must learn, somehow, in this one big
  world, to live with each other.</p>

  <p>This means that more and more our loyalties
  must become ecumenical rather than sectional. We must now give an
  overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the
  best in our individual societies.</p>

  <p>This call for a worldwide fellowship that
  lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and
  nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and
  unconditional love for all men. This oft misunderstood and
  misinterpreted concept so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of
  the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an
  absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love
  I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response which is
  little more than emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force
  which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme
  unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks
  the door which leads to ultimate reality. This
  Hindu-Moslem-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate
  reality is beautifully summed up in the First Epistle of Saint
  John<a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">Let us love one another: for love is of God;
    and everyone<br>
    that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
    He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br>
    If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His<br>
    love is perfected in us.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Let us hope that this spirit will become
  the order of the day. As Arnold Toynbee<a href=
  "#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a> says: "Love is the ultimate force
  that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the
  damning choice of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our
  inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last
  word." We can no longer afford to worship the God of hate or bow
  before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made
  turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. History is cluttered
  with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this
  self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solution of
  the problems of the world.</p>

  <p>Let me close by saying that I have the
  personal faith that mankind will somehow rise up to the occasion
  and give new directions to an age drifting rapidly to its doom.
  In spite of the tensions and uncertainties of this period
  something profoundly meaningful is taking place. Old systems of
  exploitation and oppression are passing away, and out of the womb
  of a frail world new systems of justice and equality are being
  born. Doors of opportunity are gradually being opened to those at
  the bottom of society. The shirtless and barefoot people of the
  land are developing a new sense of "some-bodiness" and carving a
  tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of despair. "The people
  who sat in darkness have seen a great light."<a href=
  "#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a> Here and there an individual or
  group dares to love, and rises to the majestic heights of moral
  maturity. So in a real sense this is a great time to be alive.
  Therefore, I am not yet discouraged about the future. Granted
  that the easygoing optimism of yesterday is impossible. Granted
  that those who pioneer in the struggle for peace and freedom will
  still face uncomfortable jail terms, painful threats of death;
  they will still be battered by the storms of persecution, leading
  them to the nagging feeling that they can no longer bear such a
  heavy burden, and the temptation of wanting to retreat to a more
  quiet and serene life. Granted that we face a world crisis which
  leaves us standing so often amid the surging murmur of life's
  restless sea. But every crisis has both its dangers and its
  opportunities. It can spell either salvation or doom. In a dark
  confused world the kingdom of God may yet reign in the hearts of
  men.</p>
