  Abraham Waksman</b> was born in Priluka, near Kiev, Russia, on
  July 22nd, 1888, as the son of Jacob Waksman and Fradia London.
  He received his early education primarily from private tutors,
  and completed his school training in Odessa in an evening school
  and with private tutors. He obtained his matriculation diploma in
  1910 from the Fifth Gymnasium in Odessa as an extern, and left
  for the United States immediately afterwards.<br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1911 he entered Rutgers
  College, having won a State Scholarship the previous spring.
  He received his B.Sc. degree in Agriculture from Rutgers in 1915.
  He was then appointed research assistant in soil bacteriology
  under Dr. J. G. Lipman at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment
  Station, and was allowed to continue graduate work at Rutgers,
  obtaining his M.Sc. degree in 1916. In the same year, he became a
  naturalized United States citizen and was appointed a Research
  Fellow at the University of California where he received his
  Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1918.<br>
  <br>
  He was invited by Dr. Lipman to return to Rutgers, where he
  received an appointment as microbiologist at the Experiment
  Station and as Lecturer in Soil Microbiology at the University.
  He was appointed Associate Professor in 1925 and Professor in
  1930. When the Department of Microbiology was organized in 1940,
  he became Professor of Microbiology and Head of the Department.
  In 1949, he was appointed Director of the Institute of
  Microbiology. He retired in 1958. However, he has a
  laboratory and office at the Institute to continue a limited
  amount of research and considerable writing and lecturing.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from his activities at Rutgers, he was invited to organize
  a division of Marine Bacteriology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
  Institution in 1931; he was also appointed marine
  bacteriologist at the same institution, where he served until
  1942. He was then elected as a Trustee, and later a Life Trustee.
  On various occasions, he held industrial positions for limited
  periods of time and served as consultant to industrial
  laboratories, government and other scientific institutions.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Waksman's fields of work include, in chronological
  order, the microbiological population of the soil, sulphur
  oxidation by bacteria, microorganisms and soil fertility;
  decomposition of plant and animal residues, nature and formation
  of humus; occurrence of bacteria in the sea and their role in
  marine processes; production and nature of antibiotic substances;
  taxonomy, physiology, and biochemistry of the actinomycetes. He
  has published more than 400 scientific papers and has written,
  alone or with others, 18 books.<br>
  <br>
  He has isolated, together with his students and associates, a
  number of new antibiotics, including actinomycin (1940),
  clavacin, streptothricin (1942), streptomycin (1943), grisein
  (1946), neomycin (1948), fradicin, candicidin, candidin, and
  others. Two of these, streptomycin and neomycin, have found
  extensive application in the treatment of numerous infectious
  diseases of men, animals and plants. They have been covered by
  patents, that on streptomycin having been recently listed as one
  of the ten &laquo;patents that shaped the world&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Waksman holds honorary doctor's degrees in medicine,
  science, agriculture, law or letters from the Universities of
  Li&egrave;ge,
  Athens, Pavia, Madrid,
  Strasbourg, Jerusalem, G&ouml;ttingen, Perugia, Keio (Japan) and
  several American universities and colleges. He is a member,
  honorary member or fellow of a number of scientific societies in
  the USA, France, Sweden, Mexico, India, Germany, Brazil, Spain,
  and Israel. He is a Former President of the American Society for
  Microbiology.<br>
  <br>
  His work in the field of microbiology has been recognized by
  numerous scientific and other societies in the USA, Denmark, The
  Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Japan, Israel, Italy, Spain, and
  Turkey. In 1950 he was made Commander of the French L&eacute;gion
  d'Honneur, and in 1952 he was voted as one of &laquo;the most
  outstanding 100 people in the world today&raquo; (Little, Brown
  &amp; Co.).<br>
  <br>
  In 1949, the Trustees of Rutgers University voted to establish an
  Institute of Microbiology and made Professor Waksman its first
  Director. The larger portion of the funds derived from the
  royalties obtained from streptomycin and neomycin have been
  assigned for the building and support of this Institute, which is
  being used for research and advanced teaching on a doctorate and
  post-doctorate level in microbiology. Out of the small portion of
  the royalties assigned to him personally, Dr. and Mrs. Waksman
  established the &laquo;Foundation for Microbiology&raquo;, for the
  support of research and publications in the field of microbiology
  at various institutions of the world. Professor Waksman continues
  as President of this Foundation. He and his wife have also
  established a scholarship for an immigrant student, or the son or
  daughter of an immigrant, at Rutgers University, and Mrs. Waksman
  has established a music scholarship at Douglass College, Rutgers University.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Waksman's wife is Deborah B. Mitnik. They have one son,
  Byron H. Waksman, M.D., who was a Research Associate at Massachusetts
  General Hospital, Boston, and Assistant Professor at Harvard University
  Medical School, and more recently Professor of Microbiology
  at Yale University Medical School, and two
  grandchildren, Nan and Peter.</p>
