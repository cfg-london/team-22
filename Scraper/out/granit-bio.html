  <h1>Ragnar Granit - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="granit.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ragnar Arthur Granit</b> was born in the
  parish of Helsinge, Finland, on October 30th, 1900, eldest son of
  the Crown forester Arthur Wilhelm Granit and his wife Albertina
  Helena Malmberg. The family then moved to the neighbourhood of
  Helsingfors where his father opened a firm dealing with
  sylviculture and forest produce and the son became a pupil of the
  Swedish Normallyceum belonging, as he did, to the Swedish
  population of his native country, to a sea-faring family from the
  island of Korpo in the Baltic waters separating Sweden and
  Finland. He still spends his summers on this island.<br>
  <br>
  Granit matriculated at Helsingfors University in 1919. While still at
  school, he took part in Finland's War of Liberation 1918 (the
  Svidja corps) and was decorated with the Cross of Freedom IV Cl.
  &laquo;with sword&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  During a preliminary Summer Course at the &Aring;bo Academy in
  1919 he decided to take up experimental psychology, which as an
  academic subject fell within the humanities, but was well advised
  by his uncle, Dr. Lars Ringbom, to add a full medical degree to
  these studies. His teacher in experimental psychology at
  Helsingfors was Eino Kaila, later Professor of Philosophy. Granit
  became Mag. Phil. in 1923. During his medical studies he arrived
  at the conclusion that physiology would prove a better starting
  point than psychology for the visual work that he had undertaken
  almost from the beginning of his career and so he eagerly
  accepted the post of demonstrator (assistant) at the
  Physiological Institute, offered him in 1926 by Professor Carl
  Tigerstedt. He took his M.D. in December 1927 and became
  &laquo;Docent&raquo; in Physiology in 1929.<br>
  <br>
  In 1928 he spent half a year at <a href="../1932/index.html">Sir
  Charles Sherrington</a>'s laboratory at Oxford and returned there
  as a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation in 1932-1933. The years
  1929-1931 he spent as Fellow in Medical Physics at the Johnson
  Foundation of the University of Pennsylvania on the invitation of Dr.
  D. W. Bronk, then engaged in setting up this institute. Returning
  to Helsingfors Granit held the office of Professor of Physiology
  from 1935 and was formally appointed in 1937, his chair being at
  about the same time transformed into one assigned for teaching in
  the Swedish language. During the so-called Winter War between
  Finland and Russia, Granit was district physician for the three
  Swedish-speaking island parishes of Korpo, Houtsk&auml;r and
  Ini&ouml; in the Baltic, simultaneously charged with the duty as
  physician to the forts within this region.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 he was called to Harvard University and to the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/granit-bio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.ki.se/" target="_blank">Royal Caroline Institute</a>
  of Stockholm, in the end deciding in favour of the latter. The
  appointment was based on a grant from the Foundation &laquo;Knut
  och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse&raquo; and also supported by the
  Rockefeller Foundation. In 1945 the Caroline Institute made his
  laboratory a department of the <a href="http://www.nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank">Medical Nobel Institute</a> for which new buildings were
  to be erected. In 1946 he received a personal research chair in
  Neurophysiology from the Ministry of Education. The new building
  was ready in 1947. He retired as Professor Emeritus in July,
  1967.<br>
  <br>
  Ragnar Granit was a Member of the Medical Research Council (1949-1955),
  President of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/granit-bio.html&object=kva&to=http://www.kva.se/" target="_blank">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> (1963-1965), Vice
  President (1965-1969). Between 1956 and 1966 he was Visiting
  Professor at the Rockefeller Institute (since Rockefeller
  University), New York; in 1967 in a similar capacity at St. Catherine's
  College, Oxford for the Michaelmas Term, and at the University of the
  Pacific, San Francisco, 1969; Fogarty Scholar, N.I.H., Bethesda,
  1971-1972. Some of his major lectures are: The Thomas Young
  Oration of the Physical Society, London, 1945; The Silliman
  Lectures of Yale
  University, 1954; The Sherrington Memorial Lecture of the
  Royal
  Society of Medicine, London, 1967; The Sherrington Lectures,
  Liverpool, 1970.<br>

  the International Society for Clinical Electroretinography, the
  Biological Societies of Montevideo, Santiago de Chile and
  Argentina, the Finnish Society for Ophthalmology, the American
  Physiological Society, the American Neurological Association, the
  Physiological Society of England, the Finnish Society of
  Physicians, the Swedish Society of Physicians, the Swedish and
  the Finnish Societies of Physiology.<br>

  Among the many awards Ragnar Granit has received the following
  may be mentioned here: Hans Cronstedt's Prize, 1926; Jubilee
  Medal of the Swedish Society of Physicians, 1947; Anders Retzius
  Gold Medal, Stockholm, 1957; F. C. Donders Medal, Utrecht, 1957;
  Sherrington Memorial Gold Medal, London, 1967; Purkinje Gold
  Medal, Prague, 1969.<br>
  <br>
  From 1920 to around 1947 Ragnar Granit's main research was in the
  field of vision, beginning with psychophysics in the twenties and
  ending up with electrophysiological work from the early thirties
  onwards, as briefly reported in the Nobel Lecture. He next took
  up muscular afferents, in particular the muscle spindles and
  their motor control; passing over to the spinal cord, he studied
  the projection of these affarents and separated tonic and phasic
  motoneurons, established algebraical summation of excitation and
  inhibition upon these cells, finally also making use of the
  intracellular approach for the investigation of these and several
  other problems of motor control. In 1965 he initiated the series
  of international Nobel Symposia as contributor to, and as
  Chairman and Editor of Nobel Symposium I, Muscular Afferents and
  Motor Control.<br>
  <br>
  Ragnar Granit married in 1929 Baroness Marguerite (Daisy) Emma
  Bruun, daughter of the State Councillor, Baron Theodor Bruun and
  Mary Edith Henley. The son in this marriage, Michael W. Th.
  Granit has been Chief Architect of the Communications of Greater
  Stockholm since 1967. Michael Granit married Elisabet Stolpe in
  1957, and they have two sons and one daughter.</p>
