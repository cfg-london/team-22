<h1>Rigoberta Mench&uacute; Tum - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Acceptance and Nobel Lecture, December 10, 1992</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><i>(Translation)</i></p>

  <p>Your Majesties, the King and
  Queen of Norway,<br>
  The Honorable Members of the Nobel Peace Committee,<br>
  Your Excellency, the Prime Minister,<br>
  Your Excellencies, Members of the Government and the Diplomatic
  Corps,<br>
  Dear Guatemalan countrymen and women,<br>
  Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>I feel a deep emotion and pride for the
  honor of having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1992. A
  deep personal feeling and pride for my country and its very
  ancient culture. For the values of the community and the people
  to which I belong, for the love of my country, of Mother Nature.
  Whoever understands this respects life and encourages the
  struggle that aims at such objectives.</p>

  <p>I consider this Prize, not as a reward to
  me personally, but rather as one of the greatest conquests in the
  struggle for peace, for Human Rights and for the rights of the
  indigenous people, who, for 500 years, have been split,
  fragmented, as well as the victims of genocides, repression and
  discrimination.</p>

  <p>Please allow me to convey to you all, what
  this Prize means to me.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, the Nobel Peace Prize calls
  upon us to act in accordance with what it represents, and the
  great significance it has worldwide. In addition to being a
  priceless treasure, it is an instrument with which to fight for
  peace, for justice, for the rights of those who suffer the
  abysmal economical, social, cultural and political inequalities,
  typical of the order of the world in which we live, and where the
  transformation into a new world based on the values of the human
  being, is the expectation of the majority of those who live on
  this planet.</p>

  <p>This Nobel Prize represents a standard
  bearer that encourages us to continue denouncing the violation of
  Human Rights, committed against the people in Guatemala, in
  America and in the world, and to perform a positive role in
  respect of the pressing task in my country, which is to achieve
  peace with social justice.</p>

  <p>The Nobel Prize is a symbol of peace, and
  of the efforts to build up a real democracy. It will stimulate
  the civil sectors so that through a solid national unity, these
  may contribute to the process of negotiations that seek peace,
  reflecting the general feeling - although at times not possible
  to express because of fear - of Guatemalan society: to establish
  political and legal grounds that will give irreversible impulses
  to a solution to what initiated the internal armed conflict.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt whatsoever that it
  constitutes a sign of hope in the struggle of the indigenous
  people in the entire Continent.</p>

  <p>It is also a tribute to the
  Central-American people who are still searching for their
  stability, for the structuring of their future, and the path for
  their development and integration, based on civil democracy and
  mutual respect.</p>

  <p>The importance of this Nobel Prize has been
  demonstrated by all the congratulations received from everywhere,
  from Heads of Government - practically all the American
  Presidents - to the organizations of the indigenous people and of
  Human Rights, from all over the world. In fact, what they see in
  this Nobel Peace Prize is not only a reward and a recognition of
  a single person, but a starting point for the hard struggle
  towards the achievement of that revindication which is yet to be
  fulfilled.</p>

  <p>As a contrast, and paradoxically, it was
  actually in my own country where I met, on the part of some
  people, the strongest objections, reserve and indifference, for
  the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to this Quich&eacute; Indian.
  Perhaps because in Latin America, it is precisely in Guatemala
  where the discrimination towards the indigenous, towards women,
  and the repression of the longing for justice and peace, are more
  deeply rooted in certain social and political sectors.</p>

  <p>Under present circumstances, in this
  disordered and complex world, the decision of the Norwegian Nobel
  Peace Prize Committee to award this honorable distinction to me,
  reflects the awareness of the fact that, in this way, courage and
  strength is given to the struggle of peace, reconciliation and
  justice; to the struggle against racism, cultural discrimination,
  and hence contributes to the achievement of harmonious
  co-existence between our people.</p>

  <p>With deep pain, on one side, but with
  satisfaction on the other, I have to inform you that the Nobel
  Peace Prize 1992 will have to remain temporarily in Mexico City,
  in watchful waiting for peace in Guatemala. Because there are no
  political conditions in my country that would indicate or make me
  foresee a prompt and just solution. The satisfaction and
  gratitude are due to the fact that Mexico, our brother neighbor
  country, that has been so dedicated and interested, that has made
  such great efforts in respect of the negotiations that are being
  conducted to achieve peace, that has received and admitted so
  many refugees and exiled Guatemalans, has given us a place in the
  Museo del Templo Mayor (the cradle of the ancient Aztecs) so that
  the Nobel Prize may remain there, until peaceful and safe
  conditions are established in Guatemala to place it here, in the
  land of the Quetzal.<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>When evaluating the overall significance of
  the award of the Peace Prize, I would like to say some words on
  behalf of all those whose voice cannot be heard or who have been
  repressed for having spoken their opinions, of all those who have
  been marginalized, who have been discriminated, who live in
  poverty, in need, of all those who are the victims of repression
  and violation of human rights. Those who, nevertheless, have
  endured through centuries, who have not lost their conscience,
  determination, and hope.</p>

  <p>Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to
  say some words about my country and the civilization of the
  Mayas. The Maya people developed and spread geographically
  through some 300,000 square km; they occupied parts of the South
  of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, as well as Honduras and El
  Salvador; they developed a very rich civilization in the area of
  political organization, as well as in social and economic fields;
  they were great scientists in the fields of mathematics,
  astronomy, agriculture, architecture and engineering; they were
  great artists in the fields of sculpture, painting, weaving and
  carving.</p>

  <p>The Mayas discovered the zero value in
  mathematics, at about the same time that it was discovered in
  India and later passed on to the Arabs. Their astronomic
  forecasts based on mathematical calculations and scientific
  observations were amazing, and still are. They prepared a
  calendar more accurate than the Gregorian, and in the field of
  medicine they performed intracranial surgical operations.</p>

  <p>One of the Maya books, which escaped
  destruction by the conquistadores, known as <i>The Codex of
  Dresden,</i> contains the results of an investigation on eclipses
  as well a table of 69 dates, in which solar eclipse occur in a
  lapse of 33 years.</p>

  <p>Today, it is important to emphasize the
  deep respect that the Maya civilization had towards life and
  nature in general.</p>

  <p>Who can predict what other great scientific
  conquests and developments these people could have achieved, if
  they had not been conquered by blood and fire, and subjected to
  an ethnocide that affected nearly 50 million people in the course
  of 500 years.</p>

  <p>I would describe the meaning of this Nobel
  Peace prize, in the first place as a tribute to the Indian people
  who have been sacrificed and have disappeared because they aimed
  at a more dignified and just life with fraternity and
  understanding among human beings. To those who are no longer
  alive to keep up the hope for a change in the situation in
  respect of poverty and marginalization of the Indians, of those
  who have been banished, of the helpless in Guatemala as well as
  in the entire American Continent.</p>

  <p>This growing concern is comforting, even
  though it comes 500 years later, to the suffering, the
  discrimination, the oppression and the exploitation that our
  peoples have been exposed to, but who, thanks to their own
  cosmovision - and concept of life, have managed to withstand and
  finally see some promising prospects. How those roots, that were
  to be eradicated, now begin to grow with strength, hope and
  visions of the future!</p>

  <p>It also represents a sign of the growing
  international interest for, and understanding of the original
  Rights of the People, of the future of more than 60 million
  Indians that live in our Americas, and their outcry because of
  the 500 years of oppression that they have endured. For the
  genocide beyond comparison that they have had to suffer
  throughout this epoch, and from which other countries and the
  elite of the Americas have profited and taken advantage.</p>

  <p>Let there be freedom for the Indians,
  wherever they may be in the American Continent or elsewhere in
  the world, because while they are alive, a glow of hope will be
  alive as well as a true concept of life.</p>

  <p>The expressions of great happiness by the
  Indian Organizations in the entire Continent and the worldwide
  congratulations received for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize,
  clearly indicate the great importance of this decision. It is the
  recognition of the European debt to the American indigenous
  people; it is an appeal to the conscience of Humanity so that
  those conditions of marginalization that condemned them to
  colonialism and exploitation may be eradicated; it is a cry for
  life, peace, justice, equality and fraternity between human
  beings.</p>

  <p>The peculiarities of the vision of the
  Indian people are expressed according to the way in which they
  are related to each other. First, between human beings, through
  communication. Second, with the earth, as with our mother,
  because she gives us our lives and is not mere merchandise.
  Third, with nature, because we are an integral part of it, and
  not its owners.</p>

  <p>To us Mother Earth is not only a source of
  economic riches that give us the maize, which is our life, but
  she also provides so many other things that the privileged ones
  of today strive for. The Earth is the root and the source of our
  culture. She keeps our memories, she receives our ancestors and
  she, therefore, demands that we honor her and return to her, with
  tenderness and respect, those goods that she gives us. We have to
  take care of her so that our children and grandchildren may
  continue to benefit from her. If the world does not learn now to
  show respect to nature, what kind of future will the new
  generations have?</p>

  <p>From these basic features derive behavior,
  rights and obligations in the American Continent, for the
  indigenous people as well as for the non-indigenous, whether they
  be racially mixed, blacks, whites or Asian. The whole society has
  an obligation to show mutual respect, to learn from each other
  and to share material and scientific achievements, in the most
  convenient way. The indigenous peoples never had, and still do
  not have, the place that they should have occupied in the
  progress and benefits of science and technology, although they
  represented an important basis for this development.</p>

  <p>If the indigenous civilization and the
  European civilizations could have made exchanges in a peaceful
  and harmonious manner, without destruction, exploitation,
  discrimination and poverty, they could, no doubt, have achieved
  greater and more valuable conquests for Humanity.</p>

  <p>Let us not forget that when the Europeans
  came to America, there were flourishing and strong civilization
  there. One cannot talk about a "discovery of America", because
  one discovers that which one does not known about, or that which
  is hidden. But America and its native civilizations had
  discovered themselves long before the fall of the Roman Empire
  and Medieval Europe. The significance of its cultures forms part
  of the heritage of humanity and continues to astonish the
  learned.</p>

  <p>I think it is necessary that the indigenous
  peoples, of which I am a member, should contribute their science
  and knowledge to human development, because we have enormous
  potential and we could combine our very ancient heritage with the
  achievements of European civilization as well as with
  civilizations in other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>But this contribution, that to our
  understanding is a recovery of the natural and cultural heritage,
  must take place based on a rational and consensual basis in
  respect of the right to make use of knowledge and natural
  resources, with guarantees for equality between Government and
  society.</p>

  <p>We the indigenous are willing to combine
  tradition with modernism, but not at any cost. We will not
  tolerate or permit that our future be planned as possible
  guardians of ethno-touristic projects on a continental level.</p>

  <p>At a time when the commemoration of the
  Fifth Centenary of the arrival of Columbus in America has
  repercussions all over the world, the revival of hope for the
  oppressed indigenous peoples demands that we reassert our
  existence to the world and the value of our cultural identity. It
  demands that we endeavor to actively participate in the decisions
  that concern our destiny, in the building-up of our
  countries/nations. Should we, in spite of all, not be taken into
  consideration, there are factors that guarantee our future:
  struggle and endurance; courage; the decision to maintain our
  traditions that have been exposed to so many perils and
  sufferings; solidarity towards our struggle on the part of
  numerous countries, governments, organizations and citizens of
  the world.</p>

  <p>That is why I dream of the day when the
  relationship between the indigenous peoples and other peoples is
  strengthened; when they can combine their potentialities and
  their capabilities and contribute to make life on this planet
  less unequal, a better distribution of the scientific and
  cultural treasures accumulated by Humanity, flourishing in peace
  and justice.</p>

  <p>Today, in the 47th period of sessions of
  the General Assembly, the United nations (UN) will proclaim 1993
  as the <i>International Year of the World's Indigenous
  People</i>, in the presence of well-known chiefs of the
  organizations of the Indian people and of the coordination of the
  Continental Movement of Indigenous, Blacks and Popular
  Resistance. They will all formally participate in the opening of
  the working sessions in order to make 1993 a year of specific
  actions to truly place the indigenous peoples within their
  national contexts and to make them part of mutual international
  agreements.</p>

  <p>The achievement of the <i>International
  Year of the World's Indigenous People</i> and the progress
  represented by the preparation of the project for the
  <i>Universal Declaration</i>, are the result of the participation
  of numerous Indian brothers, nongovernmental organizations and
  the successful efforts of the experts in the Working group, in
  addition to the comprehensiveness shown by many countries in the
  United Nations.</p>

  <p>We hope that the formulation of the project
  in respect of the Declaration on the Rights of the indigenous
  People will examine and go deeply into the existing difficulty
  reality that we, the Indo-Americans, experience.<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

  <p>Our people will have a year dedicated to
  the problems that afflict them and, in this respect, are now
  getting ready to carry out different activities with the purpose
  of presenting proposals and putting pressure on action plans. All
  this will be conducted in the most reasonable way and with the
  most convincing and justified arguments for the elimination of
  racism, oppression, discrimination and the exploitation of those
  who have been dragged into poverty and oblivion. Also for "the
  condemned of the earth", the award of the Nobel Peace Prize
  represents a recognition, an encouragement and an objective for
  the future.</p>

  <p>I wish that a conscious sense of peace and
  a feeling of human solidarity would develop in all peoples, which
  would open new relationships of respect and equality for the next
  millennium, to be ruled by fraternity and not by cruel
  conflicts.</p>

  <p>Opinion is being formed everywhere today,
  that in spite of wars and violence, calls upon the entire human
  race to protect its historical values and to form unity in
  diversity. And this calls upon us all to reflect upon the
  incorporation of important elements of change and transformation
  in all aspects of life on earth, in the search for specific and
  definite solutions to the deep ethical crisis that afflicts
  Humanity. This will, no doubt have decisive influence on the
  structure of the future.</p>

  <p>There is a possibility that some centers of
  political and economic power, some statesmen and intellectuals,
  have not yet managed to see the advantages of the active
  participation of the indigenous peoples in a<span class=
  "normaltext">l</span>l the fields of human activity. However, the
  movement initiated by different political and intellectual
  "Amerindians" will finally convince them that, from an objective
  point of view, we are a constituent part of the historical
  alternatives that are being discussed at the international
  level.</p>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say some
  candid words about my country.</p>

  <p>The attention that this Nobel Peace Prize
  has focused on Guatemala, should imply that the violation of the
  human rights is no longer ignored internationally. It will also
  honor all those who died in the struggle for social equality and
  justice in my country.</p>

  <p>It is known throughout the world that the
  Guatemalan people, as a result of their struggle, succeeded in
  achieving, in October 1944, a period of democracy where
  institutionality and human rights were the main philosophies. At
  that time, Guatemala was an exception in the American Continent,
  because of its struggle for complete national sovereignty.
  However, in 1954, a conspiracy that associated the traditional
  national power centers, inheritors of colonialism, with powerful
  foreign interests, overthrew the democratic regime as a result of
  an armed invasion, thereby re-imposing the old system of
  oppression which has characterized the history of my
  country.<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <p>The economic, social and political
  subjection that derived from the Cold War, was what initiated the
  internal armed conflict. The repression against the organizations
  of the people, the democratic parties and the intellectuals,
  started in Guatemala long before the war started. Let us not
  forget that.</p>

  <p>In the attempt to crush rebellion,
  dictatorships have committed the greatest atrocities. They have
  leveled villages, and murdered thousands of peasants particularly
  Indians, hundreds of trade union workers and students,
  outstanding intellectuals and politicians, priests and nuns.
  Through this systematic persecution in the name of the safety of
  the nation, one million peasants were removed by force from their
  lands; 100,000 had to seek refuge in the neighboring countries.
  In Guatemala, there are today almost 100,000 orphans and more
  than 40,000 widows. The practice of "disappeared" politicians was
  invented in Guatemala, as a government policy.</p>

  <p>As you know, I am myself a survivor of a
  massacred family.</p>

  <p>The country collapsed into a crisis never
  seen before and the changes in the world forced and encouraged
  the military forces to permit a political opening that consisted
  in the preparation of a new Constitution, in an expansion of the
  political field, and in the transfer of the government to civil
  sectors. We have had this new regime for eight years and in
  certain fields there have been some openings of importance.</p>

  <p>However, in spite of these openings,
  repression and violation of human rights persists in the middle
  of an economic crisis, that is becoming more and more acute, to
  the extent that 84% of the population is today considered as
  poor, and some 60% are considered as very poor. Impunity and
  terror continue to prevent people from freely expressing their
  needs and vital demands. The internal armed conflict still
  exists.</p>

  <p>The political life in my country has lately
  centered around the search for a political solution to the global
  crisis and the armed conflict that has existed in Guatemala since
  1962. This process was initiated by the Agreement signed in this
  City of Oslo, between the Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de
  Reconciliaci&oacute;n with government mandate, and the Unidad
  Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) as a necessary step
  to introduce to Guatemala the spirit of the Agreement of
  Esquipulas.<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

  <p>As a result of this Agreement and
  conversations between the URNG and different sectors of
  Guatemalan society, direct negotiations were initiated under the
  government of President Serrano, between the government and the
  guerrillas, as a result of which three agreements have already
  been signed. However, the subject of Human Rights has taken a
  long time, because this subject constitutes the core of the
  Guatemalan problems, and around this core important differences
  have arisen. Nevertheless, there has been considerable
  progress.</p>

  <p>The process of negotiations aims at
  reaching agreements in order to establish the basis for a real
  democracy in Guatemala and for an end to the war. As far as I
  understand, with the goodwill of the parties concerned and the
  active participation of the civil sectors, adapting to a great
  national unity, the phase of purposes and intentions could be
  left behind so that Guatemala could be pulled out of the
  crossroads that seem to have become eternal.</p>

  <p>Dialogues and political negotiations are,
  no doubt, adequate means to solve these problems, in order to
  respond in a specific way to the vital and urgent needs for life
  and for the implementation of democracy for the Guatemalan
  people. However, I am convinced that if the diverse social
  sectors which integrate Guatemalan society find bases of unity,
  respecting their natural differences, they would together find a
  solution to those problems and therefore resolve the causes which
  initiated the war which prevails in Guatemala.</p>

  <p>Other civil sectors as well as the
  international community must demand that the negotiations between
  the Government and the URNG surpass the period in which they are
  finding themselves in discussing Human Rights and move ahead as
  soon as possible to a verifiable agreement with the United
  Nations. It is necessary to point out, here in Oslo, that the
  issue of Human Rights in Guatemala constitutes, at present, the
  most urgent problem that has to be solved. My statement is
  neither incidental nor unjustified.</p>

  <p>As has been ascertained by international
  institutions, such as The United Nations Commission on Human
  Rights, The Interamerican Commission of Human Rights and many
  other humanitarian organizations, Guatemala is one of the
  countries in America with the largest number of violations of
  these rights, and the largest number of cases of impunity where
  security forces are generally involved. It is imperative that the
  repression and persecution of the people and the Indians be
  stopped. The compulsory mobilization and integration of young
  people into the Patrols of Civil Self Defense, which principally
  affects the Indian people, must also be stopped.</p>

  <p>Democracy in Guatemala must be built-up as
  soon as possible. It is necessary that Human Rights agreements be
  fully complied with, i.e. an end to racism; guaranteed freedom to
  organize and to move within all sectors of the country. In short,
  it is imperative to open all fields to the multi-ethnic civil
  society with all its rights, to demilitarize the country and
  establish the basis for its development, so that it can be pulled
  out of today's underdevelopment and poverty.</p>

  <p>Among the most bitter dramas that a great
  percentage of the population has to endure, is the forced exodus.
  Which means, to be forced by military units and persecution to
  abandon their villages, their Mother Earth, where their ancestors
  rest, their environment, the nature that gave them life and the
  growth of their communities, all of which constituted a coherent
  system of social organization and functional democracy.</p>

  <p>The case of the displaced and of refugees
  in Guatemala is heartbreaking; some of them are condemned to live
  in exile in other countries, but the great majority live in exile
  in their own country. They are forced to wander from place to
  place, to live in ravines and inhospitable places, some not
  recognized as Guatemalan citizens, but all of them are condemned
  to poverty and hunger. There cannot be a true democracy as long
  as this problem is not satisfactorily solved and these people are
  reinstated on their lands and in their villages.</p>

  <p>In the new Guatemalan society, there must
  be a fundamental reorganization in the matter of land ownership,
  to allow for the development of the agricultural potential, as
  well as for the return of the land to the legitimate owners. This
  process of reorganization must be carried out with the greatest
  respect for nature, in order to protect her and return to her,
  her strength and capability to generate life.</p>

  <p>No less characteristic of a democracy is
  social justice. This demands a solution to the frightening
  statistics on infant mortality, of malnutrition, lack of
  education, analphabetism, wages insufficient to sustain life.
  These problems have a growing and painful impact on the
  Guatemalan population and imply no prospects and no hope.</p>

  <p>Among the features that characterize
  society today, is that of the role of women, although female
  emancipation has not, in fact, been fully achieved so far by any
  country in the world.</p>

  <p>The historical development in Guatemala
  reflects now the need and the irreversibility of the active
  contribution of women to the configuration of the new Guatemalan
  social order, of which, I humbly believe, the Indian women
  already are a clear testimony. This Nobel Peace Prize is a
  recognition to those who have been, and still are in most parts
  of the world, the most exploited of the exploited; the most
  discriminated of the discriminated, the most marginalized of the
  marginalized, but still those who produce life and riches.</p>

  <p>Democracy, development and modernization of
  a country are impossible and incongruous without the solution of
  these problems.</p>

  <p>In Guatemala, it is just as important to
  recognize the Identity and the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples,
  that have been ignored and despised not only during the colonial
  period, but also during the Republic. It is not possible to
  conceive a democratic Guatemala, free and independent, without
  the indigenous identity shaping its character into all aspects of
  national existence.</p>

  <p>It will undoubtedly be something new, a
  completely new experience, with features that, at the moment, we
  cannot describe. But it will authentically respond to history and
  the characteristics of the real Guatemalan nationality. The true
  profile that has been distorted for such a long time.</p>

  <p>This urgency of this vital need, are the
  issues that urge me, at this moment, from this rostrum, to urge
  national opinion and the international community, to show a more
  active interest in Guatemala.</p>

  <p>Taking into consideration that in
  connection with my role as a Nobel Prize Winner, in the process
  of negotiations for peace in Guatemala many possibilities have
  been handled, but now I think that this role is more likely to be
  the role of a promotor of peace, of national unity, for the
  protection of the rights of the indigenous peoples. In such a
  way, that I may take initiatives in accordance with the needs,
  and thereby prevent the Peace Prize from becoming a piece of
  paper that has been pigeonholed.</p>

  <p>I call upon all the social and ethnic
  sectors that constitute the people of Guatemala to participate
  actively in the efforts to find a peaceful solution to the armed
  conflict, to build-up a sound unity between the
  "ladinos,"<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> the blacks and
  the Indians, all of whom must create within their diverse groups,
  a "Guatemality".</p>

  <p>Along these same lines, I invite the
  international community to contribute with specific actions so
  that the parties involved may overcome the differences that at
  this stage keep negotiations in a wait-and-see state, so that
  they will succeed, first of all, in signing an agreement on Human
  Rights. And then, to re-initiate the rounds of negotiation and
  identify those issues on which to compromise, to allow for the
  Peace Agreement to be signed and immediately ratified, because I
  have no doubt that this will bring about great relief in the
  prevailing situation in Guatemala.</p>

  <p>My opinion is also that the UN should have
  a more direct participation, which would go further than playing
  the role of observer, and could help substantially to move the
  process ahead.</p>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that. I have
  given preference to the American Continent, and in particular to
  my country, does not mean that I do not have an important place
  in my mind and in my heart for the concern of other peoples of
  the world and their constant struggle in the defense of peace, of
  the right to a life and all its inalienable rights. The majority
  of us who are gathered here today, constitute an example of the
  above, and along these lines I would humbly extend to you my
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>Many things have changed in these last
  years. There have been great changes of worldwide character. The
  East-West confrontation has ceased to exist and the Cold War has
  come to an end. These changes, the exact forms of which cannot
  yet be predicted, have left gaps that the people of the world
  have known how to make use of in order to come forward, struggle
  and win national terrain and international recognition.</p>

  <p>Today, we must fight for a better world,
  without poverty, without racism, with peace in the Middle East
  and in Southeast Asia, to where I address a plea for the
  liberation of <a href="/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/index.html">Mrs.
  Aung San Suu Kyi,</a> winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 1991; for a
  just and peaceful solution, in the Balkans; for the end of the
  apartheid in South Africa; for the stability in Nicaragua, that
  the Peace Agreement in El Salvador be observed; for the
  re-establishment of democracy in Haiti; for the complete
  sovereignty of Panama; because all of these constitute the
  highest aims for justice in the international situation.</p>

  <p>A world at peace that could provide
  consistency, interrelations and concordance in respect of the
  economic, social and cultural structures of the societies would
  indeed have deep roots and a robust influence.</p>

  <p>We have in our mind the deepest felt
  demands of the entire human race, when we strive for peaceful
  co-existence and the preservation of the environment. The
  struggle we fight purifies and shapes the future.</p>

  <p>Our history is a living history, that has
  throbbed, withstood and survived many centuries of sacrifice. Now
  it comes forward again with strength. The seeds, dormant for such
  a long time, break out today with some uncertainty, although they
  germinate in a world that is at present characterized by
  confusion and uncertainty.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that this process will be
  long and complex, but it is no Utopia and we, the Indians, we
  have new confidence in its implementation.</p>

  <p>The peoples of Guatemala will mobilize and
  will be aware of their strength in building up a worthy future.
  They are preparing themselves to sow the future, to free
  themselves from atavisms, to rediscover their heritage. To build
  a country with a genuine national identity. To start a new
  life.</p>

  <p>By combining all the shades and nuances of
  the "ladinos", the "gar&iacute;funas"<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Indians in the Guatemalan
  ethnic mosaic, we must interlace a number of colors without
  introducing contradictions, without becoming grotesque nor
  antagonistic, but we must give them brightness and a superior
  quality, just the way our weavers weave a typical huipil blouse,
  brilliantly composed, a gift to Humanity.</p>

  <p>Thank you very much.</p>

  The revolution of 1944 brought to power the presidential regime
  of Dr. Juan Jos&eacute; Ar&eacute;valo, who instituted democratic and
  social reforms. His successor, Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&aacute;n, was
  considered to be pro-communists by the government of President
  Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States, which ordered the CIA
  to cooperate with right-wing and military forces in an armed
  invasion which overthrew the Arbenz government in 1954. The
  ensuing period of repression led to the civil war which lasted
  from 1962 to 1996.</p>

  This agreement between the governmental National Commission for
  Reconciliation and the guerrilla Guatemalan National
  Revolutionary Unity was signed at Oslo in March 1990. It was a
  further step in the efforts of the two Guatemalan parties to end
  their armed conflict, a process in which the government of
  Guatemala was participating along with El Salvador, Honduras,
  Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The five presidents had made several
  attempts to agree on measures to end the civil wars in Central
  American countries, one of their summits having taken place in
  Esquipulas, Guatemala, in 1986. President Oscar Arias
  S&aacute;nchez of Costa Rica took a leading role in these
  negotiations, which were finally successful in the multilateral
  agreement signed in August 1987. For his contribution Arias
  received the Nobel Peace prize that year. See the previous volume
  in this series, Nobel Lectures. Peace, 1981-1990, pp.
