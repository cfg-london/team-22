  <h1>John Hume - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, Oslo, December 10, 1998</p>

  <p class="smalltext">&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesties, Members of the Norwegian
  Nobel Committee, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

  <p>I would like to begin by expressing my deep
  appreciation and gratitude to the Nobel committee for bestowing
  this honour on me today. I am sure that they share with me the
  knowledge that, most profoundly of all, we owe this peace to the
  ordinary people of Ireland, particularly those of the North who
  have lived and suffered the reality of our conflict. I think that
  David Trimble would agree with me that this Nobel prize for peace
  which names us both is in the deepest sense a powerful
  recognition from the wider world of the tremendous qualities of
  compassion and humanity of all the people we represent between
  us.</p>

  <p>In the past 30 years of our conflict there
  have been many moments of deep depression and outright horror.
  Many people wondered whether the words of W.B Yeats might come
  true</p>

  <p>"Too long a sacrifice Can make a stone of
  the heart."</p>

  <p>Endlessly our people gathered their
  strength to face another day and they never stopped encouraging
  their leaders to find the courage to resolve this situation so
  that our children could look to the future with a smile of hope.
  This is indeed their prize and I am convinced that they
  understand it in that sense and would take strong encouragement
  from today&iacute;s significance and it will powerfully strengthen
  our peace process.</p>

  <p>Today also we commemorate and the world
  commemorates the adoption 50 years ago of the Universal
  declaration of Human Rights and it is right and proper, that
  today is also a day that is associated internationally with the
  support of peace and work for peace because the basis of peace
  and stability, in any society, has to be the fullest respect for
  the human rights of all its people. It is right and proper that
  the European Convention of Human Rights is to be incorporated
  into the domestic law of our land as an element of the Good
  Friday Agreement.</p>

  <p>In my own work for peace, I was very
  strongly inspired by my European experience. I always tell this
  story, and I do so because it is so simple yet so profound and so
  applicable to conflict resolution anywhere in the world. On my
  first visit to Strasbourg in 1979 as a member of the European
  Parliament. I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg
  to Kehl. Strasbourg is in France. Kehl is in Germany. They are
  very close. I stopped in the middle of the bridge and I
  meditated. There is Germany. There is France. If I had stood on
  this bridge 30 years ago after the end of the second world war
  when 25 million people lay dead across our continent for the
  second time in this century and if I had said: "Don&iacute;t worry.
  In 30 years&iacute; time we will all be together in a new Europe,
  our conflicts and wars will be ended and we will be working
  together in our common interests", I would have been sent to a
  psychiatrist. But it has happened and it is now clear that
  European Union is the best example in the history of the world of
  conflict resolution and it is the duty of everyone, particularly
  those who live in areas of conflict to study how it was done and
  to apply its principles to their own conflict resolution.</p>

  <p>All conflict is about difference, whether
  the difference is race, religion or nationality The European
  visionaries decided that difference is not a threat, difference
  is natural. Difference is of the essence of humanity. Difference
  is an accident of birth and it should therefore never be the
  source of hatred or conflict. The answer to difference is to
  respect it. Therein lies a most fundamental principle of peace -
  respect for diversity.</p>

  <p>The peoples of Europe then created
  institutions which respected their diversity - a Council of
  Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament -
  but allowed them to work together in their common and substantial
  economic interest. They spilt their sweat and not their blood and
  by doing so broke down the barriers of distrust of centuries and
  the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving, based on
  agreement and respect for difference.</p>

  <p>That is precisely what we are now committed
  to doing in Northern Ireland. Our Agreement, which was
  overwhelmingly endorsed by the people, creates institutions which
  respect diversity but ensure that we work together in our common
  interest. Our Assembly is proportionately elected so that all
  sections of our people are represented. Any new administration or
  government will be proportionately elected by the members of the
  Assembly so that all sections will be working together. There
  will be also be institutions between both parts of Ireland and
  between Britain and Ireland that will also respect diversity and
  work the common ground.</p>

  <p>Once these institutions are in place and we
  begin to work together in our very substantial common interests,
  the real healing process will begin and we will erode the
  distrust and prejudices of out past and our new society will
  evolve, based on agreement and respect for diversity. The
  identities of both sections of our people will be respected and
  there will be no victory for either side.</p>

  <p>We have also had enormous solidarity and
  support from right across the world which has strengthened our
  peace process. We in Ireland appreciate this solidarity and
  support - from the United States, from the European Union, from
  friends around the world - more than we can say. The achievement
  of peace could not have been won without this goodwill and
  generosity of spirit. We should recall too on this formal
  occasion that our Springtime of peace and hope in Ireland owes an
  overwhelming debt to several others who devoted their passionate
  intensity and all of their skills to this enterprise: to the
  Prime Ministers,Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, to the President of
  the United States of America Bill Clinton and the European
  President Jacques Delors and Jacques Santer and to the three men
  who so clearly facilitated the negotiation, Senator George
  Mitchell former Leader of the Senate of the United States of
  America, Harri Holkerri of Finland and General John de Chastelain
  of Canada. And, of course, to our outstanding Secretary of State,
  Mo Mowlam.</p>

  <p>We in Ireland appreciate this solidarity
  and support - from the United States; from the European Union,
  from friends around the world - more than we can say. The
  achievement of peace could not have been won without this good
  will and generosity of spirit. Two major political traditions -
  share the Island of Ireland. We are destined by history to live
  side by side. Two representatives of these political traditions
  stand here today. We do so in shared fellowship and a shared
  determination to make Ireland, after the hardship and pain of
  many years, a true and enduring symbol of peace.</p>

  <p>Too many lives have already been lost in
  Ireland in the pursuit of political goals. Bloodshed for
  political change prevents the only change that truly matter: in
  the human heart. We must now shape a future of change that will
  be truly radical and that will offer a focus for real unity of
  purpose: harnessing new forces of idealism and commitment for the
  benefit of Ireland and all its people.</p>

  <p>Throughout my years in political life, I
  have seen extraordinary courage and fortitude by individual men
  and women, innocent victims of violence. Amid shattered lives, a
  quiet heroism has born silent rebuke to the evil that violence
  represents, to the carnage and waste of violence, to its ultimate
  futility.</p>

  <p>I have seen a determination for peace
  become a shared bond that has brought together people of all
  political persuasions in Northern Ireland and throughout the
  island of Ireland.</p>

  <p>I have seen the friendship of Irish and
  British people transcend, even in times of misunderstanding and
  tensions, all narrower political differences. We are two
  neighbouring islands whose destiny is to live in friendship and
  amity with each other. We are friends and the achievement of
  peace will further strengthen that friendship and, together,
  allow us to build on the countless ties that unite us in so many
  ways.</p>

  <p>The Good Friday Agreement now opens a new
  future for all the people of Ireland. A future built on respect
  for diversity and for political difference. A future where all
  can rejoice in cherished aspirations and beliefs and where this
  can be a badge of honour, not a source of fear or division.</p>

  <p>The Agreement represents an accommodation
  that diminishes the self-respect of no political tradition, no
  group, no individual. It allows all of us - in Northern Ireland
  and throughout the island of Ireland - to now come together and,
  jointly, to work together in shared endeavour for the good of
  all.</p>

  <p>No-one is asked to yield their cherished
  convictions or beliefs. All of us are asked to respect the views
  and rights of others as equal of our own and, together, to forge
  a covenant of shared ideals based on commitment to the rights of
  all allied to a new generosity of purpose.</p>

  <p>That is what a new, agreed Ireland will
  involve. That is what is demanded of each of us.</p>

  <p>The people of Ireland, in both parts of the
  island, have joined together to passionately support peace. They
  have endorsed, by overwhelming numbers in the ballot box, the
  Good Friday Agreement. They have shown an absolute and unyielding
  determination that the achievement of peace must be set in
  granite and its possibilities grasped with resolute purpose.</p>

  <p>It is now up to political leaders on all
  sides to move decisively to fulfil the mandate given by the Irish
  people: to safeguard and cherish peace by establishing agreed
  structures for peace that will forever remove the underlying
  causes of violence and division on our island. There is now, in
  Ireland, a passionate sense of moving to new beginnings.</p>

  <p>I salute all those who made this possible:
  the leaders and members of all the political parties who worked
  together to shape a new future and to reach agreement; the
  Republican and Loyalist movements who turned to a different path
  with foresight and courage; people in all parts of Ireland who
  have led the way for peace and who have made it possible.</p>

  <p>And so, the challenge now is to grasp and
  shape history: to show that past grievances and injustices can
  give way to a new generosity of spirit and action.</p>

  <p>I want to see Ireland - North and South -
  the wounds of violence healed, play its rightful role in a Europe
  that will, for all Irish people, be a shared bond of patriotism
  and new endeavour.</p>

  <p>I want to see Ireland as an example to men
  and women everywhere of what can be achieved by living for
  ideals, rather than fighting for them, and by viewing each and
  every person as worthy of respect and honour.</p>

  <p>I want to see an Ireland of partnership
  where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the
  marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future
  that can be as great as our dreams allow.</p>

  <p>The Irish poet, Louis MacNiece wrote words
  of affirmation and hope that seem to me to sum up the challenges
  now facing all of us - North and South, Unionist and Nationalist
  - in Ireland.</p>

  <p>"By a high star our course is set, Our end
  is life. Put out to sea."</p>

  <p>That is the journey on which we in Ireland
  are now embarked.</p>

  <p>Today, as I have said, the world also
  commemorates the adoption fifty years ago, of the Universal
  Declaration of Human Rights. To me there is a unique
  appropriateness, a sort of poetic fulfilment, in the coincidence
  that my fellow Laureate and I, representing a community long
  divided by the forces of a terrible history, should jointly be
  honoured on this day. I humbly accept this honour on behalf of a
  people who, after many years of strife, have finally made a
  commitment to a better future in harmony together. Our commitment
  is grounded in the very language and the very principles of the
  Universal Declaration itself. No greater honour could have been
  done me or the people I speak here for on no more fitting
  day.</p>

  <p>I will now end with a quotation of total
  hope, the words of a former Laureate, one of my great heroes of
  this century, Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

  <p>We shall overcome.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
