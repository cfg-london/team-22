  <h1>John Macleod - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="macleod.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>John James Rickard
  Macleod</b> was born on September 6, 1876 at Cluny, near Dunkeld,
  Perthshire, Scotland. He was the son of the Rev. Robert Macleod.
  When later the family moved to Aberdeen, Macleod went to the
  Grammar School there and later entered the Marischal College of
  the University
  of Aberdeen to study medicine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1898 he took his medical degree with honours and was awarded
  the Anderson Travelling Fellowship, which enabled him to work for
  a year at the Institute for Physiology at the University of
  Leipzig.<br>
  <br>
  In 1899 he was appointed Demonstrator of Physiology at the London
  Hospital Medical School under Professor Leonard Hill and in 1902
  he was appointed Lecturer in Biochemistry at the same College. In
  that year he was awarded the McKinnon Research Studentship of the
  Royal Society, which he held until 1903, when he was appointed
  Professor of Physiology at the Western Reserve University at Cleveland,
  Ohio, U.S.A.<br>
  <br>
  During his tenure of this post he was occupied by various war
  duties and acted, for part of the winter session of 1916, as
  Professor of Physiology at McGill University, Montreal.<br>
  <br>
  In 1918 he was elected Professor of Physiology at the University of
  Toronto, Canada. Here he was Director of the Physiological
  Laboratory and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.<br>
  <br>
  In 1928 he was appointed Regius Professor of Physiology at the
  University of Aberdeen, a post which he held, together with that
  of Consultant Physiologist to the Rowett Institute
  for Animal Nutrition, in spite of failing health, until his early
  death.<br>
  <br>
  Macleod's name will always be associated with his work on
  carbohydrate metabolism and especially with his collaboration
  with <a href="index.html">Frederick Banting</a> and Charles Best
  in the discovery of insulin. For this work on the discovery of
  insulin, in 1921, Banting and Macleod were jointly awarded the
  Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for 1923.<br>
  <br>
  Macleod had, before this discovery, been interested in
  carbohydrate metabolism and especially in diabetes since 1905 and
  he had published some 37 papers on carbohydrate metabolism and 12
  papers on experimentally produced glycosuria. Previously he had
  followed the earlier great work of von Mering and Minkowski,
  which has been published in 1889, and although he believed that
  the pancreas was the organ involved, he had not been able to
  prove exactly what part it played. Although Laguesse had
  suggested, in 1893, that the islets of Langerhans possibly
  produced an internal secretion which controlled the metabolism of
  sugar, and Sharpey-Schafer had, in 1916, called this hypothetical
  substance "insuline", nobody had been able to prove its actual
  existence. Others had made extracts of the pancreas, some of
  which had proved to be active in affecting the metabolism of
  sugar, but none of these products had been found reliable, until
  Banting and Best, jointly with Macleod, could announce their
  great discovery in February 1922. The process of manufacturing
  the pancreatic extract which could be used for the treatment of
  human patients was patented; the financial proceeds of the patent
  were given to the British Medical Research Council for the
  Encouragement of Research, the discoverers receiving no payment
  at all. Subsequently, the active principle of these earlier
  pancreatic extracts, insulin, was isolated in pure form by John
  Jacob Abel in 1926, and eventually it became available as a
  manufactured product.<br>
  <br>
  Earlier, in 1908, Macleod had done experimental work on the
  possible part played by the central nervous system in the
  causation of hyperglycaemia and in 1932 he returned to this
  subject, basing his work on the experiments done by Claude
  Bernard on puncture diabetes, and Macleod then concluded, from
  experiments done on rabbits, that stimulation of gluconeogenesis
  in the liver occurred by way of the parasympathetic nervous
  system.<br>
  <br>
  Macleod also did much work in fields other than carbohydrate
  metabolism. His first paper, published in 1899, when he was
  working at the London Hospital, had been on the phosphorus
  content of muscle and he also worked on air sickness, electric
  shock, purine bases, the chemistry of the tubercle bacillus and
  the carbamates.<br>
  <br>
  In addition he wrote 11 books and monographs, among which were
  his <i>Recent Advances in Physiology</i> (with Sir Leonard Hill)
  (1905); <i>Physiology and Biochemistry of Modern Medicine</i>,
  which had reached its 9th edition in 1941; <i>Diabetes: its
  Pathological Physiology</i> (1925); <i>Carbohydrate Metabolism
  and Insulin</i> (1926); and his Vanuxem lectures, published in
  1928 as the <i>Fuel of Life</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1919 Macleod was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada,
  in 1923 of the Royal Society, London, in 1930 of the Royal College
  of Physicians, London, and in 1932 of the Royal Society
  of Edinburgh. During 1921-1923 he was President of the
  American Physiological Society, and during 1925-1926 of the Royal
  Canadian Institute. He held honorary doctorates of the
  Universities of Toronto, Cambridge, Aberdeen and Pennsylvania, the
  Western Reserve University and the Jefferson
  Medical College. He was an honorary fellow of the Accademia
  Medica, Rome, and also a corresponding member of the Medical and
  Surgical Society, Bologna, the Societ&aacute; Medica Chirurgica,
  Rome, and the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher
  Leopoldina, Halle, and Foreign Associate Fellow of the
  College of
  Physicians, Philadelphia.<br>
  <br>
  Macleod was a very successful teacher and director of research.
  His lucid lectures were delivered in an attractive manner and his
  pupils and research associates found him a sympathetic and
  stimulating worker, who demanded exact work and the humility that
  was a feature of his character. He would not tolerate careless
  work. He was much interested in the development of medical
  education and especially in the introduction of scientific
  methods of investigation into clinical work.<br>
  <br>
  Outside the laboratory he was keenly interested in golf and
  gardening and the arts, especially painting. A sensitive, loyal
  and affectionate man of engaging personality, his serene spirit
  met with courage and optimism the painful and crippling
  disabilities which troubled the final years of his busy
  life.<br>
  <br>
  Macleod was married to Mary McWalter. He died on March 16,
  1935.</p>
