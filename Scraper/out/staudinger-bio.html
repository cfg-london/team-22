  <h1>Hermann Staudinger - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="staudinger.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Hermann Staudinger</b> was
  born in Worms on the 23rd of March 1881. His father was Dr. Franz
  Staudinger.<br>
  <br>
  Staudinger was educated in Worms, matriculated in 1899, and
  continued his studies first at the University of Halle, later at Darmstadt and Munich.
  He graduated at Halle in 1903 and qualified for inauguration as
  academic lecturer under Professor Thiele at Strasbourg
  University in spring 1907. In November 1907 he was appointed
  Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Institute of Chemistry of
  the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe. For fourteen years, from
  1912, he was lecturer at the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule in
  Zurich, and in 1926 followed the invitation of the University of
  Freiburg i. Br. to become Lecturer of Chemistry. ln this
  city, he remained all through his further career. From 1940
  onwards he held an additional appointment as Principal of the
  Research Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry. Staudinger
  resigned from his post as Principal of the Chemical Laboratories
  of the University in April 1951, and accepted the honorary
  appointment as Head of the State Research Institute for
  Macromolecular Chemistry, which he held until April 1956.<br>
  <br>
  Staudinger was a prolific writer and the following books by him
  have been published: <i>Die Ketene</i> (Ketenes), published by
  Enke, Stuttgart, 1912; <i>Anleitung zur organischen qualitativen
  Analyse</i> (Introduction to organic qualitative analysis),
  published by Springer, Berlin, 1st edition 1923, 5th edition
  1948, 6th edition 1955; <i>Tabellen zu den Vorlesungen &uuml;ber
  allgemeine und anorganische Chemie</i> (Tables for the lectures
  on general and inorganic chemistry), published by Braun,
  Karlsruhe, 1st edition 1927, 5th edition 1947; <i>Die
  hochmolekularen organischen Verbindungen, Kautschak und
  Cellulose</i> (The high-molecular organic compounds, rubber and
  cellulose), published by Springer, Berlin, 1932; <i>Organische
  Kolloidchemie</i> (Organic colloid chemistry), published by
  Vieweg, Braunschweig, 1st edition 1940, 3rd edition 1950;
  <i>Fortschritte der Chemie, Physik und Technik der
  makromolekularen Stoffe</i> (Progress of the chemistry, physics
  and technique of the macromolecular substances), jointly with
  Professor Vieweg and Professor R&ouml;hrs, Volume 1, 1939, Volume
  II, 1942, publisher Lehmann, Munich; <i>Makromolekulare Chemie
  und Biologie</i> (Macromolecular chemistry and biology),
  publisher Wepf &amp; Co., Basle, 1947; <i>Vom Aufstand der
  technischen Sklaven</i> (The uprising of the technical slave),
  published by Chamier, Essen-Freiburg, 1947.<br>
  <br>
  Since September 1947 Staudinger has edited the periodical <i>Die
  makromolekulare Chemie</i> (Macromolecular chemistry), published
  by Dr. A. H&uuml;thig, Heidelberg and Wepf &amp; Co.,
  Basle.<br>
  <br>
  In 1961 his book <i>Arbeitserinnerungen</i> (Working memoirs)
  appeared, published by Dr. A. H&uuml;thig, Heidelberg.<br>
  <br>
  Besides the books, Staudinger published a great number of
  scientific papers. Among these were fifty on ketenes, also works
  on oxalyl chloride, autoxidation, aliphatic diazo-compounds,
  explosions, insecticides, synthetic pepper and coffee aroma.
  Since 1920 he has written approximately 500 papers on
  macromolecular compounds, about 120 of these on cellulose, about
  50 on rubber and isoprene.<br>
  <br>
  For his work Staudinger received many honours and awards; to
  mention but a few - he is Dr. Ing. h.c. of the Technische
  Hochschule Karlsruhe; Dr. rer. nat. h.c. of the University of
  Mainz; Dr. (C) h.c. of the University of Salamanca; Dr. chem.
  h.c. of the University of Torino; Dr. sc. techn. h.c. of the
  Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule Zurich; and Dr. h.c. of
  the University of Strasbourg. In 1953 he was awarded the Nobel
  Prize in Chemistry for his discoveries in the field of
  macromolecular chemistry. In 1933 he was honoured with the
  Cannizzarro Prize of the Reale Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in
  Roma. He is member of the Institut de France, and member and
  honorary member of many Chemical Societies and the Society of
  Macromolecular Chemistry in Tokyo.<br>

  Hermann Staudinger is married to Magda Woit, who is for many
  years his co-worker and co-author of numerous publications.</p>
