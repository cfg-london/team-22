  <h1>Daniel Nathans - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nathans.jpg" class="bio-img">My parents came to the United States in the
  early years of this century as part of a wave of Russian Jewish
  immigrants seeking freedom and opportunity in the New World. My
  mother, Sarah Levitan, came to America when she was 18. My
  father, Samuel, rebelling against an orthodox family, left home
  in his midteens and made his way to the United States a few years
  later. They were married in Philadelphia in 1910. As the last of
  their nine children I was born in 1928 in Wilmington, Delaware,
  on the eve of the great depression. Soon after, my father lost
  his small business and was for some time unemployed. Our house
  was cold and leaky, and (I learned later) my parents sometimes
  went hungry. Yet they generally managed to retain their good
  humor and certainly their hopes for their children. I have only
  fond memories of this period, no doubt due to the special
  attentions of an affectionate family.<br>
  <br>
  My education began in the public schools of Wilmington. During
  most of these years, from about age 10, I also worked at some job
  or other after school, on weekends, and in the summer months.
  Following in the footsteps of my brothers and sisters, I went on
  to the University
  of Delaware, where I studied chemistry, philosophy, and
  literature. Although I enjoyed science and mathematics, what I
  remember most vividly is a small, stimulating circle of
  professors and students (including a number of veterans just back
  from the war), interested in philosophy and politics. To my
  father my interest in natural science meant "medicine", and
  becoming a physician also seemed more attractive to me than any
  other alternative I knew about. So I applied to medical school
  and received a scholarship at Washington University in St. Louis.
  Washington University turned out to be a lucky choice. The
  faculty was scholarly and dedicated and accessible to students. A
  wonderful summer of research with Oliver Lowry, Professor of
  Pharmacology, convinced me that a career in medical research and
  teaching suited me better than medical practice. After getting an
  M. D. degree in 1954, I went to the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York for
  an internship in medicine with Robert Loeb, a masterful clinician
  and medical scientist. That was one of the most valuable years of
  my life. The glimpses of human strength and frailty that a
  physician sees are with me still. I spent two more years at
  Columbia as a medical resident, interrupted by service as a
  Clinical Associate at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. During my
  years in Bethesda, I married Joanne Gomberg, and our son Eli was
  born.<br>
  <br>
  While at the National Institutes of Health I developed an
  interest in the biosynthesis of proteins as a result of a study
  with Michael Potter
  and John Fahey of myeloma protein formation in plasmacytoma
  cells. This led me to <a href="../1953/index.html">Fritz
  Lipmann's</a> laboratory at the Rockefeller
  Institute in 1959. Here I identified the bacterial
  "elongation factors" involved in the addition of amino acids to
  growing peptide chains, worked on the mechanism of action of
  puromycin as an inhibitor of this step (with Amos Neidle), and in
  a collaborative study with Norton Zinder, demonstrated that RNA
  from a bacterial virus directed the synthesis by cell extracts of
  viral coat protein. During those years in the invigorating
  atmosphere of Lipmann's laboratory and the Rockefeller Institute,
  I learned a geat deal, and Lipmann's artistry made a lasting
  impression on me. I also found out that I liked biochemical
  research and that I could do it. The intention of returning to a
  department of medicine was abandoned, and I accepted a position
  at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the
  Department of Microbiology, headed by Barry Wood, an inspiring
  former teacher at Washington University. During the years in New
  York our son Jeremy was born, and soon after our move to
  Baltimore in 1962, my wife gave birth to our youngest son,
  Ben.<br>
  <br>
  In Baltimore I became head of a one-man "Division of Genetics"
  which gradually developed substance with the recruitment of
  <a href="index.html">Hamilton Smith</a>, Bernard Weiss, Kenneth
  Berns, Thomas Kelly, and recently, John Morrow. My initial
  research at Hopkins was a continuation of studies on the in vitro
  translation of bacteriophage RNA, particularly its regulation by
  phage coat protein and the location of genes by translation of
  fragments of the RNA. My co-workers during these years were
  Yoshiro Shimura, Max Oeschger, Gerardo Suarez, Robb Moses,
  Kathleen Eggen, Roy Schmickel, Herbert Kaizer, Marilyn Kozak, and
  Susan Polmar.<br>
  <br>
  In the mid 60's I became interested in viral tumorigenesis and
  spent the first half of 1969 learning about animal cells and
  viruses at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel,
  with Leo Sachs and Ernest Winocour. That spring a letter from
  Hamilton Smith telling me about the restriction endonuclease he
  had discovered in <i>Hemophilus influenzae</i> aroused my
  interest in the possibility of using restriction enzymes to
  dissect the genomes of DNA tumor viruses. Back in Baltimore in
  the summer and fall of 1969, Stuart Adler and I surveyed the
  known restriction enzymes for their ability to cleave the DNA of
  Simian Virus 40, one of the simplest animal viruses that
  transform cultured cells to tumorigenicity. Using fragments of
  Simian Virus 40 DNA produced by Smith's enzyme and by similar
  enzymes discovered subsequently, Kathleen Danna and George Sack
  constructed a cleavage map of the viral DNA. With this map in
  hand, other co-workers proceeded to localize viral genes and
  template functions along the molecule, to construct deletion
  mutants and later point mutants at pre-selected restriction
  sites, and to analyse the genomes of naturally arising variants
  of the virus. Associates in these later studies were Elena
  Nightingale, Ching-Juh Lai, Theresa Lee, William Brockman, Mary
  Gutai, Walter Scott, Nicholas Muzyczka, and David Shortle; and
  collaborators from other laboratories were George Khoury, Malcolm
  Martin, Kathleen Rundell, and Peter Tegtmeyer.<br>
  <br>
  As I look back on the last few decades of my life, I am struck by
  the good fortune that came my way. Throughout my schooling there
  was an abundance of opportunity and encouragement. Several of my
  teachers were remarkable individuals who had a lasting influence
  on me. At every stage of my career I have had interesting and
  cordial colleagues, some of whom are close friends. My field of
  research is as exciting to me as ever, and it remains essentially
  a "cottage industry" effort. I have had talented students who are
  a source of much enjoyment, and I anticipate more to come as
  their careers develop. And most important, my wife and sons have
  created in our home an atmosphere of joy and harmony, so
  essential to everything else.</p>
