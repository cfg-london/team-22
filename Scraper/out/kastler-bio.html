  <h1>Alfred Kastler - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kastler.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Alfred Kastler</b> was born in
  Guebwiller in Alsace on May 3, 1902. He followed his early
  studies at the school in his native town, and continued at the
  Oberrealschule of Colmar, which became the Lycee Bartholdi in
  1918, when Alsace was returned to France.<br>
  <br>
  He entered the &Eacute;cole Normale Superieure in 1921, and left in
  1926 to teach in a lyc&eacute;e. He taught for 5 years, first in
  the Mulhouse lyc&eacute;e, then in those of Colmar and Bordeaux.
  The next stage of his career was in higher education: assistant
  at the Bordeaux Faculty of Science from 1931 to 1936, lecturer at
  Clermont-Ferrand from 1936 to 1938, professor at Bordeaux from
  1938 to 1941. In 1941, in the midst of the German occupation,
  Georges Bruhat asked him to come to Paris to help him in
  establishing physics teaching at the Ecole Normale Superieure.
  The post was provisional, but was confirmed by the allocation of
  a chair in a personal capacity at the Paris Faculty of Sciences
  in 1952.<br>
  <br>
  His mathematics teachers at the Colmar Lyc&eacute;e, Fr&ouml;hlich
  from Bavaria and Edouard Greiner from Alsace, were the first to
  awaken his interest in science. This predilection became
  consolidated in the special mathematics class held by Mahuet and
  Brunold, who helped Kastler to gain entry to the &Eacute;cole
  Normale Superieure by the side entrance, so to speak. In the
  stimulating and friendly atmosphere of this college, the teacher
  Eug&egrave;ne Bloch (who came from the upper Rhine and who
  subsequently disappeared without trace in Auschwitz) initiated
  his students into the concepts of Bohr's atom and quantum
  physics, and drew Kastler's attention to Sommerfeld's book on
  atomic structure and spectral lines. This book introduced him to
  the principle of the conservation of momentum applied by A.
  Rubinowicz to the exchange of energy between atoms and radiation.
  This principle was to guide the whole of Kastler's research,
  beginning with his thesis up to the most recent investigations of
  the Parisian team.<br>
  <br>
  Alfred Kastler was in 1931 appointed assistant to Pierre Daure,
  professor at the Bordeaux Faculty of Science. His teaching duties
  were then less onerous, and Kastler was able to devote all his
  free time to research, aided by Professor Daure who initiated him
  into experimental spectroscopy. For many years, he worked in the
  field of optical spectroscopy, particularly on atomic
  fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy. [In I937 he became
  interested in the luminescence of sodium atoms in the upper
  atmosphere; after establishing that the D line of the twilight
  sky could be absorbed by sodium vapour, and after some studies at
  Abisko where twilight is prolonged, he was able to demonstrate in
  cooperation with his colleague Jean Bricard, that this line is
  polarized, as it must be if the emission mechanism is one of
  optical resonance produced by solar radiation.]<br>
  <br>
  During the years of the occupation, French scientists were
  virtually isolated from the outside world. In 1945, it was
  possible to send pupils to other western countries, so that they
  could bring their knowledge of the most recent devel opments in
  scientific progress up to date. Among them was Jean Brossel, who
  returned in 1951 in possession of a mass of information gained
  under Francis Bitter at M.I.T.<br>
  <br>
  Under the influence of Gorter, <a href=
  "../1944/index.html">Rabi</a> had very successfully applied
  certain methods to the investigation of atoms in their
  fundamental state. In 1949, Bitter suggested extending these same
  methods to the excited states of atoms. Brossel and Kastler
  together then proposed the " double resonance method ", which
  combines optical resonance with magnetic resonance.<br>
  <br>
  While Brossel was at M.I.T., between 1949 and 1951, he carried
  out pioneer work along these lines on the excited state of the
  mercury atom. At the same time, Kastler was supplementing the
  method by the technique of "optical pumping", which makes it
  possible to apply "optical methods for studying the microwave
  resonances" to the fundamental states of atoms.<br>
  <br>
  After 1951, Kastler worked in collaboration with Jean Brossel in
  Paris to perfect all these methods. Among the young men and women
  at the &Eacute;cole Normale, which nurtures the intellectual elite,
  they found their research workers. Their theses represent the
  various stages in their collective work which has been awarded
  the Nobel Prize, and of which some account is given in Kastler's
  Nobel lecture.<br>
  <br>
  Kastler taught as Francqui Professor at the University of Louvain
  during the year 1953-1954, he hold honorary doctorates from the
  University of Louvain (1955), Pisa (1960), and Oxford (1966), and he
  was decorated by the University of Li&eacute;ge.The French and Polish
  Societies of Physics and the American Society of Optics have
  elected Kastler to honorary memberships. In 1962, the latter
  society awarded him the first Mees medal bearing the inscrip tion
  "Optics transcends all boundaries". In 1954, the British Physical
  Society awarded him the prize commemorating Fernand Holweck, who
  disappeared tragically in 1941. Kastler was made a member of the
  Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium in 1954, and of the Paris
  Academy of Sciences in 1964; in 1965, the National Centre for
  Scientific Research awarded him their gold medal, at the same
  time as his friend and colleague <a href=
  "../1970/index.html">Louis N&eacute;el</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In Decermber 1924 Kastler married Elise Cosset, a former pupil of
  the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. By working as a history
  teacher in secondary schools she made it possible for her husband
  to devote to research all the leisure time left to him by his own
  teaching duties. They have three children: Daniel, born in 1926,
  Mireille born in 1928, and Claude-Yves born in 1936. They have
  all married, there are now six grandchildren, whose ages range
  from 14 years to 10 months. Daniel is a Professor of Physics at
  the Faculty of Science in Marseilles, he is working on
  theoretical physics problems; Mireille is an ophthalmologist in
  Paris, and Claude-Yves teaches Russian at the Arts Faculty in
  Grenoble.</p>
