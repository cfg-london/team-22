  <h1>Giulio Natta - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="natta.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Giulio Natta</b> was born at Imperia
  on February 26, 1903. He graduated in Chemical Engineering at the
  Polytechnic of
  Milan in 1924 and passed the examinations entitling him to
  teach there in 1927. In 1933 he was established on the staff of
  Pavia
  University as a full professor and at the same time was
  appointed director of the Institute of General Chemistry at that
  University, where he stayed till 1935, that is until he was
  appointed full professor in physical chemistry at the University
  of Rome. From 1936 to 1938 he was full professor and director of
  the Institute of Industrial Chemistry at the Polytechnic
  of Turin. He has been full professor and director of the
  Department of Industrial Chemistry at the Milan Polytechnic since
  1938.<br>
  <br>
  Now a world famous scientist, Prof. Natta began his career with a
  study of solids by means of X-rays and electron diffraction. He
  then used the same methods for studying catalysts and the
  structure of some high organic polymers (the latter from 1934).
  His kinetic research on methanol synthesis, on selective
  hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds and on
  oxosynthesis led to an understanding of the mechanism of these
  reactions and to an improvement in the selectivity of
  catalysts.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938 Prof. Natta began to study the production of synthetic
  rubber in Italy; he took part in research work on butadiene and
  was the first to accomplish physical separation of butadiene from
  1-butadiene by a new method of extractive distillation.<br>
  <br>
  In 1938 he began to investigate the polymerisation of olefins and
  the kinetics of subsequent concurrent reactions. In 1953, with
  financial aid from a large Italian chemical company, Montecatini,
  Prof. Natta extended the research conducted by Ziegler on
  organometallic catalysts to the stereospecific polymerization,
  thus discovering new classes of polymers with a sterically
  ordered structure, <i>viz</i>. isotactic, syndiotactic and
  di-isotactic polymers and linear non branched olefinic polymers
  and copolymers with an atactic (or sterically nonordered)
  structure. These studies, which were developed for industrial
  application in Montecatini's laboratories, led to the realisation
  of a thermoplastic material, isotactic polypropylene, which
  Montecatini were the first to produce on an industrial scale, in
  1957, in their Ferrara plant. This product has been marketed
  successfully as a plastic material, by the name of Moplen, as a
  synthetic fibre, by the name of Meraklon, as a monofilament by
  the name of Merakrin and as packing film, by the name of
  Moplefan.<br>
  <br>
  By X-ray investigations, Prof. Natta has also succeeded in
  determining the exact arrangement of chains in the lattice of the
  new crystalline polymers he has discovered.<br>
  <br>
  No less important is his later research which led to the
  synthesis of completely new elastomers, in two different ways: by
  polymerization of butadiene into <i>cis</i>-1,4 polymers with a
  very high degree of steric purity and by copolymerization of
  ethylene with other <font face="Symbol">a</font>-olefins
  (propylene), originating extremely interesting materials such as
  saturated synthetic rubbers. The vulcanisation of these rubbers
  was made possible by the usual methods used for natural rubber,
  with the introduction of unsaturated monomeric units (terpolymers
  containing ethylene and propylene). The processes for the
  asymmetric synthesis, which allow the production of optically
  active macromolecules from optically inactive monomers, are of
  great scientific importance, due to their similarity to the
  natural biological processes. Other interesting results obtained
  by Natta in the field of macromolecular chemistry concern the
  synthesis of crystalline alternating copolymers of different
  couples of monomers and the synthesis of various sterically
  ordered polymers of non-hydrocarbon monomers.<br>
  <br>
  Prof. Natta's scientific and technical activity is documented in
  over 700 published papers, of which about 500 concern
  stereoregular polymers, and by a large number of patents in many
  different countries. In 1961 he was made an honorary life member
  of the New York
  Academy of Sciences of which he had been a fellow since 1958.
  In 1955 he became a "national member" of the Accademia dei
  Lincei; he is also a member of the Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e
  Lettere and of the Accademia delle Scienze of Turin. He was made
  honorary member of the Austrian (1960), Belgian (that awarded him
  the STAS medal) (1962), and Swiss (1963) Chemical Societies.
  Professor Natta received a gold medal from the town of Milan
  (1960), from the President of the Italian Republic (1961,
  reserved to those who gained merits in the field of school,
  culture and art), the first international gold medal of the
  synthetic rubber industry (1961); a gold medal from the Milan
  district (1962) and from the Society of Plastic Engineers (New
  York, 1963), the Perrin medal from the French Chemical Physical
  Society, and the Lavoisier medal from the Chemical Society of
  France (both in 1963), the Perkin gold medal of the English
  Society of Dyers and Colourists (1963), the John Scott award from
  the Board of Directors of the City Trust of Philadelphia, and the
  Medal "Leonardus Vincius Florentinus Doctor Ingenieurs" of
  FIDIIS, Paris (1971). The Turin University gave him an honorary
  degree in pure chemistry, and in 1963 Prof. Natta received an
  honorary degree from Mainz University.<br>

  Prof. Natta is a honorary member of the Industrial Chemical
  Society of Paris (1966) and of the Chemical Society of London
  (1970); an honorary member of the Rotary Club; associated foreign
  member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences de l'Institut de France
  (1964); member of the National Academy of XL, Rome (1964); joined
  member of the International Academy of Astronautics, Paris
  (1965); foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of Moscow,
  U.S.S.R. (1966); honorary president of the Italian Section of the
  Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE). He holds the following
  awards and honorary degrees: gold medal of the Union of Italian
  Chemists (1964); gold medal "Lomonosov" of the Moscow Academy of
  Sciences (1969); the "Carl-Dietrich-Harries-Plakette, of the
  Deutsche Kautschuk Gesellschaft, Frankfurt/Main (1971); honorary
  degrees from the University of Genoa (1964), the Polytechnic
  Institute of Brooklyn, New York (1964), the Catholic University
  of Louvain, Belgium (1965), and in 1971 from ESPI, University of
  Paris.</p>
