  <h1>Dudley R. Herschbach - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="herschbach.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in San Jose,
  California on June 18, 1932, the first of six children of Robert
  and Dorothy Herschbach. My father was then a building contractor
  and later a rabbit breeder. His family had lived in this part of
  California for three generations; although our surname comes from
  a pair of villages in the Rhine Valley, most of his immediate
  ancestors were of English or Irish origin. My mother's family had
  moved to San Jose from Illinois when she was a young girl; most
  of her known ancestors were of German, Dutch, or French
  origin.<br>
  <br>
  In my boyhood we lived in what was then a rural area of fruit
  orchards, only a few miles outside San Jose. For years I milked a
  cow, fed the pigs and chickens, and during summers picked prunes,
  apricots, and walnuts. From an early age I loved to read but was
  also very involved in outdoor activities, scouting, and sports.
  My interest in science was excited at age nine by an article on
  astronomy in <i>National Geographic;</i> the author was Donald
  Menzel of the Harvard Observatory. For the next few years, I
  regularly made star maps and snuck out at night to make
  observations from a locust tree in our back yard.<br>
  <br>
  When I attended Campbell High School, I took all the science and
  mathematics courses offered. Chemistry I found at first puzzling
  and then most intriguing, thanks to John Meischke, a superb
  teacher. At the time, I was at least as interested in football
  and other sports; perhaps that presaged my later pursuit of
  molecular collisions. Like most of my classmates, I did not
  expect to attend college; none of my known relatives had
  graduated from a university. However, my teachers and coaches
  presumed I would go. Indeed, I received offers of football
  scholarships from some universities to which I had not even
  applied for admission.<br>
  <br>
  I entered Stanford University in 1950 and found a new world
  with vastly broader intellectual horizons than I'd imagined.
  Although I gladly played freshman football, I had turned down an
  athletic scholarship in favor of an academic one. This permitted
  me to give up varsity football after spring practice, in reaction
  to a dictum by the head coach that we not take any lab courses
  during the season. By then the lab and library already were for
  me much the more exciting playground. My chief mentor at Stanford
  was Harold Johnston, who imbued me with his passion for chemical
  kinetics. Many other subjects and professors were also compelling
  and I took up to ten courses a term. Mathematics was especially
  appealing; I so admired the teaching of Harold Bacon, George
  Polya, Gabor Szego, and Bob Weinstock that I simply took all the
  courses they gave. I received the B.S. in mathematics in 1954 and
  the M.S. in chemistry in 1955. My Master's thesis, done under the
  direction of Harold Johnston, was titled: "Theoretical
  Pre-exponential Factors for Bimolecular Reactions." It employed
  the transition-state theory of Henry Eyring and Michael Polanyi
  and treated the proportionality factor in the most venerable
  formula of chemical kinetics, the Arrhenius equation.<br>
  <br>
  My graduate study continued at Harvard, where again I found an exhilarating
  academic environment. I received the A.M. in Physics in 1956 and
  the Ph.D. in Chemical Physics in 1958. My Doctoral Thesis, done
  under E. Bright Wilson, Jr., was titled: "Internal Rotation and
  Microwave Spectroscopy". This presented theoretical calculations
  and experiments dealing with hindered internal rotation of methyl
  groups. The height of the hindering barrier could be accurately
  determined because the observed spectra were very sensitive to
  tunneling between equivalent potential minima. Much that shaped
  my later research I learned from Bright Wilson and other faculty,
  especially George Kistiakowsky and Bill Klemperer, or from fellow
  students, especially Jerry Swalen, Victor Laurie and Larry
  Krisher. My thesis work also benefited from visits of several
  months to take spectra at the National Research Council in Ottawa
  and to compute Mathieu functions at Los Alamos National
  Laboratory. During 1957-1959, while a Junior Fellow in the
  Society of Fellows at Harvard, I developed plans for molecular
  beam studies of elementary chemical reactions.<br>
  <br>
  This work was launched at the University of California at Berkeley, where I
  was appointed an Assistant Professor of Chemistry in 1959 and
  became an Associate Professor in 1961. The chief experiments
  dealt with reactions of alkali atoms with alkyl iodides, systems
  studied forty years before by Michael Polanyi. Rather simple
  apparatus sufficed to attain single-collision conditions and
  revealed that the product molecules emerged with a preferred
  range of recoil angle and translational energy. The possibility
  of resolving such features of reaction dynamics encouraged other
  workers pursuing kindred experiments and fostered an outburst of
  new theory. My early work thus interacted particularly with that
  of Richard Bernstein, Sheldon Datz, Ned Greene, John Polanyi,
  John Ross, and Peter Toennies.<br>
  <br>
  This new field developed rapidly after I returned to Harvard in
  1963 as Professor of Chemistry. We studied a wide range of alkali
  reactions and found several prototype modes of reaction dynamics
  which could be correlated with the electronic structure of the
  target molecule. Processes involving abrupt, <i>impulsive</i>
  bond exchange or formation of a <i>persistent</i> complex
  comprise the two major categories. In 1967 Yuan Lee joined our
  group as a postdoctoral fellow and led the construction of a
  "supermachine". This employed greatly augmented differential
  pumping, sophisticated mass spectroscopy using ion counting
  techniques adapted from nuclear physics, and supersonic beam
  sources advocated by enterprising chemical engineers, especially
  John Fenn and Jim Anderson. The new machine greatly extended the
  scope of crossed-beam experiments, taking us "beyond the alkali
  age". In particular, we were then able to study the same
  reactions elucidated by John Polanyi with his complementary
  method of infrared chemiluminescence. This much enhanced the
  interpretation of reaction dynamics in terms of electronic
  structure.<br>

  the Nobel Prize probably appeared in:<br>

  In current research we are developing a method for simultaneous
  measurement of three or four vector properties of reactive
  collisions, such as reactant or product relative velocities or
  rotational angular momenta. Theory has shown that data on
  correlations among these vectors can undo much of the averaging
  over initial molecular orientations and impact parameters and
  thereby reveal more incisive information about reaction dynamics.
  Other studies deal with processes akin to liquid-phase reactions
  by solvating reactant molecules during a supersonic expansion. We
  are also examining bulk liquid interactions by means of
  vibrational frequency shifts induced by high pressure; this
  offers a way to determine solute-solvent intermolecular forces.
  In addition to theoretical studies related to these experiments,
  we are pursuing a new approach to electronic structure
  calculations which exploits exact solutions obtainable in the
  limit of one- and infintie-dimension. For two-electron systems
  this has given high accuracy for the electron correlation energy
  with far less effort than conventional methods.<br>

  Other biographical items pertaining to Harvard include my
  appointment in 1976 as Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science;
  service as Chairman of the Chemical Physics program (1964-1977)
  and the Chemistry Department (1977-1980), as a member of the
  Faculty Council (1980-1983), and as Co Master with my wife of
  Currier House (1981-1986). At Currier we were in effect
  reincarnated as undergraduates to preside over an extremely
  lively community of 400 students and tutors. Typical of many
  memorable episodes was the night we were summoned to a student's
  room to meet a seal in the bathtub. My teaching includes graduate
  courses in quantum mechanics, chemical kinetics, molecular
  spectroscopy, and collision theory. In recent years I have given
  undergraduate courses in physical chemistry and especially
  general chemistry for freshmen, my most challenging
  assignment.<br>
  <br>
  Away from Harvard, I have been a Visiting Professor at
  G&ouml;ttingen University in 1963, a Guggenheim Fellow at
  Freiburg
  University in 1968, a Visiting Fellow of the Joins Institute
  of Laboratory Astrophysics in 1969, and a Sherman Fairchild
  Scholar at the California Institute of Technology in 1976. I also
  serve as a consultant to Aerodyne Corporation, the Fluorocarbon
  Research Panel, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. I was
  appointed an Exxon Faculty Fellow in 1981 and visit regularly the
  Corporate Research Laboratory in New Jersey to participate in
  projects there. I have also served since 1980 as an Associate
  Editor of the Journal of Physical Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Other honors include election to the American Academy of Arts
  and Sciences in 1964 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967; the
  Pure Chemistry Prize of the American Chemical Society in 1965,
  the <a href="../1954/index.html">Linus Pauling</a> Medal in 1978,
  the Michael Polanyi Medal in 1981, and the Irving Langmuir Prize
  in Chemical Physics in 1983. The University of Toronto bestowed in 1977
  the D. Sc., <i>honoris causa.</i><br>
  <br>
  Chemistry also brought my wife Georgene Botyos to Harvard as an
  organic graduate student. We were married in 1964 and our
  daughters Lisa and Brenda arrived as harbingers before she
  received her Ph.D. in 1968. Georgene is now Assistant Dean of
  Harvard College, a multifaceted position that often requires
  delicate personal chemistry. Lisa is now a junior in humanities
  at Stanford, this year enjoying the overseas option at Oxford. Brenda is a
  junior in chemistry at Harvard, already pursuing research. Our
  home is in Lincoln, Massachusetts.</p>
