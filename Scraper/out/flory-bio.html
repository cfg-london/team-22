  <h1>Paul J. Flory - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="flory.jpg" class="bio-img"> I was born on
  19 June, 1910, in Sterling, Illinois, of Huguenot-German
  parentage, mine being the sixth generation native to America. My
  father was Ezra Flory, a clergyman-educator; my mother, nee
  Martha Brumbaugh, had been a schoolteacher. Both were descended
  from generations of farmers in the New World. They were the first
  of their families of record to have attended college.<br>
  <br>
  My interest in science, and in chemistry in particular, was
  kindled by a remarkable teacher, Carl W. Holl, Professor of
  Chemistry at Manchester College, a liberal arts college in
  Indiana, where I graduated in 1931. With his encouragement, I
  entered the Graduate School of The Ohio State
  University where my interests turned to physical chemistry.
  Research for my dissertation was in the field of photochemistry
  and spectroscopy. It was carried out under the guidance of the
  late Professor Herrick L. Johnston whose boundless zeal for
  scientific research made a lasting impression on his
  students.<br>
  <br>
  Upon completion of my Ph.D. in 1934, I joined the Central
  Research Department of the DuPont Company. There it was my good
  fortune to be assigned to the small group headed by Dr. Wallace
  H. Carothers, inventor of nylon and neoprene, and a scientist of
  extraordinary breadth and originality. It was through the
  association with him that I first became interested in
  exploration of the fundamentals of polymerization and polymeric
  substances. His conviction that polymers are valid objects of
  scientific inquiry proved contagious. The time was propitious,
  for the hypothesis that polymers are in fact covalently linked
  macromolecules had been established by the works of Staudinger
  and of Carothers only a few years earlier.<br>
  <br>
  A year after the untimely death of Carothers, in 1937, I joined
  the Basic Science Research Laboratory of the University of Cincinnati
  for a period of two years. With the outbreak of World War II and
  the urgency of research and development on synthetic rubber,
  supply of which was imperiled, I returned to industry, first at
  the Esso (now Exxon) Laboratories of the Standard Oil Development
  Company (1940-43) and later at the Research Laboratory of the
  Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (1943-48). Provision of
  opportunities for continuation of basic research by these two
  industrial laboratories to the limit that the severe pressures of
  the times would allow, and their liberal policies on publication,
  permitted continuation of the beginnings of a scientific career
  which might otherwise have been stifled by the exigencies of
  those difficult years.<br>
  <br>
  In the Spring of 1948 it was my privilege to hold the George
  Fisher Baker Non-Resident Lectureship in Chemistry at Cornell University.
  The invitation on behalf of the Department of Chemistry had been
  tendered by the late Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1936/index.html">Peter J.W. Debye</a>, then
  Chairman of that Department. The experience of this lectureship
  and the stimulating associations with the Cornell faculty led me
  to accept, without hesitation, their offer of a professorship
  commencing in the Autumn of 1948. There followed a most
  productive and satisfying period of research and teaching
  "Principles of Polymer Chemistry," published by the Cornell
  University Press in 1953, was an outgrowth of the Baker
  Lectures.<br>
  <br>
  It was during the Baker Lectureship that I perceived a way to
  treat the effect of excluded volume on the configuration of
  polymer chains. I had long suspected that the effect would be
  non-asymptotic with the length of the chain; that is, that the
  perturbation of the configuration by the exclusion of one segment
  of the chain from the space occupied by another would increase
  without limit as the chain is lengthened. The treatment of the
  effect by resort to a relatively simple "smoothed density" model
  confirmed this expectation and provided an expression relating
  the perturbation of the configuration to the chain length and the
  effective volume of a chain segment. It became apparent that the
  physical properties of dilute solutions of macromolecules could
  not be properly treated and comprehended without taking account
  of the perturbation of the macromolecule by these intramolecular
  interactions. The hydrodynamic theories of dilute polymer
  solutions developed a year or two earlier by Kirkwood and by
  Debye were therefore reinterpreted in light of the excluded
  volume effect. Agreement with a broad range of experimental
  information on viscosities, diffusion coefficients and
  sedimentation velocities was demonstrated soon thereafter.<br>
  <br>
  Out of these developments came the formulation of the
  hydrodynamic constant called theta, and the recognition of the
  Theta point at which excluded volume interactions are
  neutralized. Criteria for experimental identification of the
  Theta point are easily applied. Ideal behavior of polymers,
  natural and synthetic, under Theta conditions has subsequently
  received abundant confirmation in many laboratories. These
  findings are most gratifying. More importantly, they provide the
  essential basis for rational interpretation of physical
  measurements on dilute polymer solutions, and hence for the
  quantitative characterization of macromolecules.<br>
  <br>
  In 1957 my family and I moved to Pittsburgh where I undertook to
  establish a broad program of basic research at the Mellon
  Institute. The opportunity to achieve this objective having been
  subsequently withdrawn, I accepted a professorship in the
  Department of Chemistry at Stanford University in 1961. In 1966, I was
  appointed to the J.G. Jackson - C.J. Wood Professorship in
  Chemistry at Stanford.<br>
  <br>
  The change in situation upon moving to Stanford afforded the
  opportunity to recast my research efforts in new directions. Two
  areas have dominated the interests of my co-workers and myself
  since 1961. The one concerns the spatial configuration of chain
  molecules and the treatment of their configuration-dependent
  properties by rigorous mathematical methods; the other
  constitutes a new approach to an old subject, namely, the
  thermodynamics of solutions.<br>
  <br>
  Our investigations in the former area have proceeded from
  foundations laid by Professor M.V. Volkenstein and his
  collaborators in the Soviet Union, and were supplemented by major
  contributions of the late Professor Kazuo Nagai in Japan. Theory
  and methods in their present state of development permit
  realistic, quantitative correlations of the properties of chain
  molecules with their chemical constitution and structure. They
  have been applied to a wide variety of macromolecules, both
  natural and synthetic, including polypeptides and polynucleotides
  in the former category. The success of these efforts has been due
  in no small measure to the outstanding students and research
  fellows who have collaborated with me at Stanford during the past
  thirteen years. A book entitled "Statistical Mechanics of Chain
  Molecules", published in 1969, summarizes the development of the
  theory and its applications up to that date.<br>
  <br>
  Mrs. Flory, the former Emily Catherine Tabor, and I were married
  in 1936. We have three children: Susan, wife of Professor George
  S. Springer of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the
  University of
  Michigan; Melinda, wife of Professor Donald E. Groom of the
  Department of Physics at the University of Utah; and Dr. Paul John Flory,
  Jr., currently a post-doctoral Research Associate at the Medical Nobel
  Institute in Stockholm. We have four grandchildren: Elizabeth
  Springer, Mary Springer, Susanna Groom and Jeremy Groom.</p>
