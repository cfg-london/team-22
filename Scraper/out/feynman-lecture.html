  <h2>The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum
  Electrodynamics</h2>

  <p>We have a habit in writing articles
  published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as
  possible, to cover all the tracks, to not worry about the blind
  alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so
  on. So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner,
  what you actually did in order to get to do the work, although,
  there has been in these days, some interest in this kind of
  thing. Since winning the prize is a personal thing, I thought I
  could be excused in this particular situation, if I were to talk
  personally about my relationship to quantum electrodynamics,
  rather than to discuss the subject itself in a refined and
  finished fashion. Furthermore, since there are three people who
  have won the prize in physics, if they are all going to be
  talking about quantum electrodynamics itself, one might become
  bored with the subject. So, what I would like to tell you about
  today are the sequence of events, really the sequence of ideas,
  which occurred, and by which I finally came out the other end
  with an unsolved problem for which I ultimately received a
  prize.</p>

  <p>I realize that a truly scientific paper
  would be of greater value, but such a paper I could publish in
  regular journals. So, I shall use this Nobel Lecture as an
  opportunity to do something of less value, but which I cannot do
  elsewhere. I ask your indulgence in another manner. I shall
  include details of anecdotes which are of no value either
  scientifically, nor for understanding the development of ideas.
  They are included only to make the lecture more entertaining.</p>

  <p>I worked on this problem about eight years
  until the final publication in 1947. The beginning of the thing
  was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when I was an
  undergraduate student reading about the known physics, learning
  slowly about all these things that people were worrying about,
  and realizing ultimately that the fundamental problem of the day
  was that the quantum theory of electricity and magnetism was not
  completely satisfactory. This I gathered from books like those of
  Heitler and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Dirac</a>. I was inspired by
  the remarks in these books; not by the parts in which everything
  was proved and demonstrated carefully and calculated, because I
  couldn't understand those very well. At the young age what I
  could understand were the remarks about the fact that this
  doesn't make any sense, and the last sentence of the book of
  Dirac I can still remember, "It seems that some essentially new
  physical ideas are here needed." So, I had this as a challenge
  and an inspiration. I also had a personal feeling, that since
  they didn't get a satisfactory answer to the problem I wanted to
  solve, I don't have to pay a lot of attention to what they did
  do.</p>

  <p>I did gather from my readings, however,
  that two things were the source of the difficulties with the
  quantum electrodynamical theories. The first was an infinite
  energy of interaction of the electron with itself. And this
  difficulty existed even in the classical theory. The other
  difficulty came from some infinites which had to do with the
  infinite numbers of degrees of freedom in the field. As I
  understood it at the time (as nearly as I can remember) this was
  simply the difficulty that if you quantized the harmonic
  oscillators of the field (say in a box) each oscillator has a
  ground state energy of (&frac12;)<img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_a.gif" width="18" height="13" alt=
  ""> and there is an infinite number of modes in a box of every
  increasing frequency <i><font face="Symbol">w</font></i>, and
  therefore there is an infinite energy in the box. I now realize
  that that wasn't a completely correct statement of the central
  problem; it can be removed simply by changing the zero from which
  energy is measured. At any rate, I believed that the difficulty
  arose somehow from a combination of the electron acting on itself
  and the infinite number of degrees of freedom of the field.</p>

  <p>Well, it seemed to me quite evident that
  the idea that a particle acts on itself, that the electrical
  force acts on the same particle that generates it, is not a
  necessary one - it is a sort of a silly one, as a matter of fact.
  And, so I suggested to myself, that electrons cannot act on
  themselves, they can only act on other electrons. That means
  there is no field at all. You see, if all charges contribute to
  making a single common field, and if that common field acts back
  on all the charges, then each charge must act back on itself.
  Well, that was where the mistake was, there was no field. It was
  just that when you shook one charge, another would shake later.
  There was a direct interaction between charges, albeit with a
  delay. The law of force connecting the motion of one charge with
  another would just involve a delay. Shake this one, that one
  shakes later. The sun atom shakes; my eye electron shakes eight
  minutes later, because of a direct interaction across.</p>

  <p>Now, this has the attractive feature that
  it solves both problems at once. First, I can say immediately, I
  don't let the electron act on itself, I just let this act on
  that, hence, no self-energy! Secondly, there is not an infinite
  number of degrees of freedom in the field. There is no field at
  all; or if you insist on thinking in terms of ideas like that of
  a field, this field is always completely determined by the action
  of the particles which produce it. You shake this particle, it
  shakes that one, but if you want to think in a field way, the
  field, if it's there, would be entirely determined by the matter
  which generates it, and therefore, the field does not have any
  <i>independent</i> degrees of freedom and the infinities from the
  degrees of freedom would then be removed. As a matter of fact,
  when we look out anywhere and see light, we can always "see" some
  matter as the source of the light. We don't just see light
  (except recently some radio reception has been found with no
  apparent material source).</p>

  <p>You see then that my general plan was to
  first solve the classical problem, to get rid of the infinite
  self-energies in the classical theory, and to hope that when I
  made a quantum theory of it, everything would just be fine.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning, and the idea seemed
  so obvious to me and so elegant that I fell deeply in love with
  it. And, like falling in love with a woman, it is only possible
  if you do not know much about her, so you cannot see her faults.
  The faults will become apparent later, but after the love is
  strong enough to hold you to her. So, I was held to this theory,
  in spite of all difficulties, by my youthful enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Then I went to graduate school and
  somewhere along the line I learned what was wrong with the idea
  that an electron does not act on itself. When you accelerate an
  electron it radiates energy and you have to do extra work to
  account for that energy. The extra force against which this work
  is done is called the force of radiation resistance. The origin
  of this extra force was identified in those days, following
  Lorentz, as the action of the electron itself. The first term of
  this action, of the electron on itself, gave a kind of inertia
  (not quite relativistically satisfactory). But that inertia-like
  term was infinite for a point-charge. Yet the next term in the
  sequence gave an energy loss rate, which for a point-charge
  agrees exactly with the rate you get by calculating how much
  energy is radiated. So, the force of radiation resistance, which
  is absolutely necessary for the conservation of energy would
  disappear if I said that a charge could not act on itself.</p>

  <p>So, I learned in the interim when I went to
  graduate school the glaringly obvious fault of my own theory.
  But, I was still in love with the original theory, and was still
  thinking that with it lay the solution to the difficulties of
  quantum electrodynamics. So, I continued to try on and off to
  save it somehow. I must have some action develop on a given
  electron when I accelerate it to account for radiation
  resistance. But, if I let electrons only act on other electrons
  the only possible source for this action is another electron in
  the world. So, one day, when I was working for Professor Wheeler
  and could no longer solve the problem that he had given me, I
  thought about this again and I calculated the following. Suppose
  I have two charges - I shake the first charge, which I think of
  as a source and this makes the second one shake, but the second
  one shaking produces an effect back on the source. And so, I
  calculated how much that effect back on the first charge was,
  hoping it might add up the force of radiation resistance. It
  didn't come out right, of course, but I went to Professor Wheeler
  and told him my ideas. He said, - yes, but the answer you get for
  the problem with the two charges that you just mentioned will,
  unfortunately, depend upon the charge and the mass of the second
  charge and will vary inversely as the square of the distance
  <i>R</i>, between the charges, while the force of radiation
  resistance depends on none of these things. I thought, surely, he
  had computed it himself, but now having become a professor, I
  know that one can be wise enough to see immediately what some
  graduate student takes several weeks to develop. He also pointed
  out something that also bothered me, that if we had a situation
  with many charges all around the original source at roughly
  uniform density and if we added the effect of all the surrounding
  charges the inverse <i>R</i> square would be compensated by the
  <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> in the volume element and we would get a
  result proportional to the thickness of the layer, which would go
  to infinity. That is, one would have an infinite total effect
  back at the source. And, finally he said to me, and you forgot
  something else, when you accelerate the first charge, the second
  acts later, and then the reaction back here at the source would
  be still later. In other words, the action occurs at the wrong
  time. I suddenly realized what a stupid fellow I am, for what I
  had described and calculated was just ordinary reflected light,
  not radiation reaction.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>But, as I was stupid, so was Professor
  Wheeler that much more clever. For he then went on to give a
  lecture as though he had worked this all out before and was
  completely prepared, but he had not, he worked it out as he went
  along. First, he said, let us suppose that the return action by
  the charges in the absorber reaches the source by advanced waves
  as well as by the ordinary retarded waves of reflected light; so
  that the law of interaction acts backward in time, as well as
  forward in time. I was enough of a physicist at that time not to
  say, "Oh, no, how could that be?" For today all physicists know
  from studying <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html">Einstein</a> and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">Bohr</a>, that sometimes an
  idea which looks completely paradoxical at first, if analyzed to
  completion in all detail and in experimental situations, may, in
  fact, not be paradoxical. So, it did not bother me any more than
  it bothered Professor Wheeler to use advance waves for the back
  reaction - a solution of Maxwell's equations, which previously
  had not been physically used.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Professor Wheeler used advanced waves to
  get the reaction back at the right time and then he suggested
  this: If there were lots of electrons in the absorber, there
  would be an index of refraction <i>n</i>, so, the retarded waves
  coming from the source would have their wave lengths slightly
  modified in going through the absorber. Now, if we shall assume
  that the advanced waves come back from the absorber without an
  index - why? I don't know, let's assume they come back without an
  index - then, there will be a gradual shifting in phase between
  the return and the original signal so that we would only have to
  figure that the contributions act as if they come from only a
  finite thickness, that of the first wave zone. (More
  specifically, up to that depth where the phase in the medium is
  shifted appreciably from what it would be in vacuum, a thickness
  proportional to <font face="Symbol">l</font>/(<i>n</i>-1). ) Now,
  the less the number of electrons in here, the less each
  contributes, but the thicker will be the layer that effectively
  contributes because with less electrons, the index differs less
  from 1. The higher the charges of these electrons, the more each
  contribute, but the thinner the effective layer, because the
  index would be higher. And when we estimated it, (calculated
  without being careful to keep the correct numerical factor) sure
  enough, it came out that the action back at the source was
  completely independent of the properties of the charges that were
  in the surrounding absorber. Further, it was of just the right
  character to represent radiation resistance, but we were unable
  to see if it was just exactly the right size. He sent me home
  with orders to figure out exactly how much advanced and how much
  retarded wave we need to get the thing to come out numerically
  right, and after that, figure out what happens to the advanced
  effects that you would expect if you put a test charge here close
  to the source? For if all charges generate advanced, as well as
  retarded effects, why would that test not be affected by the
  advanced waves from the source?</p>

  <p>I found that you get the right answer if
  you use half-advanced and half-retarded as the field generated by
  each charge. That is, one is to use the solution of Maxwell's
  equation which is symmetrical in time and that the reason we got
  no advanced effects at a point close to the source in spite of
  the fact that the source was producing an advanced field is this.
  Suppose the source <i>s</i> surrounded by a spherical absorbing
  wall ten light seconds away, and that the test charge is one
  second to the right of the source. Then the source is as much as
  eleven seconds away from some parts of the wall and only nine
  seconds away from other parts. The source acting at time
  <i>t</i>=0 induces motions in the wall at time +10. Advanced
  effects from this can act on the test charge as early as eleven
  seconds earlier, or at <i>t</i>= -1. This is just at the time
  that the direct advanced waves from the source should reach the
  test charge, and it turns out the two effects are exactly equal
  and opposite and cancel out! At the later time +1 effects on the
  test charge from the source and from the walls are again equal,
  but this time are of the same sign and add to convert the
  half-retarded wave of the source to full retarded strength.</p>

  <p>Thus, it became clear that there was the
  possibility that if we assume all actions are <i>via</i>
  half-advanced and half-retarded solutions of Maxwell's equations
  and assume that all sources are surrounded by material absorbing
  all the the light which is emitted, then we could account for
  radiation resistance as a direct action of the charges of the
  absorber acting back by advanced waves on the source.</p>

  <p>Many months were devoted to checking all
  these points. I worked to show that everything is independent of
  the shape of the container, and so on, that the laws are exactly
  right, and that the advanced effects really cancel in every case.
  We always tried to increase the efficiency of our demonstrations,
  and to see with more and more clarity why it works. I won't bore
  you by going through the details of this. Because of our using
  advanced waves, we also had many apparent paradoxes, which we
  gradually reduced one by one, and saw that there was in fact no
  logical difficulty with the theory. It was perfectly
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>We also found that we could reformulate
  this thing in another way, and that is by a principle of least
  action. Since my original plan was to describe everything
  directly in terms of particle motions, it was my desire to
  represent this new theory without saying anything about fields.
  It turned out that we found a form for an action directly
  involving the motions of the charges only, which upon variation
  would give the equations of motion of these charges. The
  expression for this action <i>A</i> is</p>

  <p>where <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_b.gif" width="42" height="17" alt=

  function of some parameter <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_c.gif" width="142" height="17" alt=
  "">. The first term is the integral of proper time, the
  ordinary action of relativistic mechanics of free particles of
  mass <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>. (We sum in the usual way on the
  repeated index <font face="Symbol">m</font>.) The second term
  represents the electrical interaction of the charges. It is
  summed over each pair of charges (the factor &frac12; is to count
  each pair once, the term <i>i</i>=<i>j</i> is omitted to avoid
  self-action) .The interaction is a double integral over a delta
  function of the square of space-time interval
  <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> between two points on the paths. Thus,
  interaction occurs only when this interval vanishes, that is,
  along light cones.</p>

  <p>The fact that the interaction is exactly
  one-half advanced and half-retarded meant that we could write
  such a principle of least action, whereas interaction <i>via</i>
  retarded waves alone cannot be written in such a way.</p>

  <p>So, all of classical electrodynamics was
  contained in this very simple form. It looked good, and
  therefore, it was undoubtedly true, at least to the beginner. It
  automatically gave half-advanced and half-retarded effects and it
  was without fields. By omitting the term in the sum when
  <i>i</i>=<i>j</i>, <i>I</i> omit self-interaction and no longer
  have any infinite self-energy. This then was the hoped-for
  solution to the problem of ridding classical electrodynamics of
  the infinities.</p>

  <p>It turns out, of course, that you can
  reinstate fields if you wish to, but you have to keep track of
  the field produced by each particle separately. This is because
  to find the right field to act on a given particle, you must
  exclude the field that it creates itself. A single universal
  field to which all contribute will not do. This idea had been
  suggested earlier by Frenkel and so we called these Frenkel
  fields. This theory which allowed only particles to act on each
  other was equivalent to Frenkel's fields using half-advanced and
  half-retarded solutions.</p>

  <p>There were several suggestions for
  interesting modifications of electrodynamics. We discussed lots
  of them, but I shall report on only one. It was to replace this
  delta function in the interaction by another function, say,
  <i>f</i>(<i>I<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub></i>), which is not
  infinitely sharp. Instead of having the action occur only when
  the interval between the two charges is exactly zero, we would
  replace the delta function of <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> by a narrow
  peaked thing. Let's say that <i>f</i>(<i>Z</i>) is large only
  near <i>Z</i>=0 width of order <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>. Interactions
  will now occur when <i>T<sup>2</sup>-R<sup>2</sup></i> is of
  order <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> roughly where <i>T</i> is the time
  difference and <i>R</i> is the separation of the charges. This
  might look like it disagrees with experience, but if <i>a</i> is
  some small distance, like 10<sup>-13</sup> cm, it says that the
  time delay <i>T</i> in action is roughly <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig3.gif" width="56" height="19" alt=
  ""> or approximately, - if <i>R</i> is much larger than
  <i>a</i>, <i>T</i>=<i>R&plusmn;a<sup>2</sup>/2R</i>. This means
  that the deviation of time <i>T</i> from the ideal theoretical
  time <i>R</i> of Maxwell, gets smaller and smaller, the further
  the pieces are apart. Therefore, all theories involving in
  analyzing generators, motors, etc., in fact, all of the tests of
  electrodynamics that were available in Maxwell's time, would be
  adequately satisfied if were 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. If <i>R</i> is
  of the order of a centimeter this deviation in <i>T</i> is only
  10<sup>-26</sup> parts. So, it was possible, also, to change the
  theory in a simple manner and to still agree with all
  observations of classical electrodynamics. You have no clue of
  precisely what function to put in for <i>f</i>, but it was an
  interesting possibility to keep in mind when developing quantum
  electrodynamics.</p>

  <p>It also occurred to us that if we did that
  (replace <font face="Symbol">d</font> by <i>f</i>) we could not
  reinstate the term <i>i</i>=<i>j</i> in the sum because this
  would now represent in a relativistically invariant fashion a
  finite action of a charge on itself. In fact, it was possible to
  prove that if we did do such a thing, the main effect of the
  self-action (for not too rapid accelerations) would be to produce
  a modification of the mass. In fact, there need be no mass
  <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>, term, all the mechanical mass could be
  electromagnetic self-action. So, if you would like, we could also
  have another theory with a still simpler expression for the
  action <i>A</i>. In expression (1) only the second term is kept,
  the sum extended over all <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, and some
  function replaces <font face="Symbol">d</font>. Such a simple
  form could represent all of classical electrodynamics, which
  aside from gravitation is essentially all of classical
  physics.</p>

  <p>Although it may sound confusing, I am
  describing several different alternative theories at once. The
  important thing to note is that at this time we had all these in
  mind as different possibilities. There were several possible
  solutions of the difficulty of classical electrodynamics, any one
  of which might serve as a good starting point to the solution of
  the difficulties of quantum electrodynamics.</p>

  <p>I would also like to emphasize that by this
  time I was becoming used to a physical point of view different
  from the more customary point of view. In the customary view,
  things are discussed as a function of time in very great detail.
  For example, you have the field at this moment, a differential
  equation gives you the field at the next moment and so on; a
  method, which I shall call the Hamilton method, the time
  differential method. We have, instead (in (1) say) a thing that
  describes the character of the path throughout all of space and
  time. The behavior of nature is determined by saying her whole
  spacetime path has a certain character. For an action like (1)
  the equations obtained by variation (of X<sup>i</sup><font face=
  "Symbol">m</font> (<font face=
  "Symbol">a</font><sub><i>i</i></sub>)) are no longer at all easy
  to get back into Hamiltonian form. If you wish to use as
  variables only the coordinates of particles, then you can talk
  about the property of the paths - but the path of one particle at
  a given time is affected by the path of another at a different
  time. If you try to describe, therefore, things differentially,
  telling what the present conditions of the particles are, and how
  these present conditions will affect the future you see, it is
  impossible with particles alone, because something the particle
  did in the past is going to affect the future.</p>

  <p>Therefore, you need a lot of bookkeeping
  variables to keep track of what the particle did in the past.
  These are called field variables. You will, also, have to tell
  what the field is at this present moment, if you are to be able
  to see later what is going to happen. From the overall space-time
  view of the least action principle, the field disappears as
  nothing but bookkeeping variables insisted on by the Hamiltonian
  method.</p>

  <p>As a by-product of this same view, I
  received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at
  Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I
  know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass"
  "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!" And, then he
  explained on the telephone, "suppose that the world lines which
  we were ordinarily considering before in time and space - instead
  of only going up in time were a tremendous knot, and then, when
  we cut through the knot, by the plane corresponding to a fixed
  time, we would see many, many world lines and that would
  represent many electrons, except for one thing. If in one section
  this is an ordinary electron world line, in the section in which
  it reversed itself and is coming back from the future we have the
  wrong sign to the proper time - to the proper four velocities -
  and that's equivalent to changing the sign of the charge, and,
  therefore, that part of a path would act like a positron." "But,
  Professor", I said, "there aren't as many positrons as
  electrons." "Well, maybe they are hidden in the protons or
  something", he said. I did not take the idea that all the
  electrons were the same one from him as seriously as I took the
  observation that positrons could simply be represented as
  electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of
  their world lines. That, I stole!</p>

  <p>To summarize, when I was done with this, as
  a physicist I had gained two things. One, I knew many different
  ways of formulating classical electrodynamics, with many
  different mathematical forms. I got to know how to express the
  subject every which way. Second, I had a point of view - the
  overall space-time point of view - and a disrespect for the
  Hamiltonian method of describing physics.</p>

  <p>I would like to interrupt here to make a
  remark. The fact that electrodynamics can be written in so many
  ways - the differential equations of Maxwell, various minimum
  principles with fields, minimum principles without fields, all
  different kinds of ways, was something I knew, but I have never
  understood. It always seems odd to me that the fundamental laws
  of physics, when discovered, can appear in so many different
  forms that are not apparently identical at first, but, with a
  little mathematical fiddling you can show the relationship. An
  example of that is the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/index.html">Schr&ouml;dinger</a>
  equation and the <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html">Heisenberg</a> formulation
  of quantum mechanics. I don't know why this is - it remains a
  mystery, but it was something I learned from experience. There is
  always another way to say the same thing that doesn't look at all
  like the way you said it before. I don't know what the reason for
  this is. I think it is somehow a representation of the simplicity
  of nature. A thing like the inverse square law is just right to
  be represented by the solution of Poisson's equation, which,
  therefore, is a very different way to say the same thing that
  doesn't look at all like the way you said it before. I don't know
  what it means, that nature chooses these curious forms, but maybe
  that is a way of defining simplicity. Perhaps a thing is simple
  if you can describe it fully in several different ways without
  immediately knowing that you are describing the same thing.</p>

  <p>I was now convinced that since we had
  solved the problem of classical electrodynamics (and completely
  in accordance with my program from M.I.T., only direct
  interaction between particles, in a way that made fields
  unnecessary) that everything was definitely going to be all
  right. I was convinced that all I had to do was make a quantum
  theory analogous to the classical one and everything would be
  solved.</p>

  <p>So, the problem is only to make a quantum
  theory, which has as its classical analog, this expression (1).
  Now, there is no unique way to make a quantum theory from
  classical mechanics, although all the textbooks make believe
  there is. What they would tell you to do, was find the momentum
  variables and replace them by <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_d.gif" width="61" height="14" alt=
  "">, but I couldn't find a momentum variable, as there wasn't
  any.</p>

  <p>The character of quantum mechanics of the
  day was to write things in the famous Hamiltonian way - in the
  form of a differential equation, which described how the wave
  function changes from instant to instant, and in terms of an
  operator, <i>H</i>. If the classical physics could be reduced to
  a Hamiltonian form, everything was all right. Now, least action
  does not imply a Hamiltonian form if the action is a function of
  anything more than positions and velocities at the same moment.
  If the action is of the form of the integral of a function,

  <p>then you can start with the Lagrangian and
  then create a Hamiltonian and work out the quantum mechanics,
  more or less uniquely. But this thing (1) involves the key
  variables, positions, at two different times and therefore, it
  was not obvious what to do to make the quantum-mechanical
  analogue.</p>

  <p>I tried - I would struggle in various ways.
  One of them was this; if I had harmonic oscillators interacting
  with a delay in time, I could work out what the normal modes were
  and guess that the quantum theory of the normal modes was the
  same as for simple oscillators and kind of work my way back in
  terms of the original variables. I succeeded in doing that, but I
  hoped then to generalize to other than a harmonic oscillator, but
  I learned to my regret something, which many people have learned.
  The harmonic oscillator is too simple; very often you can work
  out what it should do in quantum theory without getting much of a
  clue as to how to generalize your results to other systems.</p>

  <p>So that didn't help me very much, but when
  I was struggling with this problem, I went to a beer party in the
  Nassau Tavern in Princeton. There was a gentleman, newly arrived
  from Europe (Herbert Jehle) who came and sat next to me.
  Europeans are much more serious than we are in America because
  they think that a good place to discuss intellectual matters is a
  beer party. So, he sat by me and asked, "what are you doing" and
  so on, and I said, "I'm drinking beer." Then I realized that he
  wanted to know what work I was doing and I told him I was
  struggling with this problem, and I simply turned to him and
  said, "listen, do you know any way of doing quantum mechanics,
  starting with action - where the action integral comes into the
  quantum mechanics?" "No", he said, "but Dirac has a paper in
  which the Lagrangian, at least, comes into quantum mechanics. I
  will show it to you tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Next day we went to the Princeton Library,
  they have little rooms on the side to discuss things, and he
  showed me this paper. What Dirac said was the following: There is
  in quantum mechanics a very important quantity which carries the
  wave function from one time to another, besides the differential
  equation but equivalent to it, a kind of a kernal, which we might
  call <i>K</i>(<i>x'</i>, <i>x</i>), which carries the wave
  function <font face="Symbol">j</font>(<i>x</i>) known at time
  <i>t</i>, to the wave function <font face=
  "Symbol">j</font>(<i>x'</i>) at time, <i>t+<font face=
  "Symbol">e</font></i> Dirac points out that this function
  <i>K</i> was <i>analogous</i> to the quantity in classical
  mechanics that you would calculate if you took the exponential of
  <i>i</i><font face="Symbol">e</font>, multiplied by the
  Lagrangian <img src="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_e.gif" width=
  "38" height="14" alt=" "> imagining that these two positions
  <i>x,x'</i> corresponded <i>t</i> and <i>t</i>+<font face=
  "Symbol">e</font>. In other words,</p>

  <table width="230" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

  </table>

  <p>Professor Jehle showed me this, I read it,
  he explained it to me, and I said, "what does he mean, they are
  analogous; what does that mean, <i>analogous</i>? What is the use
  of that?" He said, "you Americans! You always want to find a use
  for everything!" I said, that I thought that Dirac must mean that
  they were equal. "No", he explained, "he doesn't mean they are
  equal." "Well", I said, "let's see what happens if we make them
  equal."</p>

  <p>So I simply put them equal, taking the
  simplest example where the Lagrangian is
  &frac12;<i>Mx</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>V</i>(<i>x</i>) but soon found I
  had to put a constant of proportionality <i>A</i> in, suitably
  adjusted. When I substituted <img src=

  <p>and just calculated things out by Taylor
  series expansion, out came the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. So, I
  turned to Professor Jehle, not really understanding, and said,
  "well, you see Professor Dirac meant that they were
  proportional." Professor Jehle's eyes were bugging out - he had
  taken out a little notebook and was rapidly copying it down from
  the blackboard, and said, "no, no, this is an important
  discovery. You Americans are always trying to find out how
  something can be used. That's a good way to discover things!" So,
  I thought I was finding out what Dirac meant, but, as a matter of
  fact, had made the discovery that what Dirac thought was
  analogous, was, in fact, equal. I had then, at least, the
  connection between the Lagrangian and quantum mechanics, but
  still with wave functions and infinitesimal times.</p>

  <p>It must have been a day or so later when I
  was lying in bed thinking about these things, that I imagined
  what would happen if I wanted to calculate the wave function at a
  finite interval later.</p>

  <p>I would put one of these factors
  e<sup><i>i<font face="Symbol">e</font>L</i></sup> in here, and
  that would give me the wave functions the next moment,
  <i>t</i>+<font face="Symbol">e</font> and then I could substitute
  that back into (3) to get another factor of e<sup><i>i<font face=
  "Symbol">e</font>L</i></sup> and give me the wave function the
  next moment, <i>t</i>+2<font face="Symbol">e</font> and so on and
  so on. In that way I found myself thinking of a large number of
  integrals, one after the other in sequence. In the integrand was
  the product of the exponentials, which, of course, was the
  exponential of the sum of terms like <font face=
  "Symbol">e</font><i>L</i>. Now, <i>L</i> is the Lagrangian and
  <font face="Symbol">e</font> is like the time interval d<i>t</i>,
  so that if you took a sum of such terms, that's exactly like an
  integral. That's like Riemann's formula for the integral
  <img src="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_g.gif" width="5" height=
  "19" alt=" "> <i>L</i>d<i>t</i>, you just take the value at each
  point and add them together. We are to take the limit as
  <font face="Symbol">e</font>-0, of course. Therefore, the
  connection between the wave function of one instant and the wave
  function of another instant a finite time later could be obtained
  by an infinite number of integrals, (because <font face=
  "Symbol">e</font> goes to zero, of course) of exponential
  <img src="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_h.gif" width="36" height=
  "14" alt=" "> where <i>S</i> is the action expression (2). At
  last, I had succeeded in representing quantum mechanics directly
  in terms of the action <i>S</i>.</p>

  <p>This led later on to the idea of the
  amplitude for a path; that for each possible way that the
  particle can go from one point to another in space-time, there's
  an amplitude. That amplitude is e to the <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_i.gif" width="18" height="12" alt=
  ""> times the action for the path. Amplitudes from various
  paths superpose by addition. This then is another, a third way,
  of describing quantum mechanics, which looks quite different than
  that of Schr&ouml;dinger or Heisenberg, but which is equivalent
  to them.</p>

  <p>Now immediately after making a few checks
  on this thing, what I wanted to do, of course, was to substitute
  the action (1) for the other (2). The first trouble was that I
  could not get the thing to work with the relativistic case of
  spin one-half. However, although I could deal with the matter
  only nonrelativistically, I could deal with the light or the
  photon interactions perfectly well by just putting the
  interaction terms of (1) into any action, replacing the mass
  terms by the non-relativistic (<i>Mx</i><sup>2</sup>/2)d<i>t</i>.
  When the action has a delay, as it now had, and involved more
  than one time, I had to lose the idea of a wave function. That
  is, I could no longer describe the program as; given the
  amplitude for all positions at a certain time to compute the
  amplitude at another time. However, that didn't cause very much
  trouble. It just meant developing a new idea. Instead of wave
  functions we could talk about this; that if a source of a certain
  kind emits a particle, and a detector is there to receive it, we
  can give the amplitude that the source will emit and the detector
  receive. We do this without specifying the exact instant that the
  source emits or the exact instant that any detector receives,
  without trying to specify the state of anything at any particular
  time in between, but by just finding the amplitude for the
  complete experiment. And, then we could discuss how that
  amplitude would change if you had a scattering sample in between,
  as you rotated and changed angles, and so on, without really
  having any wave functions.</p>

  <p>It was also possible to discover what the
  old concepts of energy and momentum would mean with this
  generalized action. And, so I believed that I had a quantum
  theory of classical electrodynamics - or rather of this new
  classical electrodynamics described by action (1). I made a
  number of checks. If I took the Frenkel field point of view,
  which you remember was more differential, I could convert it
  directly to quantum mechanics in a more conventional way. The
  only problem was how to specify in quantum mechanics the
  classical boundary conditions to use only half-advanced and
  half-retarded solutions. By some ingenuity in defining what that
  meant, I found that the quantum mechanics with Frenkel fields,
  plus a special boundary condition, gave me back this action, (1)
  in the new form of quantum mechanics with a delay. So, various
  things indicated that there wasn't any doubt I had everything
  straightened out.</p>

  <p>It was also easy to guess how to modify the
  electrodynamics, if anybody ever wanted to modify it. I just
  changed the delta to an <i>f,</i> just as I would for the
  classical case. So, it was very easy, a simple thing. To describe
  the old retarded theory without explicit mention of fields I
  would have to write probabilities, not just amplitudes. I would
  have to square my amplitudes and that would involve double path
  integrals in which there are two <i>S</i>'s and so forth. Yet, as
  I worked out many of these things and studied different forms and
  different boundary conditions. I got a kind of funny feeling that
  things weren't exactly right. I could not clearly identify the
  difficulty and in one of the short periods during which I
  imagined I had laid it to rest, I published a thesis and received
  my Ph.D.</p>

  <p>During the war, I didn't have time to work
  on these things very extensively, but wandered about on buses and
  so forth, with little pieces of paper, and struggled to work on
  it and discovered indeed that there was something wrong,
  something terribly wrong. I found that if one generalized the
  action from the nice Langrangian forms (2) to these forms (1)
  then the quantities which I defined as energy, and so on, would
  be complex. The energy values of stationary states wouldn't be
  real and probabilities of events wouldn't add up to 100%. That
  is, if you took the probability that this would happen and that
  would happen - everything you could think of would happen, it
  would not add up to one.</p>

  <p>Another problem on which I struggled very
  hard, was to represent relativistic electrons with this new
  quantum mechanics. I wanted to do a unique and different way -
  and not just by copying the operators of Dirac into some kind of
  an expression and using some kind of Dirac algebra instead of
  ordinary complex numbers. I was very much encouraged by the fact
  that in one space dimension, I did find a way of giving an
  amplitude to every path by limiting myself to paths, which only
  went back and forth at the speed of light. The amplitude was
  simple (<i>i</i><font face="Symbol">e</font>) to a power equal to
  the number of velocity reversals where I have divided the time
  into steps and I am allowed to reverse velocity only at such a
  time. This gives (as approaches zero) Dirac's equation in two
  dimensions - one dimension of space and one of time <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_j.gif" width="68" height="14" alt=
  "">.</p>

  <p>Dirac's wave function has four components
  in four dimensions, but in this case, it has only two components
  and this rule for the amplitude of a path automatically generates
  the need for two components. Because if this is the formula for
  the amplitudes of path, it will not do you any good to know the
  total amplitude of all paths, which come into a given point to
  find the amplitude to reach the next point. This is because for
  the next time, if it came in from the right, there is no new
  factor <i>i</i><font face="Symbol">e</font> if it goes out to the
  right, whereas, if it came in from the left there was a new
  factor i<font face="Symbol">e</font>. So, to continue this same
  information forward to the next moment, it was not sufficient
  information to know the total amplitude to arrive, but you had to
  know the amplitude to arrive from the right and the amplitude to
  arrive to the left, independently. If you did, however, you could
  then compute both of those again independently and thus you had
  to carry two amplitudes to form a differential equation (first
  order in time).</p>

  <p>And, so I dreamed that if I were clever, I
  would find a formula for the amplitude of a path that was
  beautiful and simple for three dimensions of space and one of
  time, which would be equivalent to the Dirac equation, and for
  which the four components, matrices, and all those other
  mathematical funny things would come out as a simple consequence
  - I have never succeeded in that either. But, I did want to
  mention some of the unsuccessful things on which I spent almost
  as much effort, as on the things that did work.</p>

  <p>To summarize the situation a few years
  after the way, I would say, I had much experience with quantum
  electrodynamics, at least in the knowledge of many different ways
  of formulating it, in terms of path integrals of actions and in
  other forms. One of the important by-products, for example, of
  much experience in these simple forms, was that it was easy to
  see how to combine together what was in those days called the
  longitudinal and transverse fields, and in general, to see
  clearly the relativistic invariance of the theory. Because of the
  need to do things differentially there had been, in the standard
  quantum electrodynamics, a complete split of the field into two
  parts, one of which is called the longitudinal part and the other
  mediated by the photons, or transverse waves. The longitudinal
  part was described by a Coulomb potential acting instantaneously
  in the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, while the transverse part had
  entirely different description in terms of quantization of the
  transverse waves. This separation depended upon the relativistic
  tilt of your axes in spacetime. People moving at different
  velocities would separate the same field into longitudinal and
  transverse fields in a different way. Furthermore, the entire
  formulation of quantum mechanics insisting, as it did, on the
  wave function at a given time, was hard to analyze
  relativistically. Somebody else in a different coordinate system
  would calculate the succession of events in terms of wave
  functions on differently cut slices of space-time, and with a
  different separation of longitudinal and transverse parts. The
  Hamiltonian theory did not look relativistically invariant,
  although, of course, it was. One of the great advantages of the
  overall point of view, was that you could see the relativistic
  invariance right away - or as <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">Schwinger</a> would say -
  the covariance was manifest. I had the advantage, therefore, of
  having a manifestedly covariant form for quantum electrodynamics
  with suggestions for modifications and so on. I had the
  disadvantage that if I took it too seriously - I mean, if I took
  it seriously at all in this form, - I got into trouble with these
  complex energies and the failure of adding probabilities to one
  and so on. I was unsuccessfully struggling with that.</p>

  <p>Then <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1955/index.html">Lamb</a> did his experiment,
  measuring the separation of the 2<i>S</i>&frac12; and
  2<i>P</i>&frac12; levels of hydrogen, finding it to be about 1000
  megacycles of frequency difference. Professor <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Bethe</a>, with whom I was
  then associated at Cornell, is a man who has this characteristic:
  If there's a good experimental number you've got to figure it out
  from theory. So, he forced the quantum electrodynamics of the day
  to give him an answer to the separation of these two levels. He
  pointed out that the self-energy of an electron itself is
  infinite, so that the calculated energy of a bound electron
  should also come out infinite. But, when you calculated the
  separation of the two energy levels in terms of the corrected
  mass instead of the old mass, it would turn out, he thought, that
  the theory would give convergent finite answers. He made an
  estimate of the splitting that way and found out that it was
  still divergent, but he guessed that was probably due to the fact
  that he used an unrelativistic theory of the matter. Assuming it
  would be convergent if relativistically treated, he estimated he
  would get about a thousand megacycles for the Lamb-shift, and
  thus, made the most important discovery in the history of the
  theory of quantum electrodynamics. He worked this out on the
  train from Ithaca, New York to Schenectady and telephoned me
  excitedly from Schenectady to tell me the result, which I don't
  remember fully appreciating at the time.</p>

  <p>Returning to Cornell, he gave a lecture on
  the subject, which I attended. He explained that it gets very
  confusing to figure out exactly which infinite term corresponds
  to what in trying to make the correction for the infinite change
  in mass. If there were any modifications whatever, he said, even
  though not physically correct, (that is not necessarily the way
  nature actually works) but any modification whatever at high
  frequencies, which would make this correction finite, then there
  would be no problem at all to figuring out how to keep track of
  everything. You just calculate the finite mass correction
  <font face="Symbol"><i>D</i></font><i>m</i> to the electron mass
  <i>m<sub>o</sub></i>, substitute the numerical values of
  <i>m<sub>o</sub></i>+<font face="Symbol"><i>D</i></font><i>m</i>
  for <i>m</i> in the results for any other problem and all these
  ambiguities would be resolved. If, in addition, this method were
  relativistically invariant, then we would be absolutely sure how
  to do it without destroying relativistically invariant.</p>

  <p>After the lecture, I went up to him and
  told him, "I can do that for you, I'll bring it in for you
  tomorrow." I guess I knew every way to modify quantum
  electrodynamics known to man, at the time. So, I went in next
  day, and explained what would correspond to the modification of
  the delta-function to <i>f</i> and asked him to explain to me how
  you calculate the self-energy of an electron, for instance, so we
  can figure out if it's finite.</p>

  <p>I want you to see an interesting point. I
  did not take the advice of Professor Jehle to find out how it was
  useful. I never used all that machinery which I had cooked up to
  solve a single relativistic problem. I hadn't even calculated the
  self-energy of an electron up to that moment, and was studying
  the difficulties with the conservation of probability, and so on,
  without actually doing anything, except discussing the general
  properties of the theory.</p>

  <p>But now I went to Professor Bethe, who
  explained to me on the blackboard, as we worked together, how to
  calculate the self-energy of an electron. Up to that time when
  you did the integrals they had been logarithmically divergent. I
  told him how to make the relativistically invariant modifications
  that I thought would make everything all right. We set up the
  integral which then diverged at the sixth power of the frequency
  instead of logarithmically!</p>

  <p>So, I went back to my room and worried
  about this thing and went around in circles trying to figure out
  what was wrong because I was sure physically everything had to
  come out finite, I couldn't understand how it came out infinite.
  I became more and more interested and finally realized I had to
  learn how to make a calculation. So, ultimately, I taught myself
  how to calculate the self-energy of an electron working my
  patient way through the terrible confusion of those days of
  negative energy states and holes and longitudinal contributions
  and so on. When I finally found out how to do it and did it with
  the modifications I wanted to suggest, it turned out that it was
  nicely convergent and finite, just as I had expected. Professor
  Bethe and I have never been able to discover what we did wrong on
  that blackboard two months before, but apparently we just went
  off somewhere and we have never been able to figure out where. It
  turned out, that what I had proposed, if we had carried it out
  without making a mistake would have been all right and would have
  given a finite correction. Anyway, it forced me to go back over
  all this and to convince myself physically that nothing can go
  wrong. At any rate, the correction to mass was now finite,
  proportional to <img src="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/fig_k.gif"
  width="53" height="14" alt=" ">where <i>a</i> is the width of
  that function <i>f</i> which was substituted for <font face=
  "Symbol">d</font>. If you wanted an unmodified electrodynamics,
  you would have to take <i>a</i> equal to zero, getting an
  infinite mass correction. But, that wasn't the point. Keeping a
  finite, I simply followed the program outlined by Professor Bethe
  and showed how to calculate all the various things, the
  scatterings of electrons from atoms without radiation, the shifts
  of levels and so forth, calculating everything in terms of the
  experimental mass, and noting that the results as Bethe
  suggested, were not sensitive to <i>a</i> in this form and even
  had a definite limit as <i>a</i><font face=
  "Wingdings 3">g</font>0.</p>

  <p>The rest of my work was simply to improve
  the techniques then available for calculations, making diagrams
  to help analyze perturbation theory quicker. Most of this was
  first worked out by guessing - you see, I didn't have the
  relativistic theory of matter. For example, it seemed to me
  obvious that the velocities in non-relativistic formulas have to
  be replaced by Dirac's matrix <font face="Symbol">a</font> or in
  the more relativistic forms by the operators <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/figl.gif" width="13" height="16" alt=
  "">. I just took my guesses from the forms that I had worked
  out using path integrals for nonrelativistic matter, but
  relativistic light. It was easy to develop rules of what to
  substitute to get the relativistic case. I was very surprised to
  discover that it was not known at that time, that every one of
  the formulas that had been worked out so patiently by separating
  longitudinal and transverse waves could be obtained from the
  formula for the transverse waves alone, if instead of summing
  over only the two perpendicular polarization directions you would
  sum over all four possible directions of polarization. It was so
  obvious from the action (1) that I thought it was general
  knowledge and would do it all the time. I would get into
  arguments with people, because I didn't realize they didn't know
  that; but, it turned out that all their patient work with the
  longitudinal waves was always equivalent to just extending the
  sum on the two transverse directions of polarization over all
  four directions. This was one of the amusing advantages of the
  method. In addition, I included diagrams for the various terms of
  the perturbation series, improved notations to be used, worked
  out easy ways to evaluate integrals, which occurred in these
  problems, and so on, and made a kind of handbook on how to do
  quantum electrodynamics.</p>

  <p>But one step of importance that was
  physically new was involved with the negative energy sea of
  Dirac, which caused me so much logical difficulty. I got so
  confused that I remembered Wheeler's old idea about the positron
  being, maybe, the electron going backward in time. Therefore, in
  the time dependent perturbation theory that was usual for getting
  self-energy, I simply supposed that for a while we could go
  backward in the time, and looked at what terms I got by running
  the time variables backward. They were the same as the terms that
  other people got when they did the problem a more complicated
  way, using holes in the sea, except, possibly, for some signs.
  These, I, at first, determined empirically by inventing and
  trying some rules.</p>

  <p>I have tried to explain that all the
  improvements of relativistic theory were at first more or less
  straightforward, semi-empirical shenanigans. Each time I would
  discover something, however, I would go back and I would check it
  so many ways, compare it to every problem that had been done
  previously in electrodynamics (and later, in weak coupling meson
  theory) to see if it would always agree, and so on, until I was
  absolutely convinced of the truth of the various rules and
  regulations which I concocted to simplify all the work.</p>

  <p>During this time, people had been
  developing meson theory, a subject I had not studied in any
  detail. I became interested in the possible application of my
  methods to perturbation calculations in meson theory. But, what
  was meson theory? All I knew was that meson theory was something
  analogous to electrodynamics, except that particles corresponding
  to the photon had a mass. It was easy to guess the <font face=
  "Symbol">d</font>-function in (1), which was a solution of
  d'Alembertian equals zero, was to be changed to the corresponding
  solution of d'Alembertian equals <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>. Next,
  there were different kind of mesons - the one in closest analogy
  to photons, coupled <i>via</i> <img src=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/figm.gif" width="22" height="16" alt=
  "">, are called vector mesons - there were also scalar mesons.
  Well, maybe that corresponds to putting unity in place of the
  <img src="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/figl.gif" width="13" height=
  "16" alt=" ">, I would here then speak of "pseudo vector
  coupling" and I would guess what that probably was. I didn't have
  the knowledge to understand the way these were defined in the
  conventional papers because they were expressed at that time in
  terms of creation and annihilation operators, and so on, which, I
  had not successfully learned. I remember that when someone had
  started to teach me about creation and annihilation operators,
  that this operator creates an electron, I said, "how do you
  create an electron? It disagrees with the conservation of
  charge", and in that way, I blocked my mind from learning a very
  practical scheme of calculation. Therefore, I had to find as many
  opportunities as possible to test whether I guessed right as to
  what the various theories were.</p>

  <p>One day a dispute arose at a Physical
  Society meeting as to the correctness of a calculation by
  Slotnick of the interaction of an electron with a neutron using
  pseudo scalar theory with pseudo vector coupling and also, pseudo
  scalar theory with pseudo scalar coupling. He had found that the
  answers were not the same, in fact, by one theory, the result was
  divergent, although convergent with the other. Some people
  believed that the two theories must give the same answer for the
  problem. This was a welcome opportunity to test my guesses as to
  whether I really did understand what these two couplings were.
  So, I went home, and during the evening I worked out the electron
  neutron scattering for the pseudo scalar and pseudo vector
  coupling, saw they were not equal and subtracted them, and worked
  out the difference in detail. The next day at the meeting, I saw
  Slotnick and said, "Slotnick, I worked it out last night, I
  wanted to see if I got the same answers you do. I got a different
  answer for each coupling - but, I would like to check in detail
  with you because I want to make sure of my methods." And, he
  said, "what do you mean you worked it out last night, it took me
  six months!" And, when we compared the answers he looked at mine
  and he asked, "what is that <i>Q</i> in there, that variable
  <i>Q</i>?" (I had expressions like (tan <sup>-1</sup><i>Q</i>)
  /<i>Q</i> etc.). I said, "that's the momentum transferred by the
  electron, the electron deflected by different angles." "Oh", he
  said, "no, I only have the limiting value as <i>Q</i> approaches
  zero; the forward scattering." Well, it was easy enough to just
  substitute <i>Q</i> equals zero in my form and I then got the
  same answers as he did. But, it took him six months to do the
  case of zero momentum transfer, whereas, during one evening I had
  done the finite and arbitrary momentum transfer. That was a
  thrilling moment for me, like receiving the Nobel Prize, because
  that convinced me, at last, I did have some kind of method and
  technique and understood how to do something that other people
  did not know how to do. That was my moment of triumph in which I
  realized I really had succeeded in working out something
  worthwhile.</p>

  <p>At this stage, I was urged to publish this
  because everybody said it looks like an easy way to make
  calculations, and wanted to know how to do it. I had to publish
  it, missing two things; one was proof of every statement in a
  mathematically conventional sense. Often, even in a physicist's
  sense, I did not have a demonstration of how to get all of these
  rules and equations from conventional electrodynamics. But, I did
  know from experience, from fooling around, that everything was,
  in fact, equivalent to the regular electrodynamics and had
  partial proofs of many pieces, although, I never really sat down,
  like Euclid did for the geometers of Greece, and made sure that
  you could get it all from a single simple set of axioms. As a
  result, the work was criticized, I don't know whether favorably
  or unfavorably, and the "method" was called the "intuitive
  method". For those who do not realize it, however, I should like
  to emphasize that there is a lot of work involved in using this
  "intuitive method" successfully. Because no simple clear proof of
  the formula or idea presents itself, it is necessary to do an
  unusually great amount of checking and rechecking for consistency
  and correctness in terms of what is known, by comparing to other
  analogous examples, limiting cases, etc. In the face of the lack
  of direct mathematical demonstration, one must be careful and
  thorough to make sure of the point, and one should make a
  perpetual attempt to demonstrate as much of the formula as
  possible. Nevertheless, a very great deal more truth can become
  known than can be proven.</p>

  <p>It must be clearly understood that in all
  this work, I was representing the conventional electrodynamics
  with retarded interaction, and not my half-advanced and
  half-retarded theory corresponding to (1). I merely use (1) to
  guess at forms. And, one of the forms I guessed at corresponded
  to changing <font face="Symbol">d</font> to a function <i>f</i>
  of width <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, so that I could calculate finite
  results for all of the problems. This brings me to the second
  thing that was missing when I published the paper, an unresolved
  difficulty. With <font face="Symbol">d</font> replaced by
  <i>f</i> the calculations would give results which were not
  "unitary", that is, for which the sum of the probabilities of all
  alternatives was not unity. The deviation from unity was very
  small, in practice, if <i>a</i> was very small. In the limit that
  I took <i>a</i> very tiny, it might not make any difference. And,
  so the process of the renormalization could be made, you could
  calculate everything in terms of the experimental mass and then
  take the limit and the apparent difficulty that the unitary is
  violated temporarily seems to disappear. I was unable to
  demonstrate that, as a matter of fact, it does.</p>

  <p>It is lucky that I did not wait to
  straighten out that point, for as far as I know, nobody has yet
  been able to resolve this question. Experience with meson
  theories with stronger couplings and with strongly coupled vector
  photons, although not proving anything, convinces me that if the
  coupling were stronger, or if you went to a higher order (137th
  order of perturbation theory for electrodynamics), this
  difficulty would remain in the limit and there would be real
  trouble. That is, I believe there is really no satisfactory
  quantum electrodynamics, but I'm not sure. And, I believe, that
  one of the reasons for the slowness of present-day progress in
  understanding the <i>strong</i> interactions is that there isn't
  any relativistic theoretical model, from which you can really
  calculate everything. Although, it is usually said, that the
  difficulty lies in the fact that strong interactions are too hard
  to calculate, I believe, it is really because strong interactions
  in field theory have no solution, have no sense they're either
  infinite, or, if you try to modify them, the modification
  destroys the unitarity. I don't think we have a completely
  satisfactory relativistic quantum-mechanical model, even one that
  doesn't agree with nature, but, at least, agrees with the logic
  that the sum of probability of all alternatives has to be 100%.
  Therefore, I think that the renormalization theory is simply a
  way to sweep the difficulties of the divergences of
  electrodynamics under the rug. I am, of course, not sure of
  that.</p>

  <p>This completes the story of the development
  of the space-time view of quantum electrodynamics. I wonder if
  anything can be learned from it. I doubt it. It is most striking
  that most of the ideas developed in the course of this research
  were not ultimately used in the final result. For example, the
  half-advanced and half-retarded potential was not finally used,
  the action expression (1) was not used, the idea that charges do
  not act on themselves was abandoned. The path-integral
  formulation of quantum mechanics was useful for guessing at final
  expressions and at formulating the general theory of
  electrodynamics in new ways - although, strictly it was not
  absolutely necessary. The same goes for the idea of the positron
  being a backward moving electron, it was very convenient, but not
  strictly necessary for the theory because it is exactly
  equivalent to the negative energy sea point of view.</p>

  <p>We are struck by the very large number of
  different physical viewpoints and widely different mathematical
  formulations that are all equivalent to one another. The method
  used here, of reasoning in physical terms, therefore, appears to
  be extremely inefficient. On looking back over the work, I can
  only feel a kind of regret for the enormous amount of physical
  reasoning and mathematically re-expression which ends by merely
  re-expressing what was previously known, although in a form which
  is much more efficient for the calculation of specific problems.
  Would it not have been much easier to simply work entirely in the
  mathematical framework to elaborate a more efficient expression?
  This would certainly seem to be the case, but it must be remarked
  that although the problem actually solved was only such a
  reformulation, the problem originally tackled was the (possibly
  still unsolved) problem of avoidance of the infinities of the
  usual theory. Therefore, a new theory was sought, not just a
  modification of the old. Although the quest was unsuccessful, we
  should look at the question of the value of physical ideas in
  developing a <i>new</i> theory.</p>

  <p>Many different physical ideas can describe
  the same physical reality. Thus, classical electrodynamics can be
  described by a field view, or an action at a distance view, etc.
  Originally, Maxwell filled space with idler wheels, and Faraday
  with fields lines, but somehow the Maxwell equations themselves
  are pristine and independent of the elaboration of words
  attempting a physical description. The only true physical
  description is that describing the experimental meaning of the
  quantities in the equation - or better, the way the equations are
  to be used in describing experimental observations. This being
  the case perhaps the best way to proceed is to try to guess
  equations, and disregard physical models or descriptions. For
  example, McCullough guessed the correct equations for light
  propagation in a crystal long before his colleagues using elastic
  models could make head or tail of the phenomena, or again, Dirac
  obtained his equation for the description of the electron by an
  almost purely mathematical proposition. A simple physical view by
  which all the contents of this equation can be seen is still
  lacking.</p>

  <p>Therefore, I think equation guessing might
  be the best method to proceed to obtain the laws for the part of
  physics which is presently unknown. Yet, when I was much younger,
  I tried this equation guessing and I have seen many students try
  this, but it is very easy to go off in wildly incorrect and
  impossible directions. I think the problem is not to find the
  <i>best</i> or most efficient method to proceed to a discovery,
  but to find any method at all. Physical reasoning does help some
  people to generate suggestions as to how the unknown may be
  related to the known. Theories of the known, which are described
  by different physical ideas may be equivalent in all their
  predictions and are hence scientifically indistinguishable.
  However, they are not psychologically identical when trying to
  move from that base into the unknown. For different views suggest
  different kinds of modifications which might be made and hence
  are not equivalent in the hypotheses one generates from them in
  ones attempt to understand what is not yet understood. I,
  therefore, think that a good theoretical physicist today might
  find it useful to have a wide range of physical viewpoints and
  mathematical expressions of the same theory (for example, of
  quantum electrodynamics) available to him. This may be asking too
  much of one man. Then new students should as a class have this.
  If every individual student follows the same current fashion in
  expressing and thinking about electrodynamics or field theory,
  then the variety of hypotheses being generated to understand
  strong interactions, say, is limited. Perhaps rightly so, for
  possibly the chance is high that the truth lies in the
  fashionable direction. But, on the off-chance that it is in
  another direction - a direction obvious from an unfashionable
  view of field theory - who will find it? Only someone who has
  sacrificed himself by teaching himself quantum electrodynamics
  from a peculiar and unusual point of view; one that he may have
  to invent for himself. I say sacrificed himself because he most
  likely will get nothing from it, because the truth may lie in
  another direction, perhaps even the fashionable one.</p>

  <p>But, if my own experience is any guide, the
  sacrifice is really not great because if the peculiar viewpoint
  taken is truly experimentally equivalent to the usual in the
  realm of the known there is always a range of applications and
  problems in this realm for which the special viewpoint gives one
  a special power and clarity of thought, which is valuable in
  itself. Furthermore, in the search for new laws, you always have
  the psychological excitement of feeling that possible nobody has
  yet thought of the crazy possibility you are looking at right
  now.</p>

  <p>So what happened to the old theory that I
  fell in love with as a youth? Well, I would say it's become an
  old lady, that has very little attractive left in her and the
  young today will not have their hearts pound  anymore when they look at
  her. But, we can say the best we can for any old woman,
  that she has been a very good mother and she has given birth to
  some very good children. And, I thank the Swedish Academy of
  Sciences for complimenting one of them. Thank you.</p>
