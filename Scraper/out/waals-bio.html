  <h1>Johannes Diderik van der Waals - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="waals.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Johannes Diderik van der Waals</b>
  was born on November 23, 1837 in Leyden, The Netherlands, the son
  of Jacobus van der Waals and Elisabeth van den Burg. After having
  finished elementary education at his birthplace he became a
  schoolteacher. Although he had no knowledge of classical
  languages, and thus was not allowed to take academic
  examinations, he continued studying at Leyden University in his
  spare time during 1862-65. In this way he also obtained teaching
  certificates in mathematics and physics.<br>
  <br>
  In 1864 he was appointed teacher at a secondary school at
  Deventer; in 1866 he moved to The Hague, first as teacher and
  later as Director of one of the secondary schools in that
  town.<br>
  <br>
  New legislation whereby university students in science were
  exempted from the conditions concerning prior classical education
  enabled Van der Waals to sit for university examinations. In 1873
  he obtained his doctor's degree for a thesis entitled <i>Over de
  Continu&iuml;teit van den Gas - en Vloeistoftoestand</i> (On the
  continuity of the gas and liquid state), which put him at once in
  the foremost rank of physicists. In this thesis he put forward an
  "Equation of State" embracing both the gaseous and the liquid
  state; he could demonstrate that these two states of aggregation
  not only merge into each other in a continuous manner, but that
  they are in fact of the same nature. The importance of this
  conclusion from Van der Waals' very first paper can be judged
  from the remarks made by James Clerk Maxwell in Nature, "that
  there can be no doubt that the name of Van der Waals will soon be
  among the foremost in molecular science" and "It has certainly
  directed the attention of more than one inquirer to the study of
  the Low-Dutch language in which it is written" (Maxwell probably
  meant to say "Low-German", which would also be incorrect, since
  Dutch is a language in its own right). Subsequently, numerous
  papers on this and related subjects were published in the
  <i>Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences</i>
  and in the <i>Archives N&eacute;erlandaises</i>, and they were also
  translated into other languages.<br>
  <br>
  When, in 1876, the new Law on Higher Education was established
  which promoted the old Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam to
  university status, Van der Waals was appointed the first
  Professor of Physics. Together with <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/index.html">Van't Hoff</a> and Hugo de
  Vries, the geneticist, he contributed to the fame of the
  University, and remained faithful to it until his retirement, in
  spite of enticing invitations from elsewhere.<br>
  <br>
  The immediate cause of Van der Waals' interest in the subject of
  his thesis was R. Clausius' treatise considering heat as a
  phenomenon of motion, which led him to look for an explanation
  for T. Andrews' experiments (1869) revealing the existence of
  "critical temperatures " in gases. It was Van der Waals' genius
  that made him see the necessity of taking into account the
  volumes of molecules and the intermolecular forces ("Van der
  Waals forces", as they are now generally called) in establishing
  the relationship between the pressure, volume and temperature of
  gases and liquids.<br>
  <br>
  A second great discovery - arrived at after much arduous work -
  was published in 1880, when he enunciated the Law of
  Corresponding States. This showed that if pressure is expressed
  as a simple function of the critical pressure, volume as one of
  the critical volume, and temperature as one of the critical
  temperature, a general form of the equation of state is obtained
  which is applicable to all substances, since the three constants
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>R</i> in the equation, which can be
  expressed in the critical quantities of a particular substance,
  will disappear. It was this law which served as a guide during
  experiments which ultimately led to the liquefaction of hydrogen
  by J. Dewar in 1898 and of helium by <a href=
  "../1913/index.html">H. Kamerlingh Onnes</a> in 1908. The latter,
  who in 1913 received the Nobel Prize for his low-temperature
  studies and his production of liquid helium, wrote in 1910 "that
  Van der Waals' studies have always been considered as a magic
  wand for carrying out experiments and that the Cryogenic
  Laboratory at Leyden has developed under the influence of his
  theories ".<br>
  <br>
  Ten years later, in 1890, the first treatise on the "Theory of
  Binary Solutions" appeared in the <i>Archives
  N&eacute;erlandaises</i> - another great achievement of Van der
  Waals. By relating his equation of state with the Second Law of
  Thermodynamics, in the form first proposed by W. Gibbs in his
  treatises on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances, he was
  able to arrive at a graphical representation of his mathematical
  formulations in the form of a surface which he called
  "Psi-surface" in honour of Gibbs, who had chosen the Greek letter
  Psi as a symbol for the free energy, which he realised was
  significant for the equilibrium. The theory of binary mixtures
  gave rise to numerous series of experiments, one of the first
  being carried out by J. P. Kuenen, who found characteristics of
  critical phenomena fully predictable by the theory. Lectures on
  this subject were subsequently assembled in the <i>Lehrbuch der
  Thermodynamik</i> (Textbook of thermodynamics) by Van der Waals
  and Ph. Kohnstamm.<br>
  <br>
  Mention should also be made of Van der Waals' thermodynamic
  theory of capillarity, which in its basic form first appeared in
  1893. In this, he accepted the existence of a gradual, though
  very rapid, change of density at the boundary layer between
  liquid and vapour - a view which differed from that of Gibbs, who
  assumed a sudden transition of the density of the fluid into that
  of the vapour. In contrast to Laplace, who had earlier formed a
  theory on these phenomena, Van der Waals also held the view that
  the molecules are in permanent, rapid motion. Experiments with
  regard to phenomena in the vicinity of the critical temperature
  decided in favour of Van der Waals' concepts.<br>
  <br>
  Van der Waals was the recipient of numerous honours and
  distinctions, of which the following should be particularly
  mentioned. He received an honorary doctorate of the University of
  Cambridge; was made honorary member of the Imperial Society of
  Naturalists of Moscow, the Royal Irish Academy and the American
  Philosophical Society; corresponding member of the Institut de
  France and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin; associate
  member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium; and foreign
  member of the Chemical Society of London, the National Academy of
  Sciences of the U.S.A., and of the Accademia dei Lincei of
  Rome.<br>
  <br>
  In 1864, Van der Waals married Anna Magdalena Smit, who died
  early. He never married again. They had three daughters and one
  son. The daughters were Anne Madeleine who, after her mother's
  early death, ran the house and looked after her father;
  Jacqueline Elisabeth, who was a teacher of history and a
  well-known poetess; and Johanna Diderica, who was a teacher of
  English. The son, Johannes Diderik Jr., was Professor of Physics
  at Groningen University 1903-08, and subsequently succeeded his
  father in the Physics Chair of the University of Amsterdam.<br>
  <br>
  Van der Waals' main recreations were walking, particularly in the
  country, and reading. He died in Amsterdam on March 8, 1923.</p>
