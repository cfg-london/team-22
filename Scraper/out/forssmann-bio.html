<p><img src="forssmann.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Werner Theodor Otto Forssmann</b> was born in Berlin on August
  29, 1904, the son of Julius Forssmann and Emmy Hindenberg. He was
  educated at the Askanische Gymnasium (secondary grammar school)
  in Berlin. Leaving school in 1922, he went to the University of
  Berlin to study medicine, passing his State Examination in 1929.
  For his clinical training he went to the University Medical
  Clinic, working under Professor Georg Klemperer, and he studied
  anatomy under Professor Rudolph Fick. For clinical instruction in
  surgery he went, in 1929, to the August Victoria Home at
  Eberswalde near Berlin.<br>
  <br>
  It was here that he was the first to develop a technique for the
  catheterization of the heart. This he did by inserting a cannula
  into his own antecubital vein, through which he passed a catheter
  for 65 cm and then walked to the X-ray department, where a
  photograph was taken of the catheter lying in his right
  auricle.<br>
  <br>
  Subsequently he worked at the Charit&eacute;, Berlin, and the City Hospital at
  Mainz, and then went to the Rudolf Virchow Hospital in Berlin for specialist
  training in urology under Dr. Karl Heusch. He was appointed Chief
  of the Surgical Clinic of the City Hospital at
  Dresden-Friedrichstadt and at the Robert Koch Hospital, Berlin.
  At the beginning of the Second World War, Forssmann served as a
  Sanitary Officer, reaching the rank of Surgeon-Major; but he
  became a prisoner of war until his release in 1945, when he went
  into practice with his wife, in the Schwarzwald.<br>
  <br>
  From 1950 onwards he practised as a urological specialist at Bad
  Kreuznach, and since 1958 he has been Chief of the Surgical
  Division of the Evangelical Hospital at D&uuml;sseldorf, where he
  now lives.<br>
  <br>
  In 1956 he was awarded, together with <a href=

  "index.html">Dickinson W. Richards</a>, the Nobel Prize for
  Physiology or Medicine and he was, in the same year, appointed
  Honorary Professor of Surgery and Urology at the Johannes
  Gutenberg University, Mainz.<br>
  <br>
  In 1954 he was awarded the Leibniz Medal of the German Academy of
  Sciences; in the same year he was Guest of Honour at the National
  University of Cordoba, Argentina, where he was appointed
  Honorary Professor in 1961.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1962 he is a Member of the Executive Board of the German
  Surgical Society. He is also a Member of the American College of
  Chest Physicians, and Honorary Member of the Swedish Society
  of Cardiology, the German Society of Urology, and the German
  Child Welfare Association.<br>
  <br>
  In 1933 Forssmann married Dr. Elsbet Engel, who is also a
  specialist in urology. They have six children: Klaus (b. 1934),
  Knut (b. 1936), J&ouml;rg (b. 1938), Wolf (b. 1939), Bernd (b.
  1940), and Renate (b. 1943).</p>
