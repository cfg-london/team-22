  <h2><br>Africa and Freedom</h2>

  <p>In years gone by, some of the greatest men
  of our century have stood here to receive this award, men whose
  names and deeds have enriched the pages of human history, men
  whom future generations will regard as having shaped the world of
  our time. No one could be left unmoved at being plucked from the
  village of Groutville<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>, a name
  many of you have never heard before and which does not even
  feature on many maps - to be plucked from banishment in a rural
  backwater, to be lifted out of the narrow confines of South
  Africa's internal politics and placed here in the shadow of these
  great figures. It is a great honor to me to stand on this rostrum
  where many of the great men of our times have stood before.</p>

  <p>The Nobel Peace Award that has brought me
  here has for me a threefold significance. On the one hand, it is
  a tribute to my humble contribution to efforts by democrats on
  both sides of the color line to find a peaceful solution to the
  race problem. This contribution is not in any way unique. I did
  not initiate the struggle to extend the area of human freedom in
  South Africa; other African patriots - devoted men - did so
  before me. I also, as a Christian and patriot, could not look on
  while systematic attempts were made, almost in every department
  of life, to debase the God-factor in man or to set a limit beyond
  which the human being in his black form might not strive to serve
  his Creator to the best of his ability. To remain neutral in a
  situation where the laws of the land virtually criticized God for
  having created men of color was the sort of thing I could not, as
  a Christian, tolerate.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the award is a
  democratic declaration of solidarity with those who fight to
  widen the area of liberty in my part of the world. As such, it is
  the sort of gesture which gives me and millions who think as I
  do, tremendous encouragement. There are still people in the world
  today who regard South Africa's race problem as a simple clash
  between black and white. Our government has carefully projected
  this image of the problem before the eyes of the world. This has
  had two effects. It has confused the real issues at stake in the
  race crisis. It has given some form of force to the government's
  contention that the race problem is a domestic matter for South
  Africa. This, in turn, has tended to narrow down the area over
  which our case could be better understood in the world<a href=
  "#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>From yet another angle, it is welcome
  recognition of the role played by the African people during the
  last fifty years to establish, peacefully, a society in which
  merit and not race would fix the position of the individual in
  the life of the nation.</p>

  <p>This award could not be for me alone, nor
  for just South Africa, but for Africa as a whole. Africa
  presently is most deeply torn with strife and most bitterly
  stricken with racial conflict. How strange then it is that a man
  of Africa should be here to receive an award given for service to
  the cause of peace and brotherhood between men. There has been
  little peace in Africa in our time. From the northernmost end of
  our continent, where war has raged for seven years, to the center
  and to the south there are battles being fought out, some with
  arms, some without? In my own country, in the year 1960, for
  which this award is given, there was a state of emergency for
  many months. At Sharpeville, a small village, in a single
  afternoon sixtynine people were shot dead and 180 wounded by
  small arms fire<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>; and in parts
  like the Transkei<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a>, a state of
  emergency is still continuing. Ours is a continent in revolution
  against oppression. And peace and revolution make uneasy
  bedfellows. There can be no peace until the forces of oppression
  are overthrown.</p>

  <p>Our continent has been carved up by the
  great powers; alien governments have been forced upon the African
  people by military conquest and by economic domination; strivings
  for nationhood and national dignity have been beaten down by
  force; traditional economics and ancient customs have been
  disrupted, and human skills and energy have been harnessed for
  the advantage of our conquerors. In these times there has been no
  peace; there could be no brotherhood between men.</p>

  <p>But now, the revolutionary stirrings of our
  continent are setting the past aside. Our people everywhere from
  north to south of the continent are reclaiming their land, their
  right to participate in government, their dignity as men, their
  nationhood. Thus, in the turmoil of revolution, the basis for
  peace and brotherhood in Africa is being restored by the
  resurrection of national sovereignty and independence, of
  equality and the dignity of man.</p>

  <p>It should not be difficult for you here in
  Europe to appreciate this. Your continent passed through a longer
  series of revolutionary upheavals, in which your age of feudal
  backwardness gave way to the new age of industrialization, true
  nationhood, democracy, and rising living standards - the golden
  age for which men have striven for generations. Your age of
  revolution, stretching across all the years from the eighteenth
  century to our own, encompassed some of the bloodiest civil wars
  in all history. By comparison, the African revolution has swept
  across three quarters of the continent in less than a decade; its
  final completion is within sight of our own generation. Again, by
  comparison with Europe, our African revolution - to our credit -
  is proving to be orderly, quick, and comparatively bloodless.</p>

  <p>This fact of the relative peacefulness of
  our African revolution is attested to by other observers of
  eminence. Professor C.W. de Kiewiet, president of the University
  of Rochester, U.S.A., in a Hoernl&eacute; Memorial Lecture for
  1960, has this to say: "There has, it is true, been almost no
  serious violence in the achievement of political self-rule. In
  that sense there is no revolution in Africa - only reform..."</p>

  <p>Professor D.V. Cowen, then professor of
  comparative law at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in
  a Hoernl&eacute; Memorial Lecture for 1961, throws light on the
  nature of our struggle in the following words: "They (the Whites
  in South Africa) are again fortunate in the very high moral
  caliber of the non-White inhabitants of South Africa, who compare
  favorably with any on the whole continent." Let this never be
  forgotten by those who so eagerly point a finger of scorn at
  Africa.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, by your standards, our surge to
  revolutionary reforms is late. If it is so - if we are late in
  joining the modern age of social enlightenment, late in gaining
  self-rule, independence, and democracy, it is because in the past
  the pace has not been set by us. Europe set the pattern for the
  nineteenth and twentieth-century development of Africa. Only now
  is our continent coming into its own and recapturing its own fate
  from foreign rule.</p>

  <p>Though I speak of Africa as a single
  entity, it is divided in many ways by race, language, history,
  and custom; by political, economic, and ethnic frontiers. But in
  truth, despite these multiple divisions, Africa has a single
  common purpose and a single goal - the achievement of its own
  independence. All Africa, both lands which have won their
  political victories but have still to overcome the legacy of
  economic backwardness, and lands like my own whose political
  battles have still to be waged to their conclusion - all Africa
  has this single aim: our goal is a united Africa in which the
  standards of life and liberty are constantly expanding; in which
  the ancient legacy of illiteracy and disease is swept aside; in
  which the dignity of man is rescued from beneath the heels of
  colonialism which have trampled it. This goal, pursued by
  millions of our people with revolutionary zeal, by means of
  books, representations, demonstrations, and in some places armed
  force provoked by the adamancy of white rule, carries the only
  real promise of peace in Africa. Whatever means have been used,
  the efforts have gone to end alien rule and race oppression.</p>

  <p>There is a paradox in the fact that Africa
  qualifies for such an award in its age of turmoil and revolution.
  How great is the paradox and how much greater the honor that an
  award in support of peace and the brotherhood of man should come
  to one who is a citizen of a country where the brotherhood of man
  is an illegal doctrine, outlawed, banned, censured, proscribed
  and prohibited; where to work, talk, or campaign for the
  realization in fact and deed of the brotherhood of man is
  hazardous, punished with banishment, or confinement without
  trial, or imprisonment; where effective democratic channels to
  peaceful settlement of the race problem have never existed these
  300 years; and where white minority power rests on the most
  heavily armed and equipped military machine in Africa. This is
  South Africa.</p>

  <p>Even here, where white rule seems
  determined not to change its mind for the better, the spirit of
  Africa's militant struggle for liberty, equality, and
  independence asserts itself. I, together with thousands of my
  countrymen have in the course of the struggle for these ideals,
  been harassed and imprisoned, but we are not deterred in our
  quest for a new age in which we shall live in peace and in
  brotherhood.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary for me to speak at
  length about South Africa; its social system, its politics, its
  economics, and its laws have forced themselves on the attention
  of the world. It is a museum piece in our time, a hangover from
  the dark past of mankind, a relic of an age which everywhere else
  is dead or dying. Here the cult of race superiority and of white
  supremacy is worshiped like a god. Few white people escape
  corruption, and many of their children learn to believe that
  white men are unquestionably superior, efficient, clever,
  industrious, and capable; that black men are, equally
  unquestionably, inferior, slothful, stupid, evil, and clumsy. On
  the basis of the mythology that "the lowest amongst them is
  higher than the highest amongst us", it is claimed that white men
  build everything that is worthwhile in the country - its cities,
  its industries, its mines, and its agriculture and that they
  alone are thus fitted and entitled as of right to own and control
  these things, while black men are only temporary sojourners in
  these cities, fitted only for menial labor, and unfit to share
  political power. The prime minister of South Africa, Dr.
  Verwoerd<a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>, then minister of Bantu
  Affairs, when explaining his government's policy on African
  education had this to say: "There is no place for him (the
  African) in the European community above the level of certain
  forms of labor."</p>

  <p>There is little new in this mythology.
  Every part of Africa which has been subject to white conquest
  has, at one time or another and in one guise or another, suffered
  from it, even in its virulent form of the slavery that obtained
  in Africa up to the nineteenth century. The mitigating feature in
  the gloom of those far-off days was the shaft of light sunk by
  Christian missions, a shaft of light to which we owe our initial
  enlightenment. With successive governments of the time doing
  little or nothing to ameliorate the harrowing suffering of the
  black man at the hands of slave drivers, men like Dr. David
  Livingstone<a href="#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Dr. John
  Philip<a href="#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> and other illustrious men
  of God stood for social justice in the face of overwhelming odds.
  It is worth noting that the names I have referred to are still
  anathema to some South Africans. Hence the ghost of slavery
  lingers on to this day in the form of forced labor that goes on
  in what are called farm prisons. But the tradition of Livingstone
  and Philip lives on, perpetuated by a few of their line. It is
  fair to say that even in present-day conditions, Christian
  missions have been in the vanguard of initiating social services
  provided for us. Our progress in this field has been in spite of,
  and not mainly because of, the government. In this, the church in
  South Africa, though belatedly, seems to be awakening to a
  broader mission of the church in its ministry among us. It is
  beginning to take seriously the words of its Founder who said: "I
  came that they might have life and have it more
  abundantly."<a href="#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is a call to
  the church in South Africa to help in the all-round development
  of man in the present, and not only in the hereafter. In this
  regard, the people of South Africa, especially those who claim to
  be Christians, would be well advised to take heed of the
  Conference decisions of the World Council of Churches held at
  Cottesloe, Johannesburg, in 1960, which gave a clear lead on the
  mission of the church in our day<a href=
  "#note9"><sup>9</sup></a>. It left no room for doubt about the
  relevancy of the Christian message in the present issues that
  confront mankind. I note with gratitude this broader outlook of
  the World Council of Churches. It has a great meaning and
  significance for us in Africa.</p>

  <p>There is nothing new in South Africa's
  apartheid ideas, but South Africa is unique in this: the ideas
  not only survive in our modern age but are stubbornly defended,
  extended, and bolstered up by legislation at the time when, in
  the major part of the world, they are now largely historical and
  are either being shamefacedly hidden behind concealing
  formulations or are being steadily scrapped. These ideas survive
  in South Africa because those who sponsor them profit from them.
  They provide moral whitewash for the conditions which exist in
  the country: for the fact that the country is ruled exclusively
  by a white government elected by an exclusively white electorate
  which is a privileged minority; for the fact that eighty-seven
  percent of the land and all the best agricultural land within
  reach of town, market, and railways are reserved for white
  ownership and occupation, and now through the recent Group Areas
  legislation<a href="#note10"><sup>10</sup></a> nonwhites are
  losing more land to white greed; for the fact that all skilled
  and highly paid jobs are for whites only; for the fact that all
  universities of any academic merit are exclusively preserves of
  whites; for the fact that the education of every white child
  costs about &pound;64 per year while that of an African child
  costs about &pound;9 per year and that of an Indian child or
  colored child costs about &pound;20 per year; for the fact that
  white education is universal and compulsory up to the age of
  sixteen, while education for the nonwhite children is scarce and
  inadequate; and for the fact that almost one million Africans a
  year are arrested and jailed or fined for breaches of innumerable
  pass and permit laws, which do not apply to whites.</p>

  <p>I could carry on in this strain and talk on
  every facet of South African life from the cradle to the grave.
  But these facts today are becoming known to all the world. A
  fierce spotlight of world attention has been thrown on them. Try
  as our government and its apologists will, with honeyed words
  about "separate development" and eventual "independence" in
  so-called "Bantu homelands"<a href="#note11"><sup>11</sup></a>,
  nothing can conceal the reality of South African conditions. I,
  as a Christian, have always felt that there is one thing above
  all about "apartheid" or "separate development" that is
  unforgivable. It seems utterly indifferent to the suffering of
  individual persons, who lose their land, their homes, their jobs,
  in the pursuit of what is surely the most terrible dream in the
  world. This terrible dream is not held on to by a crackpot group
  on the fringe of society or by Ku Klux Klansmen<a href=
  "#note12"><sup>12</sup></a>, of whom we have a sprinkling. It is
  the deliberate policy of a government, supported actively by a
  large part of the white population and tolerated passively by an
  overwhelming white majority, but now fortunately rejected by an
  encouraging white minority who have thrown their lot with
  nonwhites, who are overwhelmingly opposed to so-called separate
  development.</p>

  <p>Thus it is that the golden age of Africa's
  independence is also the dark age of South Africa's decline and
  retrogression, brought about by men who, when revolutionary
  changes that entrenched fundamental human rights were taking
  place in Europe, were closed in on the tip of South Africa - and
  so missed the wind of progressive change.</p>

  <p>In the wake of that decline and
  retrogression, bitterness between men grows to alarming heights;
  the economy declines as confidence ebbs away; unemployment rises;
  government becomes increasingly dictatorial and intolerant of
  constitutional and legal procedures, increasingly violent and
  suppressive; there is a constant drive for more policemen, more
  soldiers, more armaments, banishments without trial, and penal
  whippings. All the trappings of medieval backwardness and cruelty
  come to the fore. Education is being reduced to an instrument of
  subtle indoctrination; slanted and biased reporting in the organs
  of public information, a creeping censorship, book banning, and
  blacklisting - all these spread their shadows over the land. This
  is South Africa today, in the age of Africa's greatness.</p>

  <p>But beneath the surface there is a spirit
  of defiance. The people of South Africa have never been a docile
  lot, least of all the African people. We have a long tradition of
  struggle for our national rights, reaching back to the very
  beginnings of white settlement and conquest 300 years ago. Our
  history is one of opposition to domination, of protest and
  refusal to submit to tyranny. Consider some of our great names:
  the great warrior and nation builder Shaka, who welded tribes
  together into the Zulu nation from which I spring; Moshoeshoe,
  the statesman and nation-builder who fathered the Basuto nation
  and placed Basutoland beyond the reach of the claws of the South
  African whites; Hintsa of the Xosas, who chose death rather than
  surrender his territory to white invaders<a href=
  "#note13"><sup>13</sup></a>. All these and other royal names, as
  well as other great chieftains, resisted manfully white
  intrusion. Consider also the sturdiness of the stock that
  nurtured the foregoing great names. I refer to our forbears, who,
  in trekking from the north to the southernmost tip of Africa
  centuries ago, braved rivers that are perennially swollen; hacked
  their way through treacherous jungle and forest; survived the
  plagues of the then untamed lethal diseases of a multifarious
  nature that abounded in Equatorial Africa; and wrested themselves
  from the gaping mouths of the beasts of prey. They endured it
  all. They settled in these parts of Africa to build a future
  worthwhile for us, their offspring. While the social and
  political conditions have changed and the problems we face are
  different, we too, their progeny, find ourselves facing a
  situation where we have to struggle for our very survival as
  human beings. Although methods of struggle may differ from time
  to time, the universal human strivings for liberty remain
  unchanged. We, in our situation, have chosen the path of
  non-violence of our own volition. Along this path we have
  organized many heroic campaigns. All the strength of progressive
  leadership in South Africa, all my life and strength, have been
  given to the pursuance of this method, in an attempt to avert
  disaster in the interests of South Africa, and [we] have bravely
  paid the penalties for it.</p>

  <p>It may well be that South Africa's social
  system is a monument to racialism and race oppression, but its
  people are the living testimony to the unconquerable spirit of
  mankind. Down the years, against seemingly overwhelming odds,
  they have sought the goal of fuller life and liberty, striving
  with incredible determination and fortitude for the right to live
  as men - free men. In this, our country is not unique. Your
  recent and inspiring history, when the Axis powers overran most
  European states, is testimony of this unconquerable spirit of
  mankind. People of Europe formed resistance movements that
  finally helped to break the power of the combination of Nazism
  and Fascism, with their creed of race arrogance and Herrenvolk
  mentality.</p>

  <p>Every people has, at one time or another in
  its history, been plunged into such struggle. But generally the
  passing of time has seen the barriers to freedom going down, one
  by one. Not so South Africa. Here the barriers do not go down.
  Each step we take forward, every achievement we chalk up, is
  cancelled out by the raising of new and higher barriers to our
  advance. The color bars do not get weaker; they get stronger. The
  bitterness of the struggle mounts as liberty comes step by step
  closer to the freedom fighter's grasp. All too often the protests
  and demonstrations of our people have been beaten back by force;
  but they have never been silenced.</p>

  <p>Through all this cruel treatment in the
  name of law and order, our people, with a few exceptions, have
  remained nonviolent. If today this peace award is given to South
  Africa through a black man, it is not because we in South Africa
  have won our fight for peace and human brotherhood. Far from it.
  Perhaps we stand farther from victory than any other people in
  Africa. But nothing which we have suffered at the hands of the
  government has turned us from our chosen path of disciplined
  resistance. It is for this, I believe, that this award is
  given.</p>

  <p>How easy it would have been in South Africa
  for the natural feelings of resentment at white domination to
  have been turned into feelings of hatred and a desire for revenge
  against the white community. Here, where every day, in every
  aspect of life every nonwhite comes up against the ubiquitous
  sign "Europeans Only" and the equally ubiquitous policeman to
  enforce it - here it could well be expected that a racialism
  equal to that of their oppressors would flourish to counter the
  white arrogance toward blacks. That it has not done so is no
  accident. It is because, deliberately and advisedly, African
  leadership for the past fifty years, with the inspiration of the
  African National Congress, which I had the honor to lead for the
  last decade or so until it was banned, had set itself steadfastly
  against racial vaingloriousness. We know that in so doing we
  passed up opportunities for an easy demagogic appeal to the
  natural passions of a people denied freedom and liberty; we
  discarded the chance of an easy and expedient emotional appeal.
  Our vision has always been that of a nonracial, democratic South
  Africa which upholds the rights of all who live in our country to
  remain there as <i>full</i> citizens, with equal rights and
  responsibilities with all others. For the consummation of this
  ideal we have labored unflinchingly. We shall continue to labor
  unflinchingly.</p>

  <p>It is this vision which prompted the
  African National Congress to invite members of other racial
  groups who believe with us in the brotherhood of man and in the
  freedom of all people to join with us in establishing a
  non-racial, democratic South Africa. Thus the African National
  Congress in its day brought about the Congress Alliance and
  welcomed the emergence of the Liberal Party and the Progressive
  Party, who to an encouraging measure support these ideals.</p>

  <p>The true patriots of South Africa, for whom
  I speak, will be satisfied with nothing less than the fullest
  democratic rights. In government we will not be satisfied with
  anything less than direct, individual adult suffrage and the
  right to stand for and be elected to all organs of government. In
  economic matters we will be satisfied with nothing less than
  equality of opportunity in every sphere, and the enjoyment by all
  of those heritages which form the resources of the country, which
  up to now have been appropriated on a racial "whites only" basis.
  In culture we will be satisfied with nothing less than the
  opening of all doors of learning in non-segregated institutions
  on the sole criterion of ability. In the social sphere we will be
  satisfied with nothing less than the abolition of all racial
  bars. We do not demand these things for people of African descent
  alone. We demand them for all South Africans, white and black. On
  these principles we are uncompromising. To compromise would be an
  expediency that is most treacherous to democracy, for in the turn
  of events, the sweets of economic, political, and social
  privileges that are a monopoly of only one section of a community
  turn sour even in the mouths of those who eat them. Thus
  apartheid in practice is proving to be a monster created by
  Frankenstein. That is the tragedy of the South African scene.</p>

  <p>Many spurious slogans have been invented in
  our country in an effort to redeem uneasy race relations -
  "trusteeship", "separate development", "race federation" and
  elsewhere, "partnership". These are efforts to sidetrack us from
  the democratic road, mean delaying tactics that fool no one but
  the unwary. No euphemistic naming will ever hide their hideous
  nature. We reject these policies because they do not measure up
  to the best mankind has striven for throughout the ages; they do
  great offense to man's sublime aspirations that have remained
  true in a sea of flux and change down the ages, aspirations of
  which the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights<a href=
  "#note14"><sup>14</sup></a> is a culmination. This is what we
  stand for. This is what we fight for.</p>

  <p>In their fight for lasting values, there
  are many things that have sustained the spirit of the freedom -
  loving people of South Africa and those in the yet unredeemed
  parts of Africa where the white man claims resolutely proprietary
  rights over democracy - a universal heritage. High among them -
  the things that have sustained us - stand: the magnificent
  support of the progressive people and governments throughout the
  world, among whom number the people and government of the country
  of which I am today guest; our brothers in Africa, especially in
  the independent African states; organizations who share the
  outlook we embrace in countries scattered right across the face
  of the globe; the United Nations Organization jointly and some of
  its member nations singly. In their defense of peace in the world
  through actively upholding the quality of man, all these groups
  have reinforced our undying faith in the unassailable rightness
  and justness of our cause. To all of them I say: Alone we would
  have been weak. Our heartfelt appreciation of your acts of
  support of us we cannot adequately express, nor can we ever
  forget, now or in the future when victory is behind us and South
  Africa's freedom rests in the hands of all her people.</p>

  <p>We South Africans, however, equally
  understand that, much as others might do for us, our freedom
  cannot come to us as a gift from abroad. Our freedom we must make
  ourselves. All honest freedom-loving people have dedicated
  themselves to that task. What we need is the courage that rises
  with danger.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the future of our freedom
  efforts, our cause is the cause of the liberation of people who
  are denied freedom. Only on this basis can the peace of Africa
  and the world be firmly founded. Our cause is the cause of
  equality between nations and peoples. Only thus can the
  brotherhood of man be firmly established. It is encouraging and
  elating to remind you that, despite her humiliation and torment
  at the hands of white rule, the spirit of Africa in quest for
  freedom has been, generally, for peaceful means to the
  utmost.</p>

  <p>If I have dwelt at length on my country's
  race problem, it is not as though other countries on our
  continent do not labor under these problems, but because it is
  here in the Republic of South Africa that the race problem is
  most acute. Perhaps in no other country on the continent is white
  supremacy asserted with greater vigor and determination and a
  sense of righteousness. This places the opponents of apartheid in
  the front rank of those who fight white domination.</p>

  <p>In bringing my address to a close, let me
  invite Africa to cast her eyes beyond the past and to some extent
  the present, with their woes and tribulations, trials and
  failures, and some successes, and see herself an emerging
  continent, bursting to freedom through the shell of centuries of
  serfdom. This is Africa's age - the dawn of her fulfillment, yes,
  the moment when she must grapple with destiny to reach the
  summits of sublimity, saying: Ours was a fight for noble values
  and worthy ends, and not for lands and the enslavement of
  man.</p>

  <p>Africa is a vital subject matter in the
  world of today, a focal point of world interest and concern.
  Could it not be that history has delayed her rebirth for a
  purpose? The situation confronts her with inescapable challenges,
  but more importantly with opportunities for service to herself
  and mankind. She evades the challenges and neglects the
  opportunities, to her shame, if not her doom. How she sees her
  destiny is a more vital and rewarding quest than bemoaning her
  past, with its humiliations and sufferings.</p>

  <p>The address could do no more than pose some
  questions and leave it to the African leaders and peoples to
  provide satisfying answers and responses by their concern for
  higher values and by their noble actions that could be</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quote">Footprints on the sands of time.<br>
    Footprints, that perhaps another,<br>
    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,<br>
    A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br>
    Seeing, shall take heart again.<a href=
    "#note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Still licking the scars of past wrongs
  perpetrated on her, could she not be magnanimous and practice no
  revenge? Her hand of friendship scornfully rejected, her pleas
  for justice and fair play spurned, should she not nonetheless
  seek to turn enmity into amity? Though robbed of her lands, her
  independence, and opportunities - this, oddly enough, often in
  the name of civilization and even Christianity - should she not
  see her destiny as being that of making a distinctive
  contribution to human progress and human relationships with a
  peculiar new Africa flavor enriched by the diversity of cultures
  she enjoys, thus building on the summits of present human
  achievement an edifice that would be one of the finest tributes
  to the genius of man?</p>

  <p>She should see this hour of her fulfillment
  as a challenge to her to labor on until she is purged of racial
  domination, and as an opportunity of reassuring the world that
  her national aspiration lies not in overthrowing white domination
  to replace it by a black caste but in building a nonracial
  democracy that shall be a monumental brotherhood, a "brotherly
  community" with none discriminated against on grounds of race or
  color.</p>

  <p>What of the many pressing and complex
  political, economic, and cultural problems attendant upon the
  early years of a newly independent state? These, and others which
  are the legacy of colonial days, will tax to the limit the
  statesmanship, ingenuity, altruism, and steadfastness of African
  leadership and its unbending avowal to democratic tenets in
  statecraft. To us all, free or not free, the call of the hour is
  to redeem the name and honor of Mother Africa.</p>

  <p>In a strife-torn world, tottering on the
  brink of complete destruction by man-made nuclear weapons, a free
  and independent Africa is in the making, in answer to the
  injunction and challenge of history: "Arise and shine for thy
  light is come."<a href="#note16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Acting in
  concert with other nations, she is man's last hope for a mediator
  between the East and West, and is qualified to demand of the
  great powers to "turn the swords into ploughshares"<a href=
  "#note17"><sup>17</sup></a> because two-thirds of mankind is
  hungry and illiterate; to engage human energy, human skill, and
  human talent in the service of peace, for the alternative is
  unthinkable - war, destruction, and desolation; and to build a
  world community which will stand as a lasting monument to the
  millions of men and women, to such devoted and distinguished
  world citizens and fighters for peace as the late Dag
  Hammarskj&ouml;ld, who have given their lives that we may live in
  happiness and peace.</p>

  <p>Africa's qualification for this noble task
  is incontestable, for her own fight has never been and is not now
  a fight for conquest of land, for accumulation of wealth or
  domination of peoples, but for the recognition and preservation
  of the rights of man and the establishment of a truly free world
  for a free people.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note" id="note"></a>* The laureate
  delivered this lecture in the Auditorium of the University of
  Oslo. The occasion saw some "firsts" in Nobel ceremonies: Lutuli
  was asked to bring his wife to the platform - never before done -
  and, after much applause at the end of his lecture, he himself
  sang (in Zulu) the African anthem, "Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika", being
  joined by the Africans, present and by others in the audience.
  The text of his lecture, which he gave in English, is taken from
  <i>Les Prix Nobel en 1961</i>. A tape of it records many
  extemporaneous additions made in delivery. In an informal and
  often humorous opening paragraph not in the prepared text, he
  thanked the Nobel Committee and Oslo - its people and its mayor -
  and paid tribute to the "human" King of Norway (Olaf V). His
  other additions were for the most part repetitions or
  amplifications of points already made.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note1" id="note1"></a>1.
  Groutville, Lutuli's home village of some 500 population on the
  Natal coast about fifty miles north of Durban, is the center of
  the Umvoti Mission Reserve that supports about 5.000 Zulus.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note2" id="note2"></a>2. In one of
  his extemporaneous insertions, Lutuli here points out that the
  race issue in South Africa is not just a "clash of color", but a
  "clash of ideas" oppression versus democratic rights for all.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note3" id="note3"></a>3. The result
  of police reaction to anti-pass tactics used by the
  Pan-Africanist Congress, which supported an Africans - only
  resistance as opposed to the African National Congress idea of
  working with all races; this action circumvented an ANC anti-pass
  campaign scheduled for a few days later.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note4" id="note4"></a>4. In East
  Cape Province of South Africa.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note5" id="note5"></a>5. Hendrik
  Frensch Verwoerd (1901-1966), Nationalist Party leader and
  prominent advocate of apartheid in the Union of South Africa;
  native affairs minister (1950-1958); prime minister
  (1958-1966).</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note6" id="note6"></a>6. David
  Livingstone (1813-1873), Scottish missionary and explorer in
  Africa.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note7" id="note7"></a>7. John
  Philip (1775-1851), British missionary in South Africa; was
  influential in gaining rights for the natives but had to abandon
  his plan for independent native states.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note8" id="note8"></a>8. John

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note9" id="note9"></a>9. Meeting
  from December 8 to 14, 1960, the Council delegates lived and
  worked together without regard for the color bar and in their
  final report included criticism of the Union government's racial
  measures.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note10" id="note10"></a>10.
  Legislation permitting the division of residential land in South
  African cities into sections, each for one racial group.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note11" id="note11"></a>11. Under
  the apartheid or "separate development" policy, Bantu "homelands"
  or Bantustans are areas set aside for Africans only, where, the
  theory goes, they can preserve their own culture and
  traditions.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note12" id="note12"></a>12. Founded
  in 1915 in Georgia, the "modern" Ku Klux Klan, an anti-Negro,
  anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic organization, reached its peak of
  power in the U.S. in the mid-twenties; is now moribund.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note13" id="note13"></a>13. Shaka
  [also Chaka] (?-1828), the "Black Napoleon", built the Zulu
  nation by conquest between 1816 and 1828, when he was
  assassinated. Moshoeshoe [also Moshesh] (c. 1780-1870) fought off
  the Zulus and later signed an agreement with the British, under
  whose protection and guidance Basutoland has been developing self
  government. Hintsa of the Gcaleka Xosas, a tribal chief, was
  killed when trying to "escape" the English in 1835.</p>

  <p class="smalltext"><a name="note14" id="note14"></a>14. Adopted
  by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948; for details, see
