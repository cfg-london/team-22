  <h1>Martin Rodbell - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="rodbell.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on December 1, 1925 in
  Baltimore, Maryland where I attended public schools and graduated
  from the accelerated course at Baltimore City
  College, a public high school of special note because it took
  selected students from around the city. An all boys school, it
  resembled a private college preparatory school in both its
  scholastic standards and by giving sufficient college courses to
  qualify after graduation to enter the second year of a
  university. Special attention was given to languages (Latin,
  Greek, German, French); the sciences were understated. In fact,
  the only class in chemistry was given by a teacher who seemed to
  know Lavoisier personally since he was given the highest status
  in that course. As a result, my interests tended toward
  languages, especially French, which greatly influenced my
  direction when I entered Johns Hopkins University in 1943. On the other hand,
  I had acquired a great interest in chemistry despite the high
  school teacher. That interest was acquired through a special
  boyhood friendship with two individuals from my neighborhood. We
  were gifted students, highly competitive, and interested in math
  and chemistry. The three of us shared these interests throughout
  our boyhood and were together from elementary school to Johns
  Hopkins. We separated during the war when each of us went into
  different wartime situations. I was drafted into the Navy, the
  other two stayed at universities under the auspices of Uncle Sam,
  the expression used for those taken in the armed services.<br>
  <br>
  I happily went into the armed services from Hopkins. I was bored
  with the courses given during wartime; most of the young,
  enthusiastic teachers had left for the services. More importantly
  for me, most of my friends had gone to war. As a Jew, fighting
  Hitler was the highest priority. However, in the Navy I spent
  most of the time in the South Pacific where the fighting was with
  the Japanese. I was a radio operator attached to the Marine Corps
  until I contracted malaria in the jungles of the Philippines.
  After recovering, I practiced my profession on several ships and
  traveled, as a result, to Korea and China. I mention this aspect
  of my life because my interactions with so many different types
  of people under trying conditions provided me with a healthy
  respect for the human condition. In fact, this experience
  buttressed the wonderful childhood atmosphere that I experienced
  in my home and in my neighborhood where my father's grocery store
  served as a focal point for contact between people in the area. I
  believe all of these experiences conditioned me for the life I
  have led as a scientist.<br>
  <br>
  When I returned from the war and re-entered Johns Hopkins, I was
  again attracted to French literature and became an avid reader of
  contemporary French writers, particularly <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/index.html">Gide</a> and those
  promoting the existentialist philosophy. My father was interested
  in my going to medical school. Pre-medical school was not at all
  interesting to me in part because of the intense competition
  among students for obtaining the highest grades, so necessary at
  the time to enter medical school. The turning point for me was a
  small class given by James Ebert, then a graduate student in the
  Biology department. Lengthy discourses on science philosophy and
  his deep interest and knowledge of embryology along with his
  enthusiasm for biology in general probably were the principal
  inducements for me to consider a career in the biological
  sciences. Moreover, the Biology department was filled with great
  professors like Bentley Glass and Vincent Dethier. When
  graduation time came, I went to Dr. Glass for advice. He told me
  to enter the field of Biochemistry. Not having taken advanced
  chemistry courses, I spent an extra year taking every advanced
  course in chemistry available at Hopkins. I knew at the end of
  that year that science was my forte.<br>
  <br>
  I met my future wife, Barbara Ledermann, in 1949. She had come to
  America from Holland where she survived the war in the Dutch
  underground. Her sister and parents disappeared in the ovens of
  Auschwitz. During the war she learned photography and maintained
  her training as a ballet dancer. She had come to Baltimore and by
  chance was given a part in Moliere's "School for Wives" in a
  production by the Johns Hopkins "Barnstormers". In a short time
  she had acquired a number of friends interested in theater, art,
  and music. I had never met so many interesting people. Given my
  proclivity for literature and my somewhat limited experience in
  classical piano, the scene that unfolded was overwhelming. I knew
  she would be the perfect companion. We married in 1950. Not only
  had I entered the world of Science, my life now became intensely
  immersed in the Arts.<br>
  <br>
  Having disappointed my father with my choice to become a
  scientist I gave him another shock by departing with Barbara for
  the U. of
  Washington in Seattle. Hans Neurath had just taken the chair
  of Biochemistry. The department was young with only a few
  graduate students and youthful professors (<a href=
  "../1992/index.html">Ed Krebs</a>, Don Hanahan, Frank Huennekens,
  among others). I chose Hanahan as my thesis advisor and became
  immersed in lipid chemistry, particularly in the metabolism of
  phospholipids. I learned from Hanahan how to assay for the
  actions of phospholipases in ether solution. Not realized at the
  time, my life as a biochemist was to be immersed in membranes. My
  thesis concerned the biosynthesis of lecithin in the rat liver.
  Unfortunately for me, Eugene Kennedy was working on the same
  subject and succeeded in demonstrating that CTP rather than ATP
  is responsible for the biosynthetic pathway. That experience
  taught me a good lesson; never rely on the purity of biological
  chemicals, as I had done. That lesson helped greatly in the later
  discovery of the role of GTP in signal transduction.<br>
  <br>
  I received my Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1954. We immediately left
  Seattle for Urbana, Illinois where I became a post-doctoral
  fellow under Dr. Herbert E. Carter, then chairman of the
  department of Chemistry at the U. of Illinois. It was a wonderful place to
  be at that time, not only because of the great chemists in the
  department but also because the department of Microbiology had
  such notables as Gunsalus, <a href="../1969/index.html">Luria</a>
  and Spiegelman who enlivened seminars with their egocentric views
  and vivid arguments about everything. I took on the research
  problem of the biosynthesis of chloramphenicol, an antibiotic of
  note that interested Dr. Carter. The molecule contained a nitro
  group appended to its benzene ring and two chlorides in the
  aliphatic side chain. My interest was how inorganic chloride was
  taken up into the side chain. I had some good ideas toward the
  second and final year after spending a great deal of effort
  trying to crush the mycelia into cell-free extracts. Finally it
  came down to the understanding that chloride was taken up into an
  activated (radical?) carbon at the two position of acetylacetate
  derived from the metabolism of phenylalanine! That problem was
  ultimately solved. The challenge was exciting, it was time to
  move on. Dr. Carter asked me at what university would I wish to
  teach. I replied: none. I had experienced teaching his lecture
  courses for the first year students: few of the students passed
  my exams. Devastated I decided never to teach. I chose research
  as my metier. Dr. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/index.html">Anfinsen</a> at the
  National Heart Institute accepted me for a position in his
  laboratory to work on "clearing factor". By the time I arrived,
  Dr. Edward Korn (an old and dear friend at NIH) had established
  clearing factor as lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzed
  the triglycerides in chylomicrons, the principle form of fat
  circulating in the bloodstream. Using emulsions of coconut oil as
  substrate, the enzyme required the presence of serum
  lipoproteins. My interest was to discern the nature of the
  lipoproteins on the surface of chylomicrons. Fortunately for me,
  Dr. Donald Frederickson and other scientists in the Heart
  Institute had extensive experience with serum lipoproteins; he
  and scientists at the Rockefeller Institute in New York supplied
  me with copious quantities of human chylomicrons. Using a newly
  developed "fingerprinting" method I established that at least
  five different proteins (designated alphabetically as A,B,C..etc)
  were present. Years later these five proteins proved to have very
  significant roles in diseases involving lipoproteins. For me,
  this was a fine exercise in protein chemistry that I had gained
  from Neurath's department combined with my invaluable experience
  with phospholipids.<br>
  <br>
  In 1960 I reached the conclusion that I wanted to return to my
  initial interest in cell biology: embryology. Fortunately I was
  granted a fellowship in Professor Jean Brachet's department at
  the Free University of Brussels. A delightful man of great
  erudition and wit, Brachet was my perfect opening into the
  culture of Europe. I learned many new techniques; especially
  useful was an ultrathin x-ray film process to record localization
  of tritium-labeled molecules in cells. My family, meanwhile,
  lived in the Hague, enjoying the remaining family of Barbara: the
  Citroens of which Paul Citroen was a great Dutch painter.
  Traveling to and fro by train between Brussels and the Hague
  proved too much after 6 months. Luckily I found a suitable
  laboratory in Leiden, headed by Dr. Peter Gaillard, a pioneer in
  the techniques of cell culturing. In that lab I acquired expert
  training in the use of cultured heart cells for discerning the
  uptake of tritium-labeled chylomicrons. The year in Belgium and
  Holland, however, proved to be most important because of the
  cultural impact of European civilization on my life. I have been
  wedded to Europe since then.<br>
  <br>
  On returning to the States I found myself in the Institute of
  Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases headed by DeWitt Stetten who
  gave me a position in the Laboratory of Nutrition and
  Endocrinology. With my experience in cell culturing, I became
  interested in discerning whether lipoprotein lipase was
  synthesized and released from fat cells. Korn had already
  established that the enzyme was present in adipose tissue. After
  months of trying several means of disrupting adipose tissue, I
  discovered that collagenase (actually an impure preparation
  containing many proteases) rapidly digested the tissue matrix,
  releasing the fat cells. Since fat cells floated to the surface
  of the incubation medium, it proved a simple matter to separate
  and purify these cells from the mostly vascular cells in adipose
  tissue. Little did I realize that this simple procedure was to
  change the course of research and the rest of my scientific
  career!<br>
  <br>
  Dr. <a href="../1947/index.html">Bernardo Houssay</a>, the great
  physiologist and Nobelist from Argentina was visiting the
  laboratory (one of his post-doctoral students was Robert Scow,
  section head of my lab) and learned of my feat. However, he
  questioned whether the cells were metabolically viable and said I
  must demonstrate to him that the cells were susceptible to
  insulin action. A few days later I showed him the results of
  insulin action on glucose utilization. He was ecstatic and
  proclaimed that this would be a landmark in the history of
  endocrinology. I was nonplussed but heartened by his enthusiasm.
  Insulin action, particularly its site of action on the cell,
  became a driving force. Testing the effects of my old favorites,
  phospholipases, I found that they mimicked the effects of the
  hormone on glucose utilization and protein synthesis. I had
  considered their actions to be restricted to the surface
  membrane. These results suggested that insulin may act by
  stimulating phospholipases thereby altering the structure of the
  surface membrane. As importantly, these data provided indirect
  evidence that the insulin receptor is located on the surface of
  fat cells. Prompted by teachings of Dr. Robert Williams of the
  department of Medicine at the U. of Washington, I decided to
  pursue this research by gently removing the fat from the cell
  while retaining many of the structural and metabolic aspects of
  the cell. This preparation I termed fat cell "ghosts".
  Importantly, they were responsive to a variety of hormones in
  terms of their actions on glucose utilization.<br>
  <br>
  In the mid-sixties, <a href="../1971/index.html">Earl
  Sutherland</a> gave a lecture on his "second-messenger" theory of
  hormone action in which cyclic AMP was demonstrated to be a
  product of the actions of a variety of hormones on adenyl
  (adenylate, adenylyl) cyclase. I believe his lecture had a great
  impact on a number of us at NIH. Certainly, it caused me to turn
  to the "cyclic AMP" paradigm. Until that time I worked in the lab
  with Ann Butler Jones as technician. In 1967, just prior to
  embarking on a sabbatical in Geneva, we were joined by Lutz
  Birnbaumer. He proved to be a prime source for the next two years
  of the important information that led ultimately to the concept
  of transducers and the principles of signal transduction that I
  projected in lectures and in writings. News of our investigations
  rapidly spread. When I returned from Geneva, Michiel Krans and
  Stephen L. Pohl joined in our efforts with fat cell ghosts and
  later with rat liver membranes.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile I had been asked by Albert E. Renold, a great
  endocrinologist and a noble man, to take over his Institut de
  Biochimie Clinique in Geneva while he was going on sabbatical in
  the laboratory of Robert Williams. That was the beginning of my
  long love affair with the city of Geneva and my many friends and
  colleagues there. Later I was to be Professor in the Laboratory
  of Biochemistry at the University (1981-83) where I carried out
  research on the structure/function of glucagon. During the period
  1967-68, I carried out very interesting research on the effects
  of hormones on ion and amino acid translocations in fat cell
  ghosts with Torben Clausen who was serving a post-doctoral period
  from the U. of Aarhus in Denmark. We both learned from that
  experience that hormones originally thought to act
  monotheistically actually are pleiotropic agents; i.e., they can
  do many different things by separate routes. Certainly in my
  mind, endocrinology was no longer just a science; it was imbued
  with existentialism!<br>
  <br>
  There is no point in recounting the story of the discovery of the
  role of GTP and magnesium ions in hormone action. That story
  evolved in our lab with many contributors over the past two
  decades of harmonious and exciting times. Looking back it was a
  period in which my life experiences had kaleidoscoped into a
  wonderful sense of creativity shared with not only my immediate
  colleagues but with scientists from all over the world. My life
  as a scientist has been joyful in large part because of my wife
  and our four children (Paul, Suzanne, Andrew, and Phillip) who
  succored me during those long days and nights of intense thought
  and often of frustration when ideas were scarce. In many
  respects, my career and my experiences with people and events
  have been seamless in that I cannot separate one from another.
  Without doubt, the thread of one's life should be within the
  matrix of the total human experience.</p>
