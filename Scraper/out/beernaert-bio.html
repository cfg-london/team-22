  <h1>Auguste Beernaert - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="beernaert.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Auguste Marie Fran&ccedil;ois Beernaert</b> (July 26,
  1829-October 6, 1912) was born in Ostend, Belgium, in a
  middle-class Catholic family of Flemish origin. His father was a
  government functionary whose changing appointments took the
  family from Ostend to Dinant and then to Namur, where Auguste and
  his sister spent their childhood. Their early education was
  undertaken by their mother, a woman of outstanding intelligence
  and moral character. Admitted to the University of Louvain
  in 1846, Beernaert took his doctorate in law in 1851 with the
  highest distinction. Awarded a traveling fellowship, he spent two
  years at the Universities of Paris, Heidelberg, and Berlin,
  studying the status of legal education in France and Germany and
  upon his return to Belgium submitting a report of his findings -
  later published - to the minister of the Interior.<br>
  <br>
  Admitted to the bar in 1853, he clerked for a time for Hubert
  Dolez, a prominent lawyer and former president of the Chamber of
  Representatives, then set up an independent practice,
  specializing in fiscal law. In the next twenty years his essays
  in legal journals earned him a reputation as a scholar, and his
  practice a comfortable fortune. Consequently, there was some
  surprise expressed in Belgian legal circles when he gave up his
  practice in 1873 to become the minister of public works in Jules
  Malou's conservative Catholic cabinet. In the next five years
  Beernaert proved to be an able and energetic administrator. He
  improved the country's rail, canal, and road systems, established
  new port facilities at Ostend and Anvers, and beautified the
  capital, but he failed in his attempt to end child labor in the
  mines. In June of 1874 he lost a contest for a seat in the Senate
  but three months later won an election in the west Flanders town
  of Thielt, a constituency which re-elected him until his
  death.<br>
  <br>
  When the Catholic Party, defeated in 1878, was returned to power
  in 1884, Beernaert was named minister of the Department of
  Agriculture, Industry, and Public Works in the new cabinet. Four
  months later, after some resignations from the cabinet, King
  Leopold II entrusted Beernaert with the direction of the
  government.<br>
  <br>
  Beernaert was prime minister of Belgium and finance minister for
  the next ten years. Under his administration the budget was
  balanced; the Flemish language was protected; the independent
  State of the Congo was created in 1885 and the title of sovereign
  of that land given to Leopold who had personally been largely
  responsible for its development; social and judicial reforms
  designed to protect the welfare of the workingman were instituted
  in 1887 in the wake of riots in that year; military
  fortifications on the Meuse were constructed in order to defend
  Belgian neutrality; the constitution of 1831 was revised, the
  right of suffrage being granted to ten times the number of
  citizens who had formerly enjoyed it.<br>
  <br>
  On another constitutional question, that of proportional
  representation, the cabinet fell in 1894. Although he returned to
  his law practice, Beernaert continued to serve in the government.
  He accepted the advisory post of minister of state and from 1895
  to 1900 served as the president of the Chamber of
  Representatives, being elected by his colleagues. A lifelong
  patron of the arts, he was selected to head the Commission of
  Museums and Arts. During this period he engaged actively in
  international attempts to abolish slavery and solidified into
  active opposition his dismay at the exploitation of the Congo
  that had troubled his relationship with Leopold in the last part
  of his tenure as prime minister.<br>
  <br>
  One of Belgium's leading pacifists, Beernaert became an active
  member of the Interparliamentary Union after he resigned from the
  prime ministry, presided over several of its conferences, and
  served as president of its Council after 1899 and of its
  Executive Committee after its creation in 1908. At the Peace
  Conference at The Hague in 1899 he presided over the First
  Commission on arms limitation; at the Conference of 1907, over
  the Second Commission on codification of land war. He was a
  member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration; he represented
  Mexico in 1902 in the dispute with the United States, the first
  case to be brought before the Court; and on many occasions he
  acted as arbiter of international quarrels. Beernaert was the
  primary force behind proposals to unify international maritime
  law; those resulting from the international conferences of 1885
  and 1888, convened on his initiative, failed of adoption by the
  several nations, but the conventions dealing with collision and
  assistance at sea drawn up in 1910 at the conference in Brussels
  under his chairmanship were soon signed by many nations. He
  exemplified his own aphorism: &laquo;The first virtue of politics
  and the first element of success is perseverance&raquo;.<a href=

  <br>
  On his way home from the 1912 Geneva conference of the
  Interparliamentary Union on the prohibition of air warfare,
  Beernaert was hospitalized in Lucerne where he died of pneumonia.
  He was buried at Boitsfort with the simplest of ceremonies, as he
  had requested.</p>
