  <h1>Paul D. Boyer - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="boyer.jpg" class="bio-img">The first 21 years of my life were spent
  in Provo, Utah, then a city of about 15,000 people, beautifully
  situated at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains. Hardy Mormon
  pioneers had settled the area only 70 years before my birth in
  1918. Provo was a well-designed city with stable neighbourhoods,
  a pride in its past and a spirit of unbounded opportunity. The
  geographical isolation and lack of television made world
  happenings and problems seem remote.<br>
  <br>
  My father, Dell Delos Boyer, born in 1879 in Springville, Utah,
  came from the Pennsylvania Boyers, who in turn came from an
  earlier Bayer ancestry in what is now Holland and Germany. A
  small portion of my Boyer DNA has been traced to John Alden,
  famous as a Mayflower pilgrim who wooed for another and won for
  himself. Dad's education, at what was then the Brigham Young
  Academy, was delayed by the ill health he had endured in much of
  his youth. Through his ambition, and the sacrifices of his
  family, he acquired training in Los Angeles to become an
  osteopathic physician. He served humanity well. More by example
  than by word, my father taught me logical reasoning, compassion,
  love of others, honesty, and discipline applied with
  understanding. He also taught me such skills such as pitching
  horseshoes and growing vegetables. Dad loved to travel. Family
  trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in
  Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day,
  were real adventures. Father became a widower when the youngest
  of my five siblings was only eight. Fifteen years later he
  married another fine woman. They shared many happy times, and she
  cared for him during a long illness as he died from prostate
  cancer at the age of 82. Prostate cancer also took the life of my
  only brother when he was 76. If our society continues to support
  basic research on how living organisms function, it is likely
  that my great grandchildren will be spared the agony of losing
  family members to most types of cancer.<br>
  <br>
  Recently I scanned notes on a diary that my mother, Grace Guymon,
  wrote in her late teens, when living near Mancos, Colorado. The
  Guymons were among the Huguenots who fled religious persecution
  in France. My French heritage has been mixed with English and
  other nationalities as the Guymons descended. Mother's diary
  revealed to me more about her vitality and charm than I
  remembered from her later years, which were clouded by Addison's
  disease. She died in 1933, at the age of 45, just weeks after my
  fifteenth birthday. Discoveries about the adrenal hormones, that
  could have saved her life, came too late. Her death contributed
  to my later interest in studying biochemistry, an interest that
  has not been fulfilled in the sense that my accomplishments
  remain more at the basic than the applied level. Mother made a
  glorious home environment for my early years. During her long
  illness and after her death, all of the children helped with
  family chores. One of my less pleasant memories is of getting up
  in the middle of the night to use our allotted irrigation time to
  water the garden.<br>
  <br>
  The large, gracious home provided by Mother and Dad at 346 North
  University Avenue has been replaced by a pizza parlor, although
  an inspection a few months ago revealed that the irrigation ditch
  for our garden area (now a parking lot) can still be found.
  Mother had a talent for home decorating. I often read from a set
  of the <i>Book of Knowledge or Harvard Classics</i> while lying
  in front of the fireplace, with a mantel designed and decorated
  by her. Staring into the glowing coals as a fire dims provided a
  wonderful milieu for a youthful imagination. I also remember such
  things as picnics in Provo Canyon, and the anticipation that I
  might get to lick the dasher after cranking the ice-cream
  freezer. My older brother, Roy, and I had a play-fight
  relationship. I still carry a scar on my nose from when I plunged
  (he pushed me!) through the mirror of the dining room closet. I
  am told that I had a bad temper, and remember being banished to
  the back hall until civility returned. Perhaps this temper was
  later sublimated into drive and tenacity, traits that may have
  come in part from my mother.<br>
  <br>
  The great depression of the 1930s left lasting impressions on all
  our family. Father's patients became non-paying or often
  exchanged farm produce or some labor for medical care. Mother
  saved pennies to pay the taxes. The burden of paper routes and
  odd jobs to provide my spending money made it painful when my new
  Iver Johnson bicycle was stolen. We were encouraged to be
  creative. I recall mother's tolerance when she allowed me, at an
  early age, to take off the hinges and doors of cupboards if I
  would put them back on. My first exposure to chemistry came when
  I was given a chemistry set for Christmas. It competed for space
  in our basement with a model electric trains and an "Erector"
  set. After school the neighborhood yards were filled with shouts
  of play; games of "kick-the-can," "run-sheepy-run,"
  "steal-the-sticks," as well as marbles, baseball and other
  activities. In our back yard we built tree houses, dug
  underground tunnels and secret passages, and made a small club
  house. The mountains above our house offered other outlets for
  adventuresome teenage boys. Days were spent in an abandoned cabin
  or sleeping under the sky in the shadow of Provo peak. We even
  took cultures of sour dough bread to the mountains and baked
  delicious biscuits in an a rusty stove. Mountain hikes instilled
  in me a life-long urge to get to the top of any inviting summit
  or peak.<br>
  <br>
  Provo public schools were excellent. At Parker Elementary School,
  a few blocks from my home, I fell in love with my 3rd grade
  teacher, Miss McKay. Students who learned more easily were
  allowed to skip a grade, and I entered the new Farrer Junior High
  school at a younger age than my classmates. This handicapped me
  in two types of sporting events, athletics and courting girls.
  Girls did not want to dance with little Paul Boyer; boys were
  quite unimpressed with my physique. As I grew my status among
  fellows improved. Once I got into a scuffle in gym class, the
  instructor had the "combatants" put on boxing gloves, and I gave
  more than I received. It wasn't until late high school and early
  college that I gained enough size and skill to make me welcome on
  intramural basketball teams.<br>
  <br>
  I was one of about 500 students of Provo High School, where the
  atmosphere was friendly, and scholarship and activities were
  encouraged by both students and faculty. I participated on
  debating teams and in student government, and served as senior
  class president. I still have a particularly high regard for my
  chemistry teacher, Rees Bench. I was pleased when he wrote in my
  Yearbook for graduation, "You have proven yourself as a most
  outstanding student." I graduated while still 16, and thought
  myself quite mature. I wish I had saved a copy of my
  valedictorian address. I suspect it may have sparkled with
  naivete.<br>
  <br>
  It was always assumed that I would go to college. The Brigham Young
  University (BYU) campus was just a few blocks from my home
  and tuition was minimal. It was a small college of about 3,500
  students, less than a tenth of its present size. As in high
  school, I enjoyed social and student government activities.
  Friendships abounded. New vistas were opened in a variety of
  fields of learning. Chemistry and mathematics seemed logical
  studies to emphasize, although I had little concept as to where
  they might lead. A painstaking course in qualitative and
  quantitative analysis by John Wing gave me an appreciation of the
  need for, and beauty of, accurate measurement. However, the
  lingering odor of hydrogen sulfide, used for metal identification
  and separation, called unwanted attention to me in later classes.
  "Prof" Joe Nichol's enthusiasm for general chemistry was superbly
  conveyed to his students. Professor Charles Maw excelled in
  transferring a knowledge of organic chemistry to his students.
  Biochemistry was not included in the curriculum.<br>
  <br>
  Summers I worked as a waiter and managerial assistant at
  Pinecrest Inn, in a canyon near Salt Lake City. One summer a
  college friend and I lived there in a sheep camp trailer while
  managing a string of saddle horses for the guests to use. A
  different type of education came when as a member of a medical
  corps in the National Guard I spent several weeks in a military
  camp in California.<br>
  <br>
  As my senior year progressed several career paths were
  considered; employment as a chemist in the mining industry, a
  training program in hotel management, the study of osteopathic or
  conventional medicine, or some type of graduate training. Little
  information was available about the latter possibility; but a few
  chemistry majors from BYU had gone on to graduate school. I have
  a tendency to be lucky and make the right choices based on
  limited information. A notice was posted of a Wisconsin Alumni
  Research Foundation (WARF) Scholarship for graduate studies. My
  application was approved, and the stage was set for a later phase
  of my career.<br>
  <br>
  Before leaving Provo, a most important and fortunate event
  occurred. A beautiful and talented brunette coed, with one year
  of college to finish, indicated a willingness to marry me. She
  came from a large and loving family, impoverished financially by
  her father's death when she was 2 years old. She had worked and
  charmed her way nearly through college. My savings were limited
  and hers were negative. But it was clear that my choice was to
  have her join with me in the Wisconsin adventure or take my
  chances when I returned a year later. It was an easy decision.
  Paul, who had just turned 21, and Lyda Whicker, 20, were married
  in my father's home on August 31, 1939. Five days later we left
  by train to Wisconsin for my graduate study.<br>
  <br>
  A few months after our arrival our new marriage almost ended. I
  was admitted to the student infirmary with diagnosed
  appendicitis. Through medical mismanagement my appendix ruptured
  and I became deathly ill. Sulfanilamides, discovered a few years
  earlier by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1939/index.html">Domagk</a>, saved my life.
  Last summer I read an outstanding book, <i>The Forgotten Plague:
  How the Battle Against Tuberculosis Was Won and Lost,</i> by
  Frank Ryan. The book gives a stirring account, the first I have
  read, of Domagk's research and how he was not allowed to leave
  Hitler's Germany to receive the 1939 Nobel Prize.<br>
  <br>
  Fortunately, the Biochemistry Department at the University of Wisconsin in
  Madison was outstanding and far ahead of most others in the
  country. A new wing on the biochemistry building had recently
  been opened. The excitement of vitamins, nutrition and metabolism
  permeated the environment. Steenbock had recently patented the
  irradiation of milk for enrichment with vitamin D. Elvehjem's
  group had discovered that nicotinic acid would cure pellagra.
  Petersen's group was identifying and separating bacterial growth
  factors. Link's group was isolating and identifying a vitamin K
  antagonist from sweet clover. Patents for the use of dicoumarol
  as a rat poison and as an anticoagulant sweetened the coffers of
  the WARF, the Foundation that supported my scholarship. Among
  younger faculty an interest in enzymology and metabolism was
  blossoming.<br>
  <br>
  Married graduate students were rare, and the continuing economic
  depression made jobs hard to find. But my remarkable wife soon
  found a good job, and I settled into graduate studies. During our
  Wisconsin years she gained a perspective of art while employed in
  Madison's leading art retail outlet. It was years later before
  Lyda finished a college degree, became a professional editor at
  UCLA, and worked with me on the eighteen-volume series of <i>The
  Enzymes</i>. Our contacts in graduate school and through Lyda's
  employment gave us life-long friends; one was Henry Lardy, from
  South Dakota farm country. He and I were assigned to work under
  Professor Paul Phillips. Henry was highly talented, and it was my
  good fortune to work along side him. Phillips' main interests
  were in reproductive and nutritional problems of farm animals.
  Henry developed an egg yolk medium for sperm storage that
  revolutionized animal breeding.<br>
  <br>
  We were encouraged by Phillips to explore metabolic and enzyme
  interests. I did not realize that it was unusual to be able step
  across the hall and attend a symposium on respiratory enzymes in
  which such biochemical giants as <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/index.html">Otto Meyerhof</a>, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/index.html">Fritz Lipmann</a>, and
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1947/index.html">Carl Cori</a>
  spoke. Evening research discussion groups with keen young faculty
  such as Marvin Johnson and Van Potter, centered on enzymes and
  metabolism, broadened and sharpened our perspectives. One evening
  I presented my and Henry's evidence for the first known
  K<sup>+</sup> activation of an enzyme, pyruvate kinase. Henry
  kept score on the interruptions for questions or discussions-some
  35 as I recall. This superb training environment set the base for
  my career.<br>
  <br>
  My Ph.D. degree was granted in the spring of 1943, the nation was
  at war, and I headed for a war project at Stanford
  University. A few weeks after my arrival in California, on my
  birthday, July 31, our daughter Gail was born. I became somewhat
  more involved in home duties and more deeply in love with
  Lyda.<br>
  <br>
  The wartime Committee on Medical Research sponsored a project at
  Stanford University on blood plasma proteins, under the direction
  of J. Murray Luck, founder of the nonprofit Annual Review of
  Biochemistry and other Reviews. Concentrated serum albumin
  fractionated from blood plasma was effective in battlefield
  treatment of shock. When heated to kill microorganisms and
  viruses, the solutions of albumin developed cloudiness from
  protein denaturation. The principal goal of our research project
  was to find some way to stabilize the solutions so that they
  would not show this behavior. Our small group found that acetate
  gave some stabilization and butyrate was better. This led to the
  discovery that long chain fatty acids would remarkably stabilize
  serum albumin to heat denaturation, and would even reverse the
  denaturation by heat or concentrated urea solutions. Other
  compounds with hydrophobic portions and a negative charge, such
  as acetyl tryptophan, were also effective. Our stabilization
  method was quickly adopted and is still in use. From the Stanford
  studies I gained experience with proteins and a growing respect
  for the beauty of their structures.<br>
  <br>
  In marked contrast to the University of Wisconsin, Biochemistry
  was hardly visible at Stanford in 1945, consisting of only two
  professors in the chemistry department. The war project at
  Stanford was essentially completed, and I accepted an offer of an
  Assistant Professorship at the University of Minnesota, which had a good
  biochemistry department. But my local War Draft Board in Provo,
  Utah, had other plans and I became a member of the U.S. Navy. The
  Navy did not know what to do with me, the war with Japan was
  nearly over, and I became what is likely the only seaman
  second-class that has had a nearly private laboratory at the Navy
  Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. In less than a
  year I returned to civilian life. In the spring of 1946 I, my
  wife, and now two daughters, Gail and Hali, became Minnesotans.
  But I had unknowingly acquired a latent California virus to be
  expressed years later.<br>
  <br>
  Minnesota has generally competent and honest public officials,
  good support of the schools and cultural amenities, and an
  excellent state university. It was a fine place to rear a family,
  and soon our third child, Douglas, was born. A golden era for
  biochemistry was just starting. The NIH and NSF research grants were expanding at a rate equal
  to, or even ahead, of the growing number of meritorious
  applications. The G.I. bill provided financial support that
  brought excellent and mature graduate students to campus. New
  insights into metabolism, enzyme action, and protein structure
  and function were being rapidly acquired.<br>
  <br>
  Housing was almost unavailable in the post war years. Initially
  we coped with an isolated, rat-infested farm house. In 1950,
  after my academic competence seemed satisfactorily established,
  we built a home not far from the St. Paul campus where the
  Department of Biochemistry was located. I served as contractor,
  plumber, electrician, finish carpenter etc. My warm memories of
  this home include looking at a sparkling, snow-covered landscape,
  while seated at the desk in the bedroom corner that served as my
  study, and struggling with the interpretation of some puzzling
  isotope exchanges accompanying an enzyme catalysis. The
  understanding that developed was rewarding and perhaps one of my
  best intellectual efforts. However, it did not seem that the
  approach would give answers to major problems.<br>
  <br>
  During my early years at Minnesota I conducted an evening enzyme
  seminar. One participant in our lively discussions was a
  promising graduate student from another department, Bo Malmstrom,
  who became a renowned scientist in his field, and is now a
  retired professor from the University of G&ouml;teborg. In 1952
  my family spent a memorable summer at the Woods Hole Marine
  Biological Laboratories on Cape Cod. A sabbatical period on a
  Guggenheim Fellowship in Sweden in 1955 was especially rewarding.
  There I did research at both the Wenner-Gren Institute of the
  University of
  Stockholm with Olov Lindberg and Lars Ernster, and at the
  <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1997/boyer-autobio.html&object=ki&to=http://www.nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank">Nobel Medical Institute</a>, working with
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1955/index.html">Hugo Theorell</a>'s
  group. Professor Theorell received a Nobel Prize that year,
  exposing us to the splendor and formality of the Nobel
  festivities.<br>
  <br>
  Along the way, I was gratified to receive the Award in Enzyme
  Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 1955. In 1959-60 I
  served as Chairman of the Biochemistry Section of the American Chemical
  Society. In 1956 I accepted a Hill Foundation Professorship
  and moved to the medical school campus of the University of
  Minnesota in Minneapolis. Much of my group's research was on
  enzymes other than the ATP synthase. But solving how oxidative
  phosphorylation occurred remained one the most challenging
  problems of biochemistry, and I could not resist its siren call.
  Mildred Cohn reported that mitochondria doing oxidative
  phosphorylation catalyzed an exchange of the phosphate and water
  oxygens, an intriguing capacity. An able physicist and a pioneer
  in mass spectrometry, Alfred Nier, made gaseous <sup>18</sup>O
  and facilities available to me, and some experiments were run
  using this heavy isotope of oxygen. However, much of our effort
  over several years was directed toward attempting to detect a
  possible phosphorylated intermediate in ATP (adenosine
  triphosphate) synthesis using <sup>32</sup>P as a probe. The
  combined efforts of some excellent graduate students and
  postdocs, most of whom went on to rewarding academic careers,
  culminated in the discovery of a new type of phosphorylated
  protein, a catalytic intermediate in ATP formation with a
  phosphoryl group attached to a histidine residue.<br>
  <br>
  By then, time and queries had stimulated the latent California
  virus. Change was underway. In the summer of 1963, I and a group
  of graduate students and postdocs who came with me, activated
  laboratories in the new wing of the chemistry building at the
  University of
  California in Los Angeles (UCLA), located on a beautiful
  campus at the foot of the Santa Monica mountains. We soon found
  that the enzyme-bound phosphohistidine we had discovered was an
  intermediate in the substrate level phosphorylation of the citric
  acid cycle. It was not a key to oxidative phosphorylation. The
  experience reminds me of a favorite saying: Most of the yield
  from research efforts comes from the coal that is mined while
  looking for diamonds.<br>
  <br>
  In 1965 I accepted the Directorship of a newly created Molecular
  Biology Institute (MBI) at UCLA, in part because of my
  disappointment that oxidative phosphorylation had resisted our
  efforts. A building that was promised failed to materialize, but
  through luck and persistence adequate funds were obtained, partly
  from private resources, and promising faculty were recruited. The
  objective was to promote basic research on how living cells
  function at the molecular level. I believe the best research is
  accomplished by a faculty member with a small group of graduate
  students and postdocs, who freely design, competently conduct and
  intensely evaluate experiments. To spend time with such a group I
  soon found ways to reduce my administrative chores. Probes of
  oxidative phosphorylation continued, and, as 1971 approached, we
  hit pay dirt. We recognized the first main postulate of what was
  to become the binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis, namely
  that energy input was not used primarily to form the ATP
  molecule, but to promote the release of an already formed and
  tightly bound ATP.<br>
  <br>
  In the following decade, the other two main concepts of the
  mechanism were revealed, namely that the three catalytic sites
  participate sequentially and cooperatively, and that our, and
  other, data could be best explained by what was termed a
  rotational catalysis. These previously unrecognized concepts in
  enzymology provided motivation and excitement within my research
  group. Richard Cross, a postdoctoral fellow trained with Jui Wang
  at Yale,
  capably probed tightly bound ATP. Jan Rosing, a gifted
  experimentalist from Bill Slater's group in Amsterdam, and Celik
  Kayalar, an intelligent, innovative graduate student from Turkey,
  formed a productive pair that unveiled essential facets of
  cooperative catalysis. David Hackney, a postdoc from Dan
  Koshland's stable of budding scientists at Berkeley, was an
  intellectual leader in our <sup>18</sup>O experimentation that
  led to rotational catalysis. Dan Smith, Michael Gresser, Linda
  Smith, and Chana Vinkler (from Israel) as postdocs, and Lee
  Hutton, Gary Rosen and Glenda Choate as graduate students,
  established the participation of bound intermediates in rapid
  mixing and quenching experiments, and conducted <sup>18</sup>O
  exchange experiments that clarified and supported our mechanistic
  postulates.<br>
  <br>
  In ensuing years, other aspects of the complex ATP synthase were
  explored that solidified our feeling that the binding change
  mechanism was likely valid and general, and promoted its
  acceptance in the field. I will resist telling you here about the
  number, properties, and function of the six nucleotide binding
  sites, of the probes that agreed with rotational catalysis, of
  the unraveling of the complex Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ADP inhibition,
  of the generality of the mechanism and other synthase properties
  revealed by studies with chloroplasts, <i>E. coli</i>, and
  Kagawa's thermophilic bacterium. It was a pleasure to work on
  such problems with Teri Melese, a postdoc who excelled in
  enthusiasm as well as capability, and Zhixiong Xue, an
  exceptional graduate student that I first met while leading a
  biochemical delegation to China, with Raj Kandpal a scholarly
  postdoc from India, with the productive postdocs John Wise (from
  Alan Senior's lab) and Rick Feldman (from David Sigman's lab),
  with Janet Wood during her sabbatical, and with June-Mei Zhou and
  Ziyun Du (on leave from Academia Sinica laboratories in China) as
  well as Dan Wu, Steven Stroop, and Karen Guerrero as graduate
  students. Special mention should be made of three excellent
  Russian researchers, Vladimir Kasho, Yakov Milgrom and Marat
  Murataliev, from the laboratory of Vladimir Skulachev, a
  respected leader in bioenergetics. With the latter two I am now
  writing what will likely be my last paper reporting research
  results. Other welcome postdocs, visitors, and graduate students
  at UCLA worked with other problems, including the
  Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase that Skou first isolated,
  and the related Ca<sup>++</sup> transporting ATPase of the
  sarcoplasmic reticulum. During these active years it was a
  pleasure to receive peer recognition in the form of the Rose
  Award of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology, the preeminent society in my field (I served as its
  President many years earlier).<br>
  <br>
  An unexpected benefit of my career in biochemistry has been
  travel. The information exchanged and gained at scientific
  conferences and visits has been tremendously important for
  progress in my laboratory. My travelophilic wife and I thoroughly
  enjoyed being guests of the Australian and South African
  biochemical societies while visiting their countries. Meetings or
  laboratory visits in Japan, Sweden, France, Germany, Russia,
  Italy, Wales, Argentina, Iran, and elsewhere gave us a world
  perspective. Manuscripts that have to be produced, sometimes a
  bit unwillingly, offer the challenge to present speculation and
  perspective often not welcome by editors of prestigious journals.
  It was in a volume from a conference dedicated to one of the
  giants of the bioenergetics field, Efraim Racker, that the
  designation "the binding change mechanism" was introduced.
  Conferences at the University of Wisconsin provided opportunity
  to publish thoughts about rotational catalysis that had not been
  enthusiastically endorsed at Gordon Conferences, where
  information is exchanged without publication. These travels have
  strong scientific justification. They provided the opportunity
  for exchange of information, to test new ideas, to gain new
  perspective, and to avoid unnecessary experiments. The milieu
  encourages innovation and planning, as well as providing a
  stimulus and vitality that fosters research progress.<br>
  <br>
  Other events that make up a lifetime continued. Through fortunate
  circumstances, Lyda and I obtained a building lot at a price that
  a professor could afford, in the hills north of UCLA, overlooking
  the city and ocean. The home we built (I was again contractor and
  miscellaneous laborer) has served as a focal point for family
  activities, and a temporary residence for grandchildren attending
  UCLA. The home meant much for my research, as I could readily
  move between home and lab, and the ambiance created was
  supportive for study and writing.<br>
  <br>
  The study of life processes has given me a deep appreciation for
  the marvel of the living cell. The beauty, the design, and the
  controls honed by years of evolution, and the ability humans have
  to gain more and more understanding of life, the earth and the
  universe, are wonderful to contemplate. I firmly believe that our
  present and future knowledge of all that we are and what
  surrounds us depends on the tools and approaches of science. I
  was struck by how well <a href="../1996/index.html">Harold
  Kroto</a>, one of last year's Nobelists, presented what are some
  of my views in his biographical sketch. As he stated, "I am a
  devout atheist--nothing else makes sense to me and I must admit
  to being bewildered by those, who in the face of what appears to
  be so obvious, still believe in a mystical creator." I wonder if
  in the United States we will ever reach the day when the man-made
  concept of a God will not appear on our money, and for political
  survival must be invoked by those who seek to represent us in our
  democracy.<br>
  <br>
  It is disappointing how little the understanding that science
  provides seems to have permeated into society as a whole. All too
  common attitudes and approaches seem to have progressed little
  since the days of Galileo. Religious fundamentalists successfully
  oppose the teaching of evolution, and by this decry the teaching
  of critical thinking. We humans have a remarkable ability to
  blind ourselves to unpleasant facts. This applies not only to
  mystical and religious beliefs, but also to long-term
  environmental consequences of our actions. If we fail to teach
  our children the skills they need to think clearly, they will
  march behind whatever guru wears the shiniest cloak. Our
  political processes and a host of human interactions are
  undermined because many have not learned how to gain a sound
  understanding of what they encounter.<br>
  <br>
  The major problem facing humanity is that of the survival of our
  selves and our progeny. In my less optimistic moments, I feel
  that we will continue to decimate the environment that surrounds
  us, even though we know of our folly and of what has happened to
  others. Humans could become quite transient occupants of planet
  earth. The most important cause of our problem is over
  population, which nature, as with other species, will deal with
  severely. I hear the cry from capable environmental leaders and
  organizations for movement toward sustainable societies. They are
  calling for sensible approaches to steer us away from impending
  disaster. But their voices remain largely unheard as those with
  power, and those misled by religious or nationality concerns,
  become immersed in unimportant, self-centered and short range
  pursuits.</p>
