  <h2>Essential Elements of a Universal and Enduring Peace</h2>

  <p>Men and women everywhere are once more
  asking the old question - is it peace? They are asking it with
  anxiety and fear; for, on the one hand, there has never been such
  a longing for peace and dread of war as there is today. On the
  other hand, there have never been such awful means of spreading
  destruction and death as those that are now being prepared in
  well-nigh every country. To a visitor from another planet the
  world would present a spectacle as melancholy as it is
  bewildering. He would see civilization in danger of perishing
  under the oppression of a gigantic paradox: he would see
  multitudes of people starving in the midst of plenty, and nations
  preparing for war although pledged to peace.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the grimmest aspect of this great
  paradox is that the very nations that are chiefly responsible for
  starting and for maintaining the Disarmament Conference are also
  the nations that have begun a new arms race<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That is what a visitor from
  another planet would see. But we are not visitors from another
  world. This is our world, and we must make the best of it. We
  cannot give up hope for the future of humanity because it is our
  destiny to shape that future for good or ill. Whatever we do or
  fail to do will influence the course of history. We who are here
  belong to nations that are in the vanguard of civilization. Those
  nations have a very great responsibility at this juncture of the
  world's affairs, for by throwing their joint weight into the
  scales of history on the right side, they may tip the balance
  decisively in favour of peace.</p>

  <p>It is because I believe that it is in the
  power of such nations to lead the world back into the paths of
  peace that I propose to devote myself to explaining what, in my
  opinion, can and should be done to banish the fear of war that
  hangs so heavily over the world. That is not an easy task. But we
  have set our hand to that task of organizing peace already in
  subscribing to the Covenant of the League, and although its
  attainment is difficult, it is not impossible. The forces that
  are driving mankind toward unity and peace are deep-seated and
  powerful. They are material and natural, as well as moral and
  intellectual. We have realism, common sense and the instinct of
  self-preservation on our side as well as the noblest ideals and
  the loftiest aspirations. Therefore, let us not despair, but
  instead, survey the position, consider carefully the action we
  must take, and then address ourselves to our common task in a
  mood of sober resolution and quiet confidence, without haste and
  without pause.</p>

  <p>In surveying where the problem of peace
  stands, we must begin by casting a glance back upon the period of
  the World War and at the lines on which the world has been
  tackling this problem ever since. The more the history of the
  World War and what led up to it is studied, the more clearly
  those tragic years become revealed as a vast collapse of
  civilization. It was a war which resulted from the false
  standards of patriotism and ideas of what constitute the honour
  and vital interests of nations. It revealed the incapacity of
  nations to find the best way to defend these interests and to
  become adjusted to the facts of the modern world. Two of these
  great facts are the increasing cultural and material
  interdependence of nations and the growing deadliness of warfare.
  The world before 1914 was already a world in which the welfare of
  each individual nation was inextricably bound up with the
  prosperity of the whole community of nations. Moreover, war has
  become a thing potentially so terrible and destructive that it
  should have been the common aim of statesmen to put an end to it
  forever. But the standards of statecraft insisted upon the
  untrammeled claim of each nation to uphold its own view of its
  rights by force and to build whatever armaments it considered
  necessary for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The inevitable result was the balance of
  power, the arms race, the dividing up of the world into rival
  alliances, and ultimately, war. This condition of affairs had
  deep roots in the economic system which led to competition for
  foreign trade, markets, and sources of raw material that was one
  of the major causes of the conflict. Four years of world war, at
  a cost in human suffering which our minds are mercifully too
  limited to imagine, led to the very clear realization that
  international anarchy must be abandoned if civilization was to
  survive.</p>

  <p>The Peace Conference was the scene, or,
  shall we say, the first stage, in a tremendous struggle between
  the new forces, the new hopes and aspirations to which the agony
  of the World War had given birth, and the champions of the old
  order in patriotism and in economic relations alike. The
  compromise that emerged from this struggle was embodied in the
  Covenant of the League, the International Labor Organization, and
  the terms of the peace settlement. On the whole, the advocates of
  a new order triumphed in the former two treaties; the champions
  of the old had their way to a considerable extent in the peace
  settlement. But it must be realized that there were, at the Peace
  Conference, strong forces in favour of going much further than
  the present Covenant, and that there was afterwards a slump in
  international idealism that led to public opinion and governments
  receding far below the level of even the compromise embodied in
  the existing treaties.</p>

  <p>The world's worst postwar troubles have
  been due, not so much to the peace settlement, as to the spirit
  in which some of its provisions were worked. Up to the present
  day, the Covenant and the constitution of the International Labor
  Organization are, on the whole, still far ahead of the most
  advanced governments in the world. At the same time it must be
  realized that the only connection between the Covenant and the
  Peace Treaties is purely mechanical - states ratifying the one
  automatically ratified the other, just as, through a special
  provision of the Versailles Treaty, any states that accepted it
  automatically became parties to the Hague Opium Convention of
  1912<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>. But states can accept
  the obligations of the Covenant, just as they can those of the
  Hague Opium Convention, without in any way incurring the
  obligations of the Peace Treaties, and the latter could be
  amended or even abrogated without in any way affecting the
  Covenant. The Covenant is in no sense whatever based upon the
  Peace Treaties, and that is a fact which should be clearly
  realized.</p>

  <p>Having made these general remarks, I
  propose to take up, briefly, the three great divisions of
  international relations and to show on what lines they have
  developed since the Peace Conference. Those three divisions are:
  first, <i>economic relations;</i> second, <i>the pacific
  settlement of disputes</i>; and third, <i>guarantees against
  war,</i> which include renunciation of war, disarmament, and
  common action to restrain an aggressor.</p>

  <p>After this, I wish to cast a glance at the
  present situation in the light of these developments. Finally, I
  shall indicate what I think could and should be done now if we
  are to stop the arms race, remove the present danger of war, and
  establish a universal and an endurable peace.</p>

  <p>During the war it had been found necessary
  to organize economic life, not only nationally but
  internationally. At the Peace Conference there was a determined
  effort to save the inter-Allied wartime machinery and to adapt it
  to international reconstruction work under the supervision of the
  Supreme Economic Council. But the pressure to return to
  untrammeled economic individualism was too strong. For a short
  period there was a hope that the Reparations Commission might
  take such a view of its functions as would convert it into a kind
  of reconstruction commission, but this hope soon faded. The whole
  question of reparations and debts was tackled on narrower and
  more short-sighted lines, with results that were predicted at the
  time by Mr. Keynes<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> and
  others. Far-reaching proposals in the British draft of the
  Covenant for the promotion of cooperation on matters of common
  concern, and particularly on economic and financial questions,
  were considerably watered down. All that was left were the vague
  and brief provisions of Articles 23 and 24 of the Covenant
  concerning the work of the technical organizations, advisory
  committees, and international bureaus, and the constitution of
  the International Labor Organization.</p>

  <p>At the outset the League's economic and
  financial work was hampered by the existence of the questions of
  reparations and debts, with which it was not allowed to deal, but
  which were being handled on lines that made fruitful
  international economic and financial cooperation exceedingly
  difficult. But gradually these questions dropped into the
  background. The League developed its machinery for cooperation on
  matters of common concern, and the views of governments on these
  subjects became broader. Originally the League was forbidden to
  touch the subject of tariffs, and there was a strong
  predisposition to regard banking as a mystery that must be
  removed entirely from the purview of governments. This feeling
  led to the total separation of the international Bank of
  Settlements from the League. But by degrees the competence
  allowed to the League in these matters embraced every aspect of
  economic and financial relations, including particularly that of
  tariffs, quotas, and other barriers to trade. And today the
  United States, taking an active part in all these aspects of
  League work, has become a member of the International Labor
  Organization<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>As regards pacific settlement of disputes,
  the system laid down in the Covenant has been very greatly
  extended. This system gave either party to a dispute the right to
  summon the other before the Council or Assembly and bound both
  parties to appear. It also gave any member of the League, whether
  or not a party to a dispute, the right to draw the attention of
  the Council to any circumstances affecting the good understanding
  between states on which peace depends. This provision has been
  extensively used. The Council has developed its procedure and
  powers in the light of a number of precedents, and the Assembly
  has been used on several occasions. The number of disputes
  settled, including those that threatened peace, is by this time
  very considerable. Article 13 of the Covenant provides for
  arbitration or judicial settlement by agreement between the
  parties, and Article 14 calls for the setting up of a Permanent
  Court of International Justice. That Court was set up, with
  compulsory jurisdiction in the well-known Optional Clause<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, which by this time has been signed
  by forty-two members of the League, including all the Great
  Powers except Japan. There is a bill before the United States
  Congress at present for accession to the Statute of the
  Court<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> on certain conditions
  which have been accepted by the members of the League. As regards
  arbitration, the General Act of Arbitration has been framed and
  adopted by nineteen states. A large number of treaties - by this
  time some hundreds - provide for referring disputes to the Court
  or to arbitration, and most League Conventions provide that the
  Court shall be resorted to in settling any question as to how
  they shall be interpreted.</p>

  <p>In short, it may be said that on paper the
  obligations to settle international disputes peacefully are now
  so comprehensive and far-reaching that it is almost impossible
  for a state to resort to war without violating one or more solemn
  treaty obligations. But no one would be bold enough to suggest
  that this is enough to ensure peace. The real difficulty is to
  make sure that such treaty obligations will be observed. It is
  precisely because of the primary importance of this problem that
  the obligations and machinery for settling disputes peacefully
  have, from the outset of the League's career, been connected with
  the obligations to renounce war and to restrain an aggressor. The
  agreement to refer all disputes to some form of pacific procedure
  in Article 12 of the Covenant is linked with an undertaking in no
  circumstances to go to war for a certain period; the agreement to
  arbitrate or go to the Court in Article 13 is coupled with an
  agreement not to resort to war against a state accepting an
  arbitral award or a judgment; the agreement in Article 15 to
  refer disputes to the Council or Assembly is coupled with the
  undertaking not to resort to war against a state that accepts a
  report of the Council or Assembly. These undertakings, in their
  turn, are linked with the obligation in Article 16 of the
  Covenant to consider that a state which resorts to war in
  defiance of these obligations has committed acts of war against
  all the members of the League, and to sever all relations with
  such a state and even, if necessary, to take military, naval, and
  air action to put an end to the breach of the peace. The whole
  system for settling disputes peacefully erected on the basis of
  the Covenant is governed by the obligation in Article II to
  regard any war or threat of war as a matter of concern to the
  whole world which the League has a duty to stop by whatever
  action seems wise and effectual, and by the more specific
  obligations of Article 16. This obligation is fundamental in the
  Covenant and was regarded as fundamental in all the various
  drafts which went to the making of the Covenant.</p>

  <p>The Report of the Phillimore
  Committee<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, which was the
  basis of all the subsequent work on the Covenant, regards the
  Covenant as a general treaty of alliance and says that its
  proposed object will be "that whatever happens, peace shall be
  preserved between members of the alliance". For that purpose any
  state resorting to war in the judgment of other members of the
  alliance "will become <i>ipso facto</i> at war with all the other
  allied States", and the latter agree to take "jointly and
  severally all such measures - military, naval, financial and
  economic - as will best avail for restraining a breach of the
  Covenant". The plan submitted by <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/index.html">Lord Cecil</a><a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>, the Italian and German plans, the
  proposals of the American League to Enforce Peace<a href=
  "#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>, and the French plan, all provide
  not only for economic but also for military sanctions. The
  clearest and most striking argument for a powerful and
  comprehensive system of sanctions to buttress the obligations for
  renouncing war and settling disputes peacefully was that put
  forward by General Smuts in his famous pamphlet entitled <i>The
  League of Nations: A Practical Suggestion<a href=
  "#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</i> In this pamphlet, General
  Smuts says that he doubts whether economic and financial
  sanctions will be enough "if unsupported by military and naval
  action".</p>

  <p>The other point on which there was
  universal agreement in all the drafts which is reflected in the
  existing Covenant is that it was not possible at the time to rule
  out resort to war, that is, so-called "private" war, in all
  circumstances. War was forbidden as against a state that had
  accepted an arbitral award or a judicial decision or a report of
  the Council concurred in by all its members, except the parties,
  or a similar report of the Assembly. War was also ruled out in
  any circumstances for a period sufficient to allow time for the
  Council or Assembly or for arbitration to effect a settlement -
  it was this provision which was known as the "moratorium on war".
  But if the Council or Assembly could not reach agreement on a
  report, the parties were free, after three months, to take such
  action as they saw fit. This was the famous "gap" in the
  Covenant. Since that time the widespread acceptance of the
  compulsory jurisdiction of the Court and of arbitration has made
  it much less likely that a position of deadlock could be reached
  in which there was no decision on the dispute and no agreement of
  the Assembly or Council, consequently leaving the door open to
  war after three months.</p>

  <p>In the second place, virtually all the
  members of the League have signed the Briand-<a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1929/index.html">Kellogg</a> Pact<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> by which they renounce war as an
  instrument of national policy and undertake never to seek the
  solution of any dispute or conflict, whatever its nature or
  origin, except by pacific means. This is generally regarded as
  closing the "gap" in the Covenant. To make assurance doubly sure,
  the last British government, in addition to setting the example
  which led to the widespread acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction
  and arbitration, proposed an amendment of the Covenant to
  incorporate in it the absolute renunciation of war contained in
  the Briand-Kellogg Pact. That is a purpose which is as yet
  unfulfilled but which has not been abandoned.</p>

  <p>In the third place, there has been a
  general weakening of confidence in the validity of the sanctions
  obligations of the Covenant. As far back as the Second Assembly,
  the Covenant was interpreted as establishing a clear distinction
  between economic and military sanctions. Economic sanctions, that
  is, the boycott of an aggressor, were regarded as obligatory,
  whereas military sanctions were considered optional. It is clear
  that a state cannot continue normal commercial and financial
  relations with an aggressor with out becoming an accessory after
  the fact to the crime of war. In our modern world of
  interdependent nations, hardly any state can wage war
  successfully without raising loans and buying war materials of
  every kind in the markets of other nations. That is why the
  boycott of an aggressor is the minimum obligation below which
  states can hardly go without conniving at the very evil they are
  supposed to be trying to suppress. But to cut off relations with
  an aggressor may often invite retaliation by armed action, and
  this would, in its turn, make necessary some form of collective
  self-defence by the loyal members of the League. It is rather in
  these terms that the problem is being envisaged today by those
  who are concerned with the question of sanctions. But, for the
  most part, the view has gained ground that the sanctions
  provisions of the Covenant are vague and unreliable and that when
  it comes to the point, states will not, in fact, act upon
  them.</p>

  <p>The fourth point is that from the outset of
  the discussion of this subject, the question of the organization
  of sanctions against an aggressor has been closely linked with
  the question of reducing and limiting armaments. Here again,
  suggestions made at the Peace Conference went far beyond what was
  actually embodied in the Covenant. A stout fight was put up by
  General Smuts and others to secure an immediate and drastic
  reduction of Allied armaments, including the abolition of
  conscription, but it failed. Mr. Lloyd George, at the end of the
  Conference, in an appeal to his colleagues entitled "Some
  Considerations for the Peace Conference before They Finally Draft
  Their Terms"<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, made the
  following statement:</p>

  <p>"An essential element in the peace
  settlement is the constitution of the League of Nations as the
  effective guardian of international right and international
  liberty throughout the world. If this is to happen, the first
  thing to do is that the leading members of the League of Nations
  should arrive at an understanding between themselves in regard to
  armaments.</p>

  <p>To my mind it is idle to endeavour to
  impose a permanent limitation of armaments upon Germany unless we
  are prepared similarly to impose a limitation upon
  ourselves...</p>

  <p>If the League is to do its work for the
  world (continued Mr. Lloyd George), it will only be because the
  members of the League trust it themselves and because there are
  no rivalries and jealousies in the matter of armaments between
  them. The first condition of success for the League of Nations
  is, therefore, a firm understanding between the British Empire
  and the United States of America and France and Italy that there
  will be no competitive building up of fleets or armies between
  them. Unless this is arrived at before the Covenant is signed,
  the League of Nations will be a sham and a mockery."</p>

  <p>There is a good deal in this statement
  which has a topical ring today. As you all know, the Covenant and
  the Peace Treaties did not go nearly so far; but the Covenant did
  pledge the members of the League to "recognize that the
  maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments
  to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the
  enforcement by common action of international obligations". It
  also pledged the members of the League to the view that "the
  manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of
  war is open to grave objections". The Council of the League was
  to devise means to give effect to these pledges. The Central
  Powers were drastically disarmed by the Peace Treaties, and the
  process of disarmament was subjected to stringent international
  control, on the understanding that these measures were a
  preliminary to general disarmament.</p>

  <p>That being the position, it became
  necessary from the outset of the League's career to find ways of
  giving effect to this part of the Covenant and to fulfil the
  promise to the Central Powers. At an early stage - ever since the
  famous Resolution 14 of the Third Assembly<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> - it was admitted that reduction
  and limitation of armaments were possible only in return for
  implementing the sanctions provisions of the Covenant. States
  would not give up reliance on their armed strength for their
  protection, except insofar as the League was prepared to
  substitute collective guarantees and means of defence. Resolution
  14, the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and the Geneva
  Protocol<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>, were successive
  stages in the attempt to organize a firm basis of security so as
  to make possible far-reaching disarmament. The Geneva Protocol
  provided for compulsory all-in arbitration. It interpreted
  Article 16 of the Covenant to mean the obligation of every member
  of the League to cooperate in upholding the Covenant and
  resisting acts of aggression to the extent allowed by its
  geographical situation and the level of its armaments. This
  interpretation was adopted by the Locarno Powers in a covering
  letter (Annex F), in which they gave their view of Article 16 to
  the German government. If the Protocol had been adopted, the
  Disarmament Conference would have been held in 1925, that is,
  some years before the economic crisis and its effects in
  intensifying nationalism. It is not too much to say that had this
  taken place, the Protocol would have provided the arbitration and
  security basis for a successful Conference which would have
  hastened the entry of Germany and the Soviet Union into the
  League and would have made the subsequent course of history both
  in Europe and the Far East very different and less tragic than it
  has been.</p>

  <p>In 1930 the connected subjects of
  arbitration, security, and disarmament were once more taken up
  vigorously at Geneva. The Optional Clause and the General Act
  were accepted by a large number of states; revision of the
  Covenant was taken in hand, to incorporate in it the complete
  renunciation of war contained in the Briand-Kellogg Pact; the
  Treaty of Financial Assistance and the Treaty for Strengthening
  the Means to Prevent War were concluded, with the proviso that
  they should come into force simultaneously with the Disarmament
  Convention, all of which were indispensable elements in a
  properly organized and constructive peace system. The world
  economic crisis had been growing steadily more severe and had
  brought to the surface social and national conflicts that had
  been latent in the whole post-war situation. One aspect in the
  working out of these forces became evident with the outbreak of
  the Sino-Japanese conflict<a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>, followed by the withdrawal of
  Germany and Japan from the League<a href=
  "#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. The internal and external
  circumstances accompanying and flowing from these withdrawals are
  merely sharp and dramatic illustrations of the worldwide clash of
  the forces released by the economic depression. The struggle
  between those forces is going on with more or less intensity and
  in different forms all over the world and within each country. On
  the outcome of that struggle depends in great measure the future
  of world peace.</p>

  <p>That, then, is the situation which
  confronts all of us who would seek peace and ensure it. I have
  tried to describe it without optimism or pessimism but in a
  spirit of sober realism. The question is, what are we to do in
  order to consolidate peace on a universal and durable foundation,
  and what are the essential elements of such a peace? This brings
  me to the political aspect of the present situation. It is
  obviously not possible wholly to separate its economic from its
  political features. On the contrary, the characteristic element
  of the present situation is that economic questions have finally
  and irrevocably invaded the domain of public life and politics.
  The drive toward economic nationalism is only part of the general
  revival of nationalism. In some states militant nationalism has
  gone to the lengths of dictatorship, the cult of the absolute or
  totalitarian state and the glorification of war. In one case
  aggression and treaty breaking have actually taken place. These
  developments in certain states have been possible only because of
  the failure to carry out solemn promises and treaty obligations
  as regards both disarmament and joint action against war. This
  failure in turn is due to the fact that the revival of
  nationalism is not confined to one or two countries but has
  become fairly general. The years of the economic depression have
  been years of political reaction, and that is why the economic
  crisis has generated a world peace crisis.</p>

  <p>It has been said that since September,
  1931, the world has been divided into wholehearted violators and
  halfhearted supporters of the Covenant. That is an exaggeration
  and simplification, but, unfortunately, it is not a complete
  misstatement. One conclusion, indeed, which has been expressed by
  prominent statesmen is that we should abandon the whole attempt
  to make a reality of the collective system. In almost every
  country there are elements of opinion which would welcome such a
  conclusion because they wish to return to the politics of the
  balance of power, unrestricted and unregulated armaments,
  international anarchy, and preparation for war. But public
  opinion is passionately determined in no circumstances to resign
  itself to the abandonment of all the promises and the hopes of
  the last fifteen years. That uprising of opinion is an undoubted
  fact in my own country, and I believe the situation is analogous
  elsewhere. We had four years of world war which the peoples
  endured only because they were told that their sufferings would
  free humanity forever from the scourge of war. For a decade and a
  half since those terrible years, we have been told by statesmen
  and leaders of opinion of every party and every religious
  organization that only through the maintenance and strengthening
  of the League could the world hope to put an end to war. So, far
  from being ready to abandon that attempt and to forget those
  promises and assurances, public opinion is ready to become
  passionately angry with those who would bid us resign ourselves
  and our children once more to the shambles.</p>

  <p>One of the first essentials is a policy of
  unreserved political cooperation with all the nations of the
  world. There is no effective alternative. If nations seek to
  return to the policy of the balance of power, if, with this in
  view, they divide into armed groups - each group seeking to pile
  up its armaments higher than its rival groups - then such a
  policy cannot but arouse suspicion and distrust and must be
  followed by disaster. A policy of international cooperation would
  convert the League into what its promoters intended it to be,
  that is, a sure guarantee of the world's peace. This cannot be
  accomplished so long as nations continue to live in a state of
  anarchy, each claiming to be the judge of its own rights.</p>

  <p>To solve the problem of organizing world
  peace we must establish world law and order. The nations must be
  organized internationally and induced to enter into partnership,
  subordinating in some measure national sovereignty to worldwide
  institutions and obligations. By these means reality would be
  given to the Pact of Paris by all the nations settling every form
  of dispute peacefully, regarding every threat of war as a common
  concern, and treating war as an international crime.</p>

  <p>I want now to consider two of the most
  difficult aspects of the problem of an organized peace: the
  question of security, and the question of equality. Three years'
  experience of the Disarmament Conference has convinced me that a
  settlement of these two points is essential to a universal and
  durable peace. I believe that the majority of the nations
  represented at Geneva would confirm this view of the position.
  The agreement reached on December II, 1932, by the five powers -
  the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and my own country -
  laid it down that the Disarmament Convention must make provision
  for the application of the principle of equality in a system of
  security for all states. But it said nothing as to how this
  equality of rights was to be achieved, or how the security of any
  state could be strengthened.</p>

  <p>The question as to whether Germany can be
  induced to return to the comity of nations at Geneva and resume
  her seat at the Disarmament Conference turns on the settlement of
  these two issues. As regards equality of rights, objection has
  been raised in many quarters during recent months to its
  immediate application, on the ground that the Hitler regime
  cannot be trusted. It is necessary, therefore, to point out that
  the inferiority complex is not limited to the members of the
  government, but touches the entire German population. I would
  recall the declaration of Dr. Br&uuml;ning<a href=
  "#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> in the early stages of the
  Disarmament Conference. He said: "In submitting these proposals
  to the Conference, the German Delegation wish to make it clear
  that the German Government cannot accept a Convention unless its
  provisions are equally applicable to Germany and other signatory
  States." In this connection it must be obvious that Chancellor
  Hitler could not accept anything less than Dr. Br&uuml;ning's
  proposals.</p>

  <p>Closely allied to this question of equality
  of rights is that of national security. Throughout the long
  drawn-out proceedings of the Conference, it has been made clear
  that states are not prepared to reduce their armaments unless, at
  the same time, definite undertakings are given to settle disputes
  without resort to force and to stand by each other in upholding
  treaties against an aggressor or war maker.</p>

  <p>Thus, there can be no real disarmament
  except on the basis of the collective peace system of the League
  of Nations. The Disarmament Conference has become the focal point
  of a great struggle between anarchy and world order, between
  those who are willing to cooperate and those who would be the
  sole judge in their own case, between those who think in terms of
  inevitable armed conflict and those who seek to build a universal
  and durable peace. Mr. Litvinov, in his maiden speech to the
  Assembly, made it clear that the Soviet Union's experience at the
  Disarmament Conference and anxiety to strengthen the collective
  peace system were the deciding factors of her entry into the
  League<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>. The main link
  between the United States and the League is the Disarmament
  Conference.</p>

  <p>The United States are taking the lead in
  urging the conclusion of a Convention controlling the trade in
  arms and have offered in connection with the Disarmament
  Conference to conclude with the members of the League a treaty of
  nonaggression and conclusion that will enable them to cooperate
  with the Council and Assembly in putting an end to a war or
  threat of war. In this connection they have further offered to
  give an undertaking that the United States will not oppose the
  application of League sanctions against a country which the
  United States also regard as an aggressor.</p>

  <p>As a first step there must be an offer to
  achieve equality of rights in disarmament by abolishing the
  weapons forbidden to the Central Powers by the Peace Treaties.
  This will become possible only in return for a comprehensive
  system of supervision and diplomatic, economic, and financial
  guarantees of execution of a disarmament convention; a treaty of
  non-aggression, with a definition of aggression, linked with the
  sanctions system of the League; drastic international control of
  the trade in arms and the limitation of armaments budgets; a
  reaffirmation of the Protocol - Locarno interpretation of Article
  16 of the Covenant; the creation of an international air police
  force, and the internationalizing of civil aviation. Most of
  these proposals, indeed, have been put forward at the Conference
  by one or more governments. It has become impossible to give up
  the enterprise of disarmament without abandoning the whole great
  adventure of building up a collective peace system. It is by now
  generally realized that, on the one hand, unless armaments are
  drastically reduced, limited, and internationally controlled, the
  new armaments race will overshadow and ultimately break down the
  collective peace system, and that, on the other hand, the arms
  race can be stopped and a beginning with disarmament made only if
  states are prepared to build up a solid system of collective
  defence on the basis of Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant.</p>

  <p>Another essential to a universal and
  durable peace is social justice. The constitution of the
  International Labor Organization, which, as you know, is part of
  the machinery of the League of Nations, says that universal peace
  can be established only on the basis of social justice. It goes
  on to add that conditions of labor exist involving such
  injustice, hardship, and privation to large numbers of people
  that the resulting unrest imperils the peace and harmony of the
  world. Thus, the struggle for peace includes the struggle for
  freedom and justice for the masses of all countries. That is the
  basis and background of the whole world situation which should
  always be kept in mind.</p>

  <p>Finally, may I ask, is it possible to stay
  halfway on the road that leads to total disarmament and the
  setting up of a League police force? If we contemplate as our
  ultimate end a League which controls the world's economic life
  and the world's armed forces, then we must say frankly that our
  ultimate ideal is the creation of nothing less than a World
  Commonwealth. I think we must make this admission. The
  establishment of a World Commonwealth is, in the long run, the
  only alternative to a relapse into a world war. The psychological
  obstacles are formidable but not insurmountable. There is already
  a group of nations in the world between whom war may be
  considered as ruled out forever. Those nations are the British
  Commonwealth, the United States, and the surviving European
  democracies. I would add to that group the Soviet Union which, in
  its international policy, has shown that it is devoted to peace,
  abhors war, and sincerely believes in the ideal of world union
  and world cooperation, although it is of the opinion that in the
  long run such a consummation is impossible without a far-reaching
  change in the present social order. The democracies stand for a
  certain view of what constitutes the good life. That view is
  incompatible with war or with the "totalitarian state". I do not
  believe that the values which the Western democracies consider
  essential to civilization can survive in a world rent by the
  international anarchy of nationalism and the economic anarchy of
  competitive enterprise. I think we must get the better of both
  those forces and subordinate them to the common good through
  world union on the basis of social justice. I believe that the
  League of Nations and the International Labor Organization are
  the instruments to our hand for conceiving and executing such a
  policy. Today the world is in transition. The vast upheaval of
  the World War set in motion forces that will either destroy
  civilization or raise mankind to undreamed of heights of human
  welfare and prosperity.</p>

  <p>The policy I have endeavoured to sketch is
  big, bold, and far-reaching. It will be no light and simple task
  to lay the foundations of a World Commonwealth. It is, on the
  contrary, perhaps, the greatest and most difficult enterprise
  ever imagined by the audacious mind of man. But it is a task
  which has become a necessity. It is an enterprise that is solidly
  grounded in realities and in the facts of the modern world. If
  there is still virtue in our common Western civilization and our
  faith in democracy - and I believe there is - then we must dare
  to announce that policy as a challenge to the world and as the
  summons to a great crusade for peace. What greater cause and what
  more splendid adventure can be set before the youth of the world
  than the endeavour to bring into being that age - old dream of
  saints and sages - the great Commonwealth of the World as the
  visible embodiment of the brotherhood of man?</p>
