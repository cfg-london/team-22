  <h1>Polykarp Kusch - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kusch.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Polykarp Kusch</b> was born in
  Blankenburg, Germany, on the 26th January, 1911, the son of a
  clergyman. He has lived in the United States since 1912 and is a
  citizen of that country. He received his early education in the
  midwest of the United States. His original professional goal was
  in the field of chemistry, but soon after beginning his course of
  studies at the Case Institute of Technology, Cleveland, Ohio, his
  interest rapidly shifted to physics. In 1931 he received the B.S.
  degree in physics. He carried on his graduate study at the
  University of
  Illinois which awarded him the M.S. degree in 1933 and the
  Ph.D. degree in 1936. At Illinois he worked on problems in the
  field of optical molecular spectroscopy under the guidance of
  Professor F. Wheeler Loomis. He worked with Professor John T.
  Tate at the University of Minnesota in the field of mass
  spectroscopy during 1936-1937.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1937 Kusch has been associated with the Department of
  Physics of Columbia University, New York City, except for
  interruptions engendered by World War II. These years were spent
  in research and development on microwave generators at the
  Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the Bell Telephone
  Laboratories and Columbia University. The experience was
  important not only in that it gave him knowledge of microwave
  methods, but also in that it suggested application of the special
  techniques of vacuum tube technology to a large range of problems
  in experimental physics.<br>
  <br>
  Kusch has been a Professor of Physics at Columbia University
  since 1949. From his first days at Columbia, he has been
  intimately associated with Professor <a href=
  "../1944/index.html">I.I. Rabi</a> in his programme of research
  on atomic, molecular and nuclear properties and phenomena by the
  method of molecular beams. The direction in which his own
  research has been directed has been greatly influenced by this
  long association. His research has dealt principally with the
  small details of the interactions of the constituent particles of
  atoms and of molecules with each other and with externally
  applied fields. The establishment of the reality of the anomalous
  magnetic moment of the electron and the precision determination
  of its magnitude was part of an intensive programme of postwar
  research with atomic and molecular beams. Later, he has also
  become interested in problems in chemical physics to whose
  experimental study he has applied the molecular beams
  technique.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Kusch has been awarded honorary Sc.D. degrees of the
  Case Institute of Technology, the Ohio State University, the University of
  Illinois and Colby College. He was elected to the membership in
  the National Academy
  of Sciences (USA) in 1956.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years he is increasingly concerned with problems of
  education, especially that of educating the young to understand a
  civilization strongly affected by the knowledge of science and by
  the techniques that result from this knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  Kusch married Edith Starr McRoberts; they had three daughters.
  His wife died in 1959 and he was married to Betty Pezzoni in
  1960.</p>
