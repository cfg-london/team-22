  <h2>Internationalism</h2>

<p>I</p>

  <p>In accordance with the Statutes of the
  Nobel Foundation, every prizewinner is supposed to deliver a
  public lecture on the work which earned him the prize. It has
  seemed natural for me, when fulfilling this obligation today, to
  try to give an account of the theoretical basis of the work which
  is being done for international peace and law, work of which my
  efforts form a part. It is probably superfluous to mention that
  this account is not original in any of its details; it must take
  its material from many fields in which I am only a layman. At
  best it can claim to be original only in the manner in which the
  material is assembled and in the spirit in which it is given.</p>

  <p>I shall discuss <i>Internationalism</i>,
  and not "Pacifism". The latter word has never appealed to me - it
  is a linguistic hybrid, directing one-sided attention to the
  negative aspect of the peace movement, the struggle against war;
  "antimilitarism" is a better word for this aspect of our efforts.
  Not that I stand aside from pacifism or antimilitarism; they
  constitute a necessary part of our work. But I endow these words
  with the special connotation (not universally accepted) of a
  moral theory; by pacifism I understand a moral protest against
  the use of violence and war in international relations. A
  pacifist will often - at least nowadays - be an internationalist
  and vice versa. But history shows us that a pacifist need not
  think internationally. Jesus of Nazareth was a pacifist; but all
  his utterances, insofar as they have survived, show that
  internationalism was quite foreign to him, for the very reason
  that he did not think politically at all; he was apolitical. If
  we were to place him in one of our present-day categories, we
  should have to call him an antimilitarist and an individualistic
  anarchist.</p>

  <p>Internationalism is a <i>social</i> and
  <i>political</i> theory, a certain concept of how human society
  ought to be organized, and in particular a concept of how the
  nations ought to organize their mutual relations.</p>

  <p>The two theories, <i>nationalism</i> and
  <i>internationalism</i>, stand in opposition to each other
  because they emphasize different aspects of this question. Thus,
  they often oppose each other on the use of principles in everyday
  politics, which for the most part involve decisions on individual
  cases. But there is nothing to hinder their final synthesis in a
  higher union - one might say in accordance with Hegel's
  dialectic<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>. On the contrary.
  Internationalism also recognizes, by its very name, that nations
  do exist. It simply limits their scope more than one-sided
  nationalism does.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there is an absolute
  conflict between nationalism and <i>cosmopolitanism</i>. The
  latter looks away from and wants to remove national conflicts and
  differences, even in those fields where internationalism accepts,
  and even supports, the fact that nations should develop their own
  ways of life.</p>

  <center>
    <p>II</p>
  </center>

  <p>Like all social theories, internationalism
  must seek its basis in the economic and technical fields; here
  are to be found the most profound and the most decisive factors
  in the development of society. Other factors can play a role -
  for example, religious beliefs, which have often influenced the
  shaping of societies, or intellectual movements - but they are
  all of subsidiary importance, and sometimes of a derivative,
  secondary nature. The most important factors in the development
  of society are, economically, the possibility of a division of
  labor, and technically, the means of exchanging goods and ideas
  within the distribution system - in other words the degree of
  development reached by transport and communications at any
  particular time.</p>

  <p>From ethnography and history we can discern
  three stages in the development of social groups, limited by the
  possibilities provided through economic and technical
  development: the nomadic horde whose members live from hand to
  mouth; the rural community (county) or city-state where the scope
  of the division of labor is restricted; the territorial state and
  the more or less extensive kingdom in which the division of labor
  and the exchange of goods reach larger proportions. Every time
  economic and technical development takes a step forward, forces
  emerge which attempt to create political forms for what, on the
  economic-technical plane, has already more or less become
  reality. This never comes about without a struggle. The past dies
  hard because the contemporary political organizations or holders
  of power seldom bend themselves willingly to the needs of the new
  age, and because past glories and traditions generally become
  transformed into poetic or religious symbols, emotional images,
  which must be repudiated by the practical and prosaic demands of
  the new age. Within each such social group, a feeling of
  solidarity prevails, a compelling need to work together and a joy
  in doing so that represent a high moral value. This feeling is
  often strengthened by the ruling religion, which is generally a
  mythical and mystical expression of the group feeling. War within
  the group is a crime, war against other groups a holy duty.</p>

  <p>Today we stand on a bridge leading from the
  territorial state to the world community. Politically, we are
  still governed by the concept of the territorial state;
  economically and technically, we live under the auspices of
  worldwide communications and worldwide markets.</p>

  <p>The territorial state is such an ancient
  form of society - here in Europe it dates back thousands of years
  - that it is now protected by the sanctity of age and the glory
  of tradition. A strong religious feeling mingles with the respect
  and the devotion to the fatherland.</p>

  <p>The territorial state today is always ready
  to don its "national" costume: it sees in national feeling its
  ideal foundation. Historically, at least in the case of the older
  states, nationalism, the fatherland feeling, is a product of
  state feeling. Only recently, during the nineteenth century, and
  then only in Europe, do we meet forms of the state which have
  been created by a deliberate national feeling. In particular, the
  efforts to reestablish peace after the World War have been
  directed toward the formation of states and the regulation of
  their frontiers according to a consciously national program.</p>

  <p>It is characteristic that this should take
  place just when it is becoming more and more clear to all who
  think about the matter, that technically and economically we have
  left the territorial state behind us. Modern techniques have torn
  down state frontiers, both economical and intellectual. The
  growth of means of transport has created a world market and an
  opportunity for division of labor embracing all the developed and
  most of the undeveloped states. Thus there has arisen a "mutual
  dependence" between the world's different peoples, which is the
  most striking feature of present-day economic life. Just as
  characteristic, perhaps, is the intellectual interdependence
  created through the development of the modern media of
  communication: post, telegraph, telephone, and popular press. The
  simultaneous reactions elicited all over the world by the reading
  of newspaper dispatches about the same events create, as it were,
  a common mental pulse beat for the whole of civilized mankind.
  From San Francisco to Yokohama, from Hammerfest to Melbourne,
  people read at the same time about the famine in Russia, about
  the conference in Washington, about Roald Amundsen's trip to the
  North Pole<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>. They may react
  differently, but they still react simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The free trade movement in the middle of
  the last century represents the first conscious recognition of
  these new circumstances and of the necessity to adapt to them.
  Some years before the war, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1933/index.html">Norman Angell</a> coined the
  word "interdependence"<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> to
  denote the situation that stamps the economic and spiritual
  culture of our time, and laid down a program for internationalism
  on the political level.</p>

  <p>Inherent in the very idea of politics is
  the notion that it must always "come after". Its task is to find
  external organizational forms for what has already been developed
  as a living reality in the economic, technical, and intellectual
  fields. In his telegram to the Nobel Committee recently, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1921/index.html">Hjalmar Branting</a><a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> formulated the task of
  internationalism in exactly the right words when he described it
  as "working toward a higher form of development for world
  civilization".</p>

  <p>The World War showed how very necessary it
  is that this work be brought to a victorious conclusion. It is a
  matter of nothing less than our civilization's "to be or not to
  be". Europe cannot survive another world war.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if the territorial state is to
  continue as the last word in the development of society, then war
  is inevitable. For the state by its nature claims
  <i>sovereignty</i>, the right to an unlimited development of
  power, determined only by self-interest. It is by nature
  anarchistic. The theoretically unrestricted right to develop
  power, to wage war against other states, is antisocial and is
  doubly dangerous, because the state as a mass entity represents a
  low moral and intellectual level. It is an accepted commonplace
  in psychology that the spiritual level of people acting as a
  crowd is far lower than the mean of each individual's
  intelligence or morality. Therefore, all hope of a better future
  for mankind rests on the promotion of "a higher form of
  development for world civilization", an all-embracing human
  community. Are we right in adopting a teleological viewpoint, a
  belief that a radiant and beneficent purpose guides the fate of
  men and of nations and will lead us forward to that higher stage
  of social development? In propaganda work we must necessarily
  build upon such an optimistic assumption. Propaganda must appeal
  to mankind's better judgment and to the necessary belief in a
  better future. For this belief, the valley of the shadow of death
  is but a war station on the road to the blessed summit.</p>

  <p>But teleological considerations can lead no
  further than to a belief and a hope. They do not give certainty.
  History shows us that other highly developed forms of
  civilization have collapsed. Who knows whether the same fate does
  not await our own?</p>

  <center>
    <p>III</p>
  </center>

  <p>Is there any real scientific basis for the
  concept of internationalism apart from the strictly sociological
  approach?</p>

  <p>For thousands of years, prophets and
  thinkers have pointed to the <i>unity of mankind</i> as
  constituting such a basis. The idea was developed in theory by
  the Greek philosophers, especially by the Stoics, and from them
  early Christianity took it up as a moral-religious principle,
  preaching the doctrine of God as the universal father, and that
  of the brotherhood of man. The idea was revived as a confirmed
  maxim at the beginning of more recent times by a number of
  writers - among them, the heretical Sebastian Franck<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>, the Jesuit Su&aacute;rez, one of the
  founders of modern international law<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup>,</a> and Amos Comenius, the last bishop
  of the Moravian Brethren and the father of modern teaching. With
  Comenius, the concept actually acquires a physiological tinge
  when he writes: "Thus we human beings are like a body which
  retains its individuality throughout all its limbs."<a href=
  "#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thereafter, the idea was kept alive
  in Western cultures. It dominated the leading minds during the
  seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, from William
  Penn and Leibnitz to Wergeland and Emerson<a href=
  "#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In recent times, biology has found a
  totally rational and genuinely scientific basis for the concept.
  The unity of mankind is a physiological fact. It was the German
  Weismann's<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> study of
  jellyfish (1883) that opened the approach to such an
  understanding. Other scholars went on to prove that the law which
  Weismann had applied to jellyfish applied equally to all species
  of animals, including man. It is called the law of "continuity of
  the germ plasm".</p>

  <p>Upon the union of the male germ cell with
  the female egg cell, a new cell is created which almost
  immediately splits into two parts. One of these grows rapidly,
  creating the human body of the individual with all its organs,
  and dies only with the individual. The other part remains as
  living germ plasm in the male body and as ova in the female. In
  this way there live in each one of us actual, tangible, traceable
  cells which come from our parents and from their parents and
  ancestors before them, and which - through conception - can in
  turn become our children and our children's children. Each of us
  is, literally and physiologically, a link in the big chain that
  makes up mankind.</p>

  <p>All analogies break down at some point. And
  yet it seems to me appropriate to look upon mankind as a mighty
  tree, with branches and twigs to which individuals are attached
  as leaves, flowers, and fruit. They live their individual,
  semi-independent lives; they</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Wake, grow and live,<br>
    Change, age and die.<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The tree, however, remains and continues,
  with its branches and twigs and shoots, and with constantly
  renewed leaves, flowers, and fruit. The latter have their small,
  short, personal lives. There are leaves that wither and fall
  unnoticed to the ground; there are flowers which gladden with
  their scent and color; there are fruits which can give
  nourishment and growth. Leaves, flowers, and fruit come and go in
  countless numbers; they establish connections with each other so
  that a net, with innumerable intersections, embraces the whole
  tree. It is at this point that our analogy breaks down - but the
  tree is one, and mankind is one single organism.</p>

  <p>During the World War, two natural
  scientists, independently but with the same purpose in mind,
  developed and clarified the significance for internationalism of
  this biological conception<a href=
  "#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Their work, especially the
  second author's application of the theory, with which many
  natural scientists disagree, need not concern us here. Of sole
  use to us is the fact on which it is based. I wish only to draw a
  single conclusion: if mankind is a physiological entity, then
  war-international war no less than civil war - is suicide, a
  degradation of mankind. Hence, internationalism acquires an even
  stronger support and a firmer foundation to build on than that
  which purely social considerations can give.</p>

  <center>
    <p>IV</p>
  </center>

  <p>The consequences and applications of the
  theory of internationalism, as it is here defined and supported,
  are not difficult to establish. They appear in the economic and
  political fields. But their fundamental importance in the purely
  spiritual fields is limited.</p>

  <p>Economically, the consequences of
  internationalism are obvious and have already been hinted at. The
  main concept is that of an international solidarity expressed in
  practice through worldwide division of labor: free trade is the
  principal point in the program of internationalism. This also
  agrees with the latest ideas and theories in the field of natural
  science. Concord, solidarity, and mutual help are the most
  important means of enabling animal species to survive. All
  species capable of grasping this fact manage better in the
  struggle for existence than those which rely upon their own
  strength alone: the wolf, which hunts in a pack, has a greater
  chance of survival than the lion, which hunts alone.
  Kropotkin<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> has fully
  illustrated this idea with examples from animal life and has also
  applied it to the social field in his book Mutual Aid (1902).</p>

  <p>It is necessary to linger in a little more
  detail over the <i>political</i> consequences of
  internationalism. Here the task is to devise patterns of
  organization for the concept of world unity and cooperation
  between the nations. That, in a word, is the great and dominating
  political task of our time.</p>

  <p>Earlier ages fortified themselves behind
  the sovereign state, behind protectionism and militarism. They
  were subject to what Norman Angell called the "optical illusion"
  that a human being increased his stature by an inch if the state
  of which he was a citizen annexed a few more square miles to rule
  over, and that it was beneficial for a state to be economically
  self-supporting, in the sense that it required as few goods as
  possible from abroad. This national protectionism was originally
  formulated by the American Alexander Hamilton<a href=
  "#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>, one of the fathers of the United
  States Constitution; it was then transplanted by the German
  Friedrich Lists<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> from
  American to European soil where it was converted to use in the
  protectionist agitation in all the European countries.</p>

  <p>Hand in hand with nationalist economic
  isolationism, militarism struggles to maintain the sovereign
  state against the forward march of internationalism. No state is
  free from militarism, which is inherent in the very concept of
  the sovereign state. There are merely differences of degree in
  the militarism of states. A state is more militaristic the more
  it allows itself to be guided by considerations of military
  strategy in its external and internal policies. The classic
  example here is the Prussian-German kaiser-state before, and
  especially during, the World War. Militarism is basically a way
  of thinking, a certain interpretation of the function of the
  state; this manner of thinking is, moreover, revealed by its
  outer forms: by armaments and state organization.</p>

  <p>It is against this concept of the sovereign
  state, a state isolated by protectionism and militarism, that
  internationalism must now engage in decisive battle. The
  sovereign state has in our times become a lethal danger to human
  civilization because technical developments enable it to employ
  an infinite number and variety of means of destruction.
  Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master. The
  independent state's armaments, built up in a militaristic spirit,
  with unlimited access to modern methods of destruction, are a
  danger to the state and to others. From this point of view we can
  see how important work for disarmament is; it is not only a task
  of economic importance, which will save unproductive expenditure,
  but also a link in the efforts to demilitarize - or we might say,
  to civilize - the states, to remove from them the temptation to
  adopt an arbitrary anarchical policy, to which their armaments
  subject them.</p>

  <p>If the sovereign state were supported only
  by the narrow, self-serving ideas embodied in economic
  isolationism and militarism, it would not be able to count on a
  secure existence, for internationalism could wage a fairly
  effective fight against it. But the sovereign state is also
  sustained by a spiritual principle: it claims to be "national",
  to represent the people's individuality as a distinct section of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>It has already been said that in most
  states the "nation" is a product of the state, not the basis for
  the creation of the state. And when it is asserted that these
  "nations" have anthropological character of their own, a "racial"
  character, the answer must be that the state which is inhabited
  by an anthropologically pure race is yet to be found. Scientific
  investigations prove that there is in all countries an endless
  crossbreeding between the various constituents of the population.
  A "pure race" does not exist at all. Furthermore, although
  various external anthropological distinctions - the shape of the
  head, the hair, the color of skin - are exact enough in
  themselves, we cannot prove that any intellectual or spiritual
  traits are associated with them.</p>

  <p>And "nationality" is nothing if not a
  spiritual phenomenon. Renan has given the valid definition: "A
  nation is a part of mankind which expresses the will to be a
  nation; a nation's existence is a continuous, daily plebiscite -
  <i>un pl&eacute;biscite de tous les jours."</i><a href=
  "#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> The first clause is a circular
  definition. It is both sharply delimited and totally exhaustive
  because it puts the emphasis on the <i>will</i> to be a nation.
  The concept of nationality thus moves into the realm of the
  spiritual. There it belongs, and there it should stay.</p>

  <p>Internationalism will not eradicate these
  spiritual distinctions. On the contrary, it will develop national
  characteristics, protect their existence, and free their
  development. Internationalism differs in this from
  cosmopolitanism. The latter wants to wipe out or at least to
  minimize all national characteristics, even in the spiritual
  field. Internationalism on the other hand admits that spiritual
  achievements have their roots deep in national life; from this
  national consciousness art and literature derive their character
  and strength and on it even many of the humanistic sciences are
  firmly based.</p>

  <p>Diversity in national intellectual
  development, distinctive character in local self-government -
  both of these are wholly compatible with inter-nationalism, which
  indeed is really a prerequisite for a rich and varied
  development.</p>

  <p>It is the political authority over
  <i>common interests</i> that internationalism wants to transfer
  to a common management. Thus, a world federation, in which
  individual nations linked in groups can participate as members,
  is the political ideal of internationalism. Before the war, a
  first groping step was taken in this direction with the work at
  The Hague<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>. The League of
  Nations marks the first serious and conscious attempt to approach
  that goal.</p>

  <center>
    <p>V</p>
  </center>

  <p>A definition of internationalism along the
  lines which have here been discussed could take the following
  form:</p>

  <p>Internationalism is a community theory of
  society which is founded on economic, spiritual, and biological
  facts. It maintains that respect for a healthy development of
  human society and of world civilization requires that mankind be
  organized internationally. Nationalities should form the
  constitutive links in a great world alliance, and must be
  guaranteed an independent life in the realm of the spiritual and
  for locally delimited tasks, while economic and political
  objectives must be guided internationally in a spirit of peaceful
  cooperation for the promotion of mankind's common interests.</p>

  <center>
    <p>VI</p>
  </center>

  <p>One last word.</p>

  <p>Has this theory of internationalism any
  relevance to our religious needs, to the claim to eternity that
  irresistibly arises in the soul of every thinking and feeling
  person?</p>

  <p>There are surely many of us who can only
  regard the belief in personal immortality as a claim which must
  remain unproved - a projection of the eternity concept onto the
  personal level.</p>

  <p>Should we then be compelled to believe that
  the theory of materialism expressed in the old Arab parable of
  the bush whose leaves fall withered to the ground and die without
  leaving a trace behind, truly applies to the family of man?</p>

  <p>It seems to me that the theory of mankind's
  organic unity and eternal continuity raises the materialistic
  view to a higher level.</p>

  <p>The idea of eternity lives in all of us. We
  thirst to live in a belief which raises our small personality to
  a higher coherence - a coherence which is human and yet
  superhuman, absolute and yet steadily growing and developing,
  ideal and yet real.</p>

  <p>Can this desire ever be fulfilled? It seems
  to be a contradiction in terms.</p>

  <p>And yet there is a belief which satisfies
  this desire and resolves the contradiction.</p>

  <p>It is the belief in the unity of
  mankind.</p>
