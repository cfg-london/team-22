  <h1>Susumu Tonegawa - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="tonegawa.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Nagoya, Japan on September
  6th, 1939, the second of three sons. I have also a younger
  sister. My father was an engineer working for a textile company
  that had several factories scattered in rural towns in the
  southern part of Japan. The company policy made it necessary for
  my father to move from one factory to another every few years. I
  and my brothers and sister spent most of our childhood in these
  small provincial towns, enjoying the space and freedom of the
  countryside. As my elder brother and I reached adolescence,
  however, my parents decided to send us to Tokyo so that we could
  receive a better education.<br>
  <br>
  I commuted to the prestigious Hibiya high school from my Uncle's
  home in Tokyo. During the high school years I developed an
  interest in chemistry, so upon graduation, I chose to take an
  entrance examination for the Department of Chemistry of the
  University of Kyoto, the old capital of Japan. After
  having failed once, I was admitted to this University in 1959.
  This happened to be one year before the first ten-year term of
  the defence treaty between Japan and the United States expired
  and the governments of both countries were preparing for a second
  ten-year term.<br>
  <br>
  The nation was deeply divided between the pragmatic pro-American
  conservatives and the idealistic anti-military leftists. Being
  the home of the most radical leftist student groups, classes at
  Kyoto University were often cancelled due to frequent political
  discussions and demonstrations on the streets. I was only a
  passive participant, withdrawn from the turmoil, but could not
  help having a feeling of defeat shared with many of my classmates
  when the treaty was finally extended for the next ten-year term.
  I believe that this experience might have been a major factor in
  making me give up the original goal of becoming a chemical
  engineer to pursue the academic life.<br>
  <br>
  I became fascinated by the then blossoming science of molecular
  biology when in my senior year I happened to read the papers by
  <a href="../1965/index.html">Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob and Jacques
  Monod</a> on the operon theory. I decided to pursue graduate
  study in molecular biology and was accepted by Professor Itaru
  Watanabe's laboratory at the Institute for Virus Research at the
  University of Kyoto, one of a few laboratories in Japan where
  U.S.-trained molecular biologists were actively engaged in
  research. However, only two months after I started my work in his
  laboratory, Professor Watanabe called me into his office and
  suggested that I carry out my graduate study in the United
  States. He explained how inadequate the graduate training
  programs in molecular biology laboratories were in Japan,
  including his own, and offered to help in my application to some
  major universities in the United States, if I would seriously
  consider studying abroad.<br>
  <br>
  At that time, it was a common career development for a Japanese
  molecular biologist to go to the United States for a few years of
  postdoctoral study after obtaining the Ph.D. in Japan. I already
  had a vague wish to follow that pattern. Professor Watanabe's
  advice to enroll in an American graduate school therefore came to
  me as a bit of a surprise, but I was excited by the idea and
  accepted his help immediately. I cannot thank Professor Watanabe
  enough for this critical suggestion in the early phase of my
  scientific career.<br>
  <br>
  With the additional help of Dr. Takashi Yura, then an assistant
  professor in Watanabe's laboratory, I was admitted to the
  graduate school of the Department of Biology of the University of
  California at San Diego that had recently been established by
  Professor David Bonner in La Jolla, the beautiful southern
  Californian town near the Mexican border.<br>
  <br>
  At UCSD I studied in the laboratory of Professor Masaki Hayashi,
  carrying out a thesis project on the transcriptional control of
  phage lambda and received my Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1968.
  I remained in Professor Hayashi's laboratory as a postdoctoral
  fellow working on the morphogenesis of a phage, &Oslash;X174, until
  early 1969. Then I moved, also as a postdoctoral fellow, across
  the street to the laboratory of Dr. <a href=
  "../1975/index.html">Renato Dulbecco</a> at the Salk
  Institute.<br>
  <br>
  Like many others, I believed that the golden age of prokaryotic
  molecular biology was coming to an end and that the great
  excitement would be in higher organisms. However, the complexity
  of high organisms was baffling and the necessary tools seemed
  hopelessly insufficient. Small tumor viruses like polyoma and
  simian virus 40, the biological material primarily dealt with in
  Dulbecco's laboratory, seemed to offer a bridge for the gap
  between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Indeed Dulbecco's laboratory
  was filled with first-class postdoctoral fellows from around the
  world, who were trained in prokaryotic molecular biology and who
  came there intending to expand their research into eukaryotic
  molecular biology.<br>
  <br>
  My project was to define the transcripts of SV40 during lytic
  infection and in transformed cells. Since this was the
  pre-restriction enzyme and pre-recombinant DNA age, the
  information I could obtain was very limited. However, being a
  member of the best laboratory in the field I glimpsed the
  excitement of the cutting edge of scientific research.
  Furthermore, I very much enjoyed the free and stimulating
  atmosphere of the laboratory. Unfortunately, as an awardee of a
  Fulbright travel grant, my U.S. visa was to expire by the end of
  1970 and I had to leave the country for at least two years before
  I was eligible for another U.S. visa.<br>
  <br>
  I had two or three job possibilities outside of the United
  States, but none were particularly interesting. In the autumn of
  1970, only a few months before my visa was to expire I received a
  letter from Renato Dulbecco who was travelling in Europe. Renato
  mentioned the newly established Basel Institute for Immunology in
  Basel, Switzerland, and suggested that the time might be ripe for
  a molecular biologist to tackle immunological problems. I had
  very little knowledge of immunology, but decided to take Dr.
  Dulbecco's advice and sent an application letter to the Director
  of the Institute, Professor <a href="../1984/index.html">Niels
  Kaj Jerne</a>, who offered me a two-year contract.<br>
  <br>
  In the winter of 1971, I thus found myself surrounded by
  immunologists in this small town located in the middle of Europe.
  I must admit that the first year in the Institute was not easy
  for me. I had a continuing interest in work on SV40, but I was
  also keenly aware that I would not be able to take much advantage
  of the circumstances if I isolated myself by pursuing that
  subject. I therefore decided to study immunology in the hope of
  finding an interesting project.<br>
  <br>
  An immunologist, Dr. Ita Askonas, and a geneticist, Charles
  Steinberg, were very helpful to me on my entering the new field.
  By the end of 1971, I was introduced to the great debate on the
  genetic origins of antibody diversity. I felt from the beginning
  that I could contribute to resolving this question by applying
  the recently invented techniques of molecular biology, namely,
  restriction enzymes and recombinant DNA. Initially I worked only
  with my skillful technicians, Monica Sh&ouml;ld and Rita
  Schuller, but was soon joined by Drs. Nobumichi Hozumi, Minoru
  Hirama, and Christine Brack. Later, as my research group
  expanded, I had the good fortune to work with many capable
  postdoctoral fellows and devoted technical assistants. In
  addition, Charles Steinberg was a very important collaborator and
  consultant, particularly in the initial phase of the
  research.<br>
  <br>
  Looking back, the research progressed with amazing speed from
  1974 to 1981, the year I left Basel. We all worked hard and had
  had a great deal of fun. Our work resolved the long held debate
  on the genetic origin of antibody diversity. It turned out that
  this diversity is generated by somatic recombination of the
  inherited gene segments and by somatic mutation. To our very good
  fortune, Director Niels Jerne was quick to understand the
  importance of our approach and became a staunch supporter of the
  research in its early phase.<br>
  <br>
  In the beginning of the 1980's I began to feel that the great
  mystery of antibody diversity had been solved, at least in its
  outlines. I thought that it might be good to change my
  environment to launch into a new project. I also recalled that I
  had initially come to Switzwerland with the intention of staying
  for two years and then returning to the United States.
  Fortunately, I received a few offers from the United States and
  decided in 1981 to take a professorship at the Center for Cancer
  Research at M.I.T. Professor <a href=
  "../1969/index.html">Salvador E. Luria</a>, Director of the
  Cancer Center, was extremely helpful, not only in bringing me to
  M.I.T., but also in providing me with a beautiful
  laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  The research projects on which I had decided concerned two major
  problems. One was to investigate the role of somatic
  rearrangement in the activation of the rearranged antibody gene,
  and the second was to extend the research in Basel to "the other
  half" of the immune system, namely, to the antigen receptor of T
  cells. Fortunately, we could contribute to the understanding of
  both problems by discovering a tissue-specific transcriptional
  enhancer in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and by
  identifying, cloning, and sequencing genes coding for the
  polypeptide subunits of the T cell receptor. A particularly
  intriguing development made during the latter study was the
  identification of a gene that led to the discovery of a new T
  cell receptor, gamma delta. While the function of the T cells
  bearing this receptor is currently unknown, data accumulated
  during the past year in our laboratory as well as many other
  laboratories suggest that these T cells may be involved in an
  entirely new aspect of immunity.<br>
  <br>
  When I look back on my scientific career to-date, I am amazed at
  my good fortune. At every major turn, I met scientists who were
  not only at the very top in their own fields, but who also gave
  me insightful advice and generous help. I am most grateful to
  Professors Itaru Watanabe, Renato Dulbecco, Niels Kaj Jerne,
  Charles Steinberg, and Salvadore Luria. I also wish to extend my
  unending gratitude to many colleagues and technical
  assistants.<br>
  <br>
  My parents were firm believers that education is the best asset
  that parents can give to their children. I am deeply grateful to
  them for their outstanding support of my study and professional
  career. I am extremely grateful to my wife, Mayumi, whom I
  married in September 1985 for her devotion, interest,
  encouragement and criticism. I also wish to express my sincere
  thanks to my first wife, Kyoko, for her limitless devotion during
  my days in La Jolla and Basel.<br>
