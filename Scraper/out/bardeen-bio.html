  <h1>John Bardeen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bardeen.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>John Bardeen</b> was born in
  Madison, Wisconsin, on May 23, 1908, son of Dr. Charles R.
  Bardeen, and Althea Harmer. Dr. Bardeen was Professor of Anatomy,
  and Dean of the Medical School of the University of Wisconsin
  at Madison. After the death of Althea, when John was about twelve
  years old, Dr. Bardeen married Ruth Hames, now Mrs. Kenelm
  McCauley, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br>
  <br>
  John Bardeen attended the University High School at Madison for
  several years, but graduated from Madison Central High School in
  1923. This was followed by a course in electrical engineering at
  the University of Wisconsin, in which much extra work was taken
  in mathematics and physics. After being out for a term while
  working in the engineering department of the Western Electric
  Company at Chicago, he graduated with a B.S. in Electrical
  Engineering in 1928. He continued on at Wisconsin as a graduate
  research assistant in electrical engineering for two years,
  working on mathematical problems in applied geophysics and on
  radiation from antennas. It was during this period that he got
  his first introduction to quantum theory from Professor J.H. Van
  Vleck.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Leo J. Peters, under whom the research in geophysics
  was done, took a position at the Gulf Research Laboratories in
  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Bardeen followed him there and
  worked during the next three years (1930-1933) on the development
  of methods for the interpretation of magnetic and gravitational
  surveys. This was a stimulating period in which geophysical
  methods were first being applied to prospecting for oil.<br>
  <br>
  Because he felt his interests were more in pure than in applied
  science, Bardeen resigned his position at Gulf in 1933 to take
  graduate work in mathematical physics at Princeton
  University. It was here under the leadership of Professor
  E.P. Wigner, that he first became interested in solid state
  physics. Before completing his thesis (on the theory of the work
  function of metals) he was offered a position as Junior Fellow of
  the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. He spent there the
  next three years, 1935-1938, working with <a href=
  "../1977/index.html">Professors Van Vleck</a> and Bridgman on
  problems in cohesion and electrical conduction in metals, and
  also did some work on level density of nuclei. The Ph.D. degree
  at Princeton was awarded in 1936.<br>
  <br>
  From 1938-1941, Bardeen was an Assistant Professor of Physics at
  the University of
  Minnesota and from 1941-1945 a civilian physicist at the
  Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Work done during
  the war was on influence fields of ships for application to
  underwater ordnance and mine-sweeping. After the war, in late
  1945, he joined the solid state research group at the Bell
  Telephone Laboratories, and remained there until 1951, when he
  was appointed Professor of Electrical Engineering and of Physics
  at the University of Illinois. Since 1959 he has also been
  a member of the Center for Advanced Study of the
  University.<br>
  <br>
  Main fields of research since 1945 have been electrical
  conduction in semiconductors and metals, surface properties of
  semiconductors, theory of superconductivity, and diffusion of
  atoms in solids. In 1957, Bardeen and two colleagues, <a href=
  "../1972/index.html">L.N. Cooper and J.R. Schrieffer</a>,
  proposed the first successful explanation of superconductivity.
  Much of his research effort since that time has been devoted to
  further extensions and applications of the theory.<br>
  <br>
  He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, has been (1954-1957) a
  member of its Council, and on the Editorial Board of <i>The
  Physical Review</i> and <i>Reviews of Modern Physics</i>. From
  1959-1962, he served as a member of the United States President's
  Science Advisory Committee.<br>
  <br>
  Bardeen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1954. Honours
  include the Stuart Ballentine Medal of the Franklin Institute,
  Philadelphia (1952) and the John Scott Medal of the City of
  Philadelphia (1955), both awarded jointly with Dr. W.H. Brattain,
  the Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society (1955) and
  D.Sc. (Hon.) from Union College and from the University of
  Wisconsin. He received the Fritz London Award for work in low
  temperature physics in 1962.<br>
  <br>
  Bardeen married Jane Maxwell in 1938. They have three children,
  James Maxwell, William Allen and Elizabeth Ann.</p>
