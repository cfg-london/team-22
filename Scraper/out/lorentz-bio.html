  <h1>Hendrik A. Lorentz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lorentz.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Hendrik
  Antoon Lorentz</b> was born at Arnhem, The Netherlands, on July
  18, 1853, as the son of nursery-owner Gerrit Frederik Lorentz and
  his wife <i>n&eacute;e</i> Geertruida van Ginkel. When he was four
  years old, his mother died, and in 1862 his father married
  Luberta Hupkes. In those days the grade school did not only have
  school hours in the morning and in the afternoon, but also in the
  evening, when teaching was more free (in a sense resembling the
  Dalton method). In this way, when in 1866 the first highschool
  (H.B.S.) at Arnhem was opened, Hendrik Lorentz, as a gifted
  pupil, was ready to be placed in the 3rd form. After the 5th form
  and a year of study of the classics, he entered the University of Leyden in 1870, obtained his B.Sc.
  degree in mathematics and physics in 1871, and returned to Arnhem
  in 1872 to become a night-school teacher, at the same time
  preparing for his doctoral thesis on the reflection and
  refraction of light. In 1875, at the early age of 22, he obtained
  his doctor's degree, and only three years later he was appointed
  to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at Leyden, newly created for
  him. In spite of many invitations to chairs abroad, he always
  remained faithful to his Alma Mater. From 1912 onward, when he
  accepted a double function at Haarlem as Curator of Teyler's
  Physical Cabinet and Secretary of the "Hollandsche Maatschappij
  der Wetenschappen" (Dutch Society of Sciences), he continued at
  Leyden as Extraordinary Professor, delivering his famous Monday
  morning lectures for the rest of his life. The far-seeing
  directors of Teyler's Foundation thus enabled his unique mind to
  be freed from routine academic obligations, permitting him to
  spread his wings still further in the highest secluded realms of
  science, which are attainable by so few.<br>
  <br>
  From the start of his scientific work, Lorentz took it as his
  task to extend James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electricity and of
  light. Already in his doctor's thesis, he treated the reflection
  and refraction phenomena of light from this standpoint which was
  then quite new. His fundamental work in the fields of optics and
  electricity has revolutionized contemporary conceptions of the
  nature of matter.<br>
  <br>
  In 1878, he published an essay on the relation between the
  velocity of light in a medium and the density and composition
  thereof. The resulting formula, proposed almost simultaneously by
  the Danish physicist Lorenz, has become known as the
  Lorenz-Lorentz formula.<br>
  <br>
  Lorentz also made fundamental contributions to the study of the
  phenomena of moving bodies. In an extensive treatise on the
  aberration of light and the problems arising in connection with
  it, he followed A.J. Fresnel's hypothesis of the existence of an
  immovable ether, which freely penetrates all bodies. This
  assumption formed the basis of a general theory of the electrical
  and optical phenomena of moving bodies.<br>
  <br>
  From Lorentz stems the conception of the electron; his view that
  his minute, electrically charged particle plays a <i>r&ocirc;le</i>  during electromagnetic phenomena in ponderable matter made it
  possible to apply the molecular theory to the theory of
  electricity, and to explain the behaviour of light waves passing
  through moving, transparent bodies.<br>
  <br>
  The so-called Lorentz transformation (1904) was based on the fact
  that electromagnetic forces between charges are subject to slight
  alterations due to their motion, resulting in a minute
  contraction in the size of moving bodies. It not only adequately
  explains the apparent absence of the relative motion of the Earth
  with respect to the ether, as indicated by the experiments of
  Michelson and Morley, but also paved the way for Einstein's
  special theory of relativity.<br>
  <br>
  It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical
  physicists as the world's leading spirit, who completed what was
  left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for
  the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the quantum
  theory.<br>
  <br>
  In 1919, he was appointed Chairman of the Committee whose task it
  was to study the movements of sea water which could be expected
  during and after the reclamation of the Zuyderzee in The
  Netherlands, one of the greatest works of all times in hydraulic
  engineering. His theoretical calculations, the result of eight
  years of pioneering work, have been confirmed in actual practice
  in the most striking manner, and have ever since been of
  permanent value to the science of hydraulics.<br>
  <br>
  An overwhelming number of honours and distinctions from all over
  the world were bestowed on Lorentz. International gatherings were
  presided over by him with exceptional skill, both on account of
  his amiable and judicious personality and his masterly command of
  languages. Until his death he was Chairman of all Solvay
  Congresses, and in 1923 he was elected to the membership of the
  "International Committee of Intellectual Cooperation" of the
  League of Nations. Of this Committee, consisting of only seven of
  the world's most eminent scholars, he became the President in
  1925.<br>
  <br>
  Through his great prestige in governmental circles in his own
  country, Lorentz was able to convince them of the importance of
  science for national production. He thus initiated the steps
  which finally led to the creation of the organisation now
  generally known under the initials T.N.O. (Dutch for Applied
  Scientific Research).<br>
  <br>
  Lorentz was a man of immense personal charm. The very picture of
  unselfishness, full of genuine interest in whoever had the
  privilege of crossing his path, he endeared himself both to the
  leaders of his age and to the ordinary citizen.<br>
  <br>
  In 1881 Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser, whose father,
  J.W. Kaiser, Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, was the
  Director of the Museum which later became the well-known
  Rijksmuseum (National Gallery) of Amsterdam, and the designer of
  the first postage stamps of The Netherlands. There were two
  daughters and one son from this marriage. The eldest daughter Dr.
  Geertruida Luberta Lorentz is a physicist in her own right and
  married Professor W.J. de Haas, Director of the Cryogenic
  Laboratory (Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory) of the University of
  Leyden.<br>
  <br>
  Lorentz died at Haarlem on February 4, 1928.</p>
