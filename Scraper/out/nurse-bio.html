  <h1>Sir Paul Nurse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="nurse.jpg" class="bio-img">My parents
  were born in Norfolk and spent their early years working in the
  big houses of that rural English county, my mother as a cook and
  my father as a handyman and chauffeur. After the 1930s recession
  they moved to Wembley, North-West London, where my father worked
  as a mechanic in the local H.J. Heinz food processing factory,
  and my mother brought up their four children and was a part-time
  cleaner. I was by far the youngest of the family, and at times it
  was like being an only child. My parents were neither wealthy nor
  academic, but we lived comfortably and they were always extremely
  supportive of my academic efforts and aspirations, both at school
  and university.</p>

  <p>My primary school was a considerable
  distance from where we lived and so I had long walks, often
  alone, to and from school. This walk took me through a park and
  some rough land where I could not fail to notice the animals,
  insects and plants there and how they changed during the seasons.
  During the winter my attention was attracted to the changes in
  the stars and planets in the sky. I think it was this curiosity
  about the natural world which awoke my early interest in science.
  Two incidents from this time that I remember, were, wondering why
  leaves were larger on plants growing in the shade compared with
  the same plants growing in sunlight, and watching Sputnik 2, the
  second ever artificial satellite and the first with a living
  cargo (a dog called Laika), as it sped across the skies of
  London. My life-long interest in astronomy started then and I
  still regularly use a telescope for astronomical observations,
  although very much as an amateur.</p>

  <p>I enjoyed my time at primary school because
  my teachers made the world seem such an interesting place and
  encouraged my innate curiosity. At age 11 in 1960, I moved to an
  academic state secondary school, Harrow County Grammar School for
  Boys. This was a mixed experience for me. It was a good,
  well-resourced school, but was very exam oriented and most of the
  other boys came from wealthier and more academic families which
  sometimes made me feel like a fish out of water. I was never very
  good at exams, having a poor memory and finding the examination
  process rather artificial, and there never seemed to be enough
  time to follow up things that really interested me. But there
  were good things about the school. I had an excellent Biology
  teacher, Keith Neal, who encouraged his pupils to study natural
  history and to do real experiments. I had a great time
  investigating the pigments of different mutant fruit flies by
  following experimental protocols published in Scientific
  American, and I also remember making my own beetle collection
  when it was still acceptable to make such collections. There were
  also good extra-curricular activities, particularly hill and
  mountain walking and more surprisingly, learning to fly. I am
  still a keen mountain walker and an enthusiastic glider pilot. I
  also made some very good friends who remained important to me
  into adulthood. It was during my time at secondary school that I
  abandoned religion. My mother was a Baptist, and as a young
  teenager I was also a committed believer. But I had real
  difficulties reconciling a literal belief in Genesis with
  evolution, and my attempts to accommodate the biblical account of
  creation by viewing it as a poetic metaphor suitable for an
  unsophisticated nomadic people was completely rejected by my
  church. I gradually slipped away from religion over several years
  and became an atheist or to be more philosophically correct, a
  sceptical agnostic.</p>

  <p>By the end of my time at school I had
  achieved examination grades which allowed me to go to University,
  but did not have a basic foreign language qualification which was
  compulsory for all University entrants. This meant that when I
  left school I had to work as a technician in a microbiological
  laboratory associated with the local Guinness brewery. This was a
  great experience for me because I had a very sympathetic lab head
  Vic Knivett, who rapidly realised that I could complete the
  routine requirements of my job in a couple of days each week, and
  encouraged me to carry out research experiments for the rest of
  my time. Unfortunately I continued to fail my French Exam and it
  was only the intervention of Professor Jinks at Birmingham that
  got me into a University. He had noticed my application for entry
  and asked me to visit his Genetics Department. After an extensive
  interview he arranged for my weaknesses in foreign languages to
  be over-looked and so I started a Biology degree at Birmingham in
  1967.</p>

  <p>My time as an undergraduate at Birmingham
  was extremely stimulating both as a biologist and also for my
  more general intellectual development. It was the heady times of
  the sixties when everything could be challenged and everything
  seemed possible. I met my wife Anne who was a sociology student,
  and her influence together with activities associated with the
  student movement of the time opened up my interests amongst other
  things into the theatre, art, music, politics and philosophy. For
  the first time I fully recognised the excitement of intellectual
  endeavour and realised that this was what I wanted to do with my
  life.</p>

  <p>The lecturers on my courses were generally
  enthusiastic about their subjects and encouraged my interest in
  the biological world. At first my inclinations turned towards the
  subject of ecology with its then new theoretical models of
  ecological systems, but a field course collecting marine
  specimens in freezing cold weather taught me that I was too soft
  for practical ecology, and I realised that I had a preference for
  the more controlled and warmer environment of the laboratory.
  Gradually my interests settled on developmental biology with an
  emphasis on plants and a molecular approach to the problem. I had
  an eccentric zoology tutor Jack Cohen who was hugely stimulating
  and entertaining, and although frequently wrong was always wrong
  in an interesting way. He taught me the value of the alternative
  view and also was the first to introduce me to the cell cycle
  with a project on the respiration rate of dividing fish eggs, a
  project which ended in complete disaster. This time at Birmingham
  turned me into a general biologist, and ever since then I have
  always tried to take a biological approach to any research
  project that I have undertaken.</p>

  <p>A key issue in developmental biology at
  that time was the problem of how cells underwent differentiation,
  with most workers concentrating on explanations in terms of
  changes in enzyme and gene regulation. To me the cell cycle
  seemed to be a good and simple model for such problems, because
  the cell underwent molecular changes as it proceeded through its
  cell cycle. So when my thoughts turned towards a PhD I looked for
  a laboratory where I could study molecular changes during the
  cell cycle. Tony Sims at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norfolk
  was just beginning such studies by looking at the enzymes of
  amino acid metabolism during the cell cycle of the fungus
  <i>Candida utilis</i>. I went to his lab as a graduate student
  because I was joining a project at its inception and thought that
  I would be able to make a more important contribution to the
  work. Tony was a great experimentalist and I rapidly learnt the
  need for good experiments to make any progress at all in a
  research project. Like many students, I found the drudgery of
  real experiments and the slowness of progress a complete shock,
  and at my low points I contemplated other alternative careers
  including study of the philosophy or sociology of science.
  However, the atmosphere at UEA was very supportive and my
  colleagues made me feel I was making a useful contribution so I
  survived the difficulties of carrying out real research. In fact
  I am very much an experimentalist and an empiricist, so it would
  have been a major mistake for me to have abandoned this type of
  work. But this experience did teach me the need for sympathetic
  support of scientific colleagues, because at the forefront of
  research there are so many difficulties that depression and low
  motivation are a constant danger.</p>

  <p>The next step was what to do as a
  post-doctoral worker and this question exercised me greatly in my
  final year as a graduate student. I felt strongly that since the
  pursuit of good science was so difficult it was essential that
  the problem being studied was an important one to justify the
  effort expanded. Rather grandly I argued to myself that the
  process of reproduction was a central property of life, and that
  this was seen in its simplest form with the reproduction of
  cells. Therefore, I reasoned that study of the cell cycle
  responsible for the reproduction of cells was important and might
  even be illuminating about the nature of life. In particular the
  control of these processes would be crucial, just like control of
  flux through a pathway was important for amino acid metabolism.
  But how could such processes be investigated given so little was
  known about them? The answer came to me in 1972 when I read two
  papers from Lee Hartwell who showed how genetics could be used to
  study the budding yeast cell cycle. I thought this was a
  beautiful approach to the problem, one I wanted to use as well.
  The difficulty was that Anne was by now a teacher and neither of
  us wanted to move to the USA, and so I needed to find a UK
  laboratory for this work. Murdoch Mitchison in Edinburgh was the
  UK authority on the cell cycle and worked on fission yeast but he
  was not a geneticist. I. went to Edinburgh on a wonderful blue
  day with the city under snow to discuss my aspirations, and was
  immediately attracted both to Murdoch's laboratory and to this
  beautiful city. He suggested that I spent a couple of months in
  Bern Switzerland with Urs Leupold, the father of fission yeast
  genetics, so that I could gain experience that would allow me to
  begin a genetic analysis of the fission yeast cell cycle. Urs was
  a careful but inspirational teacher and within six months I was
  able to introduce genetics into Murdoch's cell cycle
  laboratory.</p>

  <p>My 6 years with Murdoch were pivotal for my
  entire research career. He gave me both complete support and
  total freedom, spending hours each week talking with me but never
  instructing me what to do. An astonishingly generous supervisor,
  he never once was a co-author on any of the papers I produced
  during my time in Edinburgh. He considered, quite wrongly of
  course, that he had not made a sufficient contribution to justify
  inclusion! His laboratory was an exciting environment where I had
  many interesting colleagues. During my first year, two new
  recruits came, Peter Fantes as a postdoc and Kim Nasmyth as a
  graduate student. Peter was of a mathematical and theoretical
  bent and it was through discussions and joint work with him that
  the importance of cell mass in regulating progression through the
  fission yeast cell cycle first became clear to me. Murdoch asked
  me to look after Kim who was extra-ordinarily bright, and he
  extended the cell cycle mutant collections during his thesis
  work. My main efforts focussed on trying to identify the rate
  controlling steps during the cell cycle. Crucial for this
  analysis were wee mutants that were advanced prematurely through
  the cell cycle and so divided at a reduced cell size. I would
  like to claim that I reasoned abstractly that such mutants would
  be useful and then tried to find them, but in reality I noticed
  them only by accident whilst searching for completely different
  mutants. As is often the case it was nature that provided the
  best lead to be followed. A third new recruit was a friend of
  mine from Bern, Pierre Thuriaux who worked with me on showing
  that <i>cdc2</i> was a rate limiting factor controlling the onset
  of mitosis. A second key advance was showing that <i>cdc2</i> was
  also required for the onset of S-phase. This emerged from work
  with Yvonne Bissett while we were trying to identify a G1 control
  start similar to the one de- fined by Lee Hartwell in budding
  yeast. As a negative control for this experiment we used
  <i>cdc2</i> mutants which we thought would block cell cycle
  progression in G2. In fact the results we obtained were ambiguous
  with the negative controls always giving a small but significant
  positive response. For some time we thought the experiment flawed
  and then in desperation hypothesised that <i>cdc2</i> was
  required twice in the cell cycle explaining the mixed results.
  This turned out to be correct establishing that <i>cdc2</i> was a
  controlling factor for the onset of both S-phase and mitosis.</p>

  <p>It was now 1980 and Anne and myself had two
  little children Sarah and Emily, and we were wondering whether to
  stay permanently in Edinburgh. This possibility bothered me as I
  thought it was not advisable to remain in one academic
  environment, and the long dark winters in Edinburgh could be
  rather dismal. I also thought that the next stage in cell cycle
  analysis required molecular genetics, and fission yeast was not
  developed for these types of experiments, and so I looked for an
  environment which would make this possible. In the end I decided
  that the University of Sussex in Brighton was a good place
  for this work because it had a strong tradition in bacterial
  molecular genetics and an excellent reputation in biology. It was
  also almost as far south as it was possible to go in the UK and
  so had a reasonable chance of having decent summers! I set up my
  first laboratory there with a technician and myself and began
  working on fission yeast molecular genetic manipulation. In this
  project I had great assistance from an excellent post-doc from
  the next door lab, David Beach, who was already skilled in DNA
  cloning procedures. There followed a very fruitful collaboration
  that led to the cloning of the more important cell cycle genes.
  This allowed me to recruit more workers, in particular my first
  graduate student Jacky Hayles, who went on to contribute
  immeasurably to many subsequent projects in my laboratory and
  still is a stimulating and imaginative colleague with me today.
  Another very important recruit was Paul Russell who cloned the
  more important regulators of <i>cdc2</i>.</p>

  <p>This progress in the molecular analysis of
  the cell cycle led to more interest being taken in my work and as
  a consequence to greater competition. My job was not secure in
  Sussex as I only had a time limited position and the financial
  support for my lab was limited. I had failed to secure a
  permanent appointment at Sussex or the major MRC research
  institutes in Cambridge and London, and was on the verge of
  moving to the EMBL in Heidelberg where the Director Lennart
  Philipson had offered me a post. However, we wanted to stay in
  the UK and just in time Walter Bodmer, Scientific Director of the
  Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) offered me a permanent lab
  head position at his main laboratories in Lincoln's Inn Fields
  and I moved there in 1984. For the first time I found myself in a
  very well funded laboratory and a hot-house scientific
  environment. There were pros and cons to this; the financial
  support meant we could do any experiment we wished but there was
  not the same collegiate support that I was used to in the
  Universities. Perhaps, not unreasonably, some wondered what a
  yeast researcher was doing in a cancer research institute.
  Despite this I was now able to set up an effective laboratory
  which could take on many of the problems that I could not have
  addressed before. Lincoln's Inn was a wonderful scientific
  institute with nearly every molecular biology procedure being
  carried out by someone within its walls. I quickly built up a
  laboratory of excellent post-docs who brought in expertise that I
  did not have, expertise which was essential for a proper
  molecular analysis of the cell cycle control genes. These
  included Viesturs Simanis, Sergio Moreno and Kathy Gould, who
  between them worked out that <i>cdc2</i> encoded a protein kinase
  that was regulated during the cell cycle and was controlled by
  tyrosine phosphorylation. Another post-doc Melanie Lee cloned the
  human <i>CDC2</i> gene by rescue of a fission yeast <i>cdc2</i>
  mutant, and so established that the cell cycle in humans was
  likely to be regulated in the same way as yeasts. This was a
  major step forward, all the more so because she persevered with a
  project that many argued was highly unlikely to succeed.</p>

  <p>At the end of the 1980s as a complete
  surprise my old Edinburgh friend, Ed Southern offered me the
  Chair of Microbiology at the University of Oxford. It was a difficult
  decision to move to Oxford as things were going so well at
  Lincoln's Inn, but when my daughters realised that they would be
  able to ride ponies almost daily the debate was over and we moved
  to Oxford in 1988. I had a lot more space and my lab grew in size
  probably beyond a level that I could properly supervise. Many of
  my lab colleagues moved with me to Oxford and others including
  Chris Norbury, Iain Hagan and Tamar Enoch joined me there. During
  this time the links of <i>cdc2</i> with cyclins and maturation
  promoting factor (MPF) were established, as well as its
  involvement with checkpoint controls. My administrative work load
  increased dramatically as the head of a University Department and
  also as President of the UK Genetical Society. This together with
  being the supervisor of a large laboratory meant that I failed to
  take sufficient advantage of the broader academic environment
  that a University has to offer. I had hoped to recreate my times
  at Sussex and Edinburgh but this was not to be. However, I did
  learn how to manage things and how to deal with finances which
  led to me being approached about returning to London as
  Scientific Director to ICRF. The temptation of the properly
  founded laboratory was too great to resist and I returned to
  Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1993.</p>

  <p>This return to ICRF made me a colleague of
  Tim Hunt with whom I had had close contacts for the previous
  decade although we had never worked together. He was and is a
  most delightful companion and our very different backgrounds
  meant that our conversations, for me at least, were always
  stimulating and productive. We had the closeness and mutual
  respect which meant we could utterly disagree without the
  slightest risk of the other becoming upset. As a biochemist he
  was more grounded in reality, whilst as a geneticist I was more
  abstract in my thought. This meant I tended to lose contact with
  what was really possible within the constraints of the Laws of
  Thermodynamics as Tim was always ready to point out to me. We
  were also both natural performers on the lecture stage and not
  infrequently we entertained as a double act at conferences. There
  were many other scientists on the world stage that had great
  influence on the cell cycle field during the crucial times of the
  1980s to the early 1990s. Important for me were those working on
  frog and marine invertebrate egg cell cycles, work started by
  Yoshio Masui. Marc Kirschner provided immense clarity to this
  sometimes murky field, whilst Jim Maller successfully achieved
  the very important task of purifying maturation promoting factor
  or MPF. My lab collaborated with the French Scientist Marcel
  Dor&eacute;e who not only brought well needed biochemistry to my
  work but great gaiety as well. Closer to my own experimental
  system were the yeast geneticists, in particular Mitsuhiro
  Yanagida, a towering powerhouse of rigorous experimental
  activity, and Andrew Murray, a worker of great imaginative
  ability. My interactions with these and many others greatly
  shaped and corrected my thinking about the cell cycle and its
  control.</p>

  <p>The 1990s saw my children grow up and in
  their early 20s they left home. Sarah is an assistant producer
  for a major TV soccer programme in the UK, whilst Emily has just
  started a PhD in theoretical particle physics. My heavy
  responsibilities as Director General of ICRF have taken their
  toll on my experimental work. It is a constant worry to me that I
  have not supervised my graduate students and post-docs properly
  during this time. It has only been their excellent quality which
  has kept the work going reasonably well. Their main focus has
  been elucidating the controls regulating the onset of S-phase and
  ensuring that there is only one S-phase each cell cycle, a new
  set of projects dealing with the controls during the meiotic cell
  cycle, and genomic analysis of fission yeast. These problems all
  interest me and hopefully in the not too distant future I will be
  able to devote more of my time to their study. Two other projects
  are also being pursued. The first is a Science in Society
  Initiative of the Royal Society which I chair and has as its
  objective an improvement in dialogue between scientists and the
  public. Its agenda bears an uncanny similarity to that discussed
  in the late 1960s during student occupations at the University of
  Birmingham. The second is the merger of the ICRF with the CRC to
  generate a single organisation Cancer
  Research UK, which will form the largest cancer research
  organisation in the world outside of the USA.</p>

  <p>The award of this prize is a water-shed in
  my life, forcing me to look back over my past and to consider
  what I should do for the next 15-20 years. I have an idealistic
  view of science as a liberalising and progressive force for
  humanity. Better understanding of the natural world not only
  enhances all of us as human beings, but can also be harnessed for
  the better good, leading to improved health and quality of life.
  It is also a truly international activity which breaks down
  barriers between the peoples of world, an objective that always
  has been necessary and never more so than now. Scientific
  understanding is often beautiful, a profoundly aesthetic
  experience which gives pleasure not unlike the reading of a great
  poem. It has been a privilege to pursue knowledge for its own
  sake and to see how it might help mankind in more practical ways.
  I hope that the future will allow me to continue that pursuit for
  as long as I am able.</p>
