  <h2>Remember Your Humanity</h2>

  <p>At this momentous event in my life - the
  acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize - I want to speak as a
  scientist, but also as a human being. From my earliest days I had
  a passion for science. But science, the exercise of the supreme
  power of the human intellect, was always linked in my mind with
  benefit to people. I saw science as being in harmony with
  humanity. I did not imagine that the second half of my life would
  be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created
  by science.</p>

  <p>The practical release of nuclear energy was
  the outcome of many years of experimental and theoretical
  research. It had great potential for the common good. But the
  first the general public learned about the discovery was the news
  of the destruction of Hiroshima by the atom bomb. A splendid
  achievement of science and technology had turned malign. Science
  became identified with death and destruction.</p>

  <p>It is painful to me to admit that this
  depiction of science was deserved. The decision to use the atom
  bomb on Japanese cities, and the consequent buildup of enormous
  nuclear arsenals, was made by governments, on the basis of
  political and military perceptions. But scientists on both sides
  of the iron curtain played a very significant role in maintaining
  the momentum of the nuclear arms race throughout the four decades
  of the Cold War.</p>

  <p>The role of scientists in the nuclear arms
  race was expressed bluntly by Lord Zuckerman, for many years
  Chief Scientific Adviser to the British Government:<a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>When it comes to nuclear weapons ...
    it is the man in the laboratory who at the start proposes that
    for this or that arcane reason it would be useful to improve an
    old or to devise a new nuclear warhead. It is he, the
    technician, not the commander in the field, who is at the heart
    of the arms race.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Long before the terrifying potential of the
  arms race was recognized, there was a widespread instinctive
  abhorrence of nuclear weapons, and a strong desire to get rid of
  them. Indeed, the very first resolution of the General Assembly
  of the United Nations - adopted unanimously - called for the
  elimination of nuclear weapons. But the world was then polarized
  by the bitter ideological struggle between East and West. There
  was no chance to meet this call. The chief task was to stop the
  arms race before it brought utter disaster. However, after the
  collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union,
  any rationale for having nuclear weapons disappeared. The quest
  for their total elimination could be resumed. But the nuclear
  powers still cling tenaciously to their weapons.</p>

  <p>Let me remind you that nuclear disarmament
  is not just an ardent desire of the people, as expressed in many
  resolutions of the United Nations. It is a legal commitment by
  the five official nuclear states, entered into when they signed
  the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Only a few months ago, when the
  indefinite extension of the Treaty was agreed, the nuclear powers
  committed themselves again to complete nuclear disarmament. This
  is still their declared goal. But the declarations are not
  matched by their policies, and this divergence seems to be
  intrinsic.</p>

  <p>Since the end of the Cold War two main
  nuclear powers have begun to make big reductions in their nuclear
  arsenals. Each of them is dismantling about 2,000 nuclear
  warheads a year. If this program continued, all nuclear warheads
  could be dismantled in little over ten years from now. We have
  the technical means to create a nuclear-weapon-free world in
  about a decade. Alas, the present program does not provide for
  this. When the START 2 treaty has been implemented - and remember
  it has not yet been ratified - we will be left with some 15,000
  nuclear warheads, active and in reserve. Fifteen thousand weapons
  with an average yield of 20 Hiroshima bombs.</p>

  <p>Unless there is a change in the basic
  philosophy, we will not see a reduction of nuclear arsenals to
  zero for a very long time, if ever. The present basic philosophy
  is nuclear deterrence. This was stated clearly in the US Nuclear
  Posture Review which concluded: <i>"Post-Cold War environment
  requires nuclear deterrence,"</i><a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> and this is echoed by other nuclear
  states. Nuclear weapons are kept as a hedge against some
  unspecified dangers.</p>

  <p>This policy is simply an inertial
  continuation from the Cold War era. The Cold War is over but Cold
  War thinking survives. Then, we were told that a world war was
  prevented by the existence of nuclear weapons. Now, we are told
  that nuclear weapons prevent all kinds of war. These are
  arguments that purport to prove a negative. I am reminded of a
  story told in my boyhood at the time when radio communication
  began.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Two wise men were arguing about the
    ancient civilization in their respective countries. One said:
    'my country has a long history of technological development: we
    have carried out deep excavations and found a wire, which shows
    that already in the old days we had the telegraph'. The other
    man retorted: 'we too made excavations; we dug much deeper than
    you and found &#8230; nothing, which proves that already in
    those days we had wireless communication'!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is no direct evidence that nuclear
  weapons prevented a world war. Conversely, it is known that they
  nearly caused one. The most terrifying moment in my life was
  October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I did not know all
  the facts - we have learned only recently how close we were to
  war - but I knew enough to make me tremble. The lives of millions
  of people were about to end abruptly; millions of others were to
  suffer a lingering death; much of our civilization was to be
  destroyed. It all hung on the decision of one man, Nikita
  Khrushchev: would he or would he not yield to the U.S.
  ultimatum?<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is the
  reality of nuclear weapons: they may trigger a world war; a war
  which, unlike previous ones, destroys all of civilization.</p>

  <p>As for the assertion that nuclear weapons
  prevent wars, how many more wars are needed to refute this
  arguments? Tens of millions have died in the many wars that have
  taken place since 1945. In a number of them nuclear states were
  directly involved. In two they were actually defeated. Having
  nuclear weapons was of no use to them.</p>

  <p>To sum up, there is no evidence that a
  world without nuclear weapons would be a dangerous world. On the
  contrary, it would be a safer world, as I will show later.</p>

  <p>We are told that the possession of nuclear
  weapons - in some cases even the testing of these weapons - is
  essential for national security. But this argument can be made by
  other countries as well. If the militarily most powerful - and
  least threatened - states need nuclear weapons for their
  security, how can one deny such security to countries that are
  truly insecure? The present nuclear policy is a recipe for
  proliferation. It is a policy for disaster.</p>

  <p>To prevent this disaster - for the sake of
  humanity - we must get rid of all nuclear weapons.</p>

  <p>Achieving this goal will take time, but it
  will never happen unless we make a start. Some essential steps
  towards it can be taken now. Several studies, and a number of
  public statements by senior military and political personalities,
  testify that - except for disputes between the present nuclear
  states - all military conflicts, as well as threats to peace, can
  be dealt with using conventional weapons. This means that the
  only function of nuclear weapons, while they exist, is to deter a
  nuclear attack. All nuclear weapon states should now recognize
  that this is so, and declare - in Treaty form - that they will
  never be the first to use nuclear weapons. This would open the
  way to the gradual, mutual reduction of nuclear arsenals, down to
  zero. It would also open the way for a Nuclear Weapons
  Convention. This would be universal - it would prohibit all
  possession of nuclear weapons.</p>

  <p>We will need to work out the necessary
  verification system to safeguard the Convention. A Pugwash study
  produced suggestions on these matters.<a href=
  "#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> The mechanisms for negotiating such
  a Convention already exists. Entering into negotiations does not
  commit the parties. There is no reason why they should not begin
  now. If not now, when?</p>

  <p>So I ask the nuclear powers to abandon the
  out-of-date thinking of the Cold War period and take a fresh
  look. Above all, I appeal to them to bear in mind the long-term
  threat that nuclear weapons pose to humankind and to begin action
  towards their elimination. Remember your duty to humanity.</p>

  <p>My second appeal is to my fellow
  scientists. I described earlier the disgraceful role played by a
  few scientists, caricatured as 'Dr Strangeloves,'<a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> in fueling the arms race. They did
  great damage to the image of science.</p>

  <p>On the other side there are the scientists,
  in Pugwash and other bodies, who devote much of their time and
  ingenuity to averting the dangers created by advances in science
  and technology. However, they embrace only a small part of the
  scientific community. I want to address the scientific community
  as a whole.</p>

  <p>You are doing fundamental work, pushing
  forward the frontiers of knowledge, but often you do it without
  giving much thought to the impact of your work on society.
  Precepts such as 'science is neutral' or 'science has nothing to
  do with politics,' still prevail. They are remnants of the ivory
  tower mentality, although the ivory tower was finally demolished
  by the Hiroshima bomb.</p>

  <p>Here, for instance, is a question: Should
  any scientist work on the development of weapons of mass
  destruction? A clear "no" was the answer recently given by
  <a href="/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Hans Bethe</a>.
  Professor Bethe, a Nobel laureate, is the most senior of the
  surviving members of the Manhattan Project.<a href=
  "#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> On the occasion of the 50th
  Anniversary of Hiroshima, he issued a statement that I will quote
  in full.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>As the Director of the Theoretical
    Division at Los Alamos, I participated at the most senior level
    in the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the first
    atomic weapons.<br>
    <br>
    Now, at age 88, I am one of the few remaining such senior
    persons alive. Looking back at the half century since that
    time, I feel the most intense relief that these weapons have
    not been used since World War II, mixed with the horror that
    tens of thousands of such weapons have been built since that
    time - one hundred times more than any of us at Los Alamos
    could ever had imagined.<br>
    <br>
    Today we are rightly in an era of disarmament and dismantlement
    of nuclear weapons. But in some countries nuclear weapons
    development still continues. Whether and when the various
    Nations of the World can agree to stop this is uncertain. But
    individual scientists can still influence this process by
    withholding their skills.<br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, I call on all scientists in all countries to cease
    and desist from work creating, developing, improving and
    manufacturing further nuclear weapons - and, for that matter,
    other weapons of potential mass destruction such as chemical
    and biological weapons.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If all scientists heeded this call there
  would be no more new nuclear warheads; no French scientists at
  Mururoa:<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> no new chemical and
  biological poisons. The arms race would be truly over.</p>

  <p>But there are other areas of scientific
  research that may directly or indirectly lead to harm to society.
  This calls for constant vigilance. The purpose of some government
  or industrial research is sometimes concealed, and misleading
  information is presented to the public. It should be the duty of
  scientists to expose such malfeasance. "Whistle-blowing" should
  become part of the scientist's ethos. This may bring reprisals; a
  price to be paid for one's convictions. The price may be very
  heavy, as illustrated by the disproportionately severe punishment
  of Mordechai Vanunu.<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> I
  believe he has suffered enough.</p>

  <p>The time has come to formulate guidelines
  for the ethical conduct of scientist, perhaps in the form of a
  voluntary Hippocratic Oath. This would be particularly valuable
  for young scientists when they embark on a scientific career. The
  US Student Pugwash Group has taken up this idea - and that is
  very heartening.</p>

  <p>At a time when science plays such a
  powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the
  whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research,
  it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that
  role, and conduct themselves accordingly. I appeal to my fellow
  scientists to remember their responsibility to humanity.</p>

  <p>My third appeal is to my fellow citizens in
  all countries: Help us to establish lasting peace in the
  world.</p>

  <p>I have to bring to your notice a terrifying
  reality: with the development of nuclear weapons Man has
  acquired, for the first time in history, the technical means to
  destroy the whole of civilization in a single act. Indeed, the
  whole human species is endangered, by nuclear weapons or by other
  means of wholesale destruction which further advances in science
  are likely to produce.</p>

  <p>I have argued that we must eliminate
  nuclear weapons. While this would remove the immediate threat, it
  will not provide permanent security. Nuclear weapons cannot be
  disinvented. The knowledge of how to make them cannot be erased.
  Even in a nuclear-weapon-free world, should any of the great
  powers become involved in a military confrontation, they would be
  tempted to rebuild their nuclear arsenals. That would still be a
  better situation than the one we have now, because the rebuilding
  would take a considerable time, and in that time the dispute
  might be settled. A nuclear-weapon-free world would be safer than
  the present one. But the danger of the ultimate catastrophe would
  still be there.</p>

  <p>The only way to prevent it is to abolish
  war altogether. War must cease to be an admissible social
  institution. We must learn to resolve our disputes by means other
  than military confrontation.</p>

  <p>This need was recognized forty years ago
  when we said in the Russell- Einstein Manifesto:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Here then is the problem which we
    present to you, stark and dreadful, and inescapable: shall we
    put an end to the human race: or shall mankind renounce
    war?</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The abolition of war is also the commitment
  of the nuclear weapon states: Article VI of the NPT calls for a
  treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and
  effective international control.</p>

  <p>Any international treaty entails some
  surrender of national sovereignty, and is generally unpopular. As
  we said in the Russell-Einstein Manifesto: <i>"The abolition of
  war will demand distasteful limitations of national
  sovereignty."</i> Whatever system of governance is eventually
  adopted, it is important that it carries the people with it. We
  need to convey the message that safeguarding our common property,
  humankind, will require developing in each of us a new loyalty: a
  loyalty to mankind. It calls for the nurturing of a feeling of
  belonging to the human race. We have to become world
  citizens.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the fragmentation that has
  occurred since the end of the Cold War, and the many wars for
  recognition of national or ethnic identities, I believe that the
  prospects for the acceptance of this new loyalty are now better
  than at the time of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto. This is so
  largely because of the enormous progress made by science and
  technology during these 40 years. The fantastic advances in
  communication and transportation have shrunk our globe. All
  nations of the world have become close neighbors. Modern
  information techniques enable us to learn instantly about every
  event in every part of the globe. We can talk to each other via
  the various networks. This facility will improve enormously with
  time, because the achievements so far have only scratched the
  surface. Technology is driving us together. In many ways we are
  becoming like one family.</p>

  <p>In advocating the new loyalty to mankind I
  am not suggesting that we give up national loyalties. Each of us
  has loyalties to several groups - from the smallest, the family,
  to the largest, at present, the nation. Many of these groups
  provide protection for their members. With the global threats
  resulting from science and technology, the whole of humankind now
  needs protection. We have to extend our loyalty to the whole of
  the human race.</p>

  <p>What we are advocating in Pugwash, a
  war-free world, will be seen by many as a Utopian dream. It is
  not Utopian. There already exist in the world large regions, for
  example, the European Union, within which war is inconceivable.
  What is needed is to extend these to cover the world's major
  powers.</p>

  <p>In any case, we have no choice. The
  alternative is unacceptable. Let me quote the last passage of the
  Russell-Einstein Manifesto:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>We appeal, as human beings, to human
    beings: Remember your humanity and forget the rest. If you can
    do so, the way lies open for a new paradise; if you cannot,
    there lies before you the risk of universal death.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The quest for a war-free world has a basic
  purpose: survival. But if in the process we learn how to achieve
  it by love rather than by fear, by kindness rather than by
  compulsion; if in the process we learn to combine the essential
  with the enjoyable, the expedient with the benevolent, the
  practical with the beautiful, this will be an extra incentive to
  embark on this great task.</p>

  <p>Above all, remember your humanity.</p>

  More recently, in the Pugwash Newsletter of October 1998 Rotblat

  1962 the Soviet Union moved to install nuclear missiles in Cuba
  in order to deter any attack on Cuba by the United States. The
  United States demanded that the missiles be withdrawn, and both
