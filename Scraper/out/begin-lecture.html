  <h1>Menachem Begin - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <p class="smalltext">Nobel Lecture, December 10, 1978</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your
  Excellencies, Madame Chairlady and Members of the Nobel Prize
  Committee, Mr Marei, representative of the President of Egypt,
  Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

  <p>I ask for permission first to pay tribute
  to Golda Meir, my predecessor, a great leader and Prime Minister,
  who strove with all her heart to achieve peace between Israel and
  her neighbors. Her blessed memory will live forever in the hearts
  of the Jewish people and of all peace-loving nations.</p>

  <p>I have come from the Land of Israel, the
  land of Zion and Jerusalem, and here I stand in humility and with
  pride as a son of the Jewish people, as one of the generation of
  the Holocaust and Redemption.</p>

  <p>The ancient Jewish people gave the world
  the vision of eternal peace, of universal disarmament, of
  abolishing the teaching and learning of war. Two Prophets,
  Yeshayahu Ben Amotz and Micha HaMorashti, having foreseen the
  spiritual unity of man under God - with His word coming forth
  from Jerusalem - gave the nations of the world the following
  vision expressed in identical terms:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"And they shall beat their swords into
    ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall
    not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war
    any more".<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We mortals who believe in Divine
  Providence, when recalling those sacred prophecies, ask ourselves
  not whether, but when is this vision going to become reality? We
  remember the past; even in this century alone - and we know. We
  look around - and see. Millions of men of all nations are under
  arms. Intercontinental missiles deposited in the bowels of the
  earth or lying on the beds of oceans can destroy man and
  everything he has built. Not in Alfred Nobel's time, but in our
  own era, has mankind become capable of destroying itself and
  returning the earth to <i>Tohu Vevohu</i>.<a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Under such circumstances, should
  we, can we, keep our faith in an eternal peace that will one day
  reign over mankind? Yes, we should and we can. Perhaps that very
  capability of total destruction of our little planet - achieved
  for the first time in the annals of mankind - will one day, God
  willing, become the origin, the cause and the prime mover for the
  elimination of all instruments of destruction from the face of
  the earth and ultimate peace, prayed for and yearned for by
  previous generations, will become the portion of all nations.
  Despite the tragedies and disappointments of the past, we must
  never forsake that vision, that human dream, that unshakeable
  faith.</p>

  <p>Peace is the beauty of life. It is
  sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the
  joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the
  advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of
  truth. Peace is all of these and more and more.</p>

  <p>But in my generation, Ladies and Gentlemen,
  there was a time indescribable. Six million Jews - men, women and
  children - a number larger than many a nation in Europe - were
  dragged to a wanton death and slaughtered methodically in the
  heart of the civilized continent. It was not a sudden outburst of
  human or rather inhuman cruelty that from time to time has
  happened in the history of mankind; it was a systematic process
  of extermination which unfolded before the eyes of the whole
  world for more than six years. Those who were doomed, deprived of
  their human dignity, starved, humiliated, led away and ultimately
  turned into ashes, cried out for rescue - but in vain. Other than
  a few famous and unforgettable exceptions they were left alone to
  face the destroyer.</p>

  <p>At such a time, unheard of since the first
  generation, the hour struck to rise and fight - for the dignity
  of man, for survival, for liberty, for every value of the human
  image a man has been endowed with by his Creator, for every known
  inalienable right he stands for and lives for. Indeed, there are
  days when to fight for a cause so absolutely just is the highest
  human command. Norway has known such days, and so have we. Only
  in honoring that command comes the <i>regeneration</i> of the
  concept of peace. You rise, you struggle, you make sacrifices to
  achieve and guarantee the prospect and hope of living in peace -
  for you and your people, for your children and their
  children.</p>

  <p>Let it, however, be declared and known,
  stressed, and noted that fighters for freedom hate war, My
  friends and I learned this precept from Zeev Jabotinsky through
  his own example, and through the one he set for us from Giuseppe
  Garibaldi.<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> Our brothers in
  spirit, wherever they dwell, learned it from <i>their</i> masters
  and teachers. This is our common maxim and belief - that if
  through your efforts and sacrifices you win liberty and with it
  the prospect of peace, then work for peace because there is no
  mission in life more sacred.</p>

  <p>And so reborn Israel always strove for
  peace, yearned for it, made endless endeavors to achieve it. My
  colleagues and I have gone in the footsteps of our predecessors
  since the very first day we were called by our people to care for
  their future. We went any place, we looked for any avenue, we
  made any effort to bring about negotiations between Israel and
  its neighbors, negotiations without which peace remains an
  abstract desire.</p>

  <p>We have labored long and hard to turn it
  into a reality - because of the blessings it holds for ourselves,
  our neighbors, the world. In peace, the Middle East, the ancient
  cradle of civilization, will become invigorated and transformed.
  Throughout its lands there will be freedom of movement of people,
  of ideas, of goods. Cooperation and development in agriculture
  will make the deserts blossom. Industry will bring the promise of
  a better life. Sources of water will be developed and the almost
  year-long sunshine will yet be harnessed for the common needs of
  all the nations. Yes, indeed, the Middle East, standing at the
  crossroads of the world, will become a peaceful center of
  international communication between East and West, North and
  South - a center of human advancement in every sphere of creative
  endeavor. This and more is what peace will bring to our
  region.</p>

  <p>During the past year many efforts for peace
  were made and many significant events took place. The President
  of the Arab Republic of Egypt expressed his readiness to come to
  Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, and to address our
  parliament, the Knesset. When that message reached me I, without
  delay or hesitation, extended to <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/index.html">President Sadat</a> on behalf
  of Israel, an invitation to visit our country. I told him: You
  will be received with respect and cordiality. And, indeed, so he
  was received, cordially and respectfully, by the people, by the
  parliament and by the government of our nation. We knew and
  learned that we have differences of opinion. But whenever we
  recall those days of Jerusalem we say, always, that they were
  shining, beautiful days of friendliness and understanding. It was
  in this same atmosphere that the meetings in Ismailya were
  conducted.<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the spirit of
  the Nobel Prize tradition we gave to each other the most
  momentous pledge: No more war. No more bloodshed. We shall
  negotiate and reach agreement.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, there were difficult times as
  well. Let nobody forget that we deal with a conflict of more than
  sixty years with its manifold tragedies. These, we must put
  behind us in order to establish friendship and make peace the
  beauty of our lives.</p>

  <p>Many of the difficulties were overcome at
  Camp David where the President of the United States, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2002/index.html">Mr. Jimmy Carter</a>,
  unforgettably invested unsparing effort, untiring energy and
  great devotion in the peace-making process. There, despite all
  the differences, we found solutions for problems, agreed on
  issues and the Framework for Peace was signed. With its
  signature, there was rejoicing in our countries and throughout
  the world. The path leading to peace was paved.</p>

  <p>The phase that followed was the natural
  arduous negotiations to elaborate and conclude a peace treaty as
  we promised each other to do at Camp David. The delegations of
  both countries worked hard and have, I believe, produced a draft
  document that can serve, if and when signed and ratified, as a
  good treaty of peace between countries that decided to put an end
  to hostility and war and begin a new era of understanding and
  cooperation. Such a treaty can serve as the first indispensable
  step along the road towards a comprehensive peace in our
  region.</p>

  <p>If, because of all these efforts, President
  Sadat and I have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, let me from
  this rostrum again congratulate him - as I did in a direct
  conversation between Jerusalem and Cairo a few weeks ago on the
  morrow of the announcement.</p>

  <p>Now, it is I who must express gratitude
  from the bottom of my heart for the great honor you do me. But,
  Ladies and Gentlemen, before doing so, permit me to remind us all
  that today is an important anniversary - the thirtieth
  anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human
  Rights. Let us always remember the magnificently written words of
  its first Article. It expresses the essence of all the
  declarations of the rights of man and citizen written throughout
  history. It says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"All human beings are born free and
    equal, in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and
    conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of
    brotherhood".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Free women and men everywhere must wage an
  incessant campaign so that these human values become a generally
  recognized and practised reality. We must regretfully admit that
  in various parts of the world this is not yet the case. Without
  those values and human rights the real peace of which we dream is
  jeopardized.</p>

  <p>For reasons self-understood, but which
  every man and woman of goodwill will accept, I must remind my
  honored listeners of my brethren and the prisoners who are
  deprived of one of their most basic rights: To go home. I speak
  about people of great courage who deserve not only the respect
  but also the moral support of the free world. I speak about
  people who, even from the depths of their suffering, repeat the
  age-long prayer:</p>

  <p class="smalltext" align="center"><img src="begin-text.gif"
  width="146" height="25" alt=" "><br>
  Next year in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>The preservation and protection of human
  rights are indispensable to give peace of nations and individuals
  its real meaning.</p>

  <p>Allow me, now, to turn to you, Madame
  President of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee and to all its
  members and say, Thank you. I thank you for the great
  distinction. It does not, however, belong to me; it belongs to my
  people - the ancient people and renaissant nation that came back
  in love and devotion to the land of its ancestors after centuries
  of homelessness and persecution. This prestigious recognition is
  due to this people because they suffered so much, because they
  lost so many, because they love peace and want it with all their
  hearts for themselves and for their neighbors. On their behalf, I
  humbly accept the award and in their name I thank you from the
  bottom of my heart.</p>

  <p>And may I express to His Majesty, the Ring,
  our deep gratitude for the gracious hospitality His Majesty, on
  this occasion, bestowed upon my wife and myself.</p>

  <p>Your Majesty, Your Highnesses, Members of the Nobel Peace
  Prize Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>

  <p>Seventy-seven years ago, the first Nobel
  Peace Prize was awarded. <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/index.html">Jean Henri Dunant</a> was its
  recipient. On December 10, 1901, the President of the Norwegian
  Parliament said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"The Norwegian people have always
    demanded that their independence be respected. They have always
    been ready to defend it. But at the same time they have always
    had a keen desire and need for peace".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>May I, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of
  the people of Israel, respectfully subscribe to these true and
  noble words.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>
