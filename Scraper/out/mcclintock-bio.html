  <h1>Barbara McClintock - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mcclintock.jpg" class="bio-img"> In the
  fall of 1921 I attended the only course in genetics open to
  undergraduate students at Cornell University. It was conducted by C. B.
  Hutchison, then a professor in the Department of Plant Breeding,
  College of Agriculture, who soon left Cornell to become
  Chancellor of the University of California at Davis, California.
  Relatively few students took this course and most of them were
  interested in pursuing agriculture as a profession. Genetics as a
  discipline had not yet received general acceptance. Only
  twenty-one years had passed since the rediscovery of Mendel's
  principles of heredity. Genetic experiments, guided by these
  principles, expanded rapidly in the years between 1900 and 1921.
  The results of these studies provided a solid conceptual
  framework into which subsequent results could be fitted.
  Nevertheless, there was reluctance on the part of some
  professional biologists to accept the revolutionary concepts that
  were surfacing. This reluctance was soon dispelled as the logic
  underlying genetic investigations became increasingly
  evident.<br>
  <br>
  When the undergraduate genetics course was completed in January
  1922, I received a telephone call from Dr. Hutchison. He must
  have sensed my intense interest in the content of his course
  because the purpose of his call was to invite me to participate
  in the only other genetics course given at Cornell. It was
  scheduled for graduate students. His invitation was accepted with
  pleasure and great anticipations. Obviously, this telephone call
  cast the die for my future. I remained with genetics
  thereafter.<br>
  <br>
  At the time I was taking the undergraduate genetics course, I was
  enrolled in a cytology course given by Lester W. Sharp of the
  Department of Botany. His interests focused on the structure of
  chromosomes and their behaviors at mitosis and meiosis.
  Chromosomes then became a source of fascination as they were
  known to be the bearers of "heritable factors". By the time of
  graduation, I had no doubts about the direction I wished to
  follow for an advanced degree. It would involve chromosomes and
  their genetic content and expressions, in short, cytogenetics.
  This field had just begun to reveal its potentials. I have
  pursued it ever since and with as much pleasure over the years as
  I had experienced in my undergraduate days.<br>
  <br>
  After completing requirements for the Ph.D. degree in the spring
  of 1927, I remained at Cornell to initiate studies aimed at
  associating each of the ten chromosomes comprising the maize
  complement with the genes each carries. With the participation of
  others, particularly that of Dr. Charles R. Burnham, this task
  was finally accomplished. In the meantime, however, a sequence of
  events occurred of great significance to me. It began with the
  appearance in the fall of 1927 of <a href=
  "../1958/index.html">George W. Beadle</a> (a Nobel Laureate) at
  the Department of Plant Breeding to start studies for his Ph.D.
  degree with Professor Rollins A. Emerson. Emerson was an eminent
  geneticist whose conduct of the affairs of graduate students was
  notably successful, thus attracting many of the brightest minds.
  In the following fall, Marcus M. Rhoades arrived at the Department of Plant
  Breeding to continue his graduate studies for a Ph.D. degree,
  also with Professor Emerson. Rhoades had taken a Masters degree
  at the California Institute of Technology and was well
  versed in the newest findings of members of the <a href=
  "../1933/index.html">Morgan</a> group working with Drosophila.
  Both Beadle and Rhoades recognized the need and the significance
  of exploring the relation between chromosomes and genes as well
  as other aspects of cytogenetics. The initial association of the
  three of us, followed subsequently by inclusion of any interested
  graduate student, formed a close-knit group eager to discuss all
  phases of genetics, including those being revealed or suggested
  by our own efforts. The group was self-sustaining in all ways.
  For each of us this was an extraordinary period. Credit for its
  success rests with Professor Emerson who quietly ignored some of
  our seemingly strange behaviors.<br>
  <br>
  Over the years, members of this group have retained the warm
  personal relationship that our early association generated. The
  communal experience profoundly affected each one of us.<br>
  <br>
  The events recounted above were, by far, the most influential in
  directing my scientific life.</p>
