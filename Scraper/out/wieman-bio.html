  <h1>Carl E. Wieman - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="wieman.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on
  March 26, 1951 in the small town of Corvallis, Oregon. A number
  of years earlier my newly wed parents N. Orr and Alison Wieman,
  like somewhat belated pioneers, had driven their decrepit car
  across the country to settle deep in the forests of the Oregon
  coastal range. My father began working in the lumber industry and
  during most of my childhood he worked as a sawyer in a sawmill. I
  was the fourth of five children. Most of my childhood was spent
  in the woods of Oregon where lumber was the sole industry.
  Probably some of my spirit of independence came from growing up
  far from other houses and towns. The nearest tiny store was
  always many miles away over unpaved mountain roads. Some of my
  earliest childhood memories are of the long school bus rides that
  my siblings and I used to take over those winding roads to go to
  school.</p>

  <p>Much of my youth was spent wandering around
  in the forests of towering Douglas fir trees. I also spend much
  of my time reading and picking fruit and fir cones to earn
  spending money. Every Saturday my family would make a long
  expedition to the nearest town to do the week's worth of
  shopping. A stop at the public library was always part of these
  trips. Although I was unaware of it at the time, my parents must
  have made special arrangements for their children to use the
  library since we lived far outside the region it was supposed to
  serve. The librarians would also overlook the normal five-book
  limit and allow me to check out a large pile of books each week
  that I would then eagerly devour. That experience has left me
  with a profound appreciation for the value of public libraries.
  At the time I was quite envious that my friends had televisions
  while we did not, but in retrospect I am very grateful that I
  spent this time reading instead of watching TV.</p>

  <p>I went to primary school (up to grade 6) at
  Kings Valley grade school. It was a tiny rural school that had
  expanded from one to three rooms shortly before I enrolled. For
  the seventh grade I had to take the much longer bus ride (almost
  interminable for an impatient 13 year old!) to the small town of
  Philomath. My young idealistic teachers in mathematics and
  science there had a significant influence on me. I particularly
  remember my science teacher, Ron Tobias, who was just starting
  his first teaching job. I am sure that Philomath 7th grade, with
  all its children of loggers and farm workers, for whom education
  was not a particularly high priority, must have been a very tough
  job for a young teacher. At times I could sense hints of his
  frustration. However Mr. Tobias did a great deal to kindle my
  interest in science with his enthusiasm and knowledge. I still
  remember his explanations (far better than any of the material
  from my college courses!) of the structures of atoms in the
  periodic table and how these structures determined the various
  chemical properties and molecular reactions.</p>

  <p>After 7th grade my parents moved to
  Corvallis (home of Oregon State University) so that my siblings and I
  could both avoid the long bus rides and take advantage of the
  better school system offered by this "big city" of 25,000. It was
  a heady day for me when we moved into a house that had a central
  heating system instead of just a wood stove and had an actual
  paved street out front! Although I was never a very sociable
  child, Corvallis provided me with somewhat more comfortable
  companions. My intellectual interests and the liberal political
  attitudes of my parents were always somewhat at odds with the
  leanings most of my previous rural classmates, but I fit in
  better with the children of faculty at OSU. I became close
  friends with a very smart boy, Brook Firey, whose father Bill was
  a Professor of mathematics. One summer Bill gave Brook and I our
  own private course in geometry. It was a rewarding and
  eye-opening experience to get a glimpse of the richness of
  mathematics, even elementary geometry, as viewed by a true
  mathematician. And of course, at that age, I did not realize
  there was anything unusual about a University professor spending
  a few hours each day to provide personal instruction to two
  fourteen year olds.</p>

  <p>Brook and I also spent many hours engrossed
  in all sorts of projects constructing and investigating things. I
  think that much of my talent and enjoyment at improvising
  solutions to experimental problems goes back to those homebuilt
  projects. In this regard my older brother Howard also inspired
  me; he was always tinkering with machines and building
  astonishingly elaborate toys for his younger siblings. Carrying
  out these individual projects also developed in me a good sense
  of self-reliance and a sense when a piece of improvised apparatus
  was likely (or unlikely) to be adequate. This sense is one that I
  often see missing in students whose education has been confined
  to formal instruction.</p>

  <p>During high school I was a good student,
  but never quite at the top of the class. I mastered the material,
  but was usually a little too independent to do precisely what the
  teacher wanted, and so was never considered among the very best
  students. Usually the worse the teacher (at least according to
  me), the lower was my standing. Although always interested in
  science, my most memorable classes were in literature and
  writing. From 7th through 10th grade I was a passionate chess
  player, spending hours a day on it. I traveled all over Oregon
  and occasionally to nearby states to play in tournaments. I was
  highly ranked in the northwest US among my age group, but at the
  ripe old age of 16 decided to "retire" to spend my time in more
  productive activities. Those activities were studying and playing
  tennis.</p>

  <p>My high school grades, although not
  outstanding, were good enough to get me accepted into MIT. From what I now
  know about college admissions, I suspect my admission was
  considerably helped by their being intrigued to have a student
  who had spent much of his life literally in the wilds of Oregon.
  My accomplishments as a competitive chess and tennis player may
  also have helped. Although it may seem surprising that a boy from
  the woods of Oregon would aspire to go to MIT, my family always
  had a strong interest in education. Both my parents graduated
  from college and had come from welleducated families. My
  grandfather Henry Wieman was a rather well known Professor of
  Theology at the University of Chicago. Out my four siblings there
  are two Ph.D.'s, including a successful nuclear physicist, as
  well as a high-level software engineer.</p>

  <p>My tendency to intensely pursue a
  particular activity to the exclusion of everything else was and
  is one of my most notable strengths and weaknesses. After
  "retiring" from chess, my focus turned to tennis. That continued
  after I went to MIT, and I played intercollegiately my freshman
  year. I also learned to play squash rackets and took to it so
  naturally that I was quickly at the top of the freshman
  intercollegiate squash team. My squash career was notable in that
  I can claim to have lost to some of the best players in the
  country, including one future national champion. Unfortunately my
  rather fierce competitive drive exceeded my limited physical
  capacities, and after surviving several minor injuries caused by
  throwing myself into walls and such, by the end of my freshman
  year I had seriously damaged my right elbow from excessive
  practice at squash and tennis. After several unsuccessful
  treatments, I then switched to playing left handed, and by early
  in my second year of college was starting to again be competitive
  in both sports at the intercollegiate level. At that point I
  developed serious elbow problems in my left arm, and reluctantly
  came to the conclusion that at age 19, it was time for my second
  "retirement". It was only then I turned my full attention to
  physics.</p>

  <p>As one might imagine, going from the woods
  of Oregon to MIT was quite a culture shock. I did not do
  particularly well in classes my freshman year, but I greatly
  enjoyed an informal freshman seminar on physics that I had with
  Professor Al Hill. He was a gruff but kindly old faculty member.
  Although I had a general interest in physics at least since
  seventh grade, particularly the behavior of light and atoms, I
  was not totally convinced when I started at MIT that I wanted to
  go into physics. However, after this seminar and its casual far
  ranging discussions about physics, Al Hill encouraged me and
  suggested that I should get involved in research. I discussed
  this with my freshman advisor who was Daniel Kleppner, and he
  took me on to work in his laboratory my first summer of college.
  This was a dramatic change from my employment the previous
  summer. Then, just out of high school, I had worked in the lumber
  mill, "pulling on the green chain". As the green lumber came out
  of the mill on a large conveyor chain, my job was to pull it off
  and stack it in the appropriate pile. This was an exhausting job
  that gave me a clear taste of what real labor was like. Every now
  and then when I am fed up with some aspect of my job as an
  academic, it is useful to reflect on that summer on the green
  chain to remind myself how well off I am compared to all those
  people who spend their lives doing <i>real</i> work.</p>

  <p>I quickly became deeply engaged in research
  as an undergraduate and continued to work in Dan Kleppner's
  research group until I left for graduate school. I found this
  much more interesting and educational than taking courses, and
  quickly adopted a philosophy of taking as few courses as
  possible. Since I never did terribly well in most normal courses
  anyway, particularly ones that had exams, this worked out well. I
  was actually remarkably successful at avoiding courses, helped in
  large part by the events of the times. The last few weeks (and
  the dreaded final exams) of my freshman year were canceled
  because of massive protests over the Vietnam War, and during the
  following years there were many opportunities to participate in
  experiments in various sorts of alternatives to normal classes. I
  took full advantage of all of these alternatives, and their
  rather lax requirements and oversight. I also spent countless
  hours discussing physics with the graduate students and postdocs
  (notably Dave Pritchard) in Dan Kleppner's research group. My
  education as a physicist came largely from my work in Dan's lab
  and these interactions with him and his group. I also spent much
  time in physics discussions with an informal seminar group (the
  "physics family") run by Rai Weiss and Al Hill.</p>

  <p>In spite of (or because of) this unorthodox
  education, I ended up far more enthusiastic about physics than
  most of my classmates, as well as having a much better grasp of
  many basic concepts such as quantum mechanics. Of course I was
  considerably weaker in the formal solving of problems, and I
  still have not learned much of the standard material of the
  undergraduate curriculum. However, when I needed to know some
  material, I was completely comfortable with going out and
  learning it myself in a way that I discovered was not typical for
  my classmates. My undergraduate experience has always left me
  deeply suspicious of the claims of those who say a student cannot
  become a physicist without being required to take courses
  covering a whole list of specific topics. I have had a pretty
  successful career in optics and atomic physics without having a
  course in either, for example. Some may argue that this could
  only work because I was an extraordinary student, and the more
  typical student must be required to take a formal curriculum with
  a large number of courses and exams. However, it might be noted
  that before obtaining this unusual "education" there was little
  to indicate that I was anything special as a physics student. So
  one could equally well argue that it was not me that was
  exceptional, but rather the education I received. Perhaps if far
  more students learned physics in the haphazard way that I did,
  many more of them might turn out as motivated and successful as I
  have been.</p>

  <p>I did become extremely involved in research
  as an undergraduate. Through a chain of circumstances, helped out
  no doubt by my enthusiasm and willingness to put in long hours of
  work, I ended up with my own lab and my own experiment. This
  involved the construction and use of a tunable dye laser, which
  at that time was a very new and exciting device. This was the
  beginning of Kleppner's group moving into the use of lasers to
  study atomic physics. I spent my time blasting atoms with a dye
  laser tuned to the atomic resonance line and looking carefully at
  what happened. To a large extent much of my subsequent career has
  been variations on this basic theme. After spending many very
  late nights by myself taking data in the lab and showering every
  day at the athletic center after exercising, I started to wonder
  why I was paying all that money, of which I had little, to rent a
  dormitory room I almost never saw. So driven by my involvement in
  the research and a desire to save money, I actually moved into my
  lab. After about a half a year, living in the lab got pretty old,
  and so I moved into a normal apartment, but the story of my being
  so devoted to experimental physics that I actually lived in the
  lab has tended to follow me ever since.</p>

  <p>My work with dye lasers made me aware of
  the exciting developments in narrowband dye lasers and their
  applications to atomic spectroscopy being done by Ted
  H&auml;nsch. That, along with the far superior weather and more
  relaxed academic atmosphere, convinced me to move from MIT to
  Stanford for graduate school. At Stanford I resisted the natural
  temptation to immediately jump into laser spectroscopy again, and
  so I spent a year looking fairly carefully into all of the
  different faculty and research areas in the department. However,
  in the end I concluded that working on laser spectroscopy with
  H&auml;nsch was the best option. I began working with his group
  as they were developing a very high power narrowband dye laser
  for exciting the 1S-2S transition in hydrogen. Ted was a new
  enthusiastic young professor, the technology and the experiment
  were new and exciting, and because of my previous background I
  was able to become thoroughly involved in the experiment almost
  immediately. It was a fun time, made more so by the fact that we
  soon observed the H 1S-2S transition and used it to measure the
  Lamb shift of the 1S state. For my thesis work I then went on to
  develop the technique of polarization spectroscopy and built the
  first single mode continuous wave dye laser at 480 nm to further
  improve the 1S Lamb shift measurement and greatly improve the
  determination of the 1S-2S isotope shift.</p>

  <p>As I neared completion of my Ph.D., I
  became interested in the subject of parity violation in atoms.
  This was predicted by the theory of electroweak unification, but
  had not been seen. It seemed like the natural next step to my
  thesis work in that it was using precision spectroscopy of atoms
  to test fundamental physics. But rather than further test QED in
  atoms, which by then I was ready to accept as being confirmed as
  well as ever need be, the parity violation work was looking for
  new physics in atoms that went beyond QED and was far from
  certain. It offered the possibility of using atomic physics to do
  important elementary particle physics. I took a position as an
  assistant research scientist at University of Michigan to pursue
  these studies. I joined Bill Williams' ongoing experiment to
  measure this parity violation in atomic hydrogen using microwave
  spectroscopy. Shortly after I arrived at Michigan I found that
  the research scientist position I had taken was not the research
  faculty position that I had expected. It had all the
  disadvantages of a regular postdoc, but none of the advantages in
  that there was not sufficient research money in the grant to
  cover my salary, so that I had also had to teach, and I had to be
  responsible for much of the administration of the research group.
  However, I threw myself into the experiment and worked extremely
  hard, and my position was converted into a regular assistant
  professor position after a couple of years. Shortly after this I
  developed a somewhat different formulation for how to describe
  atomic parity violation experiments. This allowed me to see
  clearly how to compare the sensitivities of a large variety of
  different experimental approaches. At that same time I was also
  becoming increasingly disillusioned with the hydrogen experiment,
  and my new formulation made it clear to me that a quite different
  approach, using laser spectroscopy of cesium, would have a far
  better chance of success.</p>

  <p>For a variety of reasons I chose to pursue
  the cesium experiment on my own, after first receiving assurances
  from the department chair that this was a suitable activity.
  Unfortunately, my abandoning of the hydrogen experiment to pursue
  my own atomic parity violation experiment lead to considerable
  friction with senior faculty and general strife within the
  department. As a young assistant professor na&iuml;ve in
  departmental politics I was quite vulnerable, and had a difficult
  time during my subsequent years at Michigan. However, during that
  time, Sarah Gilbert and I were able to get funding from Research
  Corporation and then NSF and used it to thoroughly develop a
  novel experimental approach for measuring atomic PV in cesium.
  Sarah was a graduate student that I had met soon after I arrived
  at Michigan. We then worked intensively with graduate students
  Rich Watts and Charlie Noecker to implement this difficult
  experiment. By 1984 we had made sufficient progress to indicate
  the viability of our approach, and this attracted an offer of a
  faculty position at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I
  eagerly accepted the offer.</p>

  <p>The year 1984 was a very active one for me.
  First, Sarah Gilbert completed her Ph.D., and I accepted the job
  at Colorado. In late August we then packed up the entire lab into
  the back of a rental truck along with all the personal furniture
  of the graduate students, and then Sarah, Rich, Charlie,
  Charlie's girlfriend, and I set out on a modern day pioneer
  caravan across the Great Plains to Boulder, Colorado. After
  quickly unpacking the truck, Sarah and I then left to fly out to
  Oregon for our wedding. We had been anticipating this since
  shortly after we met, but we had delayed until after Sarah
  finished her degree. We then returned to Boulder to start our new
  jobs and a new lab.</p>

  <p>In the supportive environment of JILA and
  the Department of Physics in Boulder, along with lots of very
  hard work, the four of us, Sarah, Rich, Charlie, and myself, were
  able to make rapid progress and in less than a year completed our
  first measurement of parity violation in cesium. As with all my
  experiments, I had started out wildly optimistic as to the
  difficulty and time required for this experiment, and it was both
  a tremendous relief and a tremendous satisfaction when it
  succeeded. It was the best measurement of atomic parity violation
  at a time when this subject was being pursued by a number of
  notable atomic physics groups. Our result established both to
  myself and the rest of the world that I would have a career as
  research physicist; something that had sunk into considerable
  doubt during my seven years of meager accomplishments at
  Michigan. Shortly after the success of the PV experiment I was
  given tenure and promoted to Full Professor at Colorado. During
  the subsequent 15 years, my group has carried out two further
  generations of this long and difficulty experiment with ever
  improving accuracy.</p>

  <p>I would be remiss if I failed to mention
  the tremendous benefits that I have gained in my career by having
  a wife who is a very talented and intelligent physicist (as well
  as being a wonderful person of course). Shortly after we arrived
  in Boulder, Sarah took a job at the NIST Boulder labs where she
  has worked ever since. We worked together on the PV experiments,
  and still collaborate on an occasional small project. Talking
  with Sarah about physics has always provided me with countless
  inspirations for new ideas, and has revealed critical flaws that
  I had overlooked in twice as many bad ideas. She also can
  understand and share in my obsession with the research and its
  occasional extraordinary demands. Finally, her ruthless editing
  has greatly improved the writing of nearly all of my papers. When
  we are not working, Sarah and I can usually be found running or
  hiking on the trails of the Boulder Mountain Parks. We can also
  occasionally (but not frequently enough) be found at our house on
  the central Oregon coast.</p>

  <p>The development of the diode laser
  technology that was needed for the third generation of the parity
  violation experiment led to my involvement with laser cooling and
  trapping and ultimately BEC. Originally in about 1984 Rich Watts
  and I were simply looking for something fun and easy to do with
  the diode laser technology we had developed for the PV
  experiment, as a respite from the very long hard grind of that
  project. This resulted in our slowing atoms using lasers that
  were about 1% of the cost of what was used for previous work by
  Hall and Phillips. I then became increasingly interested in laser
  cooling and trapping. Initially my work on it focused largely on
  developing it as a useful technology for doing other atomic
  physics, but then I became more involved in studying the novel
  behavior of atoms at the unprecedented temperatures we could
  achieve. In the process of those studies I worked with an
  undergraduate Bill Swann to invent the vapor-cell MOT to replace
  the traditional atomic beam loading of optical traps. This
  provided a means to trap atoms using only inexpensive diode
  lasers and a small glass cell, which was a dramatic advance
  towards making laser trapping a simple and widely useable
  technology.</p>

  <p>To me personally, this reduction in the
  cost and complication offered the opportunity to explore a
  variety of speculative directions involving laser cooled atoms
  with relatively little risk, since the cost and effort was now
  quite modest. One such quick experiment was to switch the laser
  cooled and trapped atoms to a magnetic trap in order to avoid the
  limits we had discovered were imposed by the photons in the
  optical trap. This worked so easily and so well - we obtained
  trapped atoms about 100 times colder than had been achieved
  previously, with a corresponding enhancement in phase space
  density - that it inspired me to pursue goals grander than just
  better trapping and cooling technology; namely, the attainment of
  BEC by further cooling in the magnetic trap. Fortunately Eric
  Cornell joined me at just that time (1990) to pursue the goal of
  BEC. Ours turned out to be an extraordinarily friendly and
  effective partnership that has continued up to the present. Our
  pursuit of BEC is now well-documented history.</p>

  <p>Over the past several years I have become
  increasingly involved with trying to improve undergraduate
  physics education and have been balancing my time between that
  and my research. I have been examining alternative curricula and
  learning about the research in physics education as to how
  students do and do not learn. A particular concern has been
  improving how physics is taught to students who are not planning
  to become physicists, in the hope of one day making physics
  understandable, useful, and interesting to a large fraction of
  the population. My efforts have ranged from working with national
  organizations pursuing widespread change in undergraduate physics
  education to developing useful innovations in the individual
  courses that I teach. Because of my particular concerns, these
  courses have lately been large introductory courses primarily for
  nonscience students.</p>
