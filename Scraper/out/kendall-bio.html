  <h1>Edward C. Kendall - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kendall.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Edward
  Calvin Kendall</b> was born on March 8, 1886, at South Norwalk,
  Connecticut, U.S.A. He was educated at Columbia
  University, where he obtained the degrees of Bachelor of
  Science in 1908 and Master of Science, specializing in Chemistry,
  in 1909. From 1909 until 1910 he was Goldschmidt Fellow of this
  University, and in 1910 he obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  From 1910 until 1911 he was research chemist for Parke, Davis and
  Co., at Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A. Here he did research on the
  thyroid gland, and from 1911 until 1914 he continued this work at
  St. Luke's Hospital, New York.<br>
  <br>
  In 1914 he was appointed Head of the Biochemistry Section in the
  Graduate School of the Mayo Foundation, Rochester which is affiliated with the
  University of
  Minnesota, and in 1915 he was appointed Director of the
  Division of Biochemistry there and subsequently Professor of
  Physiological Chemistry. On April 1, 1951, Kendall reached the
  age of retirement from the Mayo Foundation and he accepted the
  position of Visiting Professor in the Department of Biochemistry
  at Princeton
  University, a position, which at the time of writing, he
  still holds.<br>
  <br>
  Kendall's name will always be associated with his isolation of
  thyroxine, the active principle of the thyroid gland, but he is
  also known for his crystallization of glutathione, the chemical
  nature of which he established, and also for his work on the
  oxidation systems in animals. Perhaps his greatest achievement,
  however, was his work on the hormones of the cortex of the
  adrenal glands. Chemical investigation of the adrenal cortex was
  carried out simultaneously but independently by Kendall and
  <a href="index.html">T. Reichstein</a> with their associates. The
  former at the Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota; the latter
  at Zurich, Switzerland.<br>
  <br>
  After many years the hormones of the adrenal cortex were
  isolated, identified, and prepared by synthetic methods in small
  amounts. Subsequently, they were made commercially on a scale
  sufficiently large to permit a study of their physiological
  effects. Previous to this, Dr. <a href="index.html">Philip
  Hench</a>, also at the Mayo Foundation, had observed that
  patients who had rheumatoid arthritis were sometimes relieved if
  they developed jaundice. In women, rheumatoid arthritis was
  sometimes relieved during pregnancy. When one of the hormones of
  the adrenal cortex was given to patients by Dr. Hench, the
  anti-inflammatory effect of the compound, cortisone, was
  discovered. It was then found that many other diseases of an
  inflammatory nature were relieved by cortisone. Although it was
  found later that cortisone, like insulin, acts only so long as it
  is given to the patient, and that it does not cure the disease,
  the discovery of the activity of cortisone was a great step
  forward. It has led to our modern knowledge of the hormones of
  the adrenal cortex and their uses in medicine. For their work,
  Kendall, Hench, and Reichstein jointly were given the Nobel Prize
  for Physiology and Medicine for 1950. Since his retirement to
  Princeton University, Kendall has continued his studies of the
  chemistry of the adrenal cortex.<br>
  <br>
  Kendall received many awards and other honours, some of these
  (Lasker Award of the American Public Health Service, Passano
  Award of the Passano Foundation in San Francisco, and Page One
  Award of the Newspaper Guild of New York) jointly with Dr. Hench.
  On December 1915, he married Rebecca Kennedy; they have two
  children.</p>
