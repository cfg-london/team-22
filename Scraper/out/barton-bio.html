  <h1>Derek Barton - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="barton.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Derek Harold Richard Barton</b> was
  born on 8 September 1918, son of William Thomas and Maude
  Henrietta Barton. In 1938 he entered Imperial College, University of London,
  where he obtained his B.Sc.Hons. (1st Class) in 1940 and Ph.D.
  (Organic Chemistry) in 1942. From 1942 to 1944 he was a research
  chemist on a government project, from1944-1945 he was with
  Messrs. Albright and Wilson, Birmingham. In 1945 he became
  assistant lecturer in the Department of Chemistry of Imperial College, from
  1946-1949 he was I.C.I. Research Fellow. In 1949 he obtained his
  D.Sc. from the same University. During 1949-1950 he was Visiting
  Lecturer in the Chemistry of Natural Products, at the Department of
  Chemistry, Harvard University (U.S.A.). In 1950 he was
  appointed Reader in Organic Chemistry and in 1953 Professor at
  Birkbeck
  College. In 1955 he became Regius Professor of Chemistry at
  the University of
  Glasgow, in 1957 he was appointed Professor of Organic
  Chemistry at Imperial College, which position he still
  holds.<br>

  In 1950, in a brief paper in <i>Experientia</i> entitled "The
  Conformation of the Steroid Nucleus", Professor Barton showed
  that organic molecules in general and steroid molecules in
  particular could be assigned a preferred conformation based upon
  results accumulated by chemical physicists, in particular by Odd
  Hassel. Having chosen a preferred conformation, it was
  demonstrated that the chemical and physical properties of a
  molecule could be interpreted in terms of that preferred
  conformation. In molecules containing fixed rings, such as the
  steroids, there resulted a simple relationship between
  configuration and conformation, such that configurations could be
  predicted once the possible conformations for the products of a
  reaction could be analysed. Thus the subject "conformational
  analysis" had begun. Barton later determined the geometry of many
  other natural product molecules using this method. Conformational
  analysis is useful in the elucidation of configuration, in the
  planning of organic synthesis, and in the analysis of reaction
  mechanisms. It will be fundamental to a complete understanding of
  enzymatic processes.<br>

  Society, in 1956 he became Fellow of the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh; in 1965 he was appointed member of the Council for
  Scientific Policy of the U. K.; in 1969 he became President of
  Section B, British Association for the Advancement of Science,
  and President of the Organic Chemistry Division of the
  International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.<br>

  Derek Barton was first married to Jeanne Kate Wilkins but this
  marriage was later dissolved. He is now married to Christiane
  Cognet, a Professor of the Lyc&eacute;e fran&ccedil;ais de Londres.
  He has one son, W.G.L. Barton, by his first marriage.</p>
