  <h1>Richard Kuhn - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kuhn.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Richard Kuhn</b> was born in Vienna
  on December 3, 1900. His father, Richard Clemens Kuhn, was an
  engineer and "Hofrat"; his mother, Angelika Rodler, was a teacher
  in elementary schools. He was educated at the "Gymnasium"
  (grammar school). He studied chemistry at Vienna University
  and later at Munich under <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/index.html">R. Willst&auml;tter</a>.
  He obtained his degree (D.Ph.) in 1922 following his thesis
  <i>&Uuml;ber Spezifit&auml;t der Enzyme</i> (On the specificity
  of enzymes).<br>
  <br>
  In 1925 Munich University invited him to lecture on chemistry.
  Kuhn accepted an invitation by the Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule in
  Zurich, where he held the post of Professor for General and
  Analytical Chemistry from 1926 until 1929. He then became
  Principal of the Institute for Chemistry at the newly founded
  Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut (since 1950, Max Planck Institut) for
  Medical Research in Heidelberg; in 1937 he also took over the
  administration of this Institute, in succession to L. von Krehl.
  Besides these duties he also filled the post of Professor of
  Biochemistry at the University of Heidelberg. For one year he was
  at the University
  of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, as a Visiting Research
  Professor for Physiological Chemistry.<br>
  <br>
  Kuhn investigated theoretical problems of organic chemistry
  (stereochemistry of aliphatic and aromatic compounds; syntheses
  of polyenes and cumulenes; constitution and colour; the acidity
  of hydrocarbons), as well as extensive fields in biochemistry
  (carotenoids; flavins; vitamins and enzymes).<br>
  <br>
  For a period of twenty years Kuhn investigated compounds
  containing double bonds which proved to be of great interest in
  connection with the study of the chemical nature of the
  carotenoids. He discovered eight new types of these and was able
  to analyse their constitution. He also carried out important work
  on vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and the antidermatitis vitamin
  B<sub>6</sub>. For his work in this important field Kuhn was
  awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1938.<br>
  <br>
  Kuhn received numerous other honours and awards in recognition of
  his work; he was awarded honorary degrees of the Technische
  Hochschule in Munich (1960), the University of
  Vienna (1960), the University of St. Maria, Brazil (1961). An
  impressive number of medals and prizes have been presented to
  him, as well as orders and the highest possible honours, in many
  countries. Kuhn is also a member of many scientific academies,
  societies and organizations in all parts of the world. He is the
  President of the Society of German Chemists, Vice-President of
  the Max Planck Society and Editor of <i>Liebigs Annalen der
  Chemie</i>. He belongs to the Board of the "Badische Anilin- und
  Soda-Fabrik".<br>
  <br>
  It may be mentioned that for a period of eight years (1910-1918)
  Richard Kuhn was a schoolmate of <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1945/index.html">Wolfgang Pauli</a> who was
  awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1945.<br>
  <br>
  Richard Kuhn married Daisy Hartmann in 1928 and has two sons and
  four daughters.</p>
