  <h2>Antineuritic Vitamin and Beriberi</h2>

  <p>Beriberi is a disease prevalent,
  epidemically, in tropical and subtropical regions of Eastern
  Asia, where rice is the staple food of the natives; it is found
  elsewhere among sago-eating peoples (Molucca Islands), as well as
  in South America, in places where rice or cassava meal is the
  staple diet, as in certain parts of Brazil. However, the disease
  also occurs sporadically - here and there even with abundant
  frequency - in the temperate zone and, in some circumstances, in
  the frigid zone.</p>

  <p>The symptoms of the disease are paralysis
  and numbness starting from the lower limbs, as well as cardiac
  and respiratory disorders accompanied by dropsy. These latter
  symptoms rapidly come to the fore, and we then speak of "wet
  beriberi". Soon the motility and sensitivity disturbances,
  eventually accompanied by severe muscular atrophy, become more
  pronounced ("dry beriberi"). Mixed and transitional forms,
  however, are not rare. Where the paralysis is fairly advanced,
  the peculiar gait of the patient is noticeable. As the extensors
  of the foot are paralysed, the patient has to raise the knee up
  and swing the foot forward in order to avoid stumbling over the
  downhanging toes.</p>

  <p>It is mostly young men in full vigour who
  are stricken by the acute form of the disease; they not
  infrequently die suddenly, in terrible distress through inability
  to breathe. This fatal issue, even in the more chronic cases, is
  often due to intercurrent causes, e.g. physical strain, or
  diseases such as malaria, dysentery, etc.</p>

  <p>Although beriberi was described as long ago
  as in the first half of the 17th century by the Dutch specialist
  in tropical medicine Bontius, it has only shown itself as a
  really devastating disease in the Malay Archipelago since about
  the sixties of last century, and then generally speaking not so
  much among the free population as among people living to some
  extent under constraint, such as soldiers, sailors, prisoners,
  imported coolies in the mines and plantations, and so forth. It
  was particularly common in the native prisons; even detainees
  awaiting trial, sometimes died of the disease. And in the native
  hospitals it claimed many a victim among people admitted for a
  relatively minor ailment, such as gonorrhoea or a fractured
  bone.</p>

  <p>During the protracted war - a true guerilla
  war - which we had to wage with the Achin sultanate, both army
  and navy suffered very severely from the disease. Newly drafted
  native troops were often unfit for service after about six weeks
  and the pitiful remnant had to be evacuated as quickly as
  possible. For instance, a man might apparently be in good health
  in the morning, and even gave proof of his skill during target
  practice, and then fell victim to the disease by evening. An army
  doctor of that time mentions that at his hospital 18 soldier died
  of beriberi on one day.</p>

  <p>European troops also suffered from the
  disease in Achin, though to a lesser extent than the native
  troops.</p>

  <p>Faced with this serious situation, the Home
  Government decided in 1886 to send out a commission to
  investigate the nature of beriberi and its cause. Pekelharing,
  Professor of Pathology, and Winkler, reader in neurology, both of
  the Medical Faculty of the University of Utrecht, were in charge,
  and I was seconded to the commission as an assistant. Winkler
  immediately established that the disease was essentially a form
  of polyneuritis (more accurately: multiple neuratrophy), a
  finding which agreed with results obtained by B&auml;lz and von
  Scheube from investigations conducted by them in Japan. The
  clinical symptoms were also consistent with this
  pathological-anatomical diagnosis, which moreover could be
  confirmed in the living subject by electrical examination
  (reaction of degeneration, etc.).</p>

  <p>At that time there were naturally many
  different theories as to the cause of beriberi. Two of these were
  based on the fact that the disease was particularly prevalent
  among rice-eating populations, although -as already mentioned -
  this is not always the case. On the one hand, rice poisoning was
  suspected; on the other, a deficiency of the rice diet, but not
  in the same sense as we now understand it.</p>

  <p>With regard to the first theory, the
  disease was found to occur all too often where the rice was of
  excellent quality from the culinary point of view. Neither was
  any actual proof of a preexisting poison in the rice diet found,
  or even sought. This also applies to other poison-theories, e.g.
  that the disease was due to rotten fish or to "mephitic" gases
  emanating from the soil.</p>

  <p>The second theory was formulated by Van
  Leent in 1879 in the light of his experience with the East Indies
  Navy. He considered that an one-sided rice diet resulted in
  malnutrition owing to its very low content of protein and fat,
  and that this condition would promote beriberi. He found that the
  incidence of the disease among native sailors fell considerably
  when they were put on to a European diet.</p>

  <p>There were weighty arguments against this
  theory, in particular the fact that people with great muscular
  strength and a welldeveloped <i>panniculus adiposus</i> were
  often attacked by the disease; and also that European crews, on a
  diet containing sufficient protein and fat, were not immune, even
  when they were given virtually no rice at all. In the report made
  after its return to Holland, the commission rejected this theory
  because it could not be assumed that malnutrition in itself would
  result in destruction of peripheral nerves. For this a directly
  injurious effect on the nerves or their centers would be
  necessary. In the light of our knowledge today, however, we see
  that there was a very large grain of truth in Van Leent's theory,
  and it can scarcely be doubted that a lasting improvement in the
  health of the native crews could have been achieved if it were
  possible to introduce the Dutch navy food and persuade the men to
  take it. It is however a very delicate matter to alter the diet
  to which people have been accustomed from their youth, and
  consequently with few exceptions the native sailors soon forsook
  pea soup with sausage and bacon, potatoes, bread with cheese,
  etc. and went back to the monotonous and poor rice diet, which
  they were usually able to procure.</p>

  <p>Takaki, who - for reasons similar to those
  of Van Leent - a few years later changed the diet of the Japanese
  Navy to the European style, thereby - it is reported - achieving
  lasting success in the fight against beriberi, also had to admit
  that this measure was difficult to put into effect. "By last
  year's experience," he said, "we have found that most of the men
  dislike meat as well as bread and we do not know what we shall do
  next."</p>

  <p>However this may be, we failed to check the
  disease permanently, although at first it did seem to subside a
  little. But this diminution does not prove much since in any case
  beriberi was subject to considerable periodic fluctuations, apart
  from the fact that the statistics on the disease were not very
  reliable. For instance it was quite obvious that these statistics
  frequently included cases of palpitations of the heart, oedema of
  the feet, as well as a new cause of death described as "hydraemia
  perniciosa tropica" - conditions which should obviously have been
  ascribed to beriberi. In those days diagnosis of beriberi was
  clearly taboo.</p>

  <p>In the limited time which the commission,
  for official reasons, had at its disposal it was unable to carry
  out experimental investigations in every conceivable direction,
  and it is not surprising that at a time when bacteriology was
  all-triumphant under the leadership of Pasteur and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/index.html">Koch</a>, the commission
  should have decided first of all to apply the methods of these
  two men to the problem in hand. It had all the more reason to
  take this line since beriberi is a disease with pronounced local
  and periodic tendencies (as defined by von Pettenkofer). The
  periodic fluctuations, the prevalence under certain climatic and
  weather conditions, the epidemic occurrence in certain countries
  and places, the association with buildings, and finally the cases
  of transmission of the disease described in the literature - all
  this pointed to an infection. True, under these circumstances a
  parasitic disease might have been considered -in particular
  hookworm, widely spread in the tropics, has been accused of being
  the main cause of beriberi - but the commission was able to
  establish that anaemia of any severity is not one of the
  characteristics of this disease.</p>

  <p>I shall not dwell on the results of the
  bacteriological investigations because they have long since
  ceased to have any significance, although at that time they were
  apparently of fundamental importance. Polymorphic bacteria were
  found in the blood of patients, although not regularly, and
  degeneration of the nerves could be induced in animals by
  repeated injections of a coccus culture from them. In its report,
  following its return to Holland, the commission suggested very
  tentatively that the cause of beriberi had thus been discovered.
  The commission succeeded in isolating a coccus, which it
  considered identical with the above-mentioned one, from the air
  in barracks which, from its point of view, could be regarded as
  infected.</p>

  <p>Following the departure of the commission I
  was entrusted with the task of continuing its investigations, but
  at frost I failed to get any further. The disinfection measures
  which, as is logical, were recommended had not the hoped-for
  success. Then a chance happening put me on the right track.</p>

  <p>A disease, in many respects strikingly
  similar to beriberi in man, suddenly broke out in the
  chicken-house at the laboratory in Batavia, and this called for a
  thorough study. The symptoms of this disease are as follows: The
  initial stages, following defective evacuation of the crop some
  days earlier, are characterized by an unsteady gait. The bird has
  difficulty in perching and has to exert itself in order not to
  fall; the legs are spread through weakness, and the knee and
  ankle joint are bent. The bird frequently collapses and falls
  over when walking. Finally it remains lying on its side and
  paresis of the wing muscles now becomes obvious from its vain
  efforts to get up. Paralysis of the body muscles advances rapidly
  from below. Within a few days the condition of the bird has so
  deteriorated that it can no longer eat anything without
  assistance; although swallowing movements are still produced, the
  bird is unable to lift its head. Symptoms indicating the onset of
  paresis of the respiratory muscles then appear. Respiration is
  slowed down, the beak opens, comb and skin become cyanotic, the
  neck is bent back and the head drawn in. The bird now becomes
  more and more soporific, the eyes are covered by the nictitating
  membrane and the body temperature falls a degree or two
  centigrade below normal.</p>

  <p>This was a case of polyneuritis, as
  indicated by the symptoms and course of the disease and proved
  beyond question by a microscopic examination.</p>

  <p>With regard to the etiology, our original
  supposition was not confirmed, i.e. that in the case of the
  strikingly epizootic occurrence of the disease an infection was
  involved. Attempts to induce the infection with material from
  affected birds or from birds which had died of the disease were
  inconclusive since all the chickens, even those kept separate as
  controls, were affected. No specific micro-organism or any higher
  parasite was found.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the disease cleared up and we
  were unable to continue our investigations. The affected chickens
  recovered and there were no new cases. Fortunately suspicion fell
  on the food, and rightly so, as it very soon turned out.</p>

  <p>The laboratory was still housed
  provisionally and in a very makeshift manner at the military
  hospital, although it was administered by the civilian
  authorities. The laboratory keeper - as I afterwards discovered -
  had for the sake of economy fed the chickens on cooked rice which
  he had obtained from the hospital kitchen. Then the cook was
  replaced and his successor refused to allow military rice to be
  taken for civilian chickens. Thus, the chickens were fed on
  polished rice from 17th June to 27th November only. And the
  disease broke out on 10th July and cleared up during the last
  days of November.</p>

  <p>Deliberate feeding experiments were then
  conducted in order to check more thoroughly whether or not the
  propable connection between diet and the disease actually
  existed. It was found for certain that the polyneuritis was due
  to the diet of cooked rice. The chickens were attacked by the
  disease after 3-4 weeks, and in many cases somewhat later,
  whereas the controls which were fed on unpolished rice remained
  healthy. In many cases, birds suffering from the disease could be
  cured by a suitable alteration in diet.</p>

  <p>This difference between polished and whole
  rice did not lie in the fact that the former had not kept so well
  during storage, since cooked rice which had been freshly prepared
  from the whole kernel would also cause the disease. In addition
  to this, rough rice, i.e. rice with only the coarse husk removed,
  which deteriorates much more easily (being attacked by mites,
  mould fungi, etc.), proved harmless during the feeding
  experiments. This rice, as obtained simply by stamping, still has
  its inner hull - known as its "silver skin" (pericarpium) - and
  germ wholly or largely intact. We were then able to conclude from
  a series of highly varied experiments that the antineuritic
  principle is situated mainly in these parts of the rice kernel,
  and indeed of any cereal grain. It can easily be extracted with
  water or strong alcohol and is dialysable. I also established
  that it can be used medicinally either through the mouth or
  parenterally.</p>

  <p>Feeding with other Amylaceae, such as sago
  and tapioca, had exactly the same results as cooking rice. Since
  these contain only traces of primary nutrients other than starch,
  it was impossible to dismiss out of hand the suspicion that the
  disease was due to simple inanition, especially as it was
  accompanied by considerable emaciation. And at that time - when
  the effectiveness of minute doses of the antineuritic principle
  had not yet been established - the fact that the affected birds
  recovered when fed on a diet consisting only of meat, could be
  regarded as being tantamount to the result of an experimentum
  crucis. On the other hand, by adding meat to the starch-rich diet
  it was possible to prevent the emaciation but not outbreaks of
  the disease, even though these were somewhat delayed. Thus,
  inanition in itself could not be the main cause of the disease
  (any more than "protein" or "salt" deficiency), even though it
  promoted it. I also concluded from this that an antineuritic
  principle must have been present in the meat, i:e. in the animal
  organism, but that this principle was gradually used up while the
  chickens were being fed on a starch diet. And finally the outcome
  of these experiments was encouraging for me in that one apparent
  difference as compared with human beriberi had thus been
  eliminated, for, as already stated, beriberi not infrequently
  attacks well-fed, strong individuals. Starvation experiments
  which I conducted at that time also produced a negative result.
  This was confirmed many times over (Holst, Shiga, &amp; Kusama;
  Fraser &amp; Stanton, et al.) before I resumed these experiments
  (in Holland) in view of a communication from Chamberlain et al.
  (1911) that they had observed in 3 out of 8 cases, polyneuritis
  among chickens which had been given drinking water without any
  solid food. This time I obtained a positive result in no less
  than six out of eight cases. However, it could not be concluded
  from this alone that the cause of the disease was general
  inanition, for, apart from the fact that total starvation
  includes partial starvation, we were able to show that the
  starved birds which were suffering from the disease, just as
  birds which had been fed on an unbalanced diet, recovered again,
  despite continuing loss of weight, when given 8-10 g vitamin-rich
  yeast per day.</p>

  <p>Investigations with other animal species on
  the East Indies showed that birds such as pigeons and the Indian
  rice bird can also be used with success. In contrast, results of
  experiments with mammals were almost entirely negative. This
  disappointment could, of course, not prevent me from testing
  whether and to what extent the discovery which had been made as a
  result of the study of polyneuritis in birds could be used in the
  fight against human beriberi, although at that time there was
  still reason enough to doubt the identity of the two diseases. I
  was therefore accused of not being logical, a reproach which I am
  happy to pass over without comment.</p>

  <p>The obvious thing to do was to test the
  preventive and curative effect of rough rice in the case of
  beriberi by means of experiments and controls. Rough rice is the
  staple diet wherever the rural population in the Indies grows
  rice for its own use and shelled it by primitive methods. White,
  or polished, rice is processed mechanically and is one of the
  blessings of European civilization, of our improved techniques
  which, for instance, have also changed the colour of bread here
  in Europe from brown to white. Thought-provoking too was the
  fact, already referred to, that the free population, which fed
  itself, was much less subject to beriberi than the population
  whose freedom was restricted, and which was often dependent on
  imported and therefore mechanically processed, polished, rice.
  (As already noted, rough rice is unsuitable for prolonged
  storage.)</p>

  <p>When the projected nutritional experiments
  on man had just begun, an observation was made by Vorderman which
  had almost the value of a check experiment. As civilian medical
  inspector for the island of Java he knew that, in accordance with
  local custom, the native prisoners were given polished rice in
  some areas, but rough rice in others. The question, therefore,
  was to ascertain whether there was a connection between the
  nature of the staple diet and the incidence of beriberi at the
  prisons. This on-the-spot investigation was carried out by
  Vorderman at my request, on behalf of the East Indies Government,
  and at the same time attention was paid to other factors - apart
  from diet - with a bearing on the subject. As a result of this
  research, conducted with admirable proficiency and perseverance,
  my theory based on the chicken experiments was proved correct.
  The enquiry covered no less than 101 prisons with almost 300,000
  inmates. In brief, the proportion of cases of beriberi in the
  prisons where polished rice was used as staple diet was some 300
  times greater than in those where rough rice was used.</p>

  <p>Vorderman's remarkable results did not at
  once find recognition and were received with scepticism and
  adverse criticism in some quarters. For me, who had meanwhile
  been repatriated, the results agreed so unequivocally with those
  of the chicken experiments that the possibility of coincidence
  could not seriously be considered. However, the nutritional
  experiments on which I had already embarked were discontinued,
  and the alteration in the catering regulations for prisoners,
  suggested after my departure by Vorderman and Grijns, in the long
  run did not meet with the necessary cooperation of the
  authorities. Only when Grijns, who continued' my investigations,
  discovered that a certain bean, the "katjang idju" (<i>Phaseolus
  radiatus</i>), has the protective and curative action in the case
  of chickens, successful experiments - with this bean - were made
  on man (Roelfsema, Hulshoff Pol, and Kiewiet de Jonge). It is,
  however, obvious that this bean is of far less value as a staple
  food than a suitable rice diet.</p>

  <p>New encouragement then came from British
  India (Braddon, Ellis, Fletcher, and Fraser &amp; Stanton), on
  the strength of which in 1910 the following resolution was drawn
  up by the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine meeting in
  Manila:</p>

  <p>"That in the opinion of this Association,
  sufficient evidence has now been produced in support of the view
  that beriberi is associated with the continuous consumption of
  white (polished) rice as the staple article of diet, and that the
  Association accordingly desires to bring this matter to the
  notice of the various Governments concerned."</p>

  <p>And in Hong Kong, 1912:</p>

  <p>"That the accuracy of the opinion of the
  Association, recorded in 1910, has received further and more
  complete confirmation by investigators in Japan, China, French
  Indo-China, the Philippine Islands, Siam, Netherlands India, the
  Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States, namely that
  beriberi..."</p>

  <p>Experiments on animals were naturally also
  used in order to trace the distribution of the antineuritic
  principle in living organisms. Numerous animal and vegetable
  foodstuffs which are more or less rich in this principle are
  listed in the literature on the subject. In practice this is of
  the greatest importance, since here too it has been found that
  the vitamin-rich foodstuffs can be used successfully to combat
  human beriberi. Concentrated extracts of these have also been
  prepared and these likewise have a pronounced curative action
  both against polyneuritis in birds and against beriberi.</p>

  <p>Until a short while ago, however, no one
  had succeeded in extracting the active principle reliably and in
  pure form from these initial materials, although indeed efforts
  to do so were not wanting. And I was particularly delighted when
  a few years ago Jansen and Donath were able to report from the
  laboratory in Batavia - now a splendid improvement on my old
  workshop - that they had isolated the antineuritic vitamin from
  rice bran. It is a crystalline substance, obtained in the form of
  a hydrochloride, an analysis of which gives approximately the
  formula.</p>

  <p>With this substance they conducted
  experiments in preventive feeding with rice birds and pigeons,
  and they found that an addition of 2 mg per 1 kg polished rice,
  i.e. in the ratio of 1:500,000, is sufficient to give protection
  against polyneuritis.</p>

  <p>They sent me approximately 40 mg,
  sufficient to carry out not only preventive but also curative
  experiments on pigeons and young cocks. I was able to confirm
  that such a minute addition gives protection and - which, indeed,
  could not have been expected otherwise - also has curative
  power.</p>

  <p>Accordingly the human requirement of
  antineuritic vitamin can be estimated at 1-2 mg per day.</p>
