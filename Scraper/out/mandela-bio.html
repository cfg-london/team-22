  <p><img src="mandela.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</b> was
  born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was
  Hendry Mphakanyiswa of the Tembu Tribe. Mandela himself was
  educated at University College of Fort Hare and the University of
  Witwatersrand where he studied law. He joined the African
  National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against
  the ruling National Party's apartheid policies after 1948. He
  went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was acquitted in
  1961.<br>
  <br>
  After the banning of the ANC in 1960, Nelson Mandela argued for
  the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. In June 1961,
  the ANC executive considered his proposal on the use of violent
  tactics and agreed that those members who wished to involve
  themselves in Mandela's campaign would not be stopped from doing
  so by the ANC. This led to the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe.
  Mandela was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years'
  imprisonment with hard labour. In 1963, when many fellow leaders
  of the ANC and the Umkhonto we Sizwe were arrested, Mandela was
  brought to stand trial with them for plotting to overthrow the
  government by violence. His statement from the dock received
  considerable international publicity. On June 12, 1964, eight of
  the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life
  imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerated at Robben
  Island Prison, off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor
  Prison, nearby on the mainland.<br>
  <br>
  During his years in prison, Nelson Mandela's reputation grew
  steadily. He was widely accepted as the most significant black
  leader in South Africa and became a potent symbol of resistance
  as the anti-apartheid movement gathered strength. He consistently
  refused to compromise his political position to obtain his
  freedom.<br>

  Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. After his
  release, he plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life's work,
  striving to attain the goals he and others had set out almost
  four decades earlier. In 1991, at the first national conference
  of the ANC held inside South Africa after the organization had
  been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected President of the ANC
  while his lifelong friend and colleague, Oliver Tambo, became the
  organisation's National Chairperson.</p>
