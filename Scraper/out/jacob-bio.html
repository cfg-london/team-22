  <h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="jacob.jpg" class="bio-img">
  <b>Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob</b> was born in June 1920 in Nancy
  (France). He was the only son of Simon Jacob and
  Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Franck. After attending the Lyc&eacute;e Carnot
  in Paris, he began studying medicine at the Faculty of Paris,
  with the intention of becoming a surgeon. These studies were
  interrupted by the war. In June 1940, when in his second year of
  medicine, he left France and joined the Free French Forces in
  London. He was sent to Africa as a medical officer and saw action
  in Fezzan, Libya, Tripolitania and Tunisia, where he was wounded.
  He was posted to the Second Armoured Division, and was severely
  wounded in Normandy, in August 1944. He remained in the hospital
  for seven months, and was awarded the Croix de la
  Lib&eacute;ration, the highest French military decoration of this
  war.<br>
  <br>
  After the war, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob completed his medical studies
  and submitted his doctoral thesis in Paris in 1947. He was unable
  to practise surgery on account of his injuries, and worked in
  various fields before turning to biology. He obtained a science
  degree in 1951, and then a doctorate in science in 1954 at the
  Sorbonne, with a thesis on &laquo;Lysogenic bacteria and the
  provirus concept&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  In 1950, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob joined the Institut
  Pasteur under Dr. <a href="index.html">Andr&eacute; Lwoff</a>.
  He was appointed Laboratory Director in 1956, then in 1960 Head
  of the Department of Cell Genetics, recently created at the
  Institut Pasteur. In 1964 he was appointed Professor at the
  Coll&egrave;ge de France, where a chair of Cell Genetics was
  created for him.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a><br>

  The work of Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob has dealt mainly with the genetic
  mechanisms existing in bacteria and bacteriophages, and with the
  biochemical effects of mutations. He first studied the properties
  of lysogenic bacteria and demonstrated their
  &laquo;immunity&raquo;, i.e. the existence of a mechanism
  inhibiting the activity of genes in the prophage as in infective
  particles of the same type. In 1954 he began a long and fruitful
  collaboration with Elie Wollman, in an attempt to establish the
  nature of the relationships between the prophage and genetic
  material of the bacterium. This study led to a definition of the
  mechanism of bacterial conjugation, and also enabled an analysis
  of the genetic apparatus of the bacterial cell. From this work
  there emerged a whole series of new concepts, such as the
  oriented process of genetic transfer from the male to the female,
  the circularity of the bacterial chromosome or the episome
  concept. The whole of this work was summarized in a book
  <i>Sexuality and the Genetics of Bacteria</i>.<br>
  <br>
  In 1958 the remarkable analogy revealed by genetic analysis of
  lysogeny and that of the induced biosynthesis of
  &szlig;-galactosidase led Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob, with <a href=
  "index.html">Jacques Monod</a>, to study the mechanisms
  responsible for the transfer of genetic information as well as
  the regulatory pathways which, in the bacterial cell, adjust the
  activity and synthesis of macromolecules. Following this
  analysis, Jacob and Monod proposed a series of new concepts,
  those of messenger RNA, regulator genes, operons and allosteric
  proteins.<br>
  <br>
  In 1963, together with Sydney
  Brenner, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob put forward the
  &laquo;replicon&raquo; hypothesis to account for certain aspects of
  cell division in bacteria. Since then, he has devoted his
  attention to the genetic analysis of the mechanisms of cell
  division. In 1970 he began to study cultured mammalian cells,
  particularly certain aspects of their genetic properties.<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  In 1970, Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob published a book <i>La logique du
  vivant, une Histoire de l'H&eacute;r&eacute;dit&eacute;,</i> in which,
  beginning with the 16th century, he traces the stages in the
  study of living beings that have led up to molecular
  biology.<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob has been awarded a number of French
  scientific prizes, notably the Charles L&eacute;opold Mayer prize
  by the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (1962). He is a foreign member
  of the Danish Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962), the
  American Academy
  of Arts and Sciences (1964), the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
  (1969), and the American Philosophical Society (1969). He has
  received honorary degrees from several universities. He was
  invited to give a Harvey Lecture (New York, 1958) and the Dunham
  Lectures (Harvard, 1964).<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a><br>
  <br>
  In 1947 Fran&ccedil;ois Jacob married the pianist Lise Bloch. They
  have four children: Pierre (born in 1949), who has become a
  philosopher, Laurent and Odile (born in 1952) and Henri (born in
  1954), who are still undifferentiated.<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
