  <h1>John H. van Vleck - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="vleck.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in Middletown, Connecticut,
  March 13, 1899 where my father and grandfather were respectively
  professors of mathematics and of astronomy at Wesleyan
  University. However, when I was seven years old father
  accepted a professorship at the University of Wisconsin, so I
  grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, where I attended the public
  schools, and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1920. As a sort of
  revolt against having two generations of academic forbears, I
  vowed as a child that I would not be a college professor, but
  after a semester of graduate work at Harvard, I outgrew my
  childish prejudices, and realized that the life work for which I
  was best qualified was that of a physicist, not of the
  experimental variety, but in an academic environment.<br>
  <br>
  I have been lucky in a number of respects. Coming from an
  academic family, I had invaluable parental guidance or advice at
  various times. At Harvard I took most of my courses under Professor
  Bridgman or Professor Kemble. The latter's course on quantum
  theory fascinated me, so I decided to write my doctor's thesis
  under Kemble's supervision. He was the one person in America at
  that time qualified to direct purely theoretical research in
  quantum atomic physics. My doctor's thesis was the calculation of
  the binding energy of a certain model of the helium atom, which
  Kemble and <a href="../1922/index.html">Niels Bohr</a> suggested
  independently and practically simultaneously, with Kramers making
  the corresponding calculation in Copenhagen. The results did not
  agree with experiment for the "old quantum theory" was not the
  real thing. However, when the true quantum mechanics was
  discovered by Heisenberg and others in 1926, my background in the
  old quantum theory and its correspondence principle was a great
  help in learning the new mechanics, particularly the matrix form
  which is especially useful in the theory of magnetism.<br>
  <br>
  I was fortunate in being offered an assistant professorship at
  the University of
  Minnesota in 1923, a year after my Ph. D. at Harvard, with
  purely graduate courses to teach. This was an unusual move by
  that institution, as at that time, posts with this type of
  teaching were generally reserved for older men, and recent Ph.
  D.'s were traditionally handicapped by heavy loads of
  undergraduate teaching which left little time to think about
  research. Also it was at Minnesota that I met Abigail Pearson, a
  student there, whom I married June 10, 1927, and on Nobel Day,
  December 10, 1977 we had been married exactly 50 1/2 years!<br>
  <br>
  I was also lucky in choosing the theory of magnetism as my
  principal research interest, as this is a field which has
  continued to be of interest over the years, with new ramfications
  continuing to make their appearance (magnetic resonance,
  relaxation, microwave devices, etc.). So often a particular field
  loses general interest after a span of time. My last paper
  dealing with magnetism was published fifty years after my first
  one.<br>
  <br>
  Besides my work on magnetism, and the closely related subjects of
  ligand fields and of dielectrics, one of my interests has been
  molecular spectra. The theoretical problems associated with the
  fine structures therein appeared rather academic at the time, but
  recently have burgeoned in interest in connection with
  radioastronomical investigations, including notably those of the
  observatory at Gothenburg.</p>
