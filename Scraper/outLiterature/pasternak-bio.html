  <h1>Boris Pasternak - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="pasternak.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Boris Leonidovich Pasternak</b>
  (1890-1960), born in Moscow, was the son of talented artists: his
  father a painter and illustrator of Tolstoy's works, his mother a
  well-known concert pianist. Pasternak's education began in a
  German Gymnasium in Moscow and was continued at the University of
  Moscow. Under the influence of the composer Scriabin, Pasternak
  took up the study of musical composition for six years from 1904
  to 1910. By 1912 he had renounced music as his calling in life
  and went to the University of Marburg, Germany, to study philosophy.
  After four months there and a trip to Italy, he returned to
  Russia and decided to dedicate himself to literature.<br>

  Pasternak's first books of verse went unnoticed. With <i>Sestra
  moya zhizn</i> (My Sister Life), 1922, and <i>Temy i
  variatsii</i> (Themes and Variations), 1923, the latter marked by
  an extreme, though sober style, Pasternak first gained a place as
  a leading poet among his Russian contemporaries. In 1924 he
  published <i>Vysokaya bolezn</i> (Sublime Malady), which
  portrayed the 1905 revolt as he saw it, and <i>Detstvo
  Lyuvers</i> (The Childhood of Luvers), a lyrical and
  psychological depiction of a young girl on the threshold of
  womanhood. A collection of four short stories was published the
  following year under the title <i>Vozdushnye puti</i> (Aerial
  Ways). In 1927 Pasternak again returned to the revolution of 1905
  as a subject for two long works: <i>Leytenant Shmidt</i>, a poem
  expressing threnodic sorrow for the fate of Lieutenant Schmidt,
  the leader of the mutiny at Sevastopol, and <i>Devyatsot pyaty
  god</i> (The Year 1905), a powerful but diffuse poem which
  concentrates on the events related to the revolution of 1905.
  Pasternak's reticent autobiography, <i>Okhrannaya gramota</i>
  (Safe Conduct), appeared in 1931, and was followed the next year
  by a collection of lyrics, <i>Vtoroye rozhdenie</i> (Second
  Birth), 1932. In 1935 he published translations of some Georgian
  poets and subsequently translated the major dramas of
  Shakespeare, several of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Kleist,
  and Ben Jonson, and poems by Pet&ouml;fi, Verlaine, Swinburne,
  Shelley, and others. <i>Na rannikh poyezdakh</i> (In Early
  Trains), a collection of poems written since 1936, was published
  in 1943 and enlarged and reissued in 1945 as <i>Zemnye
  prostory</i> (Wide Spaces of the Earth). In 1957 <i>Doktor
  Zhivago</i>, Pasternak's only novel - except for the earlier
  "novel in verse", <i>Spektorsky</i> (1926) - first appeared in an
  Italian translation and has been acclaimed by some critics as a
  successful attempt at combining lyrical-descriptive and
  epic-dramatic styles. An autobiographical sketch,
  <i>Biografichesky ocherk</i> (An Essay in Autobiography), was
  published in 1959, first in Italian, and subsequently in English.
  Pasternak lived in Peredelkino, near Moscow, until his death in
  1960.</p>
