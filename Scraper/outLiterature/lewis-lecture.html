  <h1>Sinclair Lewis - Nobel Lecture</h1>

  <h2>The American Fear of Literature</h2>

  <p>Were I to express my feeling of honor and
  pleasure in having been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, I
  should be fulsome and perhaps tedious, and I present my gratitude
  with a plain &laquo;Thank you&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  I wish, in this address, to consider certain trends, certain
  dangers, and certain high and exciting promises in present-day
  American literature. To discuss this with complete and unguarded
  frankness - and I should not insult you by being otherwise than
  completely honest, however indiscreet - it will be necessary for
  me to be a little impolite regarding certain institutions and
  persons of my own greatly beloved land.<br>
  <br>
  But I beg of you to believe that I am in no case gratifying a
  grudge. Fortune has dealt with me rather too well. I have known
  little struggle, not much poverty, many generosities. Now and
  then I have, for my books or myself, been somewhat warmly
  denounced - there was one good pastor in California who upon
  reading my <i>Elmer Gantry</i> desired to lead a mob and lynch
  me, while another holy man in the state of Maine wondered if
  there was no respectable and righteous way of putting me in jail.
  And, much harder to endure than any raging condemnation, a
  certain number of old acquaintances among journalists, what in
  the galloping American slang we call the &laquo;I Knew Him When
  Club&nbsp;&raquo;, have scribbled that since they know me personally,
  therefore I must be a rather low sort of fellow and certainly no
  writer. But if I have now and then received such cheering
  brickbats, still I, who have heaved a good many bricks myself,
  would be fatuous not to expect a fair number in return.<br>
  <br>
  No, I have for myself no conceivable complaint to make, and yet
  for American literature in general, and its standing in a country
  where industrialism and finance and science flourish and the only
  arts that are vital and respected are architecture and the film,
  I have a considerable complaint.<br>
  <br>
  I can illustrate by an incident which chances to concern the
  <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/lewis-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> and myself and which happened a few days ago, just
  before I took the ship at New York for Sweden. There is in
  America a learned and most amiable old gentleman who has been a
  pastor, a university professor, and a diplomat. He is a member of
  the American Academy of Arts and Letters and no few universities
  have honored him with degrees. As a writer he is chiefly known
  for his pleasant little essays on the joy of fishing. I do not
  Suppose that professional fishermen, whose lives depend on the
  run of cod or herring, find it altogether an amusing occupation,
  but from these essays I learned, as a boy, that there is
  something very important and spiritual about catching fish, if
  you have no need of doing so.<br>
  <br>
  This scholar stated, and publicly, that in awarding the Nobel
  Prize to a person who has scoffed at American institutions as
  much as I have, the Nobel Committee and the Swedish Academy had
  insulted America. I don't know whether, as an ex-diplomat, he
  intends to have an international incident made of it, and perhaps
  demand of the American Government that they land Marines in
  Stockholm to protect American literary rights, but I hope
  not.<br>
  <br>
  I should have supposed that to a man so learned as to have been
  made a Doctor of Divinity, a Doctor of Letters, and I do not know
  how many other imposing magnificences, the matter would have
  seemed different; I should have supposed that he would have
  reasoned, &laquo;Although personally I dislike this man's books,
  nevertheless the Swedish Academy has in choosing him honored
  America by assuming that the Americans are no longer a puerile
  backwoods clan, so inferior that they are afraid of criticism,
  but instead a nation come of age and able to consider calmly and
  maturely any dissection of their land, however
  scoffing.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  I should even have supposed that so international a scholar would
  have believed that Scandinavia, accustomed to the works of
  Strindberg, Ibsen, and <a href=
  "../1917/index.html">Pontoppidan</a>, would not have been
  peculiarly shocked by a writer whose most anarchistic assertion
  has been that America, with all her wealth and power, has not yet
  produced a civilization good enough to satisfy the deepest wants
  of human creatures.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that Strindberg rarely sang the &laquo;Star-Spangled
  Banner&raquo; or addressed Rotary Clubs, yet Sweden seems to have
  survived him.<br>
  <br>
  I have at such length discussed this criticism of the learned
  fisherman not because it has any conceivable importance in
  itself, but because it does illustrate the fact that in America
  most of us - not readers alone but even writers - are still
  afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of
  everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our
  virtues. To be not only a best seller in America but to be really
  beloved, a novelist must assert that all American men are tall,
  handsome, rich, honest, and powerful at golf; that all country
  towns are filled with neighbors who do nothing from day to day
  save go about being kind to one another; that although American
  girls may be wild, they change always into perfect wives and
  mothers; and that, geographically, America is composed solely of
  New York, which is inhabited entirely by millionaires; of the
  West, which keeps unchanged all the boisterous heroism of 1870;
  and of the South, where everyone lives on a plantation
  perpetually glossy with moonlight and scented with
  magnolias.<br>
  <br>
  It is not today vastly more true than it was twenty years ago
  that such novelists of ours as you have read in Sweden, novelists
  like Dreiser and Willa Cather, are authentically popular and
  influential in America. As it was revealed by the venerable
  fishing Academician whom I have quoted, we still most revere the
  writers for the popular magazines who in a hearty and edifying
  chorus chant that the America of a hundred and twenty million
  population is still as simple, as pastoral, as it was when it had
  but forty million; that in an industrial plant with ten thousand
  employees, the relationship between the worker and the manager is
  still as neighborly and uncomplex as in a factory of 1840, with
  five employees; that the relationships between father and son,
  between husband and wife, are precisely the same in an apartment
  in a thirty-story palace today, with three motor cars awaiting
  the family below and five books on the library shelves and a
  divorce imminent in the family next week, as were those
  relationships in a rose-veiled five-room cottage in 1880; that,
  in fine, America has gone through the revolutionary change from
  rustic colony to world empire without having in the least altered
  the bucolic and Puritanic simplicity of Uncle Sam.<br>
  <br>
  I am, actually, extremely grateful to the fishing Academician for
  having somewhat condemned me. For since he is a leading member of
  the American Academy of Arts and Letters, he has released me, has
  given me the right to speak as frankly of that Academy as he has
  spoken of me. And in any honest study of American intellectualism
  today, that curious institution must be considered.<br>
  <br>
  Before I consider the Academy, however, let me sketch a fantasy
  which has pleased me the last few days in the unavoidable
  idleness of a rough trip on the Atlantic. I am sure that you
  know, by now, that the award to me of the Nobel Prize has by no
  means been altogether popular in America. Doubtless the
  experience is not new to you. I fancy that when you gave the
  award even to <a href="../1929/index.html">Thomas Mann</a>, whose
  <i>Zauberberg</i> seems to me to contain the whole of
  intellectual Europe, even when you gave it to <i>Kipling</i>,
  whose social significance is so profound that it has been rather
  authoritatively said that he created the British Empire, even
  when you gave it to <a href="../1925/index.html">Bernard
  Shaw</a>, there were countrymen to those authors who complained
  because you did not choose another.<br>
  <br>
  And I imagined what would have been said had you chosen some
  American other than myself. Suppose you had taken Theodore
  Dreiser.<br>
  <br>
  Now to me, as to many other American writers, Dreiser more than
  any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often
  hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian
  timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and
  boldness and passion of life. Without his pioneering, I doubt if
  any of us could, unless we liked to be sent to jail, seek to
  express life and beauty and terror.<br>
  <br>
  My great colleague Sherwood Anderson has proclaimed this
  leadership of Dreiser. I am delighted to join him. Dreiser's
  great first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, which he dared to
  publish thirty long years ago and which I read twenty-five years
  ago, came to housebound and airless America like a great free
  Western wind, and to our stuffy domesticity gave us the first
  fresh air since Mark Twain and Whitman.<br>
  <br>
  Yet had you given the Prize to Mr. Dreiser, you would have heard
  groans from America; you would have heard that his style - I am
  not exactly sure what this mystic quality &laquo;style&raquo; may
  be, but I find the word so often in the writings of minor critics
  that I suppose it must exist - you would have heard that his
  style is cumbersome, that his choice of words is insensitive,
  that his books are interminable. And certainly respectable
  scholars would complain that in Mr. Dreiser's world, men and
  women are often sinful and tragic and despairing, instead of
  being forever sunny and full of song and virtue, as befits
  authentic Americans.<br>
  <br>
  And had you chosen Mr. <a href="../1936/index.html">Eugene
  O'Neill</a>, who has done nothing much in American drama save to
  transform it utterly, in ten or twelve years, from a false world
  of neat and competent trickery to a world of splendor and fear
  and greatness, you would have been reminded that he has done
  something far worse than scoffing - he has seen life as not to be
  neatly arranged in the study of a scholar but as a terrifying,
  magnificent, and often quite horrible thing akin to the tornado,
  the earthquake, the devastating fire.<br>
  <br>
  And had you given Mr. James Branch Cabell the Prize, you would
  have been told that he is too fantastically malicious. So would
  you have been told that Miss Willa Cather, for all the homely
  virtue of her novels concerning the peasants of Nebraska, has in
  her novel, <i>The Lost Lady</i>, been so untrue to America's
  patent and perpetual and possibly tedious virtuousness as to
  picture an abandoned woman who remains, nevertheless, uncannily
  charming even to the virtuous, in a story without any moral; that
  Mr. Henry Mencken is the worst of all scoffers; that Mr. Sherwood
  Anderson viciously errs in considering sex as important a force
  in life as fishing; that Mr. Upton Sinclair, being a Socialist,
  sins against the perfectness of American capitalistic mass
  production; that Mr. Joseph Hergesheimer is un-American in
  regarding graciousness of manner and beauty of surface as of some
  importance in the endurance of daily life; and that Mr. <a href=
  "../1954/index.html">Ernest Hemingway</a> is not only too young
  but, far worse, uses language which should be unknown to
  gentlemen; that he acknowledges drunkenness as one of man's
  eternal ways to happiness, and asserts that a soldier may find
  love more significant than the hearty slaughter of men in
  battle.<br>
  <br>
  Yes, they are wicked, these colleagues of mine; you would have
  done almost as evilly to have chosen them as to have chosen me;
  and as a chauvinistic American - only, mind you, as an American
  of 1930 and not of 1880 - I rejoice that they are my countrymen
  and countrywomen, and that I may speak of them with pride even in
  the Europe of Thomas Mann, H. G. Wells, Galsworthy, <a href=
  "../1920/index.html">Knut Hamsun</a>, Arnold Bennett,
  Feuchtwanger, <a href="../1909/index.html">Selma
  Lagerl&ouml;f</a>, <a href="../1928/index.html">Sigrid
  Undset</a>, <a href="../1916/index.html">Verner von
  Heidenstam</a>, D'Annunzio, <a href="../1915/index.html">Romain
  Rolland</a>.<br>
  <br>
  It is my fate in this paper to swing constantly from optimism to
  pessimism and back, but so is it the fate of anyone who writes or
  speaks of anything in America - the most contradictory, the most
  depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world
  today.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, having with no muted pride called the roll of what seem to
  me to be great men and women in American literary life today, and
  having indeed omitted a dozen other names of which I should like
  to boast were there time, I must turn again and assert that in
  our contemporary American literature, indeed in all American arts
  save architecture and the film, we - yes, we who have such
  pregnant and vigorous standards in commerce and science - have no
  standards, no healing communication, no heroes to be followed nor
  villains to be condemned, no certain ways to be pursued, and no
  dangerous paths to be avoided.<br>
  <br>
  The American novelist or poet or dramatist or sculptor or painter
  must work alone, in confusion, unassisted save by his own
  integrity.<br>
  <br>
  That, of course, has always been the lot of the artist. The
  vagabond and criminal Fran&ccedil;ois Villon had certainly no smug and
  comfortable refuge in which elegant ladies would hold his hand
  and comfort his starveling soul and more starved body. He,
  veritably a great man, destined to outlive in history all the
  dukes and puissant cardinals whose robes he was esteemed unworthy
  to touch, had for his lot the gutter and the hardened
  crust.<br>
  <br>
  Such poverty is not for the artist in America. They pay us,
  indeed, only too well; that writer is a failure who cannot have
  his butler and motor and his villa at Palm Beach, where he is
  permitted to mingle almost in equality with the barons of
  banking. But he is oppressed ever by something worse than poverty
  - by the feeling that what he creates does not matter, that he is
  expected by his readers to be only a decorator or a clown, or
  that he is good-naturedly accepted as a scoffer whose bark
  probably is worse than his bite and who probably is a good fellow
  at heart, who in any case certainly does not count in a land that
  produces eighty-story buildings, motors by the million, and wheat
  by the billions of bushels. And he has no institution, no group,
  to which he can turn for inspiration, whose criticism he can
  accept and whose praise will be precious to him.<br>
  <br>
  What institutions have we?<br>
  <br>
  The American Academy of Arts and Letters does contain, along with
  several excellent painters and architects and statesmen, such a
  really distinguished university president as Nicholas Murray
  Butler, so admirable and courageous a scholar as Wilbur Cross,
  and several first-rate writers: the poets Edwin Arlington
  Robinson and Robert Frost, the free-minded publicist James
  Truslow Adams, and the novelists Edith Wharton, Hamlin Garland,
  Owen Wister, Brand Whitlock, and Booth Tarkington.<br>
  <br>
  But it does not include Theodore Dreiser, Henry Mencken, our most
  vivid critic, George Jean Nathan, who, though still young, is
  certainly the dean of our dramatic critics, Eugene O'Neill,
  incomparably our best dramatist, the really original and vital
  poets, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Carl Sandburg, Robinson
  Jeffers and Vachel Lindsay and Edgar Lee Masters, whose <i>Spoon
  River Anthology</i> was so utterly different from any other
  poetry ever published, so fresh, so authoritative, so free from
  any gropings and timidities that it came like a revelation and
  created a new school of native American poetry. It does not
  include the novelists and short-story writers, Willa Cather,
  Joseph Hergesheimer, Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, Ernest
  Hemingway, Louis Bromfield, Wilbur Daniel Steele, Fannie Hurst,
  Mary Austin, James Branch Cabell, Edna Ferber, nor Upton
  Sinclair, of whom you must say, whether you admire or detest his
  aggressive socialism, that he is internationally better known
  than any other American artist whosoever, be he novelist, poet,
  painter, sculptor, musician, architect.<br>
  <br>
  I should not expect any Academy to be so fortunate as to contain
  all these writers, but one which fails to contain any of them,
  which thus cuts itself off from so much of what is living and
  vigorous and original in American letters, can have no
  relationship whatever to our life and aspirations. It does not
  represent the literary America of today - it represents only
  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<br>
  <br>
  It might be answered that, after all, the Academy is limited to
  fifty members; that, naturally, it cannot include every one of
  merit. But the fact is that while most of our few giants are
  excluded, the Academy does have room to include three
  extraordinarily bad poets, two very melodramatic and
  insignificant playwrights, two gentlemen who are known only
  because they are university presidents, a man who was thirty
  years ago known as a rather clever, humorous draughtsman, and
  several gentlemen of whom - I sadly confess my ignorance - I have
  never heard.<br>
  <br>
  Let me again emphasize the fact - for it is a fact - that I am
  not attacking the American Academy. It is a hospitable and
  generous and decidedly dignified institution. And it is not
  altogether the Academy's fault that it does not contain many of
  the men who have significance in our letters. Sometimes it is the
  fault of those writers themselves. I cannot imagine that grizzly
  bear Theodore Dreiser being comfortable at the serenely Athenian
  dinners of the Academy, and were they to invite Mencken, he would
  infuriate them with his boisterous jeering. No, I am not
  attacking - I am reluctantly considering the Academy because it
  is so perfect an example of the divorce in America of
  intellectual life from all authentic standards of importance and
  reality.<br>
  <br>
  Our universities and colleges, or gymnasia, most of them, exhibit
  the same unfortunate divorce. I can think of four of them,
  Rollins
  College in Florida, Middlebury College in Vermont, the University of
  Michigan, and the University of Chicago - which has had on its roll so
  excellent a novelist as Robert Herrick, so courageous a critic as
  Robert Morss Lovett - which have shown an authentic interest in
  contemporary creative literature. Four of them. But universities
  and colleges and musical emporiums and schools for the teaching
  of theology and plumbing and signpainting are as thick in America
  as the motor traffic. Whenever you see a public building with
  Gothic fenestration on a sturdy backing of Indiana concrete, you
  may be certain that it is another university, with anywhere from
  two hundred to twenty thousand students equally ardent about
  avoiding the disadvantage of becoming learned and about gaining
  the social prestige contained in the possession of a B.A
  degree.<br>
  <br>
  Oh, socially our universities are close to the mass of our
  citizens, and so are they in the matter of athletics. A great
  college football game is passionately witnessed by eighty
  thousand people, who have paid five dollars apiece and motored
  anywhere from ten to a thousand miles for the ecstasy of watching
  twenty-two men chase one another up and down a curiously marked
  field. During the football season, a capable player ranks very
  nearly with our greatest and most admired heroes - even with
  Henry Ford, President Hoover, and Colonel Lindbergh.<br>
  <br>
  And in one branch of learning, the sciences, the lords of
  business who rule us are willing to do homage to the devotees of
  learning. However bleakly one of our trader aristocrats may frown
  upon poetry or the visions of a painter, he is graciously pleased
  to endure a <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/index.html">Millikan</a>, a <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/index.html">Michelson</a>, a <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/index.html">Banting</a>, a Theobald
  Smith.<br>
  <br>
  But the paradox is that in the arts our universities are as
  cloistered, as far from reality and living creation, as socially
  and athletically and scientifically they are close to us. To a
  true-blue professor of literature in an American university,
  literature is not something that a plain human being, living
  today, painfully sits down to produce. No; it is something dead;
  it is something magically produced by superhuman beings who must,
  if they are to be regarded as artists at all, have died at least
  one hundred years before the diabolical invention of the
  typewriter. To any authentic don, there is something slightly
  repulsive in the thought that literature could be created by any
  ordinary human being, still to be seen walking the streets,
  wearing quite commonplace trousers and coat and looking not so
  unlike a chauffeur or a farmer. Our American professors like
  their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.<br>
  <br>
  I do not suppose that American universities are alone in this. I
  am aware that to the dons of Oxford and Cambridge, it would seem rather
  indecent to suggest that Wells and Bennett and Galsworthy and
  George Moore may, while they commit the impropriety of continuing
  to live, be compared to anyone so beautifully and safely dead as
  Samuel Johnson. I suppose that in the universities of Sweden and
  France and Germany there exist plenty of professors who prefer
  dissection to understanding. But in the new and vital and
  experimental land of America, one would expect the teachers of
  literature to be less monastic, more human, than in the
  traditional shadows of old Europe.<br>
  <br>
  They are not.<br>
  <br>
  There has recently appeared in America, out of the universities,
  an astonishing circus called &laquo;the New Humanism.&raquo; Now of
  course &laquo;humanism&raquo; means so many things that it means
  nothing. It may infer anything from a belief that Greek and Latin
  are more inspiring than the dialect of contemporary peasants to a
  belief that any living peasant is more interesting than a dead
  Greek. But it is a delicate bit of justice that this nebulous
  word should have been chosen to label this nebulous cult.<br>
  <br>
  Insofar as I have been able to comprehend them - for naturally in
  a world so exciting and promising as this today, a life brilliant
  with Zeppelins and Chinese revolutions and the Bolshevik
  industrialization of farming and ships and the Grand Canyon and
  young children and terrifying hunger and the lonely quest of
  scientists after God, no creative writer would have the time to
  follow all the chilly enthusiasms of the New Humanists - this
  newest of sects reasserts the dualism of man's nature. It would
  confine literature to the fight between man's soul and God, or
  man's soul and evil.<br>
  <br>
  But, curiously, neither God nor the devil may wear modern dress,
  but must retain Grecian vestments. Oedipus is a tragic figure for
  the New Humanists; man, trying to maintain himself as the image
  of God under the menace of dynamos, in a world of high-pressure
  salesmanship, is not. And the poor comfort which they offer is
  that the object of life is to develop self- discipline - whether
  or not one ever accomplishes anything with this self-discipline.
  So the whole movement results in the not particularly novel
  doctrine that both art and life must be resigned and negative. It
  is a doctrine of the blackest reaction introduced into a
  stirringly revolutionary world.<br>
  <br>
  Strangely enough, this doctrine of death, this escape from the
  complexities and danger of living into the secure blankness of
  the monastery, has become widely popular among professors in a
  land where one would have expected only boldness and intellectual
  adventure, and it has more than ever shut creative writers off
  from any benign influence which might conceivably have come from
  the universities.<br>
  <br>
  But it has always been so. America has never had a Brandes, a
  Taine, a Goethe, a Croce.<br>
  <br>
  With a wealth of creative talent in America, our criticism has
  most of it been a chill and insignificant activity pursued by
  jealous spinsters, ex-baseball-reporters, and acid professors.
  Our Erasmuses have been village schoolmistresses. How should
  there be any standards when there has been no one capable of
  setting them up?<br>
  <br>
  The great Cambridge-Concord circle of the middle of the
  nineteenth century - Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, Holmes, the
  Alcotts - were sentimental reflections of Europe, and they left
  no school, no influence. Whitman and Thoreau and Poe and, in some
  degree, Hawthorne, were outcasts, men alone and despised, berated
  by the New Humanists of their generation. It was with the
  emergence of William Dean Howells that we first began to have
  something like a standard, and a very bad standard it was.<br>
  <br>
  Mr. Howells was one of the gentlest, sweetest, and most honest of
  men, but he had the code of a pious old maid whose greatest
  delight was to have tea at the vicarage. He abhorred not only
  profanity and obscenity but all of what H. G. Wells has called
  &laquo;the jolly coarsenesses of life&raquo;. In his fantastic
  vision of life, which he innocently conceived to be realistic,
  farmers, and seamen and factory hands might exist, but the farmer
  must never be covered with muck, the seaman must never roll out
  bawdy chanteys, the factory hand must be thankful to his good
  kind employer, and all of them must long for the opportunity to
  visit Florence and smile gently at the quaintness of the
  beggars.<br>
  <br>
  So strongly did Howells feel this genteel, this New Humanistic
  philosophy that he was able vastly to influence his
  contemporaries, down even to 1914 and the turmoil of the Great
  War.<br>
  <br>
  He was actually able to tame Mark Twain, perhaps the greatest of
  our writers, and to put that fiery old savage into an
  intellectual frock coat and top hat. His influence is not
  altogether gone today. He is still worshipped by Hamlin Garland,
  an author who should in every way have been greater than Howells
  but who under Howells' influence was changed from a harsh and
  magnificent realist into a genial and insignificant lecturer. Mr.
  Garland is, so far as we have one, the dean of American letters
  today, and as our dean, he is alarmed by all of the younger
  writers who are so lacking in taste as to suggest that men and
  women do not always love in accordance with the prayer-book, and
  that common people sometimes use language which would be
  inappropriate at a women's literary club on Main Street. Yet this
  same Hamlin Garland, as a young man, before he had gone to Boston
  and become cultured and Howellsised, wrote two most valiant and
  revelatory works of realism, <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> and
  <i>Rose of Dutcher's Coolie</i>.<br>
  <br>
  I read them as a boy in a prairie village in Minnesota just such
  an environment as was described in Mr. Garland's tales. They were
  vastly exciting to me. I had realized in reading Balzac and
  Dickens that it was possible to describe French and English
  common people as one actually saw them. But it had never occurred
  to me that one might without indecency write of the people of
  Sauk Centre, Minnesota, as one felt about them. Our fictional
  tradition, you see, was that all of us in Midwestern villages
  were altogether noble and happy; that not one of us would
  exchange the neighborly bliss of living on Main Street for the
  heathen gaudiness of New York or Paris or Stockholm. But in Mr.
  Garland's <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> I discovered that there was
  one man who believed that Midwestern peasants were sometimes
  bewildered and hungry and vile - and heroic. And, given this
  vision, I was released; I could write of life as living
  life.<br>
  <br>
  I am afraid that Mr. Garland would be not pleased but acutely
  annoyed to know that he made it possible for me to write of
  America as I see it, and not as Mr. William Dean Howells so
  sunnily saw it. And it is his tragedy, it is a completely
  revelatory American tragedy, that in our land of freedom, men
  like Garland, who first blast the roads to freedom, become
  themselves the most bound.<br>
  <br>
  But, all this time, while men like Howells were so effusively
  seeking to guide America into becoming a pale edition of an
  English cathedral town, there were surly and authentic fellows -
  Whitman and Melville, then Dreiser and James Huneker and Mencken
  - who insisted that our land had something more than tea-table
  gentility.<br>
  <br>
  And so, without standards, we have survived. And for the strong
  young men, it has perhaps been well that we should have no
  standards. For, after seeming to be pessimistic about my own and
  much beloved land, I want to close this dirge with a very lively
  sound of optimism.<br>
  <br>
  I have, for the future of American literature, every hope and
  every eager belief. We are coming out, I believe, of the
  stuffiness of safe, sane, and incredibly dull provincialism.
  There are young Americans today who are doing such passionate and
  authentic work that it makes me sick to see that I am a little
  too old to be one of them.<br>
  <br>
  There is Ernest Hemingway, a bitter youth, educated by the most
  intense experience, disciplined by his own high standards, an
  authentic artist whose home is in the whole of life; there is
  Thomas Wolfe, a child of, I believe, thirty or younger, whose one
  and only novel, <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>, is worthy to be
  compared with the best in our literary production, a Gargantuan
  creature with great gusto of life; there is Thornton Wilder, who
  in an age of realism dreams the old and lovely dreams of the
  eternal romantics; there is John Dos Passos, with his hatred of
  the safe and sane standards of Babbitt and his splendor of
