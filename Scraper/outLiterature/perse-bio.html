  <h1>Saint-John Perse - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="perse.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Saint-John Perse</b>, born in 1887,
  pseudonym for Alexis Saint-L&eacute;ger L&eacute;ger, came from an
  old Bourguignon family which settled in the French Antilles in
  the seventeenth century and returned to France at the end of the
  nineteenth century. Perse studied law at Bordeaux and, after
  private studies in political science, went into the diplomatic
  service in 1914. There he had a brilliant career. He served first
  in the Peking embassy, and later in the Foreign Office where he
  held top positions under Aristide Briand and became its
  administrative head.<br>
  <br>
  He left France for the United States in 1940 and was deprived of
  his citizenship and possessions by the Vichy regime. From 1941 to
  1945, he was literary adviser to the Library of Congress. After the war he did not
  resume his diplomatic career and, in 1950, retired officially
  with the title of <i>Ambassadeur de France.</i> He has made the
  United States his permanent residence.<br>
  <br>
  His literary work was published partly under his own name, but
  chiefly under the pseudonyms St. J. Perse and Saint-John Perse.
  After various poems that reflect the impressions of his
  childhood, he wrote <i>Anabase</i> (Anabasis), 1924, while in
  China. It is an epic poem which puzzled many critics and gave
  rise to the suggestion that it could be understood better by an
  Asian than by a Westerner. Much of his work was written after he
  settled in the United States: <i>Exil</i> (Exile), 1942, in which
  man and poet merge and imagery and diction are fully mastered;
  <i>Po&egrave;me l'Etrang&egrave;re</i> (Poem to a Foreign Lady),
  1943; <i>Pluies</i> (Rains), 1943; <i>Neiges</i> (Snows), 1944;
  <i>Vents</i> (Winds), 1946, which are the winds of war and peace
  that blow within as well as outside of man; <i>Amers</i>
  (Seamarks), 1957, wherein the sea redounds as an image of the
  timelessness of man; and his abstract epic, <i>Chronique</i> (Chronicle), 1960.</p>
