  <h1>Eugenio Montale - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="montale.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Eugenio Montale</b>, born in 1896, is
  one of the few obvious "true masters" of the last fifty years of
  Italian literature. Born in Genoa into a family of businessmen,
  he discontinued his secondary studies and started, on a private
  basis, to study singing with the baritone Ernesto Sivori. But the
  1915-18 war (in which he served as an infantry officer), the
  death of Sivori and his decision to go in for a literary career,
  turned Montale away from that course, in which he had shown an
  extraordinary interest in melodrama, even its technical aspects.
  When he started to devote himself to poetry, he was already in
  possession of a rich and versatile culture and a taste for
  Bellini's and Debussy's music, impressionist painting and the art
  of the great novelists of nineteenth-century Europe, at the same
  time sharing the interests of the Ligurian poets
  Roccatagliata-Cecardi, Boine and Sbarbaro. However, the
  "regional" outlook of the poetry of his time was not allowed to
  limit the critical attention that he paid to Leopardi and
  Foscolo. It was not until after the war that the poet dedicated
  himself fully to creative activities and literature. In 1921, he
  contributed to "Primo Tempo", with Solmi and Debenedetti,
  revealing, besides his poetic gifts, a rare critical talent
  through his acuteness and independence of conventional patterns.
  His <i>Omaggio a Svevo</i>, published in 1925 in the Milanese
  paper "L'Esame", aroused much attention, determining, among other
  things, the fortune of the works of the Triestine writer.<br>
  <br>
  Montale settled down in Florence in 1928, where he became
  director of the Gabinetto Vieusseux library. He was one of the
  first inspirers of "Solaria", always being one of the most active
  and politically non-conformist Florentine intellectuals until, in
  1938, refusing to join the party then in power, he was dismissed
  from his directorship at the Gabinetto Vieusseux.<br>
  <br>
  In 1925, he published his first collection of poems, <i>Ossi di
  seppia</i>, which quickly became one of the "classics" of
  contemporary Italian poetry; in his verses, sentiment appears
  desiccated by a severe intellectual rigour, evoked with intimate
  fullness in the fervid and striking sights of the Mediterranean
  landscape. Some critics aptly saw in <i>Ossi di seppia</i> a
  singular introspective continuity, as in a great modern novel,
  linked to the story of the protagonist, finding its most
  developed form in the poem "Arsenio".<br>
  <br>
  When <i>Le occasioni</i> (1939) was published, it brought
  consistent confirmation of this inner line of development which,
  bearing a new classical-modern imprint, identified itself with
  the great contemporary metaphysical poetry. In <i>Le
  occasioni</i>, Italian poetry and culture as a whole were, from
  then on, to recognise a book that reflected the solitude and the
  agony over the human condition of one who lucidly opposed Fascist
  oppression, creating a song of noble stoicism.<br>
  <br>
  Montale's biography is a chronicle of poetry. The Second World
  War saw the publication, in 1943, of <i>Finisterre</i>, a
  collection which, published in Lugano in two successive editions
  of modest print runs, constituted one of the cornerstones of the
  volume <i>La bufera e altro</i>, a consistent continuation of his
  whole work, printed in 1956. <i>La farfalla di Dinard</i> - which
  from the ninety-six pages of the 1956 edition was expanded, from
  one edition to another, into the 273 pages of the 1960 edition -
  showed Montale to be an original writer of autobiography and
  imaginative prose, almost a narrator, with malicious flashes of
  wit but with an elegiac spirit.<br>
  <br>
  In 1961, Montale was awarded an honorary degree at the University
  of Rome and shortly afterwards, at the universities of Milan,
  Cambridge,
  and Basel. In
  1967, President Saragat appointed him senator for life "in
  recognition of his distinguished achievements in the literary and
  artistic fields". This event relieved him, in a sense, of the
  obligation to go every day to the editorial office of the
  "Corriere della Sera", where he had been working as a music
  critic, editor and special correspondent since 1948. The
  following works, prose as well as poetry, confirmed the vitality
  of a writer who, true to the fundamental themes of his early
  career (the Universe marked by inevitable failure and pain as an
  existential stigma), managed to collect experiences and important
  moments from the spiritual transformations of our times. <i>Auto
  da f&eacute;</i> (1966 and 1972), <i>Fuori di casa</i> (1969 and
  1975) and <i>Quaderno di tradazioni</i> (1948 and 1975) are books
  that give an idea of the vastness of his interests and of the
  versatility of his talent, later confirmed by <i>La bufera e
  altro</i> (1970).<br>
  <br>
  In 1971, Mondadori published his fourth collection of poetry,
  <i>Satura</i>, which soon became a bestseller. The book,
  exhibiting the usual linguistic ambiguity typical of Montale,
  alludes to a poetry that disrupts its own and others' patterns,
  including, in a paradoxical manner, much more than is usual (even
  for Montale) to include in the stylistic and linguistic models of
  poetry: meditative solicitations, existential themes about man
  still in some way Christian and Western, a wisdom anything but
  senile, subtle and provocative humor in the face of a world that
  changes and proceeds along its tragic and mysterious route.<br>
  <br>
  Montale's great poetry, in actual fact, is born out of the search
  for those presences that reveal and liberate the hidden world,
  such as spectres and amulets. Not insusceptible to the stylistic
  lessons of Pascoli and Gozzano, nor to contemporaries writing in
  English, Montale has in his turn influenced younger Italian
  poets, even post-<i>Ermetismo</i> poets and
  experimentators.<br>
  <br>
  After a volume of cultural articles, <i>La farfalla di
  Dinard</i>, he published in 1973, still with Mondadori,
  <i>Diario</i> 1971-72, which contains more recent lyric poems,
  born of a moral meditation not very different from that which
  brought forth the poems of Satura.<br>
  <br>
  Attentive to the effects of history, Montale's poetry stands out
  as congenial to spirits that are aware of the consequences (of
  which, from many aspects, we have not yet seen the end) of the
  second world tragedy, which the writer saw as temporary
  reflections of an evil without origin and without end, according
  to a parable which makes him belong to the more conscious part of
  the European intellect.</p>
