  <h1>Mikhail Sholokhov - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sholokhov.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov</b>
  (1905-1984) was born in the land of the Cossacks, now known as
  the Kamenskaya region of the R.S.F.S.R. He attended several high
  schools until 1918. During the civil war he fought on the side of
  the revolutionaries, and in 1922 he moved to Moscow to become a
  journalist. There he published a number of short stories in
  newspapers. He made his literary debut in 1926 with a volume of
  stories, <i>Donskie rasskazy</i> (Tales from the Don), 1926,
  about the Cossacks of his native region, to which he had returned
  two years earlier.<br>
  <br>
  In the same year, 1926, Sholokhov began writing <i>Tikhi Don</i>
  (And Quiet Flows the Don), 1928-1940, which matured slowly and
  took him fourteen years to complete. Reminiscent of Tolstoy in
  its vividly realistic scenes, its stark character descriptions
  and, above all, its vast panorama of the revolutionary period,
  Sholokhov's epic became the most read work of Soviet fiction.
  Deeply interested in human destinies which are played against the
  background of the transformations and troubles in Russia, he
  unites in his work the artistic heritage of Tolstoy and Gogol
  with a new vision introduced into Russian literature by Maxim
  Gorky.<br>
  <br>
  His other major work in the Don cycle, <i>Podnyataya tselina</i>
  (Virgin Soil Upturned), 1932 and 1959, deals in part with the
  collectivization of the Don area. There are a number of works
  such as the short story <i>Sudba cheloveka</i> (The Fate of a
  Man), 1957 - made into a popular Russian film - which treat the
  power and the resilience of human love under adversity. His
  collected works, <i>Sobranie sochineny</i>, were published in
  eight volumes between 1956 and 1960. In 1932 Sholokhov joined the
  Communist Party and, on several occasions, has been a delegate to
  the Supreme Soviets. In 1939 he became a member of the Soviet
  Academy of Sciences and later vice president of the Association
  of Soviet Writers.</p>
