  <h1>Thomas Mann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mann.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born in L&uuml;beck on June 6, 1875, the second 
              son of a merchant and senator of the Free City, Johann Heinrich 
              Mann, and his wife Julia da Silva Bruhns. My father was the grandson 
              and great-grandson of L&uuml;beck citizens, but my mother first 
              saw the light of day in Rio de Janeiro as the daughter of a German 
              plantation owner and a Portuguese-Creole Brazilian. She was taken 
              to Germany at the age of seven.</p>
			  
              <p>I was designated to take over my father's grain firm, which commemorated 
              its centenary during my boyhood, and I attended the science division 
              of the &laquo;Katharineum&raquo; at L&uuml;beck. I loathed school 
              and up to the very end failed to meet its requirements, owing to 
              an innate and paralyzing resistance to any external demands, which 
              I later learned to correct only with great difficulty. Whatever 
              education I possess I acquired in a free and autodidactic manner. 
              Official instruction failed to instill in me any but the most rudimentary 
              knowledge.</p>
			  
              <p>When I was fifteen, my father died, a comparatively young man. The 
              firm was liquidated. A little later my mother left the town with 
              the younger children in order to settle in the south of Germany, 
              in Munich.</p>
			  
              <p>After finishing school rather ingloriously, I followed her and for 
              the time being became a clerk in the office of a Munich insurance 
              company whose director had been a friend of my father's. Later, 
              by way of preparing for a career in journalism, I attended lectures 
              in history, economics, art history, and literature at the university 
              and the polytechnic. In between I spent a year in Italy with my 
              brother Heinrich, my elder by four years. During this time my first 
              collection of short stories, <i>Der kleine Herr Friedemann</i> (1898) 
              [<i>Little Herr Friedemann</i>], was published. In Rome, I also 
              began to write the novel <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, which appeared in 
              1901 and which since then has been such a favourite with the German 
              public that today over a million copies of it are in circulation.</p>
			  
              <p>There followed shorter stories, collected in the volume <i>Tristan</i> 
              (1903), of which the North-South artist's novella <i>Tonio Kroger</i> 
              is usually considered the most characteristic, and also the Renaissance 
              dialogues <i>Fiorenza</i> (1906), a closet drama which, however, 
              has occasionally been staged.</p>
			  
              <p>In 1905 I married the daughter of Alfred Pringsheim, who had the 
              chair of mathematics at the University of Munich. On her mother's 
              side my wife is the granddaughter of Ernst and Hedwig Dohm, the 
              well-known Berlin journalist and his wife, who played a leading 
              role in the German movement for women's emancipation. From our marriage 
              have come six children: three girls, of whom the eldest has gone 
              into the theatre, and three boys, of whom the eldest has also devoted 
              himself to literature.</p>
			  
              <p>The first literary fruit of my new status was the novel <i>K&ouml;nigliche 
              Hoheit</i> (1909) [<i>Royal Highness</i>], a court story that provides 
              the frame for a psychology of the formal-representative life and 
              for moral questions such as the reconciliation of an aristocratic, 
              melancholic consciousness with the demands of the community. Another 
              novelistic project followed, the <i>Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers 
              Felix Krull</i> (1922) [<i>Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence 
              Man</i>]. It is based on an idea of parody, that of taking an element 
              of venerable tradition, of the Goethean, self-stylizing, autobiographic, 
              and aristocratic confession, and translating it into the sphere 
              of the humorous and the criminal. The novel has remained a fragment, 
              but there are connoisseurs who consider its published sections my 
              best and most felicitous achievement. Perhaps it is the most personal 
              thing I have written, for it represents my attitude toward tradition, 
              which is simultaneously loving and destructive and has dominated 
              me as a writer.</p>
			  
              <p>In 1913 the novella <i>Tod in Venedig</i> [<i>Death in Venice</i>] 
              was published, which beside <i>Tonio Kroger</i> is considered my 
              most valid achievement in that genre. While I was writing its final 
              sections I conceived the idea of the &laquo;Bildungsroman&raquo; 
              <i>Der Zauberberg</i> (1924) [<i>The Magic Mountain</i>], but work 
              on it was interrupted in the very beginning by the war.</p>
			  
              <p>Although the war did not make any immediate demands on me physically, 
              while it lasted it put a complete stop to my artistic activity because 
              it forced me into an agonizing reappraisal of my fundamental assumptions, 
              a human and intellectual self-inquiry that found its condensation 
              in <i>Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen</i> [<i>Reflections of an 
              Unpolitical Man</i>], published in 1918. Its subject is the personally 
              accented problem of being German, <i>the</i> political problem, 
              treated in the spirit of a polemical conservatism that underwent 
              many revisions as life went on. An account of the development of 
              my socio-moral ideas is found in the volumes of essays <i>Rede und 
              Antwort</i> (1922) [Question and Answer], Bem&uuml;hungen (1925) 
              [Efforts], and <i>Die Forderung des Tages</i> (1930) [<i>Order of 
              fhe Day</i>].</p>
			  
              <p>Lecture tours abroad began immediately after the borders of countries 
              neutral or hostile during the war had been re-opened. They led me 
              first to Holland, Switzerland, and Denmark. The spring of 1923 saw 
              a journey to Spain. In the following year I was guest of honour 
              of the newly established PEN Club in London; two years later I accepted 
              an invitation of the French branch of the Carnegie Foundation, and 
              I visited Warsaw in 1927.</p>
			  
              <p>Meanwhile, in the autumn of 1924, after many prolonged delays the 
              two volumes of <i>Der Zauberberg</i> were published. The interest 
              of the public, as revealed by the hundred printings the book ran 
              into within a few years, proved that I had chosen the most favourable 
              moment to come to the fore with this composition of ideas epically 
              conceived. The problems of the novel did not essentially appeal 
              to the masses, but they were of consuming interest to the educated, 
              and the distress of the times had increased the receptivity of the 
              public to a degree that favoured my product, which so wilfully played 
              fast and loose with the form of the novel.</p>
			  
              <p>Soon after the completion of the <i>Betrachtungen</i> I added to 
              my longer narratives a prose idyll, the animal story <i>Herr und 
              Hund</i> (1919) [<i>Bashan and I</i>]. <i>Der Zauberberg</i> was 
              followed by a bourgeois novella from the period of revolution and 
              inflation, <i>Unordnung und fr&uuml;hes Leid</i> (1926) [<i>Disorder 
              and Early Sorrow</i>]; <i>Mario und der Zauberer</i> [<i>Mario and 
              the Magician</i>], written in 1929, is for the time being my last 
              attempt at compositions of this size. It was written during my work 
              on a new novel which in subject matter and intention is far different 
              from all earlier works, for it leaves behind the bourgeois individual 
              sphere and enters into that of the past and myth. The Biblical story 
              for which the title <i>Joseph und seine Br&uuml;der</i> is planned, 
              and of which individual sections have been made known through public 
              readings and publications in journals, seems about half completed. 
              A study trip connected with it led me to Egypt and Palestine in 
              February-March-April, 1930.</p>
			  
              <p>Ever since his early days the author of this biographical sketch 
              has been encouraged in his endeavours by the kind interest of his 
              fellow men as well as by official honours. An example is the conferment 
              of an honorary doctor's degree by the University of Bonn in 1919; and, 
              to satisfy the German delight in title, the Senate of L&uuml;beck, 
              my home town, added the title of professor on the occasion of a 
              city anniversary. I am one of the first members, nominated by the 
              state itself, of the new literary division of the Prussian Academy 
              of Arts; my fiftieth birthday was accompanied by expressions of 
              public affection that I can remember only with emotion, and the 
              summit of all these distinctions has been the award of the Nobel 
              Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy last year. But I may 
              say that no turmoil of success has ever dimmed the clear apprehension 
              of the relativity of my deserts or even for a moment dulled the 
              edge of my self-criticism. The value and significance of my work 
              for posterity may safely be left to the future; for me they are 
              nothing but the personal traces of a life led consciously, that 
              is, conscientiously.</p>

  <p><b>Biographical note on Thomas Mann</b></p>

  <p>Thomas Mann (1875-1955) moved to
  Switzerland in 1933 shortly after the Nazis had come to power and
  begun a campaign of abuse against him. He was formally
  expatriated in 1936. In 1937 the University of Bonn deprived him
  of his honorary doctorate (restored in 1946), which aroused Mann
  to a famous and moving reply in which he epitomized the situation
  of the German writer in exile. Mann, who had anticipated and
  warned against the rise of fascism during the Weimar Republic
  (e.g., in <i>Mario and the Magician</i>), continued to combat it
  in many pamphlets and talks throughout the period of the Nazi
  regime and the Second World War. He became an American citizen in
  1940 and, from 1941 to 1953, lived in Santa Monica, California.
  After the war he frequently revisited Europe: in 1949 he received
  the Goethe Prizes of Weimar (East Germany) and Frankfurt (West
  Germany), but when he finally returned to Europe he settled near
  Z&uuml;rich, where he died in 1955.<br>
  <br>
  Among the chief works of Mann's later years are the novels
  <i>Lotte in Weimar</i> (1939) [<i>The Beloved Returns</i>], in
  which the fictional account of a meeting of the lovers of
  <i>Werther</i> grown old provides the framework for a
  psychologically and technically ingenious portrait of the old
  Goethe; <i>Joseph und seine Br&uuml;der</i> (1933-43) [<i>Joseph
  and his Brothers</i>], a version of the Old Testament story which
  interweaves myth and psychology; and <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (1947),
  the story of an artist who chooses to pay with self-destruction
  for the powers of genius, a fate that echoes the last days of the
  Third Reich; the collections of essays <i>Leiden und Gr&ouml;sse
  der Meister</i> (1935)[ Suffering and Greatness of the Masters];
  and the essay on Schiller, <i>Versuch &uuml;ber Schiller</i>
  (1955). A complete edition of his works in twelve volumes was
  published in Berlin (1956) and in Frankfurt (1960).</p>
