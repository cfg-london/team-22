  <h1>Patrick White - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="white.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on May 28th 1912 in
  Knightsbridge, London, to Australian parents. Victor White was
  then forty-two, his wife, Ruth Withycombe, ten years younger.
  When I was six months old my parents returned to Australia and
  settled in Sydney, principally because my mother could not face
  the prospect of too many sisters-in-law on the property, in which
  my father had an interest, with three older brothers. Both my
  father's and my mother's families were yeoman-farmer stock from
  Somerset, England. My great-grandfather White had emigrated to
  New South Wales in 1826, as a flockmaster, and received a grant
  of crown land in the Upper Hunter Valley. None of my ancestors
  was distinguished enough to be remembered, though there is a
  pleasing legend that a Withycombe was fool to Edward II. My
  Withycombe grandfather emigated later in the nineteenth century.
  After his marriage with an Australian, he and my grandmother
  sailed for England, but returned when my mother was a year old.
  Grandfather Withycombe seems to have found difficulty in
  settling; he drifted from one property to another, finally dying
  near Muswellbrook on the Upper Hunter. My father and mother were
  second cousins, though they did not meet till shortly before
  their marriage. The Withycombes enjoyed less material success
  than the Whites, which perhaps accounted for my mother's sense of
  her own superiority in White circles. Almost all the Whites
  remained wedded to the land, and there was something peculiar,
  even shocking, about any member of the family who left it. To
  become any kind of artist would have been unthinkable. Like
  everybody else I was intended for the land, though, vaguely, I
  knew this was not to be.<br>
  <br>
  My childhood was a sickly one. It was found that I was suffering
  from nothing worse than asthma, but even so, nobody would insure
  my life. As a result of the asthma I was sent to school in the
  country, and only visited Sydney for brief, violently asthmatic
  sojourns on my way to a house we owned in the Blue Mountains.
  Probably induced by the asthma, I started reading and writing
  early on, my literary efforts from the age of about nine running
  chiefly to poetry and plays. When thirteen I was uprooted from
  Australia and put at school at Cheltenham, England, as my mother
  was of the opinion that what is English is best, and my father,
  though a chauvinistic Australian, respected most of her caprices.
  After seeing me 'settled' in my English prison, my parents and
  sister left for Australia. In spite of holidays when I was free
  to visit London theatres and explore the countryside, I spent
  four very miserable years as a colonial at an English school. My
  parents returned for the long holiday when I was sixteen, and
  there were travels in Europe, including Scandinavia. Norway and
  Sweden made a particular impression on me as I had discovered
  Ibsen and Strindberg in my early teens - a taste my English
  housemaster deplored: 'You have a morbid kink I mean to stamp
  out'; and he then proceeded to stamp it deeper in.<br>
  <br>
  When I was rising eighteen I persuaded my parents to let me
  return to Australia and at least see whether I could adapt myself
  to life on the land before going up to Cambridge. For two years I
  worked as jackeroo, first in the mountainous southern New South
  Wales, which became for me the bleakest place on earth, then on
  the property of a Withycombe uncle in the flat, blistering north,
  plagued alternately by drought and flood. I can remember swimming
  my horse through floodwaters to fetch the mail, and enjoying a
  dish of stewed nettles during a dearth of vegetables. The life in
  itself was not uncongenial, but the talk was endlessly of wool
  and weather. I developed the habit of writing novels behind a
  closed door, or at my uncle's, on the dining table. More
  reprehensible still, after being a colonial at my English school,
  I was now a 'Pom' in the ears of my fellow countrymen. I hardly
  dared open my mouth, and welcomed the opportunity of escaping to
  King's College,
  Cambridge.
  Even if a university should turn out to be another version of a
  school, I had decided I could lose myself afterwards as an
  anonymous particle of the London I already loved.<br>
  <br>
  In fact I enjoyed every minute of my life at King's, especially
  the discovery of French and German literature. Each vacation I
  visited either France or Germany to improve my languages. I wrote
  fitfully, bad plays, worse poetry. Then, after taking my degree,
  the decision had to be made: what to do? It was embarrassing to
  announce that I meant to stay in London and become a writer when
  I had next to nothing to show. To my surprise, my bewildered
  father, who read little beyond newspapers and stud-books, and to
  whom I could never say a word if we found ourselves stranded
  alone in a room, agreed to let me have a small allowance on which
  to live while trying to write.<br>
  <br>
  At this period of my life I was in love with the theatre and was
  in and out of it three or four nights of the week. I tried
  unsuccessfully to get work behind the scenes. I continued writing
  the bad plays which fortunately nobody would produce, just as no
  one did me the unkindness of publishing my early novels. A few
  sketches and lyrics appeared in topical revues, a few poems were
  printed in literary magazines. Then, early in 1939, a novel I had
  managed to finish, called <i>Happy Valley</i>, was published in
  London, due to the fact that Geoffrey Grigson, the poet, then
  editor of the magazine <i>New Verse</i> which had accepted one of
  my poems, was also reader for a publishing firm. This novel,
  although derivative and in many ways inconsiderably, was received
  well enough by the critics to make me feel I had become a writer.
  I left for New York expecting to repeat my success, only to be
  turned down by almost every publisher in that city, till the
  Viking Press, my American publishers of a lifetime, thought of
  taking me on.<br>
  <br>
  This exhilarating personal situation was somewhat spoilt by the
  outbreak of war. During the early, comparatively uneventful
  months I hovered between London and New York writing too
  hurriedly a second novel, <i>The Living and the Dead</i>. In 1940
  I was commissioned as an air force intelligence officer in spite
  of complete ignorance of what I was supposed to do. After a few
  hair-raising weeks amongst the RAF greats at Fighter Command I
  was sent zigzagging from Greenland to the Azores in a Liverpool
  cargo boat with a gaggle of equally raw intelligence officers,
  till finally we landed on the Gold Coast, to be flown by exotic
  stages to Cairo, in an aeroplane out of Jules Verne.<br>
  <br>
  The part I played in the war was a pretty insignificant one. My
  work as an operational intelligence officer was at most useful.
  Much of the time was spent advancing or retreating across
  deserts, sitting waiting in dust-ridden tents, or again in that
  other desert, a headquarters. At least I saw something of almost
  every country in the Middle East. Occasionally, during those
  years bombs or gunfire created what should have been a reality,
  but which in fact made reality seem more remote. I was unable to
  write, and this finally became the explanation of my state of
  mind: my flawed self has only ever felt intensely alive in the
  fictions I create.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the most important moments of my war were when, in the
  western desert of Egypt, I conceived the idea of one day writing
  a novel about a megalomaniac German, probably an explorer in
  nineteenth century Australia, and when I met my Greek friend,
  Manoly Lascaris, who has remained the mainstay of my life and
  work.<br>
  <br>
  After demobilisation we decided to come to Australia where we
  bought a farm at Castle Hill outside Sydney. During the war I had
  thought with longing of the Australian landscape. This, and the
  graveyard of postwar London, and the ignoble desire to fill my
  belly, drove me to burn my European bridges. In the meantime, in
  London, in Alexandria on the way out, and on the decks of liners,
  I was writing <i>The Aunt's Story</i>. It was exhilarating to be
  free to express myself again, but nobody engaged in sorting
  themselves out of the rubble left by a world war could take much
  interest in novels. Australians, who were less involved, were
  also less concerned. Most of them found the book unreadable, just
  as our speech was unintelligible during those first years at
  Castle Hill. I had never felt such a foreigner. The failure of
  <i>The Aunt's Story</i> and the need to learn a language afresh
  made me wonder whether I should ever write another word. Our
  efforts at farming - growing fruit, vegetables, flowers, breeding
  dogs and goats, were amateurish, but consuming. The hollow in
  which we lived, or perhaps the pollen from the paspalum which was
  always threatening to engulf us, or the suspicion that my life
  had taken a wrong turning, encouraged the worst attacks of asthma
  I had so far experienced. In the eighteen years we spent at
  Castle Hill, enslaved more than anything by the trees we had
  planted, I was in and out of hospitals. Then about 1951 I began
  writing again, painfully, a novel I called in the beginning <i>A
  Life Sentence on Earth</i>, but which developed into <i>The Tree
  of Man</i>. Well received in England and the United States, it
  was greeted with cries of scorn and incredulity in Australia that
  somebody, at best, a dubious Australian, should flout the
  naturalistic tradition, or worse, that a member of the grazier
  class should aspire to a calling which was the prerogative of
  schoolteachers! <i>Voss</i>, which followed, fared no better: it
  was 'mystical, ambiguous, obscure'; a newspaper printed its
  review under the headline 'Australia's most Unreadable Novelist'.
  <i>In Riders in the Chariot</i> it was the scene in which
  Himmelfarb, the Jewish refugee, is subjected to a mock
  crucifixion by drunken workmates which outraged the blokes and
  the bluestockings alike. Naturally, 'it couldn't happen here'-
  except that it does, in all quarters, in many infinitely
  humiliating ways, as I, a foreigner in my own country, learned
  from personal experience.<br>
  <br>
  A number of Australians, however, discovered they were able to
  read a reprint of <i>The Aunt's Story</i>, a book which had
  baffled them when first published after the war, and by the time
  <i>The Solid Mandala</i> appeared, it was realised I might be
  something they had to put up with.<br>
  <br>
  In 1964, submerged by the suburbs reaching farther into the
  country, we left Castle Hill, and moved into the centre of the
  city. Looking back, I must also have had an unconscious desire to
  bring my life full circle by returning to the scenes of my
  childhood, as well as the conscious wish to extend my range by
  writing about more sophisticated Australians, as I have done in
  <i>The Vivisector</i> and <i>The Eye of the Storm</i>. On the
  edge of Centennial Park, an idyllic landscape surrounded by a
  metropolis, I have had the best of both worlds. I have tried to
  celebrate the park, which means so much to so many of us, in
  <i>The Eye of the Storm</i> and in some of the shorter novels of
  <i>The Cockatoos</i>. Here I hope to continue living, and while I
  still have the strength, to people the Australian emptiness in
  the only way I am able.</p>
