  <h1>Andr&eacute; Gide - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gide.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Andr&eacute; Gide</b> (1869-1951) came
  from a family of Huguenots and recent converts to Catholicism. As
  a child he was often ill and his education at the &Eacute;cole
  Alsacienne was interrupted by long stays in the South, where he
  was instructed by private tutors. His <i>Les Cahiers d'Andr&eacute;
  Walter</i> (1891) [<i>The Notebooks of Andr&eacute; Walter</i>]
  opened the door to the symbolist literary circles of the day, but
  the decisive event of these years was a journey to Algeria, where
  a severe illness brought him to the verge of death and
  precipitated his revolt against his puritanical background.
  Henceforth his work lived on the never resolved tensions between
  a strict artistic discipline, a puritanical moralism, and the
  desire for unlimited sensual indulgence and abandonment to life.
  <i>Les Nourritures terrestres</i> (1897) [<i>Fruits of the
  Earth</i>], the drama <i>Saul</i> (1903), and later <i>Le Retour
  de l'enfant prodigue</i> (1907) <i>[The Return of the
  Prodigal</i>], are the chief documents of his revolt.<br>
  <br>
  A result of Gide's revolt was the unprecedented freedom with
  which he wrote about sexual matters in <i>Corydon</i> (privately
  published 1911, public version 1924), his autobiography <i>Si le
  grain ne meurt</i> (1924) [<i>If It Die ...</i>], and Gide's
  lifelong diary <i>Journal 1889 &agrave; 1939</i> (1939), <i>Journal
  1939 &agrave; 1942</i> (1948), and <i>Journal 1942 &agrave; 1949</i>
  (1950).<br>
  <br>
  Gide divided his narrative works into <i>soties</i> such as
  <i>Les Caves du Vatican</i> (1914) [<i>Lafcadio's Adventures</i>]
  and classically restrained r&eacute;cits, for example, <i>La Porte
  &eacute;troite</i> (1909) [<i>Strait is the Gate</i>] and <i>La
  Symphonie pastorale</i> (1919). The only work which he considered
  a novel was the structurally complex and experimental <i>Les Faux
  Monnayeurs</i> (1926) [<i>The Counterfeiters</i>].<br>
  <br>
  Until the twenties Gide was known chiefly in avant-garde and
  esoteric literary circles (he was one of the founders of <i>La
  Nouvelle Revue Fran&ccedil;aise</i>), but in his later years he
  became a highly influential, although always controversial
  figure. He travelled widely. His trip to the Congo led to a
  scathing report on economic abuses by French firms and resulted
  in reforms. If in the thirties Gide put off one part of the
  public by his sympathies with communism, his disillusioned report
  of his journey to Russia, <i>Le Retour de L'U.R.S.S</i> (1936),
  scandalized another. Gide's interests went far beyond the
  confines of French literature. He translated Shakespeare,
  Whitman, Conrad, and Rilke. He was an influential literary critic
  (<i>Pr&eacute;textes</i>, 1903; <i>Nouveaux Pr&eacute;textes</i>,
  1911) and was especially attracted to problematic writers like
  Dostoevsky, about whom he wrote a book (1923).<br>
  <br>
  Among Gide's last work was Th&eacute;s&eacute;e (1946), like the
  earlier Oedipe (1931) the reworking of an old myth. Gide's
  collected works have been published in fifteen volumes
  (1933-39).</p>
