  <h1>Gabriela Mistral - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mistral.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Gabriela Mistral</b> (1889-1957),
  pseudonym for Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga, was born in Vicu&ntilde;a,
  Chile. The daughter of a dilettante poet, she began to write
  poetry as a village schoolteacher after a passionate romance with
  a railway employee who committed suicide. She taught elementary
  and secondary school for many years until her poetry made her
  famous. She played an important role in the educational systems
  of Mexico and Chile, was active in cultural committees of the
  League of Nations, and was Chilean consul in Naples, Madrid, and
  Lisbon. She held honorary degrees from the Universities of
  Florence and
  Guatemala and was an honorary member of various cultural
  societies in Chile as well as in the United States, Spain, and
  Cuba. She taught Spanish literature in the United States at
  Columbia
  University, Middlebury College, Vassar College, and at the University of Puerto
  Rico.<br>

  The love poems in memory of the dead, <i>Sonetos de la muerte</i>
  (1914), made her known throughout Latin America, but her first
  great collection of poems, <i>Desolaci&oacute;n</i> [Despair], was
  not published until 1922. In 1924 appeared <i>Ternura</i>
  [Tenderness], a volume of poetry dominated by the theme of
  childhood; the same theme, linked with that of maternity, plays a
  significant role in <i>Tala</i>, poems published in 1938. Her
  complete poetry was published in 1958.</p>
