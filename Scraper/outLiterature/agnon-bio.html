  <h1>Shmuel Agnon - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="agnon.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Shmuel Yosef Agnon</b> (1888-1970) was
  born in Buczacz, Eastern Galicia. Raised in a mixed cultural
  atmosphere, in which Yiddish was the language of the home, and
  Hebrew the language of the Bible and the Talmud which he studied
  formally until the age of nine, Agnon also acquired a knowledge
  of German literature from his mother, and of the teachings of
  Maimonides and of the Hassidim from his father. In 1907 he left
  home and made his way to Palestine, where, except for an extended
  stay in Germany from 1913 to 1924, he has remained to this
  day.<br>
  <br>
  At an early age, Agnon began writing the stories which form a
  chronicle of the decline of Jewry in Galicia. Included among
  these is his first major publication, <i>Hakhnasat Kalah</i> (The
  Bridal Canopy), 1922, which re-creates the golden age of
  Hassidism, and his apocalyptic novel, <i>Oreach Nata Lalun</i> (A
  Guest for the Night), 1939, which vividly depicts the ruin of
  Galicia after the First World War. Nearly all of his other
  writings are set in his adopted Palestine and deal with the
  replacement of the early Jewish settlement of that country by the
  more organized Zionist movement after the Second World War. The
  early pioneer immigrants are portrayed in his epic <i>Temol
  Shilshom</i> (Only Yesterday), 1945, considered his greatest
  work, and also in the nightmarish stories of <i>Sefer
  Hamaasim</i> (The Book of Deeds), 1932.<br>
  <br>
  While these and other works such as <i>Pat Shlema</i> (A Whole
  Loaf), 1933, and <i>Shevuat Emunim</i> (Two Tales), 1943, are
  enough to assure his stature as the greatest living Hebrew
  writer, Agnon has also occupied himself with commentaries on the
  Jewish High Festival, <i>Yamin Noraim</i> (Days of Awe), 1938, on
  the giving of the Torah, <i>Atem Reitem</i> (Ye Have Seen), 1959,
  and on the gathering of Hassidic lore, <i>Sifreihem Shel
  Tzadikim</i> (Books of the Tzadikim), 1960-1961.</p>
