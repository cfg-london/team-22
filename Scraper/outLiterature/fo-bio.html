  <h1>Dario Fo - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="fo.jpg" class="bio-img">In addition to playwright, <b>Dario Fo</b>
  is also director, stage and costume designer, and on occasion he
  even composes the music for his plays.<br>
  <br>
  France Rame, his leading actress, has assisted in and contributed
  to the writing of many of the plays they have produced in their
  45 years of theatre together. She has also assumed the
  administrative and organizational responsibility for the Fo-Rame
  Company.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Franca Rame</b><br>
  Franca Rame was born in Parabiago, a small town in the Province
  of Milan. That she happened to be born there was pure chance: her
  family was performing in the town at the time. Her father
  Domenico, her mother Emilia and her brother, along with aunts,
  uncles, cousins and other actors and actresses hired on contract,
  were all part of a travelling theatre troupe touring the towns
  and villages of Lombardy and Piedmont.<br>
  <br>
  The Rame family's ties to the theatre are very old. Since the
  late 17th century, they have been actors, and puppet masters, as
  the occasion required.<br>
  <br>
  With the arrival of the cinema they shifted from puppet theatre
  to real theatre, enriched with all the "special effects" of the
  puppet theatre. They travelled from town to town, and were well
  received wherever they went.<br>
  <br>
  Even today, her personal success in theatre and television
  notwithstanding, people in these towns still often refer to
  Franca as "the daughter of Domenico Rame". In the best tradition
  of the Commedia dell'Arte, the family improvised its
  performances, drawing on a rich repertoire of tragic and comical
  situations and dialogues.<br>
  <br>
  They often opened in a new town - following a poll among the
  townspeople - with an enactment of the life of the local patron
  saint.<br>
  <br>
  The family's repertoire ranged from the biblical texts over
  Shakespeare to Chekhov and Pirandello; from Niccodemi to the
  great l9th century historical novels - especially those with a
  socialist or anticlerical bent. Often their performances included
  enactments of the lives of men such as Giordano Bruno, Arnaldo da
  Brescia and Galileo Galilei.<br>
  <br>
  Domenico Rame was the troupe's poet; a devout socialist, he often
  saw to it that the revenue from a performance was given in
  support of striking workers or used to build child-care
  facilities, or in other ways spent to improve the lives of the
  common people. The minutely documented records of this activity,
  which remains in the Rame-Fo archives, was probably maintained by
  Franca's mother Emilia Baldini, a school teacher and daughter of
  a municipal engineer in Bobbio.<br>
  <br>
  As a young school teacher, Emilia fell in love with Domenico -
  twenty years her senior - who was passing through Bobbio with his
  marionettes and puppets. She married him, against the strong
  wishes of her family, and together they continued to tour all of
  Lombardy. Emilia soon learned the trades of acting and costume
  designer. It was she who taught their four children to act and to
  move on the stage. She was an outstanding woman, meticulous in
  all her work and an excellent organizer. In the end it was she
  who carried the troupe on her shoulders.<br>
  <br>
  It was in this environment that Franca earned her apprenticeship.
  She has always felt at home on the stage because - as she says -
  "I was born there: I was only eight days old when I made my debut
  in my mother's arms [she played the new-born son of
  Genevi&egrave;ve of Brabant] ... I didn't say much that evening!
  "<br>
  <br>
  Some years later, in the 1950-51 theatre season, Franca -
  following the lead of her sister Pia - left the family and joined
  the company of Tino Scotti for a part in Marcello Marchesi's "Ghe
  pensi mi" at the Teatro Olimpia in Milan.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Dario Fo</b><br>
  Dario Fo was born on 24 March 1926 in San Giano, a small town on
  Lago Maggiore in the province of Varese. His family consisted of:
  his father Felice, socialist, station master and actor in an
  amateur theatre company; his mother Pina Rota, a woman of great
  imagination and talent (in the 1970s her autobiographical account
  "Il paese delle rane", telling the history of her home town, was
  published by Einaudi); his brother Fulvio and his sister Bianca;
  and his maternal grandfather, who had a farm in Lomellina, where
  young Dario spent his childhood vacations.<br>
  <br>
  During Dario's visits, his grandfather would travel around the
  countryside selling his produce from a big, horse-drawn wagon. To
  attract customers he would tell the most amazing stories, and in
  these stories he would insert news and anecdotes about local
  events. His satirical and timely chronicles earned him the
  nickname <i>Brist&igrave;n</i> (pepper seed). It was from his
  grandfather, sitting beside him on the big wagon, that Dario
  began to learn the rudiments of narrative rhythm.<br>
  <br>
  Dario spent his childhood moving from one town to another, as his
  father's postings were changed at the whim of the railway
  authorities. But even though the geography remained in a flux,
  the cultural setting was always the same. As the boy grew, he
  became schooled in the local narrative tradition. With growing
  passion, he would sit in the taverns or the <i>piazze</i> and
  listen tirelessly to the master glass-blowers and fishermen, who
  - in the oral tradition of the <i>fabulatore</i> - would swap
  tall tales, steeped in pungent political satire.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940 he moved to Milan (commuting from Luino) to study at the
  Brera Art Academy. After the war, he begins to study architecture
  at the Polytechnic, but interrupts his studies with only a few
  exams left to complete his degree.<br>
  <br>
  Towards the end of the war, Dario is conscripted into the army of
  the Salo republic. He manages to escape, and spends the last
  months of the war hidden in an attic store room. His parents are
  active in the resistance, his father organizing the smuggling of
  Jewish scientists and escaped British prisoners of war into
  Switzerland by train; his mother caring for wounded
  partisans.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the war, Dario returns to his studies at the
  Academy of Brera in Milan while attending courses in architecture
  at the Polytechnic, commuting each day from his home on Lago
  Maggiore.<br>
  <br>
  1945-41 he turns his attention to stage design and theatre
  d&eacute;cor. He begins to improvise monologues.<br>
  <br>
  He moves with his family to Milan. Mamma Fo, in order to help her
  husband put the three children through college, does her best as
  a shirt-maker.<br>
  <br>
  For the younger Fos, this is a period of ravenous reading.
  Gramsci and Marx are devoured along with American novelists and
  the first translations of Brecht, Mayakovsky and Lorca.<br>
  <br>
  In the immediate postwar years, Italian theatre undergoes a
  veritable revolution, pushed along mainly by the new phenomenon
  of <i>piccoli teatri</i> ["small theatres"] that play a key role
  in developing the idea of a "popular stage".<br>
  <br>
  Fo is captured by this effervescent movement and proves to be an
  insatiable theatregoer - even though he usually can't afford to
  buy a seat and has to stand through the performances. Mamma Fo
  keeps an open mind and an open house for her children's new
  acquaintances, among them Emilio Tadini, Alik Cavalieri, Piccoli,
  Vittorini, Morlotti, Treccani, Crepax, some of them already
  famous.<br>
  <br>
  During his architecture studies, while working as decorator and
  assistant architect, Dario begins to entertain his friends with
  tales as tall as those he heard in the lakeside taverns of his
  childhood.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer of 1950, Dario seeks out Franco Parenti who is
  enthralled by the young man's comical rendering of the parable of
  Cain and Abel, a satire in which Cain, <i>poer nano</i> ["poor
  little thing"], a miserable fool, is anything but evil. It's just
  that every time he tries, <i>poer nano,</i>to mimic the splendid,
  blond and blue-eyed Abel, he gets into trouble. After suffering
  one disaster after another, he finally goes crazy and kills the
  splendid Abel. Franco Parenti enthusiastically invites Fo to join
  his theatre company.<br>
  <br>
  Dario starts performing in Parenti's summer variety show. This is
  when he has his first "encounter" with Franca Rame - not in
  person, mind, but in the form of a photograph he sees at the home
  of some friends. He is thunderstruck!<br>
  <br>
  For a while he continues to work as assistant architect. But he
  soon decides to abandon his work and studies, disgusted by the
  corruption already rampant in the building sector.</p>

      Dario's courting technique is drastic: he pretends not to see
      Franca. After a couple of weeks of this, she grabs him

      a certain notoriety with his "poer nano" monologues,
      transmitted in 18 episodes. His innovative use of language
      subverts the rhetoric of "official" narrative. It is the
      first experiment with a narrative technique that combines
      re-examination of history with excursions into popular lore,
      a technique he is later to develop further with <b>"Mistero
      buffo"</b>. Created in this period are his grotesque
      renditions of the stories of Cain and Abel, Samson and
      Delilah, Abraham and Isaac, Romeo and Juliet, Moses, Othello,
      Rigoletto, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, King David, Nero and
      others.<br>
      The series is interrupted after the eighteenth show, as the

      Together with Franca Rame, Dario Fo is invited to write,
      direct and present <b>"Canzonissima"</b>, a highly popular TV
      show built around the national lottery, with a different host
      each year. Fo's and Rame's sketches become an issue for the
      entire nation, provoking wild controversy. For the first
      time, television is used to portray the lives and
      difficulties of common people: the work-related illness of a
      signal woman, bricklayers that fall to their death from the
      scaffolding, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The show is very successful; during broadcasts even taxi
      drivers stop working, and bars with televisions are smack
      full of people. RAI's management starts to get nervous. Cuts
      are demanded in texts that have already been approved. All
      hell breaks loose over a sketch with a Mafia theme that tells
      the story of a murdered journalist. Malagodi, a senator from
      Italy's Liberal Party, reports the sketch to the Italian
      Parliament's oversight committee for television, on the
      grounds that "the honour of the Sicilian people is insulted
      by the claim that there exists a criminal organization called
      the Mafia". (In 1985, Prime Minister Andreotti appoints
      Malagodi senator-for-life for his political services.) Fo and
      Rame also receive death threats, written with blood and
      delivered with the typical miniature, wooden coffin. The Fo
      family (including Franca's and Dario's seven-year old son) is
      placed under police protection.<br>
      <br>
      A fight begins with RAI about censorship. Just a few hours
      before the scheduled broadcast of the eighth programme in the
      series, RAI's management declares that further cuts must be
      made. Dario and Franca refuse and threaten to leave the
      programme. As <b>"Canzonissima"</b> is about to be aired it
      is still unclear what is going to happen. At the last minute
      RAI confirms the cuts. Dario and Franca walk off the show as
      a sign of protest.<br>
      <br>
      The support they receive for their act is overwhelming,
      including thousands of letters and telegrams. RAI is unable
      to find substitutes for Fo and Rame, as all who are asked to
      replace them follow the instructions of SAI (the Italian
      actors union) to turn down the offer.<br>
      <br>
      Fo and Rame face five law suits as a consequence and are
      ordered to pay several billion lire in damages. For 15 years
      they are banned by RAI from participating in either
      programmes or commercials on national radio or television (at

      Stalinism and of the social-democratic position of the
      Italian Communist Party, the tour is heavily sabotaged by the
      Party leadership. Some ten-odd performances are cancelled.
      The situation is very tense, Franca's planned opening at
      Milan's Union Hall is cancelled. Instead she is invited to
      play at the <b>"Circus Medini"</b>, a real circus with
      horses, tigers, lions and elephants, luckily all kept in
      cages around the tent. After some initial difficulties, the
      production can continue - thanks to support organized among
      the Party rank and file and among the extraparliamentary left
      - to enjoy great public success. Franca sends her Party card
      back to PCI Secretary Enrico Berlinguer (Dario has never been
      a member).<br>
      <br>
      Dario stages <b>"Mistero buffo" ["Mistero Buffo"]</b>. The
      performance takes the form of a lesson in the history of
      literature that departs from a questioning of school dogma,
      in particular the text-book interpretation of the earliest
      known text in Italian (<b>"Rosa fresca e aulentissima"</b>),
      in which the text's blatant - and scurrilous - allusion to
      the feminine genitalia is altogether censored. The actor
      reconstructs the language of the medieval jesters, reciting
      their monologues in such a way as to make them accessible to
      a wide audience today. The play is a terrific success; it
      even becomes necessary to stage it at sport arenas that can
      hold thousands. It is the play that more than any other
      establishes Fo's fame worldwide. More than 5000
      performances.<br>
