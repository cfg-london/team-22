  <h1>Sigrid Undset - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="undset.jpg" class="bio-img">My father's family came from
  &Oslash;sterdalen. The first ancestor of ours of whom anything at
  all was known was one Peder Halvorsen who, in 1730, lived in
  Grytdalen in the Sollien valley of the river Atna where some men
  from &Oslash;sterdalen had been allowed to settle and farm the
  land. My father's folk remained there until my grandfather,
  Halvor Halvorsen, came to Trondhjem as a non-commissioned officer
  and became warden of a workhouse. He took the name of Undset from
  a hamlet in which my grandmother had lived when she became a
  widow.</p>
  
  <p>My father, Ingvald Martin Undset, obtained his doctorate in 1881
  with a thesis on <i>The Beginnings of the Iron Age in Northern
  Europe</i>. In the same year he married my mother, Charlotte Gyth
  of Kallundborg, whose family had, for some obscure reason,
  settled in Denmark toward the end of the eighteenth century.
  Since most of my father's life consisted of travelling to almost
  every part of Europe, he set up a temporary home at Kallundborg.
  It was there that, in 1882, I first saw the light of day - the
  eldest of three sisters. In 1884 my father moved to Norway to
  take up a post at the Museum of Antiquities which was attached to
  the University of Christiania. I was sent to a school run by Mrs.
  Ragna Nielsen because my father was already aware that his days
  were numbered, and he was anxious for me to acquire a good
  education and follow in his footsteps. Mrs. Nielsen's school was
  co-educational and heavily committed to progressive educational
  ideas. It played an important role in shaping my character,
  inspiring me with an indelible distrust of enthusiasm for such
  beliefs! It was not that I disliked Mrs. Nielsen or suspected her
  of not being so noble-minded or attached to her principles as she
  appeared to be. No, it was those very principles which filled me
  with boundless scepticism; I knew not why either then or for a
  long time afterwards. Many years later I was to find some kind of
  an answer in the words uttered by St. Augustine concerning the
  leader of the Donatists: &laquo;securus judicat orbis
  terrarum&raquo;. At the time, however, my only reaction was to
  roll myself up into a tight ball of resistance and it was thus,
  hedgehog-wise, that I went through my school years.</p>
  
  <p>My father died in 1893 and Mrs. Nielsen offered my mother free
  education for all of us three children. Then when I was about
  fourteen, a memorable thing happened. Mrs. Nielsen called me into
  an empty classroom and told me that though she would keep her
  promise to my mother, &laquo;You, dear Sigrid, show so little
  interest in the school and there are so many children who would
  dearly love to be in your place and enjoy a free education, that
  I am asking you now: are you sure you want to take your entrance
  examinations?&raquo; &laquo;No, thank you&raquo;, was my reply. Mrs.
  Nielsen looked somewhat startled but all she said was, &laquo;Very
  well then, you must now decide about your future like a grown-up
  person&raquo;. I am afraid that my behaviour that day was more
  akin to that of a small animal! Mrs. Nielsen was as good as her
  word where my sisters were concerned, but this was one of the few
  decisions in my life I have never regretted.</p>
  
  <p>My mother had no choice but to send me to a commercial school in
  Christiania. I did not like it there but it had one great
  advantage over my old school; no one there expected me to like
  anything!</p>
  
  <p>Later on, I went to work in an office and learned among other
  lessons to do things I did not care for, and to do them well. I
  remained there for ten years - from the age of 17 until I was 27.
  Before I left this office, two of my books had already been
  published - <i>Fru Marte Oulie</i> in 1907, and <i>Den lykkelige
  alder</i> (The Happy Age) in 1908. After leaving the office job,
  I went to Germany and Italy on a scholarship.</p>
  
  <p>I have published a number of books since, my last two novels
  being set in the Middle Ages. They are <i>Kristin
  Lavransdatter</i>, which appeared in three volumes (192O-1922):
  <i>Kransen (The Garland)</i>, <i>Husfrue (The Mistress of
  Husaby)</i>, <i>Korset (The Cross)</i>; and <i>Olav
  Audunss&oslash;n i Hestviken</i> (1925 ) [<i>The Master of
  Hestviken</i>] and its sequel <i>Olav Audunssen og hans
  b&oslash;rn</i> (1927) [<i>Olav Audunss&oslash;n and his
  Children</i>].</p>
  
  <p>In 1912, I was married in Belgium to the Norwegian painter A. C.
  Svarstad. I was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1924,
  and my marriage was then dissolved, since my husband had earlier
  been married to a woman who is still living. We have three
  children.</p>
  
  <p>Since 1919, I have lived in Lillehammer.</p>

  <p><b>Biographical note on Sigrid
  Undset</b></p>

  <p>Sigrid Undset (1882-1949) was forced by the
  Second World War and the Nazi invasion to leave her native
  Norway. She went to the United States but continued to support
  the resistance movement. After the war she returned to her
  country and received the Grand Cross of St. Olav for her writing
  and her patriotic endeavours. Her later works are determined by
  the experience of her religious conversion and are chiefly
  apologetic in character. <i>Gymnadenia</i> (1929) [<i>The Wild
  Orchid</i>], <i>Den <em>br&aelig;nnende</em> busk</i> (1930) [The Burning
  Bush], <i>Ida Elisabeth</i> (1932), and <i>Den trofaste
  hustru</i> (1936) [<i>The Faithful Wife</i>] deal with
  contemporary subjects. <i>Madame Dorothea</i> (1939) is a
  historical novel. Her biography of Catherine of Siena was
  published posthumously in 1951. Sigrid Undset is the author of
  the autobiographical volumes, <i>Etapper</i> (1929 and 1933)
  [<i>Stages on the Road</i>] and <i>Elleve aar</i> (1934) [<i>The
  Longest Years</i>].</p>
