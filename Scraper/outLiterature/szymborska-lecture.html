  <h2>The Poet and the World</h2>

  <p>They say the first sentence in any speech
  is always the hardest. Well, that one's behind me, anyway. But I
  have a feeling that the sentences to come - the third, the sixth,
  the tenth, and so on, up to the final line - will be just as
  hard, since I'm supposed to talk about poetry. I've said very
  little on the subject, next to nothing, in fact. And whenever I
  have said anything, I've always had the sneaking suspicion that
  I'm not very good at it. This is why my lecture will be rather
  short. All imperfection is easier to tolerate if served up in
  small doses.</p>

  <p>Contemporary poets are skeptical and
  suspicious even, or perhaps especially, about themselves. They
  publicly confess to being poets only reluctantly, as if they were
  a little ashamed of it. But in our clamorous times it's much
  easier to acknowledge your faults, at least if they're
  attractively packaged, than to recognize your own merits, since
  these are hidden deeper and you never quite believe in them
  yourself ... When filling in questionnaires or chatting with
  strangers, that is, when they can't avoid revealing their
  profession, poets prefer to use the general term "writer" or
  replace "poet" with the name of whatever job they do in addition
  to writing. Bureaucrats and bus passengers respond with a touch
  of incredulity and alarm when they find out that they're dealing
  with a poet. I suppose philosophers may meet with a similar
  reaction. Still, they're in a better position, since as often as
  not they can embellish their calling with some kind of scholarly
  title. Professor of philosophy - now that sounds much more
  respectable.</p>

  <p>But there are no professors of poetry. This
  would mean, after all, that poetry is an occupation requiring
  specialized study, regular examinations, theoretical articles
  with bibliographies and footnotes attached, and finally,
  ceremoniously conferred diplomas. And this would mean, in turn,
  that it's not enough to cover pages with even the most exquisite
  poems in order to become a poet. The crucial element is some slip
  of paper bearing an official stamp. Let us recall that the pride
  of Russian poetry, the future Nobel Laureate <a href=
  "../1987/index.html">Joseph Brodsky</a> was once sentenced to
  internal exile precisely on such grounds. They called him "a
  parasite," because he lacked official certification granting him
  the right to be a poet ...</p>

  <p>Several years ago, I had the honor and
  pleasure of meeting Brodsky in person. And I noticed that, of all
  the poets I've known, he was the only one who enjoyed calling
  himself a poet. He pronounced the word without inhibitions.</p>

  <p>Just the opposite - he spoke it with
  defiant freedom. It seems to me that this must have been because
  he recalled the brutal humiliations he had experienced in his
  youth.</p>

  <p>In more fortunate countries, where human
  dignity isn't assaulted so readily, poets yearn, of course, to be
  published, read, and understood, but they do little, if anything,
  to set themselves above the common herd and the daily grind. And
  yet it wasn't so long ago, in this century's first decades, that
  poets strove to shock us with their extravagant dress and
  eccentric behavior. But all this was merely for the sake of
  public display. The moment always came when poets had to close
  the doors behind them, strip off their mantles, fripperies, and
  other poetic paraphernalia, and confront - silently, patiently
  awaiting their own selves - the still white sheet of paper. For
  this is finally what really counts.</p>

  <p>It's not accidental that film biographies
  of great scientists and artists are produced in droves. The more
  ambitious directors seek to reproduce convincingly the creative
  process that led to important scientific discoveries or the
  emergence of a masterpiece. And one can depict certain kinds of
  scientific labor with some success. Laboratories, sundry
  instruments, elaborate machinery brought to life: such scenes may
  hold the audience's interest for a while. And those moments of
  uncertainty - will the experiment, conducted for the thousandth
  time with some tiny modification, finally yield the desired
  result? - can be quite dramatic. Films about painters can be
  spectacular, as they go about recreating every stage of a famous
  painting's evolution, from the first penciled line to the final
  brush-stroke. Music swells in films about composers: the first
  bars of the melody that rings in the musician's ears finally
  emerge as a mature work in symphonic form. Of course this is all
  quite naive and doesn't explain the strange mental state
  popularly known as inspiration, but at least there's something to
  look at and listen to.</p>

  <p>But poets are the worst. Their work is
  hopelessly unphotogenic. Someone sits at a table or lies on a
  sofa while staring motionless at a wall or ceiling. Once in a
  while this person writes down seven lines only to cross out one
  of them fifteen minutes later, and then another hour passes,
  during which nothing happens ... Who could stand to watch this
  kind of thing?</p>

  <p>I've mentioned inspiration. Contemporary
  poets answer evasively when asked what it is, and if it actually
  exists. It's not that they've never known the blessing of this
  inner impulse. It's just not easy to explain something to someone
  else that you don't understand yourself.</p>

  <p>When I'm asked about this on occasion, I
  hedge the question too. But my answer is this: inspiration is not
  the exclusive privilege of poets or artists generally. There is,
  has been, and will always be a certain group of people whom
  inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously
  chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination.
  It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners - and I could list a
  hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous
  adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new
  challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their
  curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem
  they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous
  "I don't know."</p>

  <p>There aren't many such people. Most of the
  earth's inhabitants work to get by. They work because they have
  to. They didn't pick this or that kind of job out of passion; the
  circumstances of their lives did the choosing for them. Loveless
  work, boring work, work valued only because others haven't got
  even that much, however loveless and boring - this is one of the
  harshest human miseries. And there's no sign that coming
  centuries will produce any changes for the better as far as this
  goes.</p>

  <p>And so, though I may deny poets their
  monopoly on inspiration, I still place them in a select group of
  Fortune's darlings.</p>

  <p>At this point, though, certain doubts may
  arise in my audience. All sorts of torturers, dictators,
  fanatics, and demagogues struggling for power by way of a few
  loudly shouted slogans also enjoy their jobs, and they too
  perform their duties with inventive fervor. Well, yes, but they
  "know." They know, and whatever they know is enough for them once
  and for all. They don't want to find out about anything else,
  since that might diminish their arguments' force. And any
  knowledge that doesn't lead to new questions quickly dies out: it
  fails to maintain the temperature required for sustaining life.
  In the most extreme cases, cases well known from ancient and
  modern history, it even poses a lethal threat to society.</p>

  <p>This is why I value that little phrase "I
  don't know" so highly. It's small, but it flies on mighty wings.
  It expands our lives to include the spaces within us as well as
  those outer expanses in which our tiny Earth hangs suspended. If
  Isaac Newton had never said to himself "I don't know," the apples
  in his little orchard might have dropped to the ground like
  hailstones and at best he would have stooped to pick them up and
  gobble them with gusto. Had my compatriot <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1911/index.html">Marie Sklodowska-Curie</a>
  never said to herself "I don't know", she probably would have
  wound up teaching chemistry at some private high school for young
  ladies from good families, and would have ended her days
  performing this otherwise perfectly respectable job. But she kept
  on saying "I don't know," and these words led her, not just once
  but twice, to Stockholm, where restless, questing spirits are
  occasionally rewarded with the Nobel Prize.</p>

  <p>Poets, if they're genuine, must also keep
  repeating "I don't know." Each poem marks an effort to answer
  this statement, but as soon as the final period hits the page,
  the poet begins to hesitate, starts to realize that this
  particular answer was pure makeshift that's absolutely inadequate
  to boot. So the poets keep on trying, and sooner or later the
  consecutive results of their self-dissatisfaction are clipped
  together with a giant paperclip by literary historians and called
  their "oeuvre" ...</p>

  <p>I sometimes dream of situations that can't
  possibly come true. I audaciously imagine, for example, that I
  get a chance to chat with the Ecclesiastes, the author of that
  moving lament on the vanity of all human endeavors. I would bow
  very deeply before him, because he is, after all, one of the
  greatest poets, for me at least. That done, I would grab his
  hand. "'There's nothing new under the sun': that's what you
  wrote, Ecclesiastes. But you yourself were born new under the
  sun. And the poem you created is also new under the sun, since no
  one wrote it down before you. And all your readers are also new
  under the sun, since those who lived before you couldn't read
  your poem. And that cypress that you're sitting under hasn't been
  growing since the dawn of time. It came into being by way of
  another cypress similar to yours, but not exactly the same. And
  Ecclesiastes, I'd also like to ask you what new thing under the
  sun you're planning to work on now? A further supplement to the
  thoughts you've already expressed? Or maybe you're tempted to
  contradict some of them now? In your earlier work you mentioned
  joy - so what if it's fleeting? So maybe your new-under-the-sun
  poem will be about joy? Have you taken notes yet, do you have
  drafts? I doubt you'll say, 'I've written everything down, I've
  got nothing left to add.' There's no poet in the world who can
  say this, least of all a great poet like yourself."</p>

  <p>The world - whatever we might think when
  terrified by its vastness and our own impotence, or embittered by
  its indifference to individual suffering, of people, animals, and
  perhaps even plants, for why are we so sure that plants feel no
  pain; whatever we might think of its expanses pierced by the rays
  of stars surrounded by planets we've just begun to discover,
  planets already dead? still dead? we just don't know; whatever we
  might think of this measureless theater to which we've got
  reserved tickets, but tickets whose lifespan is laughably short,
  bounded as it is by two arbitrary dates; whatever else we might
  think of this world - it is astonishing.</p>

  <p>But "astonishing" is an epithet concealing
  a logical trap. We're astonished, after all, by things that
  deviate from some well-known and universally acknowledged norm,
  from an obviousness we've grown accustomed to. Now the point is,
  there is no such obvious world. Our astonishment exists per se
  and isn't based on comparison with something else.</p>

  <p>Granted, in daily speech, where we don't
  stop to consider every word, we all use phrases like "the
  ordinary world," "ordinary life," "the ordinary course of
  events" ... But in the language of poetry, where every word is
  weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a
  single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night
  after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's
  existence in this world.</p>

  <p>It looks like poets will always have their
  work cut out for them.</p>
