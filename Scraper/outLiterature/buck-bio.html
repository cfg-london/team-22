  <h1>Pearl Buck - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="buck.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Pearl Buck</b> (1892-1973) was born in
  Hillsboro, West Virginia. She grew up in China, where her parents
  were missionaries, but was educated at Randolph-Macon Woman's
  College. After her graduation she returned to China and lived
  there until 1934 with the exception of a year spent at Cornell University,
  where she took an M.A. in 1926. Pearl Buck began to write in the
  twenties; her first novel, <i>East Wind, West Wind</i>, appeared
  in 1930. It was followed by <i>The Good Earth</i> (1931),
  <i>Sons</i> (1932), and <i>A House Divided</i> (1935), together
  forming a trilogy on the saga of the family of Wang. <i>The Good
  Earth</i> stood on the American list of &laquo;best sellers&raquo;
  for a long time and earned her several awards, among them the
  Pulitzer
  Prize and the William Dean Howells Medal. She also published
  <i>The First Wife and Other Stories</i> (1933), <i>All Men are
  Brothers</i> (a translation of the Chinese novel <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i>) (1933), <i>The Mother</i> (1934), and <i>This Proud
  Heart</i> (1938). The biographies of her mother and father,
  <i>The Exile</i> and <i>Fighting Angel</i>, were published in
  1936 and later brought out together under the title of <i>The
  Spirit and the Flesh</i> (1944). <i>The Time Is Now</i>, a
  fictionalized account of the author's emotional experiences,
  although written much earlier, did not appear in print until
  1967.<br>

  Pearl Buck's works after 1938 are too many to mention. Her novels
  have continued to deal with the confrontation of East and West,
  her interest spreading to such countries as India and Korea. Her
  novelist's interest in the interplay of East and West has also
  led to some activity in political journalism.<br>
  <br>
  Pearl Buck has been active in many welfare organizations; in
  particular she set up an agency for the adoption of
  Asian-American children (Welcome House, Inc.) and has taken an
  active interest in retarded children <i>(The Child Who Never
  Grew, 1950)</i>.</p>
