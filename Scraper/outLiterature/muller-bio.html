 <h1>Herta M&uuml;ller - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="muller.jpg" class="bio-img">Herta M&uuml;ller was born in 1953 in Nitzkydorf, a German-speaking village
in the Banat, a region that had passed from the Austro-Hungarian Empire
to Romania in the wake of the First World War. During the Second World
War, Romania had allied with the National-Socialist German Reich, and
like many of the Romanian-Germans, Herta M&uuml;ller's father volunteered
for Hitler's Waffen-SS. Shortly before the end of the war Romania changed
positions, and in January 1945, while the fighting was still on, Stalin ordered
all Romanian-Germans between the ages of 17 and 45 to be deported to the
Soviet Union to perform five years of forced labor. Among them was Herta
M&uuml;ller's mother.</p>
<p>From 1973 to 1976, Herta M&uuml;ller studied Romanian and German
  literature in Timi&#351;oara, where she befriended authors from the
  &quot;Aktionsgruppe Banat,&quot; a group of writers opposed to the Ceau&#351;escu dictatorship
  and the official literature of the ruling socialist party. For Herta M&uuml;ller,
  her father's service as an SS soldier in the &quot;Panzer Division Frundsberg&quot;
  provided a frightening example of how individuals can be corrupted by
  ideology and opportunism &#8211; and inoculated her at a young age against
  similar structures within the communist ideology. Upon completing her
  studies, Herta M&uuml;ller worked as a translator in a machine factory in
  Timi&#351;oara. In 1979 she was approached by the Romanian secret police
  (Securitate), but she refused to spy on her colleagues and foreign guests, and
  as a result she lost her job and could only find occasional employment.</p>
<p>Her first book <em>Niederungen </em>(English title: <em>Nadirs</em>) dates from this period,
  although it wasn't until 1982 that a censored version appeared in Romania.
  In 1984 she published a collection of short prose in Romania entitled
  <em>Dr&uuml;ckender Tango</em>; that same year an uncensored but abridged edition of
  <em>Niederungen </em>came out in Germany, making her name as a writer overnight.
  Told from the perspective of a young girl, with all her fantasies and fears, the
  book depicts the confinement, corruption, intolerance, and oppression of
  a Swabian village in the Banat. In the German media, Herta M&uuml;ller openly
  criticized the communist dictatorship: as a result she was prohibited from
  publishing and repeatedly summoned by the Securitate for interrogations,
  where she was confronted with absurd accusations, reviled as a prostitute,
  charged with black marketeering, and threatened with death. In 1987 she
  emigrated to Germany together with writer Richard Wagner, her husband at
  the time. Since then she has lived in Berlin.</p>
<p>Even there, however, she was persecuted and threatened by the Securitate,
  in the perfidious manner described in her 2009 book <em>Cristina und ihre Attrappe</em>
  which is based on materials in her secret police file the author was able to
  obtain. The dossier revealed that only her reputation in Germany protected
  her from a trial that had already been prepared, on the trumped-up charge
  of being a foreign agent.</p>
<p>In the first book she wrote in Germany, which appeared in 1989 as
  <em>Reisende auf einem Bein </em>(English title: <em>Traveling on One Leg)</em>, she portrayed the
  difficulties of finding a foothold in strange surroundings. Other novels
  followed about daily life in a dictatorship, difficult friendships, and the long
  arm of the secret police reaching into the private sphere - such as her 1994
  book <em>Herztier </em>(English title: <em>The Land of Green Plums</em>) or the 1997 <em>Heute w&auml;r ich</em>
  <em>mir lieber nicht begegnet </em>(English title: <em>The Appointment</em>). Further publications
  include essays on her own poetics (<em>Der K&ouml;nig verneigt sich und t&ouml;tet</em>, 2003) and
  several volumes of collages combining images and text, most recently <em>Die blassen Herren mit den Mokkatassen </em>(2005).</p>
<p>In 2009 she published the novel <em>Atemschaukel</em>, about the deportation of
  the Romanian-German minority to the Soviet Union. Originally she wanted
  to write this novel together with the poet Oskar Pastior, who himself had
  been deported for five years of forced labor in what is now Ukraine. It is his
  detailed recollections that provide the basis of the novel. While they were
  still in the preparatory phase, Oskar Pastior died, and Herta M&uuml;ller was
  forced to write the book alone. <em>Atemschaukel </em>is not only a moving depiction
  of the unknown deportation of the Romanian-Germans; in the voice of the
  protagonist Leo Auberg, it is also Herta M&uuml;ller's literary monument to Oskar
  Pastior.</p>
