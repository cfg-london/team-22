  <h1>Knut Hamsun - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hamsun.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Knut Hamsun</b> (1859-1952) was born in
  Gudbrandsdalen, Norway, and grew up in poverty in Hamar&oslash;y in Nordland.
  From early childhood he was a shoemaker's apprentice, but was also a road worker,
  stonemason, junior-level teacher, and so on. He spent some years in America,
  travelling and working as a tram driver, and published his impressions, chiefly
  satirical, under the title <i>Fra det
  moderne Amerikas Aandsliv</i> (1889) [The Intellectual Life of
  Modern America]. The novel <i>Sult</i> (1890) [Hunger] and even
  more so <i>Pan</i> (1894) led to Hamsun's literary breakthrough and <i>Sult</i> is
  regarded as the first genuinely modern novel in Norwegian literature.</p>
  
  <p>Hamsun's work is determined by a deep aversion to civilization
  and the belief that man's only fulfilment lies with the soil.
  This primitivism (and its concomitant distrust of all things
  modern) found its fullest expression in Hamsun's masterpiece
  <i>Markens Gr&oslash;de</i> (1917) [<i>Growth of the Soil</i>]. His
  early works usually centre on an outcast, a vagabond figure,
  aggressively opposed to civilization. In his middle period,
  Hamsun's aggressiveness gives way to melancholy resignation about
  the loss of youth. The decay of age is the theme of such plays as
  <i>Livets Spil</i> (1896) [Game of Life] and
  <i>Aftenr&oslash;de</i> (1898) [ Sunset], as well as of the novels
  <i>Under H&oslash;ststjernen</i> (1906)[<i>Under the Autumn
  Star</i>], <i>Benoni</i> (1908), and <i>En Vandrer Spiller med
  Sordin</i> (1909) [<i>A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings</i>]. In
  1904 Hamsun also published a volume of poems, <i>Det vilde
  Kor</i> [The Wild Chorus].</p>
  
  <p>Hamsun's later works focused less on individual characters and
  more on broad attacks on civilization. Apart from <i>Marken's
  Gr&oslash;de</i> one should mention <i>B&oslash;rn av Tiden</i>
  (1913) [Children of the Age], Segelfoss By (1915) [<i>Segelfoss
  Town</i>] <i>Landstrykere</i> (1927) [<i>Vagabonds</i>],
  <i>August</i> (1930), <i>Men Livet lever</i> (1933) [<i>The Road
  leads on</i>], and <i>Ringen sluttet</i> (1936) [<i>The Ring is
  Closed</i>].</p>
  
  <p>Hamsun's admiration for Germany, which was of long standing, made
  him sympathetic toward the Nazi invasion of Norway in 1940. After
  the war he was sentenced to the loss of his property, temporarily
  put under psychiatric observation, and spent his last years in
  poverty. A fifteen-volume edition of his complete works was
  published in 1954, two years after his death.</p>
