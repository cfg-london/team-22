  <h1>Theodor Mommsen - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mommsen.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Theodor Mommsen</b> (1817-1903), the
  greatest classical historian of the nineteenth century, was born
  in Garding, Schleswig, the son of a Protestant minister. He read
  law and classics at Kiel from 1838-43, and after a few years in
  France and Italy and a short career in journalism, he became a
  professor of law at the University of Leipzig. His involvement in the
  revolution of 1848-49 led to his dismissal in 1850. After holding
  academic positions at the universities of Z&uuml;rich and
  Breslau he was appointed to the chair of Ancient History at the
  University of Berlin in 1858. He was permanent secretary of the
  Prussian Academy of Arts and Sciences. In the seventies he was an
  active and prominent member of the Prussian Parliament, first as
  a National Liberal and later as a Liberal.<br>

  Mommsen's many writings - a bibliography up to 1887 lists over
  900 items - revolutionized the study of Roman history. He was the
  general editor of, and chief contributor to, the <i>Corpus
  Inscriptionum Latinarum</i>, the gigantic collection of Roman
  inscriptions published by the Berlin Academy (1867-1959). This
  work laid the foundations for a systematic study of Roman
  government, administration, economics, and finance. Mommsen's
  books on Roman coinage and on Roman constitutional and criminal
  law are still classics in their fields. But he was more than a
  brilliant scholar with a tremendous grasp of detail and a
  powerful talent of organization. He was a vivid and powerful
  writer. His passionate involvement in the revolution of 1848-49
  deeply affected the point of view of his main work, the
  incomplete <i>R&ouml;mische Geschichte</i> (1854-55, 1885)
  [History of Rome]. His contempt for the senatorial oligarchy and
  the &laquo;weakling&raquo; Cicero, as well as his boundless
  admiration for the energy and statesmanship of Julius Caesar, for
  a long time dominated the standard view of the history of that
  era. The work covers the history of the Roman Republic; a history
  of the Empire was planned but never written, except for a volume
  on provincial administration under the Empire.</p>
