  <h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Mauriac - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mauriac.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Fran&ccedil;ois Mauriac</b> (1885-1970)
  was born in Bordeaux. His father, a banker, died when he was
  eighteen months old, leaving his mother with five children, of
  which he was the youngest. Fran&ccedil;ois grew up in a closely
  sheltered world, first under the protection of his mother, later
  in a school run by the Marianites. He studied literature at
  Bordeaux and Paris but soon became an independent writer. <i>Les
  Mainsjointes</i> [Clasped Hands], a collection of poems that
  appeared in 1909, aroused some interest, but it was not until the
  publication of <i>Le Baiser aux lepreux</i> (1922) [<i>A Kiss for
  the Leper</i>] that Mauriac became famous. In 1933, he was
  elected to the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise. During the Second
  World War he lived in occupied territory, at his estate in
  Malagar and in Paris, and published <i>Le Cahier noir</i> [The
  Black Notebook] under the pseudonym Forez. After the war de
  Gaulle made Mauriac a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.
  Apart from his many novels, Mauriac has published several plays
  which have been produced by the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise. He
  is also a distinguished journalist and has been an editorial
  writer for <i>Figaro</i>.<br>
  <br>
  The &laquo;religious&raquo; novels of Mauriac have been a puzzle to
  many critics, for they abound in evidences of the &laquo;dark side
  of life&raquo;, and their religious content is not directly
  apparent. For instance, <i>Le Desert de l'amour</i> (1925)
  [<i>The Desert of Love</i>] portrays the triangle of a woman and
  her would-be lovers, father and son, whose &laquo;unused&raquo;
  passion, an illusion of escape, turns into the desert in whose
  isolation the characters live their frustrated lives. Other
  outstanding novels are <i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Desqueyroux</i>
  (1927) [<i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>], <i>Le Noeud de
  vip&egrave;res</i> (1932) [<i>The Knot of Vipers</i>], <i>La Fin de
  la nuit</i> (1935) [The End of the Night], and <i>La
  Pharisienne</i> (1941) [<i>A Woman of the Pharisees</i>]. His
  most recent work has been a study of Charles de Gaulle (1964).
  Mauriac's complete works were published in twelve volumes between
  1950 and 1956.</p>
