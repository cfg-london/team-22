  <h1>Frans Eemil Sillanp&auml;&auml; - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sillanpaa.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Frans Eemil Sillanp&auml;&auml;</b> was
  born on the 16th of September, 1888, at Yl&auml;-Satakunta in the
  H&auml;meenkyr&ouml; Parish of Finland on a desolate croft of the
  same name. The cottage had been built by his parents, his father
  Frans Henrik Henriksson, who had moved there some ten years
  before from Kauvatsa in the Kumo Valley, and his mother, Loviisa
  Vilhelmiina Iisaksdotter, whose family had lived in the
  H&auml;meenkyr&ouml; Parish from times immemorial.<br>
  <br>
  Sillanp&auml;&auml;'s parents had experienced all the trials and
  tribulations common to generations of settlers in those parts of
  Finland. Frosts had killed their seeds, farm animals had
  perished, and the farmer's children, too, had died, until only
  Frans Eemil, the youngest of the offspring, was left.<br>
  <br>
  There was only a mobile school for the farm children, and it was
  purely by accident - young Sillanp&auml;&auml;'s life was to
  abound in accidents - that the crofter's son, who was regarded as
  a bright lad, came to attend a regular school where he displayed
  a real aptitude for learning. Some idealists decided that nothing
  less than a secondary school at Tampere would do and, after
  giving the matter some thought, old Sillanp&auml;&auml; consented
  to send his son away. For five years, Sillanp&auml;&auml;'s
  parents pinched and scraped to keep their son in school, after
  which he supported himself for another three years and, in 1908,
  matriculated with good marks. This was a time in Finland when a
  promising young man could study almost indefinitely on borrowed
  money, and young Sillanp&auml;&auml; was not slow to avail
  himself of this miscarriage of educational zeal. He plunged into
  learning and his studies were as chaotic as they were long
  drawn-out. He did, however, choose biology as his basic subject
  and worked hard in the laboratory, cutting up things, studying
  them under the microscope, and drawing what he saw until, one
  fine day, he woke up to find that five years had gone by; his
  examination day was still far off and the kind old gentlemen who
  had been lending him money were not prepared to do so any longer.
  He scraped together enough cash to return to his home, where he
  found his father and mother poorer than ever. He lived in their
  hut and shared their meals, which could hardly excite a gourmet's
  palate.<br>
  <br>
  His student days were over, his amorous escapades a thing of the
  past, but at least it was easy enough for him to start from
  nothing. Sillanp&auml;&auml; acquired at a nearby village shop
  some stationary of the type favoured by village lads for private
  correspondence and wrote a short story, which he sent to the
  editor of a large city paper without much hope of seeing it
  published. To use an expression popular in those days, the story
  must have been written with his heart's blood because, after a
  very short time, it appeared on the front page of the aforesaid
  paper and its author received a very handsome letter from the
  editor's secretary, as well as his fee, which was more than
  welcome. The story had been published under a pen name but the
  literary world of Helsinki soon discovered the identity of the
  author and the erstwhile eternal scholar found himself, to his
  amazement, receiving letters of extravagant praise. After several
  more of his stories had been published in the same paper,
  something very unusual happened. He was approached by a wellknown
  publisher who asked to be borne in mind should
  Sillanp&auml;&auml;'s literary output stretch to a whole book.
  The publisher went so far as to offer him a reasonable advance to
  enable him to work in peace.<br>
  <br>
  Yet another wonder - one of a series - occurred at that time. At
  an unimportant village dance, Sillanp&auml;&auml; met a shy
  seventeen-year-old girl who, insisting that she could not dance,
  sat far at the back of the dance hall. In spite of her
  resistance, Sillanp&auml;&auml; dragged her out onto the dance
  floor to discover that she could dance after all, which she
  proceeded to do with the utmost seriousness and concentration.
  This was the beginning of a twenty-five-year saga, during which
  Sigrid Maria (for such was the name of the seventeen-year-old
  girl) bore Sillanp&auml;&auml; eight children, one of whom died.
  Mrs. Sillanp&auml;&auml; died on an April morning in 1939. In
  early November, the widower who, six months earlier, had been in
  deep mourning, was standing before the mayor of Helsinki being
  asked if he would take Anna Armia von Hertzen to be his wedded
  wife, to love her, and so on. To this, Sillanp&auml;&auml;
  replied with obvious eagerness, nor was Anna Armia's
  &laquo;yes&raquo; a timid whisper. Some days before a telegram had
  come from the Secretary of the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1939/sillanpaa-autobio.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> telling Sillanp&auml;&auml; that he had been awarded
  the Nobel Prize in Literature. A new point had been reached in
  the long series of wonderful events with which
  Sillanp&auml;&auml;'s life has been punctuated. As for the
  changes which may have occurred in it since that memorable event,
  they are, historically speaking, too recent to be worth
  recording. May his autobiography, therefore, end with this
  red-letter day.<br>
  <br>
  It should perhaps be added that, in 1936, the University
  of Helsinki conferred on Sillanp&auml;&auml; an honorary
  doctorate.<br>
  <br>
  Books published by Sillanp&auml;&auml;, of which <i>The Maid
  Silja</i> in particular has been translated into nearly every
  civilized language from Icelandic to Hebrew, are:</p>
