  <h1>Carl Spitteler - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="spitteler.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on April 24, 1845, in the little
  town of Liestal in the Canton of Baselland. When I was four we
  moved to Bern, where my father had been appointed treasurer of
  the newly established Swiss Confederacy. In the winter of 1856-57
  I returned home with my parents. I attended the Gymnasium at
  Basle and lived with an aunt; later I lived in Liestal and went
  by train to Basle daily to attend the Obergymnasium called the
  &laquo;P&auml;dagogium&raquo;. Wilhelm Wackernagel and Jacob
  Burckhardt were my teachers there. At my father's request I took
  up the study of law at the University of Z&uuml;rich In 1863. Later, 1865-70, I
  studied theology in Z&uuml;rich, Heidelberg, and Basle. After
  taking my theological examination at Basle I went to Petersburg
  at the invitation of General Standertskj&ouml;ld to be the tutor
  of his younger children. I left for Petersburg in August, 1871
  and stayed there until 1879. During this period, spent partly in
  Russia and partly in Finland, I worked on <i>Prometheus und
  Epimetheus</i>, which, after my return to Switzerland, I
  published in 1881 at my own expense under the pseudonym Carl
  Felix Tandem. The book was completely neglected; because it was
  not even reviewed I abandoned all hope of making poetry my living
  and was compelled instead to teach school (Neuveville, Canton
  Bern, 1881-1885) and work for newspapers (<i>Grenzpost</i>,
  Basle, 1885-86; <i>Neue Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung</i>, 1890-92). In
  July, 1892, fate suddenly granted me financial independence. I
  moved to Lucerne, where I have lived happily with my family ever
  since. The following works of mine appeared after <i>Prometheus
  und Epimetheus: Extramundana</i> (1883), a book which I consider
  mediocre; <i>Schmetterlinge</i> (1889) [Butterflies]; <i>Friedli
  der Kolderi</i> (1891); <i>Gustav</i> (1892) ; <i>Litterarische
  Gleichnisse</i> (1892) [Literary Parables]; <i>Balladen</i>
  (1896); <i>Der Gotthard</i> (897); <i>Conrad der Leutnant</i>
  (1898); <i>Lachende Wahrheiten</i> (1898) <i>[Laughing
  Truths</i>]. Between 1900 and 1906 the four volumes of my epic
  <i>Olympischer Fr&uuml;hling</i> [Olympian Spring] were
  published: I. <i>Die Auffahrt</i> [Overture]; II. <i>Hera die
  Braut</i> [Hera the Bride]; III. <i>Die Hohe Zeit</i> [High
  Tide]; IV. <i>Ende und Wende</i> [End and Change].</p>
  
  <p>The first two parts remained as unnoticed as all my other books.
  But between the publication of the second and third volumes, a
  musician, the famous Felix Weingartner, suddenly announced
  <i>Olympischer Fr&uuml;hling</i> (together with
  <i>Prometheus</i>) to the German public in a special pamphlet
  called <i>Carl Spitteler, ein k&uuml;nstlerisches Erlebnis</i>
  (M&uuml;nchen, 1904). That was the breakthrough. Felix
  Weingartner had discovered me for the world. To the'Swiss public
  I had long before been recommended by J. V. Widmann.</p>
  
  <p>In 1909 a revised edition of my epic in five volumes was
  published; by the end of 1920 it had run into several editions.
  After <i>Olympischer Fr&uuml;hling</i> I published
  <i>Glockenlieder</i> (1906) [Bell Songs]; <i>Imago</i> (I908);
  <i>Gerold und Hansli, die M&auml;dchenfeinde</i> (1907) [<i>Two
  Little Misogynists</i>], translated into several languages; and
  <i>Meine fr&uuml;hesten Erlebnisse</i> (1914) [My Earliest
  Experiences]...</p>
