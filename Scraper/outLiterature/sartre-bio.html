  <h1>Jean-Paul Sartre - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sartre.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b>, (1905-1980) born
  in Paris in 1905, studied at the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure from 1924
  to 1929 and became Professor of Philosophy at Le Havre in 1931.
  With the help of a stipend from the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais he
  studied in Berlin (1932) the philosophies of Edmund Husserl and
  Martin Heidegger. After further teaching at Le Havre, and then in
  Laon, he taught at the Lyc&eacute;e Pasteur in Paris from 1937 to
  1939. Since the end of the Second World War, Sartre has been
  living as an independent writer.<br>
  <br>
  Sartre is one of those writers for whom a determined
  philosophical position is the centre of their artistic being.
  Although drawn from many sources, for example, Husserl's idea of
  a free, fully intentional consciousness and Heidegger's
  existentialism, the existentialism Sartre formulated and
  popularized is profoundly original. Its popularity and that of
  its author reached a climax in the forties, and Sartre's
  theoretical writings as well as his novels and plays constitute
  one of the main inspirational sources of modern literature. In
  his philosophical view atheism is taken for granted; the "loss of
  God" is not mourned. Man is condemned to freedom, a freedom from
  all authority, which he may seek to evade, distort, and deny but
  which he will have to face if he is to become a moral being. The
  meaning of man's life is not established before his existence.
  Once the terrible freedom is acknowledged, man has to make this
  meaning himself, has to commit himself to a role in this world,
  has to commit his freedom. And this attempt to make oneself is
  futile without the "solidarity" of others.<br>
  <br>
  The conclusions a writer must draw from this position were set
  forth in "Qu'est-ce que la litt&eacute;rature?" (What Is
  Literature?), 1948: literature is no longer an activity for
  itself, nor primarily descriptive of characters and situations,
  but is concerned with human freedom and its (and the author's)
  commitment. Literature is committed; artistic creation is a moral
  activity.<br>
  <br>
  While the publication of his early, largely psychological
  studies, <i>L'Imagination</i> (1936), <i>Esquisse d'une
  th&eacute;orie des &eacute;motions</i> (Outline of a Theory of the
  Emotions), 1939, and <i>L'Imaginaire: psychologie
  ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nologique de l'imagination</i> (The Psychology
  of Imagination), 1940, remained relatively unnoticed, Sartre's
  first novel, <i>La Naus&eacute;e</i> (Nausea), 1938, and the
  collection of stories <i>Le Mur</i> (The Wall and
  other Stories), 1938, brought him
  immediate recognition and success. They dramatically express
  Sartre's early existentialist themes of alienation and
  commitment, and of salvation through art.<br>
  <br>
  His central philosophical work, <i>L'Etre et le n&eacute;ant</i>
  (Being and Nothingness), 1943, is a massive structuralization of
  his concept of being, from which much of modern existentialism
  derives. The existentialist humanism which Sartre propagates in
  his popular essay <i>L'Existentialisme est un humanisme</i>
  (Existentialism is a Humanism), 1946, can be glimpsed in the
  series of novels, <i>Les Chemins de la Libert&eacute;</i> (The
  Roads to Freedom), 1945-49.<br>
  <br>
  Sartre is perhaps best known as a playwright. In <i>Les
  Mouches</i> (The Flies), 1943, the young killer's committed
  freedom is pitted against the powerless Jupiter, while in <i>Huis
  Clos</i> (No Exit), 1947, hell emerges as the togetherness of
  people.<br>
  <br>
  Sartre has engaged extensively in literary critisicm and has
  written studies on Baudelaire (1947) and Jean Genet (1952). A
  biography of his childhood, <i>Les Mots</i> (The Words), appeared
  in 1964.</p>
