  <h1>Ernest Hemingway - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hemingway.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ernest Hemingway</b> (1899-1961), born
  in Oak Park, Illinois, started his career as a writer in a
  newspaper office in Kansas City at the age of seventeen. After
  the United States entered the First World War, he joined a
  volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. Serving at the
  front, he was wounded, was decorated by the Italian Government,
  and spent considerable time in hospitals. After his return to the
  United States, he became a reporter for Canadian and American
  newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe to cover such events
  as the Greek Revolution.<br>
  <br>
  During the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of
  expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first
  important work, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (1926). Equally
  successful was <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> (1929), the study of an
  American ambulance officer's disillusionment in the war and his
  role as a deserter. Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter
  during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most
  ambitious novel, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> (1940). Among his
  later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, <i>The Old
  Man and the Sea</i> (1952), the story of an old fisherman's
  journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea,
  and his victory in defeat.<br>

  Hemingway - himself a great sportsman - liked to portray
  soldiers, hunters, bullfighters - tough, at times primitive
  people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways
  of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and
  faith. His straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his
  predilection for understatement are particularly effective in his
  short stories, some of which are collected in <i>Men Without
  Women</i> (1927) and <i>The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine
  Stories</i> (1938). Hemingway died in Idaho in 1961.</p>
