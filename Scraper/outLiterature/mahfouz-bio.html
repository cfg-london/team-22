  <h1>Naguib Mahfouz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="mahfouz.jpg" class="bio-img">Born in Cairo in 1911, <b>Naguib
  Mahfouz</b> began writing when he was seventeen. His first novel
  was published in 1939 and ten more were written before the
  Egyptian Revolution of July 1952, when he stopped writing for
  several years. One novel was republished in 1953, however, and
  the appearance of the Cairo Triology, <i>Bayn al Qasrayn, Qasr al
  Shawq, Sukkariya (Between-the-Palaces, Palace of Longing,
  Sugarhouse)</i> in 1957 made him famous throughout the Arab world
  as a depictor of traditional urban life. With <i>The Children of
  Gebelawi</i> (1959), he began writing again, in a new vein that
  frequently concealed political judgements under allegory and
  symbolism. Works of this second period include the novels, <i>The
  Thief and the Dogs</i> (1961), <i>Autumn Quail</i> (1962),
  <i>Small Talk on the Nile</i> (1966), and <i>Miramar</i> (1967),
  as well as several collections of short stories.<br>

  Until 1972, Mahfouz was employed as a civil servant, first in the
  Ministry of Mortmain Endowments, then as Director of Censorship
  in the Bureau of Art, as Director of the Foundation for the
  Support of the Cinema, and, finally, as consultant on Cultural
  Affairs to the Ministry of Culture. The years since his
  retirement from the Egyptian bureaucracy have seen an outburst of
  further creativity, much of it experimental. He is now the author
  of no fewer than thirty novels, more than a hundred short
  stories, and more than two hundred articles. Half of his novels
  have been made into films which have circulated throughout the
  Arabic-speaking world. In Egypt, each new publication is regarded
  as a major cultural event and his name is inevitably among the
  first mentioned in any literary discussion from Gibraltar to the
  Gulf.</p>
