  <h1>Giosu&egrave; Carducci - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="carducci.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Giosu&egrave; Carducci</b>
  (1835-1907) was born in Val di Castello, a small town near Pisa.
  He was early attracted to the Greek and Roman authors; in
  addition, he conscientiously studied the Italian classics: Dante,
  Tasso, and Alfieri. At the age of twenty he graduated with a
  degree in philosophy and letters from the University of Pisa.
  After several difficult years in which he taught in various high
  schools, he was appointed to the chair of Italian Literature at
  the University of Bologna, a post that he held
  until his retirement in 1904.<br>
  <br>
  Inspired both by his own time as well as by his study of the
  classical and Italian poets, Carducci began writing poetry when
  he was a child. The first two collections of his poetry were
  <i>Rime</i> (1857) [<i>Rhymes</i>] and <i>Levia Gravia</i> (1868)
  [<i>Light and Heavy</i>]. Both reveal his enthusiasm for and
  imitation of the ancients as well as a strong revolutionary
  tendency. <i>Inno a Satana</i> (1865) [<i>Hymn to Satan</i>], for
  which Carducci was considered to be a &laquo;notorious praiser of
  Satan&raquo;, is the full expression of his free thought and of
  modern ideas, inventions, and revolutions. <i>Giambi ed epodi</i>
  (1882) [<i>Iambics and Epodes</i>], a collection of satiric poems
  of a political nature, expresses Carducci's indignation with his
  compatriots. In the <i>Nuove poesie</i> (1873) [<i>New Poems</i>]
  end the three collections of Odi barbare (1877, 1882, and 1889)
  [<i>The Barbarian Odes</i>], his poetic forms reach
  perfection.<br>
  <br>
  Carducci was also an excellent translator, and the lyrics of
  Goethe and Heine greatly influenced the development of his own
  poetry.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to his fame as a poet he was a noted literary
  historian and an eminent orator. He conducted research in every
  phase of literature and eloquently expressed his findings in
  <i>Studi letterati</i> (1874) [<i>Literary Studies</i>],
  <i>Bozetti critici e discorsi letterari</i> (1876) [<i>Critical
  Sketches and Literary Discussigns</i>], and many other
  works.<br>
  <br>
  Carducci, moreover, led an active political life. After having
  been named an honorary citizen of Bologna, he was elected to the
  Senate in 1890; he served as deputy in the House of
  Representatives for a short time. Carducci's poetry inspired his
  compatriots in the war for Italian independence, and he enjoyed
  an immense popularity both at home and abroad. Having manifested
  a scholarly and dynamic personality in all his endeavours, he
  stands as the greatest Italian literary figure in the latter part
  of the nineteenth century.</p>
