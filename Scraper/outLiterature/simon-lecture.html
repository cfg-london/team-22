  <br>
  The feelings of a laureate honoured by the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1985/simon-lecture-e.html&amp;object=svenskaakademien&amp;to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a> have been perfectly expressed by one of my "Nobel
  colleagues", to use Dr. Andr&eacute; Lwoffs expression in a letter
  he has been so kind as to write to me:<br>
  <br>
  "Research being a game or a gamble," he writes in his letter of
  thanks, "it matters little, at least in theory, whether one wins
  or loses. Yet scientists" (and I would add, authors), "are in
  some respects like children. Like them, they love to win and,
  like them, they love rewards". Whereto Andr&eacute; adds: "In the
  bottom of his heart, every scientist," (every author, I should
  add, again) "longs to be recognized".<br>
  <br>
  Were I to try and analyse this kind of satisfaction's many
  components in point of some of their puerile aspects, I should
  say a certain pride is involved. Quite apart from my own person,
  attention is directed to the country which, for better or for
  worse, is mine. It is by no means a bad thing that people should
  be reminded that, despite all that is "worse" about it, a certain
  life of the intellect, although denigrated, laughed to scorn and
  sometimes even hypocritically persecuted, still, like a stubborn
  protest, makes my country one of the places where some of our
  most currently menaced values still survive, indifferent to the
  inertia or sometimes even the hostility of the powers that
  be.<br>
  <br>
  Further, if I, addressing as I now do the members of your
  Academy, say how sensible I am of your goodness in choosing me
  and thank you for doing so, it is no mere ritual act of
  submission to custom and good manners.<br>
  <br>
  It is no mere chance, namely, or so it seems to me, that this
  institution has its seat and deliberates its choices here in
  Sweden, more precisely in Stockholm, at more or less the
  geographical centre or, if you prefer it, the crossroads of four
  nations whose populations, though small, by virtue of their
  culture, their traditions, their civility and their laws, have
  made Scandinavia so great that it is a kind of privileged and
  exemplary islet on the fringe of the iron world of violence we
  today inhabit.<br>
  <br>
  Thus it is not by chance, either, that the Norwegian, Swedish and
  Danish translations of <i>Les G&eacute;orgiques,</i> my latest
  work, should have been the first to appear; nor that it was
  already possible last winter to come across another translation
  on the shelves of a stationer's shop in a remote hamlet among the
  lakes and forests of Finland. Yet when this latest Nobel award
  was announced, the <i>New York Times</i> (to mention only one of
  the two giants whose monstrous weight today is crushing us)
  vainly asked American critics for their opinion, my own country's
  media meanwhile searching feverishly for information about this
  virtually unknown author and while its popular press, for lack of
  any critical analyses of my works, published completely fanciful
  items about my life and activities as a writer - that is, when
  not deploring your decision as a national catastraphe for
  France.<br>
  <br>
  Admittedly, I am not so presumptuous or even so stupid I do not
  realise that every choice in the realms of art and literature is
  contestable and, to some extent, arbitrary; and I am the first to
  regard several other writers for whom I have the greatest
  respect, in France and elsewhere, as equally eligible.<br>
  <br>
  If I refer to the scandalized amazement (amounting at times even
  to terror - one French mass-circulation weekly has even suspected
  your Academy of having been infiltrated by the Soviet's KGB!),
  the amazement, I say, echoed by the big newspapers, I hope no one
  will think it is in a spirit of mockery or malignancy, or of
  facile triumph. But because the terms in which these protests,
  this indignation, this terror even, are formulated confront
  within the realm of literature and art the forces of conservatism
  with those others, I will not call them "of progress" (a word
  devoid of meaning in relation to art) but anyway of movement,
  thus to spotlight the much bruited and ever more aggravated
  divorce between living art and the great public, held timidly in
  a state of backwardness by all kinds of powers terrified above
  all of change.<br>
  <br>
  Leaving aside the complaints that I am a "difficult", "boring",
  "unreadable" or "confused" writer, and recalling that the same
  reproaches have always been levelled at any artist who even to
  the slightest degree upsets acquired habits and the established
  order of things, let us wonder, instead, at the way in which the
  grandchildren of those people who in impressionist paintings once
  saw nothing but shapeless (i.e., illegible) daubs today form
  endless queues outside exhibitions and museums to admire the
  works of those very same daubers.<br>
  <br>
  Likewise, let us leave aside the insinuation that you have chosen
  me at the instigation of agents of a certain political police,
  seated among you - however curious it may be to note that, even
  today, the Soviet Union remains in certain circles the symbol of
  redoubtable forces hostile to social stability; forces with which
  I, a simple writer, flatter myself I am associated. For indeed,
  the egoistic and vain gratuity of what some people call "art for
  art's sake" has been so reviled that it is no small recompense
  for me to see my writings, which have had no greater ambition
  than to raise themselves to that level, ranked among the
  instruments of revolutionary and upsetting action.<br>
  <br>
  What do seem to me more interesting, worth taking into account
  and worth pausing over, are certain other judgements on my work
  which, by their nature and their vocabulary, reveal, not so much
  a misunderstanding which may exist between the supporters of a
  certain tradition and of what I would call living literature, as
  what would seem to be a reversed (or, if you like, inverted)
  situation, all the terms used pejoratively having been most
  judiciously chosen, the only difference being that, in my eyes
  and oppositely to what my critics intend, they possess a positive
  value.<br>
  <br>
  I will come back to those who reproach my novels for having
  "neither a beginning nor an end", which is perfectly correct.
  Here I would like to dwell on two adjectives regarded as
  defamatory, and which are always naturally or, one could say,
  correlatively associated, and which serve precisely to pin-point
  the nature of this problem; namely those which denounce my works
  as a product of "labour", and thus necessarily
  "artificial".<br>
  <br>
  The dictionary defines this last word as follows: "Made with
  art". Further: "Anything which is the product of human activity
  and not of nature", - a definition so pertinent that one would be
  happy to accept it, if it were not for its connotations, which,
  commonly loaded with pejorative meaning, paradoxically turn out
  under scrutiny to be highly instructive. For if, as the
  dictionary adds, "artificial" also implies something "factitious,
  fabricated, false, imitated, invented, supererogatory", the
  thought immediately occurs that art, which is the acme of
  invention, and likewise factitious (from the Latin <i>facere</i>,
  "to make") and thus "fabricated" (another word which should be
  reinstated) is par excellence imitation (something which also
  obviously postulates falsity). Nevertheless it is necessary to
  define the exact nature of this imitation, inasmuch as it is by
  imitating itself, so to speak, that art generates itself: even to
  a point where it is not the desire to reproduce nature that makes
  the painter, but the fascination exerted by museums, just as it
  is the fascination of the written word that makes the author. As
  for Nature, she (as Oscar Wilde so wittily put it) contents
  herself with "imitating art ..."<br>
  <br>
              And certainly the language spoken by the greatest writers and musicians 
              during the centuries before, during, and after the Renaissance - 
              some of whom were treated like domestic servants, working to order 
              - was an artisan's language. They referred to the fruits of their 
              labours (here I'm thinking of Johann Sebastian Bach, of Nicolas 
              Poussin ...) as works most laboriously and conscientiously executed. 
              How to explain that today, for a certain school of criticism, the 
              very notion of labour, of work, should have fallen into such discredit 
              that to say of any writer that he finds writing difficult is just 
              about the most scathing thing one could say about him? Perhaps we 
              should dwell a moment on this problem, for it opens vistas on to 
              horizons much vaster than derive from mere pique.<br>
  <br>
  "Use-value or the value of any article," Marx writes in the first
  chapter of <i>Das Kapital</i>, "only has value insofar as it
  embodies and materializes human labour." And in fact, that is any
  value's laborious point of departure. I am neither a philosopher
  nor a sociologist; yet I am struck by the fact that it should be
  during the 19th Century that, parallel with the development of
  machinery and of a ferocious industrialism, we on the one hand
  see the growth of a certain bad conscience and, on the other, the
  whole concept of work (the ill-paid work of transmutation) being
  devalued. In this way the writer is denied the virtue of his
  efforts, in favour of what some people call "inspiration", and is
  turned into a simple intermediary, a spokesman of goodness knows
  what supernatural power, in such fashion that he, the whilom
  domestic servant or conscientious artisan, now sees himself, as a
  person, put out of court, negated. At best he becomes a copyist,
  the translator of a book already written somewhere else, a kind
  of decoding machine, whose job it is to deliver, in plain
  language, messages dictated to him from a mysterious
  "beyond".<br>
  <br>
  The strategy, at once &eacute;litist and annihilating, is obvious.
  Honoured in his role of inebriated Python or oracle, precisely
  because he is in himself nobody, the writer now nevertheless
  belongs to an exclusive caste, to which no one thereafter can
  expect to be admitted on grounds of his own merit or labour. On
  the contrary, work is regarded, as formerly by the aristocracy,
  as something infamous and degrading. From now on a work of art
  will be judged with a word drawn, quite naturally, from religion:
  namely, "grace", that divine grace to which, as everyone knows,
  no virtue, not even self-denial, can ever attain.<br>
  <br>
  By grace of this knowing ("What <i>have you got</i> to say?"
  Sartre used to say - or, in other words: "What knowledge do you
  <i>possess</i>?"), the writer becomes a despositary or retainer,
  someone who, even before he puts pen to paper, possesses within
  himself a knowledge refused to other mortal men. This means that
  the writer sees himself as assigned the mission of teaching it to
  other people, so that the novel, quite logically, becomes
  imagistic in form, in the same way as religious instruction is
  done by parable and fable. The writer's own person being
  abolished (it becomes his business to "efface" himself behind his
  characters), so is his work, and likewise its product, namely the
  piece of writing. "The best style is an unnoticeable style", we
  are in the habit of saying, remembering the famous formula of
  someone who wanted a novel should be nothing but "a mirror
  walking along a road": a flat, uniform surface, free of all
  asperities, and behind its thin polished metal plate containing
  nothing but these virtual images that he indifferently and
  objectively, one after another, places on it. In other words:
  "the world as if I were not there to give it tongue", in
  Baudelaire's ironical formula with which he defined
  "realism".<br>
  <br>
              "Have they given Claude Simon the Nobel Prize to confirm the rumour 
              that the novel is finally dead?" asks one critic. What he does not 
              yet seem to have noticed is that, if by "novel" he means the literary 
              model which established itself in the 19th Century, then it is certainly 
              dead, no matter how many copies of amiable or terrifying tales of 
              adventure, with their happy or desperate endings, railway station 
              and other bookstalls are still buying and selling, and for a long 
              time to come will go on selling, and whose titles announce such 
              revealed truths as <i>La Condition Humaine, L'Espoir</i>, or <i>Les 
              Chemins de la Libert&eacute; </i>...</p>

  <p>More interesting to me, it seems, is that
  when, at the beginning of our century, two giants, Proust and
  Joyce, opened up quite new paths, they were only sanctioning a
  slow evolution, in the course of which the so-called realistic
  novel had slowly committed suicide.<br>
  <br>
  "I endeavoured," writes Marcel Proust, "to find beauty where I
  had never imagined it could be: in the most everyday objects, in
  the profound life of <i>natures mortes</i>." And in an article
  published in Leningrad in 1927, entitled <i>On the Evolution of
  Literature</i>, the Russian essayist Tynianov wrote: "Taken as a
  whole, the descriptions of nature in older novels which, from the
  point of view of one literary system, one would be tempted to
  reduce to the ancillary role of link-passages or of slowing up
  the action (and thus almost negating it), from the point of view
  of another literary system should be regarded as a principal
  element; the fable may be only a motive, a pretext for
  accumulating static descriptions". This text which, in certain
  respects, can be regarded as prophetic, also seems to deserve a
  few observations.<br>
  <br>
  First and foremost, we should note that the chief dictionary
  sense of the word "fable" is: "A short tale from which a moral
  can be extracted". Immediately, an objection occurs: namely, that
  in reality the process of fabricating a fable unfolds in exactly
  the opposite direction: that it is the fable which is extracted
  from the moral, not vice versa. For the writer of fables, the
  moral - "The strongest reason is always best", or "Every
  flatterer lives at the expense of his listener" - is there first;
  only thereafter the story which he makes up, as an imagistic
  demonstration illustrating some maxim, precept, or thesis which
  he tries by means of it to render more striking.<br>
  <br>
  It is this tradition which, in France, via the mediaeval
  fabliaux, the fablewriters and the so-called comedy of manners or
  character of the 17th Century, and then of the philosophical tale
  of the 18th Century, led up to the l9th Century's allegedly
  "realistic" novel, such as aspired to a didactic virtue: "You and
  a few beautiful souls, beautiful as your own", Balzac wrote,
  "will understand my thought as you read <i>La Maison Nucingen</i>
  immediately after <i>C&eacute;sar Birotteau</i>. Does not this
  contrast contain a <i>whole social doctrine?"</i><br>
  <br>
  In its day and age a bold innovation (a point overlooked by
  latter-day epigones who, a century and a half later, would set it
  up as exemplary), and supported by a certain "flight of the pen"
  and by a certain larger-than-life quality which raised it above
  the level of its own intentions, the Balzac-type novel afterwards
  degenerated and gave birth to works retaining only its purely
  demonstrative element.<br>
  <br>
              Seen through such a lens, all description would seem not merely 
              supererogatory but, as Tynianov stresses, impertinent, since it 
              parasitically attaches itself to the action, whose course it interrupts, 
              merely putting off the moment when the reader at long last shall 
              tumble to the sense of the tale. "When I come to a description in 
              a novel", wrote Henri de Montherlant, "I skip a page". And Andr&eacute; 
              Breton (who had nothing else in common with Montherlant) declared 
              he could die of boredom at the description of Raskolnikov's room, 
              exclaiming furiously: "What right has the author to fob us off with 
              his postcards?" ...</p>

  <center>

  </center>

            <p>Figures in the traditional novel are social or psychological 
              types "in situation", simplified to the point of caricature, at 
              least in one French tradition. "Harpagon is a miser, pure and simple", 
              Strindberg remarks, in his preface to <i>Miss Julie</i>. "Yet he 
              could also have been an excellent town councillor, a paterfamilias 
              or indeed anything else. But no, he's a miser, pure and simple!" 
              The traditional novel's characters are caught up in a series of 
              adventures, where chain reactions follow one another in accordance 
              with some supposedly implacable law of causes and effects, such 
              as gradually leads them to the d&eacute;nouement which has been 
              called the "novel's logical climax", and which serves to substantiate 
              the author's thesis and tell his readers what view they should take 
              of men and women, of society or History ...<br>
  <br>
  The tedium of it all is that these supposedly determined and
  determining events depend only on the goodwill of him who relates
  them. It is at his good pleasure that one character meets another
  (or fails to), that they fall in love (or hate each other), die
  (or survive); and equally well these events, whilst of course
  perfectly possible, might not happen. As Conrad emphasizes in his
  preface to The <i>Nigger of the Narcissus</i>, all the author
  appeals to is our credulity; as to the "logic" of the characters,
  as of the situations, they could be discussed ad infinitum. On
  the one hand Henri Martineau, that eminent Stendhalian, assures
  us that from the outset of <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i> Julien
  Sorel is predestined to fire his fatal pistol shot at Madame de
  R&eacute;nal. Whilst, on the other, Emile Faguet, for his part,
  finds this d&eacute;nouement "impermissibly false".<br>
  <br>
              No doubt this is one of the reasons for the paradox which, from 
              the very moment of its birth, caused the realistic novel to work 
              for its own destruction. Indeed, it was as if these authors, aware 
              of the feebleness of the means they have recourse to in order to 
              transmit their didactic message, felt a confused need, if their 
              fables were to be convincing, to endue them with material density. 
              Up to then, whether in <i>La Princesse de Cl&egrave;ves, Candide, 
              Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i>, or even in <i>La Nouvelle H&eacute;loise</i>, 
              a work of so great a nature-lover as Rousseau, description, in a 
              novel or a philosophical tale, had been as it were non-existent, 
              or only appeared in stereotypes: all pretty women's complexions 
              are those "of the lily and the rose". They have "a fine figure". 
              All old women are "hideous", all shadows are "cool", all deserts 
              "monstrous", and so forth ... Not until Balzac (perhaps it was there 
              his genius lay) do we come across minute and lengthy descriptions 
              of place or character. As the century wore on, such descriptions 
              would not only become steadily more numerous, but, no longer confined 
              to the beginning of a story or the first appearances of its characters, 
              progressively break up the action or, in more or less massive doses, 
              are infused in it, even in the end becoming a kind of Trojan horse, 
              quite simply ousting the fable which it had been their purpose to 
              lend body to. Julien Sorel's tragic end on the scaffold, Emma Bovary's 
              death by arsenic, or Anna Karenina throwing herself under a train 
              may seem the logical climaxes of their adventures, whose <i>sens 
              moral</i> they serve to underline. But none can surely be drawn 
              from Albertine's end. Proust quite simply makes her disappear (one 
              could be tempted to say "gets rid of her") as a result of a banal 
              riding accident ...</p>

  <center>

  <p>An interesting parallel, it seems to me,
  could be drawn between the novel's evolution during the l9th
  Century and the evolution of painting, which had started so much
  earlier: "The end (the goal) of Christian art", Ernest Gombrich
  writes, "consists in making the sacred personage and, above all,
  sacred History convincing and moving in the eyes of the
  spectator". In its very earliest form, with the Byzantines, "the
  happening is described by means of clear and simple hieroglyphics
  that enable it to be understood, rather than seen". A tree, a
  mountain, a stream or some rocks are indicated by pictographic
  "signs".<br>
  <br>
  "However, little by little, a new requirement makes itself felt:
  to proceed in such a fashion that the spectator as it were
  becomes a witness to the event (...) which is intended to be the
  object of his meditation." This leads gradually at the advent of
  naturalism, one of whose first artisans was Giotto, an evolution
  which pursued its course until, Gombrich tells us, "the
  naturalistic landscape of the backgrounds, hitherto designed
  according to the notions of mediaeval art about how proverbs
  should be illustrated or moral lessons inculcated, and which had
  filled up areas devoid of characters or actions (...), in the
  16th Century this landscape as it were eats up the foregrounds,
  even to a point where the work is so well done by specialists
  like Joachim Pantinir that what the painter is creating no longer
  acquires its pertinence from some association with an important
  subject, but by reflecting, like music, the very harmony of the
  universe".</p>

  <center>
    * * *
  </center>

  <p>After a long evolution the painter's
  function found itself, in a manner of speaking, inverted, and the
  knowing, or, if one prefers, the sense, had passed from one side
  of the action to the other, thereafter becoming the action's
  fruit, no longer expressing content but producing it.<br>
  <br>
  The same thing has happened to literature, and this makes it seem
  legitimate, today, to demand for (or of) the novel a credibility
  more reliable than the credibility, always open to discussion,
  that can be attributed to a fiction; the credibility a text
  acquires when its components stand in a right relationship to
  each other and to their overall arrangement; where sequence and
  composition are no longer subordinate to a causality lying
  outside the "literary phenomenon", as does the psycho-social
  causality which is normally the rule in the so-called realistic
  novel; but an interior causality, in the sense that such or such
  an event, described and no longer reported, will follow or
  precede such or such another event, simply by virtue of their
  inherent qualities.<br>
  <br>
  If I can lend no credence to the <i>deus ex machina</i> who
  altogether too opportunely causes the characters in a story to
  meet, it seems to me on the other hand altogether credible,
  <i>simply because it lies in the intelligible order of
  things</i>, that Proust should suddenly be transported from the
  courtyard of the Guermantes' townhouse to the parvis of St.
  Mark's in Venice by a sensation of having two pavings underfoot;
  equally credible that Molly Bloom, in her erotic reveries, should
  be carried away by the thought of some juicy fruits she intends
  to buy the next day at market; and equally credible that
  Faulkner's unfortunate Benjy should always howl with pain at the
  golfers' shout of "caddie!". And why? Because there exists an
  obvious communion of qualities, or, in other words, a certain
  harmony between these objects, these reminiscences, these
  sensations; a harmony which, in these examples, is the upshot of
  associations or assonances, but which can also arise, as in
  painting or music, from contrasts, clashes or dissonances.</p>

            <p>And at once we glimpse an answer to the everlasting questions: 
              "Why do you write? What have you to say?"<br>
              <br>
              "If (...) someone were to ask me", wrote Paul Val&eacute;ry, "if 
              someone were to worry himself (as happens, and sometimes intensely) 
              about what I've meant to say (...), I reply that I haven't <i>wanted 
              to say</i> anything, but <i>wanted to make</i> something, and that 
              it's this intention of <i>making</i> which has <i>wanted</i> what 
              <i>l've said</i>." I could take up this reply by point. If the writer's 
              array of motivations is like a wide-open fan, the need to be recognized, 
              which Andr&eacute; Lwoff speaks of, is perhaps not the most futile, 
              demanding as it in the first place does a self-recognition, which 
              in turn implies a "making", a "doing" (I make - I produce - therefore 
              I am), whether it is a question of building a bridge, a ship, of 
              bringing in a harvest or of composing a string quartet. And if we 
              restrict ourselves to the realm of literature we should bear in 
              mind that the Greek word for"make" or "do" is <img src="greksign.gif" alt="Word in Greek" width="48" height="9"> 
              which is also the origin of the word <i>poem</i>, whose nature we 
              should perhaps plumb even deeper. For if we are agreed in allowing 
              some freedom of language to the kind of writer usually called a 
              poet, on what grounds do we refuse it to the prose-writer, to whom 
              we assign only one task: to tell apologetic tales, ignoring meanwhile 
              all other aspects of the nature of this language, which he also 
              has to use as a simple means of communication? Isn't this to forget, 
              as Mallarm&eacute; says, that "each time a stylistic effort is made, 
              there is versification", and to forget Flaubert's question in a 
              letter to George Sand: "How come there is a necessary link between 
              the exact word and the musical word?"</p>

  <p>I am an old man now. Like the lives of many
  others who inhabit our old Europe, my early life was no little
  disturbed. I witnessed a revolution. I went to war in singularly
  murderous circumstances (my regiment was one of those the
  general-staffs coldly sacrificed in advance, so that a week later
  almost nothing remained of it). I have been taken prisoner. I've
  known hunger. Have been forced to exhaust myself with physical
  labour. Escaped. Been gravely ill, several times at the point of
  a violent or natural death. I've rubbed shoulders with all sorts
  and conditions of men, both clergy and incendiaries of churches,
  peaceable bourgeois and anarchists, philosophers and illiterates.
  I've shared my bread with tramps, in a word, I've been about the
  world&nbsp;... all, however, without finding any sense to all this,
  unless it should be the one assigned to it, I believe, by Barthe,
  following Shakespeare: that "if the world signifies anything, it
  is that it signifies nothing" - except that it exists.<br>
  <br>
  As you see, I've nothing, in Sartre's sense, to say. Even if some
  important truth of a social, historical, or sacred nature had
  been revealed to me, it would have seemed to me a burlesque
  proceeding, at the very least, to have invented fictions to
  express it, rather than by a reasoned philosophical,
  sociological, or theological thesis.<br>
  <br>
  So - to return to Val&eacute;ry's word - what's to be "done" or
  "made": which in turn leads straight to the question: "made out
  of what?"<br>
  <br>
  Well, in front of my blank sheet of paper, two things confront
  me: on the one hand, the troublesome muddle of emotions,
  memories, images inside myself. On the other, the language, the
  words I'm going to look for in order to express it, and the
  syntax which will determine their arrangement and in whose womb
  they in some sense are going to take form.<br>
  <br>
  And immediately I find that, first: what one writes (or
  describes) is never something which has happened prior to the
  work of writing. On the contrary it produces itself (in every
  sense of the term) in the course of working, within its own
  <i>present</i>. It is the upshot, not of the conflict between the
  very vague initial project and the language, but, on the
  contrary, of their symbiosis, so that, at least in my case, the
  result is infinitely richer than the intention.<br>
  <br>
  Stendhal experienced this phenomenon of the literary present. In
  his <i>La Vie de Henri Brulard</i> he undertook to describe the
  Army of Italy going over the Great St. Bernard. While doing his
  very best to give his tale all possible veridicality, he says, he
  suddenly realized he was perhaps describing, not so much the
  event itself, as an engraving of it, seen subsequently. This
  engraving, (he writes) "had (in me) replaced the reality". If
  Stendhal had meditated further on the matter, he would have
  realized - anyone can imagine the numbers of objects represented
  in the engraving: guns, wagons, horses, glaciers, rocks, etc.,
  but their enumeration would fill several pages, whilst Stendhal's
  account fills exactly one, he would have realized, I say, that it
  was not even this engraving he was describing, but an image just
  then forming itself inside him, and which, in its turn, was
  replacing the engraving he thought he was describing.<br>
  <br>
              More or less consciously, as a result of the imperfections, first 
              of his perception and then of his memory, the author not only subjectively 
              selects, chooses, eliminates, but also valorizes some few of the 
              hundreds or thousands of elements in a scene: and immediately we 
              are very far indeed from the impartial mirror walking along beside 
              a road, to which this same Stendhal pretended ...<br>
  <br>
  If a breaking point occurred, a radical change in the history of
  art, it was when painters, soon followed by writers, gave up
  pretending to represent the visible world, and contented
  themselves with the impressions it produced on them.<br>
  <br>
              "A man in good health", writes Tolstoy, "is all the time thinking, 
              feeling, and recalling an incalculable number of things at once". 
              This observation should be set beside Flaubert's apropos <i>Madame 
              Bovary</i>: "Everything she had in her, of reminiscences, images, 
              combinations, escaped at once, in a single movement, like the thousand 
              sparks of a firework. Sharply, in separate pictures, she saw her 
              father, L&eacute;on, Lhereux' office, their own room downstairs, 
              another landscape, unknown figures ..."<br>
  <br>
  If Flaubert here speaks of a sick woman, the prey of a kind of
  delirium, Tolstoy, for his part, when he says "any man in good
  health", goes further and generalizes. Where they agree is in
  saying that all these reminiscences, all these emotions, and all
  these thoughts present themselves simultaneously. Only Flaubert
  is specific about it being a matter of "separate pictures",
  fragments, in other words; and that the aspect under which they
  present themselves to us is that of "combinations". And this
  exposes for us the weak side of Tynianov's timid proposition
  which, while regarding the traditional novel as passe, failed to
  conceive of a future type of novel, where the fable would merely
  be a pretext for an "accumulation" of "static"
  descriptions.<br>
  <br>
  And here we come across one of the paradoxes of literature. A
  description of what one might call an apparently static "interior
  landscape", whose main characteristic is that nothing in it is
  near or remote, turns out itself, not to be static, but, on the
  contrary, dynamic. Forced by the linear configuration of language
  to enumerate successively such a landscape's components (which in
  itself involves priorities, thus a subjective valorization of
  certain objects in relation to others), the author, as soon as he
  begins to write down a word on paper, immediately touches on this
  prodigious whole, this astounding network of relationships
  established in and by this language which, as someone has said,
  "speaks before we do" by means of what one calls "figures of
  speech"; in other words tropes, metonymies, and metaphors.
  Nothing of this is the result of chance but, quite the contrary,
  a constitutive part of man's gradually acquired knowledge of the
  world and of objects.<br>
  <br>
  And if, following Chlovski, we agree on defining the "literary
  act" as "the transfer of an object of habitual perception into
  the sphere of a new perception", how can the author hope to
  reveal the mechanisms which cause this "incalculable number" of
  apparently "separate pictures" within him to form associations
  which are his very self as a conscious being, if not in this
  language which is his very self qua thinking and speaking being,
  and in whose bosom, in its wisdom, and its logic, innumerable
  transfers or implied senses already occur to him? According to
  Lacan, words, so far from merely being "signs", are nodes of
  meaning; or even, as I have written in my brief preface to
  <i>Orion Aveugle</i>, crossroads of sense, so that language, by
  its mere vocabulary, offers potential "combinations" in
  "innumerable numbers". And it is thanks to this that this
  "adventure of narration" in which the writer, at his own risk and
  peril, involves himself, finally can seem more believable than
  the more or less arbitrary tales which the naturalistic novel,
  with a self-assurance the more imperious for knowing how fragile
  and utterly controversial are its methods, proposes to us.<br>
  <br>
  Not demonstrate, but show; not reproduce, but produce; no longer
  express, but discover. Like painting, the novel no longer claims
  to draw its pertinence from its association with some important
  topic; but from the fact that it, like music, struggles to
  reflect a certain harmony. Asking "what is 'realism'?", Roman
  Jakobson remarks that a novel's realism is not usually assessed
  in terms of actual "reality" (one object with a thousand
  aspects), but in terms of a literary genre, developed during the
  last century. This is to forget that the characters in these
  tales have no other reality than the writing which brings them
  into being: how therefore can this piece of writing "efface
  itself" behind a story and events which have no existence except
  within itself? And indeed, just as painting once took as its
  pretext some Biblical scene, mythological, or historical (who can
  seriously believe in the "reality" of a <i>Crucifixion</i>, a
  <i>Suzanna and the Elders</i> or a <i>Rape of the Sabine
  Women?</i>), what a writer even the most naturalistic of
  novelists, relates is his own adventure, his own magical
  incantations. If the adventure is null and void, if his
  incantations fail of their effect, then his novel, whatever other
  didactic or moral pretensions it may have, is also null and
  void.</p>

  <p>Sometimes people talk, only too volubly and
  ex cathedra, of a writer's function and duties. Some years ago,
  using a formula that contains within itself its own
  contradiction, some people, not altogether undemagogically, even
  went so far as to declare that "a book is worth nothing compared
  with the death of a little child in Biafra". But why is such a
  death, unlike a baby monkey's, such an insufferable scandal?
  Surely because the child is a human infant, i.e., gifted with
  intelligence, a conscience (however embryonic), who, if he
  survives, will one day be capable of thinking and talking about
  his sufferings, of reading about the sufferings of others, and of
  in his turn being moved and, with a little luck, of writing about
  it.<br>
  <br>
  Before the end of the century of the Enlightenment, before the
  myth of "realism" was forged, Novalis enunciated with astonishing
  lucidity this apparent paradox: "with language it is as with
  mathematical formulae: each contains a world of its own, for
  itself alone. Their play is exclusive and internal, expresses
  nothing except their own marvellous nature, and it is precisely
  this which makes them so expressive that it is within them,
  precisely, that the interplay of objects is so singularly
  reflected."<br>
  <br>
  It is in its search for this interplay that one perhaps could
  conceive an involvement for the act of writing which, in all
  modesty, contributes to changing the world every time it, even in
  the tiniest degree, changes the way in which man, by his
  language, relates to it. Questionless, the path then followed
  will be very different from that of the novelist who, starting
  out from a "beginning", reaches an "ending". This other way,
  which it costs an explorer of an unknown country such pains to
  find (losing himself, retracing his steps, guided or led astray
  by resemblances between different places, the same place's
  different aspects) will constantly call for rechecks, pass across
  crossroads already crossed. As for the end of this investigation
  into the "present" of images and emotions none closer or more
  distant than any other (word, namely, having a prodigious power
  to bring nearer and juxtapose objects which for lack of them
  would remain scattered in clock-time or in measurable space),
  this journey's end may well be that he comes back to his point of
  departure, the richer only for having indicated certain
  directions, thrown a few footbridges, and by obstinately
  penetrating particularities without laying claim to say
  everything that could be said, may even attain to that "common
  sense" where to some greater or smaller extent everyone can
  recognize some part of himself.<br>
  <br>
  To this path there can thus be no other term except the
  exhaustion of him who, exploring this inexhaustible countryside
  as he travels through it, contemplates the rough map he has drawn
  up in the course of his march, never quite sure he has done his
  best to follow certain enthusiasms, obey certain impulses.
  Nothing is sure, nor does it offer any other guarantees than
  those Flaubert, following Novalis, speaks of: a harmony, a music.
  Searching for it, the writer makes only laborious progress.
  Feeling his way forward like a blind man, he goes up culs-de-sac,
  gets bogged down and starts out anew. If we at all costs must
  find some edification in his efforts, one could say it lies in
  seeing that always we are advancing across sands which shift
  under our feet.<br>
