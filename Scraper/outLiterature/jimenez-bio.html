  <h1>Juan Ram&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="jimenez.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Juan Ram&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez</b>
  (1881-1958) belonged to the group of writers who, in the wake of
  Spain's loss of her colonies to the United States (1898), staged
  a literary revival. The leader of this group of
  <i>modernistas</i>, as they called themselves, Rub&eacute;n
  Dar&iacute;o, helped Juan Ram&oacute;n to publish <i>Almas de
  violeta</i> (Souls of Violet), 1900, his first volume of poetry.
  The years between 1905 to 1912 Ram&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez spent at
  his birthplace, Moguer, where he wrote <i>Elej&iacute;as puras</i>
  (Pure Elegies), 1908, <i>La soledad sonora</i> (Sonorous
  Solitude), 1911, and <i>Poemas m&aacute;gicos y dolientes</i>
  (Magic Poems of Sorrow), 1911. His early poetry was influenced by
  German Romanticism and French Symbolism. It is strongly visual
  and dominated by the colours yellow and green. His later style,
  decisive, formally ascetic, and dominated by white, emerges in
  the poetic prose of his delicate <i>Platero y yo</i> (Platero and
  I), 1914, and is fully developed in <i>Diario de un poeta
  reci&eacute;n casado</i> (Diary of a Newly-Wed Poet), 1917, written
  during a trip to the United States, as well as in
  <i>Eternidades</i> (Eternities), 1918, <i>Piedra y cielo</i>
  (Stone and Sky), 1919, <i>Poes&iacute;a</i> (Poetry), 1923, and
  <i>Belleza</i> (Beauty), 1923. In the twenties, Ram&oacute;n
  Jim&eacute;nez became the acknowledged master of the new generation
  of poets. He was active as a critic as well as an editor of
  literary journals. In 1930 he retired to Seville to devote
  himself to the revision of his earlier work. Six years later, as
  the result of the Spanish Civil War, he left Spain for Puerto
  Rico and Cuba. He remained in Cuba for three years and, in 1939,
  went to the United States, which became his residence until 1951,
  when he moved definitely to Puerto Rico. During these years Juan
  Ram&oacute;n taught at various universities and published
  <i>Espa&ntilde;oles de tres mundos</i> (Spaniards of Three Worlds),
  1942, a book of prose portraits, and several collections of
  poems, among them <i>Voces de mi copla</i> (Voices of My Song),
  1945, and <i>Animal de fondo</i> (Animal of Depth). The latter
  book, perhaps his best, clearly reveals the religious
  preoccupations that filled the last years of the poet's life.
  Selections from most of his works were published in English
  translation in <i>Selected Writings of Juan Ram&oacute;n
  Jim&eacute;nez</i> and <i>Three Hundred Poems,</i> 1903-1953.
  Ram&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez died in Puerto Rico in 1958.</p>
