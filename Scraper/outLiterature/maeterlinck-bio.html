  <h1>Maurice Maeterlinck - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="maeterlinck.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Maurice Maeterlinck</b> (1862-1949),
  born in Ghent, Belgium, came from a well-to-do family. He was
  educated at a Jesuit college and read law, but a short practice
  as a lawyer in his home town convinced him that he was unfit for
  the profession. He was drawn toward literature during a stay in
  Paris, where he associated with a number of men of letters, in
  particular Villiers de l'Isle Adam, who greatly influenced him.
  Maeterlinck established himself in Paris in 1896 but later lived
  at Saint-Wandrille, an old Norman abbey that he had restored. He
  was predominantly a writer of lyrical dramas, but his first work
  was a collection of poems entitled <i>Serres chaudes</i> [Ardent
  Talons]. It appeared in 1889, the same year in which his first
  play, <i>La Princesse Maleine</i>, received enthusiastic praise
  from Octave Mirbeau, the literary critic of <i>Le Figaro</i>, and
  made him famous overnight. Lack of action, fatalism, mysticism,
  and the constant presence of death characterize the works of
  Maeterlinck's early period, such as <i>L'Intruse</i> (1890) [The
  Intruder], <i>Les Aveugles</i> (1890) [<i>The Blind</i>], and the
  love dramas <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> (1892),
  <i>Alladine et Palomides</i> (1894), and <i>Aglavaine et
  S&eacute;lysette</i> (1896). The shadow of death looms even larger
  in his later plays, <i>Joyzelle</i> (1903) and <i>Marie
  Magdeleine</i> (1909), Maeterlinck's version of a Paul Heyse
  play, while <i>L'Oiseau bleu</i> (1909) [<i>The Blue Bird</i>] is
  marked by a fairy-tale optimism. <i>Le Bourgmestre de
  Stilemonde</i> (1919) [<i>The Burgomaster of Stilemonde</i>] was
  written under the impact of the First World War.</p>
  
  <p>Maeterlinck developed his strongly mystical ideas in a number of
  prose works, among them <i>Le Tr&eacute;sor des Humbles</i> (1896)
  [<i>The Treasure of the Humble</i>], <i>La Sagesse et la
  destin&eacute;e</i> (1898) [<i>Wisdom and Destiny</i>], and <i>Le
  Temple enseveli</i> (1902) [<i>The Buried Temple</i>]. His most
  popular work was perhaps <i>La Vie des abeilles</i> (1900)
  [<i>The Life of the Bee</i>], which was followed by
  <i>L'Intelligence des Fleurs</i> (1907) [<i>The Intelligence of
  the Flowers</i>], studies of termites (1927), and of ants (1930).
  In later life, Maeterlinck became known chiefly for his
  philosophical essays. In 1932 he was given the title of Count of
  Belgium.</p>
