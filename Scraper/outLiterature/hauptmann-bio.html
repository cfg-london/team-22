<h1>Gerhart Hauptmann - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="hauptmann.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on November 15, 1862. The place
of my birth is Bad Obersalzbrunn, a spa famous for its medicinal
springs. The house of my birth is the inn &laquo;Zur Preussischen
Krone&raquo;. My father was Robert Hauptmann, my mother Marie
Hauptmann, n&eacute;e Straehler. I am the youngest of four
children. I remember growing up in an educated and lively
middle-class house.</p>

<p>I attended the village school, learned some Latin from a tutor,
and had violin lessons. Later I went to Breslau, the capital of
our province, where I lived in boardinghouses and attended a
Gymnasium. Fortunately, my Breslau school period did not crush
me, but it left scars from which I only slowly recovered.</p>

<p>I should have perished if there had not been a way out. I went to
the country and began to study agriculture. The tortures of
school, begun in 1874, ended in 1878. But agriculture remained an
episode. Once in solitude I learned to stand on my own feet and
have my own thoughts. I grew conscious of myself, my value, and
my rights. In this way I gained independence, firmness, and a
freedom of intellect that I still enjoy today.</p>

<p>Hungry for culture, I resumed to Breslau where I spent a second,
happier period. I attended the art academy, did sculpturing,
learned what youth, hope, and beauty are, the value of friends,
masters, and teachers.</p>

<p>I drew, sculptured, drank, wrote poems, made plans, and built
castles in Spain. In this mood I exchanged the art academy of
Breslau for the University of Jena in Thuringia. In this mood I
exchanged Jena for Rome, and later Rome for Berlin.</p>

<p>Although I still worked as a sculptor in Rome, it was here that I
finally decided upon literature. A play <i>Vor Sonnenaufgang</i>
[<i>Before Dawn</i>] made me publicly known in 1889.</p>

<p>My later works I wrote partly in Berlin, partly in Schreiberhau
in the Riesengebirge, partly in Agnetendorf, partly in Italy:
they are the condensation of outward and inward fortunes.</p>

<p><b>Biographical note on Gerhart
Hauptmann</b></p>
<p>Gerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946) gained fame
as one of the founders of German Naturalism. After <i>Vor
Sonnenaufgang</i>, which created a scandal and, at the same time,
was hailed as the beginning of naturalistic drama in Germany, he
wrote his most successful play, <i>Die Weber</i> (1892) [<i>The
Weavers</i>], the comedy <i>Der Biberpelz</i> (1893) [<i>The
Beaver Coat</i>], the historical drama <i>Florian Geyer</i>
(1896), <i>Fuhrmann Henschel</i> (1898) [<i>Drayman
Henschel</i>], <i>Rose Bernd</i> (1903), and <i>Die Ratten</i>
(1911) [<i>The Rats</i>]. But he also wrote symbolic works like
<i>Hanneles Himmelfahrt</i> (1893) [<i>The Assumption of
Hannele</i>] and <i>Die versunkene Glocke</i> (1896) [<i>The
Sunken Bell</i>]. Hauptmann's later works are often literary in
inspiration to the point of being - in the widest sense -
revisions of European classics. <i>Der arme Heinrich</i> (1902)
[Henry of Au&euml;] is modelled on a German medieval romance;
<i>Hamlet in Wittenberg</i> (1935) challenged Shakespeare and
<i>Der grosse Traum</i> (1942-43) [The Great Dream] Dante. Greece
influenced him deeply, but in his image of Greece archaic and
chthonic features predominated: <i>Griechischer Fr&uuml;hling</i>
(1908) [Greek Spring], <i>Der Bogen des Odysseus</i> (1914) [The
Bow of Odysseus], and above all the <i>Atridentetralogie</i>, of
which the last two parts, <i>Agamemnons Tod</i> [Agamemnon's
Death] and <i>Elektra</i>, were published posthumously in
1948.</p>

<p>Other works include the erotic novel <i>Der Ketzer von Soana</i>
(1918) [<i>The Heretic of Soana</i>], <i>Buch der
Leidenschaft</i> (1930) [Book of Passion], a thinly veiled
account of his divorce and remarriage in 1904, and the two
autobiographical volumes <i>Abenteuer meiner Jugend</i> (1937 and
1949) [<i>Adventure of My Youth</i>]. His collected works in
seventeen volumes were published in 1942.</p>
