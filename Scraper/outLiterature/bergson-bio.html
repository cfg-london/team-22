  <h1>Henri Bergson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bergson.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Henri Bergson</b> (1859-1941), the
  son of a Jewish musician and an English woman, was educated at
  the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet and the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, where he
  studied philosophy. After a teaching career as a schoolmaster in
  various secondary schools, Bergson was appointed to the
  &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in 1898 and, from 1900 to
  1921, held the chair of philosophy at the Coll&egrave;ge de France.
  In 1914 he was elected to the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise; from
  1921 to 1926 he was president of the Commission for Intellectual
  Cooperation of the League of Nations. Shortly before his death in
  1941, Bergson expressed in several ways his opposition to the
  Vichy regime.<br>

  Bergson's English background explains the deep influence that
  Spencer, Mill, and Darwin had on him during his youth, but his
  own philosophy is largely a reaction against their rationalist
  systems.<br>

  Bergson developed his philosophy in a number of books that have
  become famous not only for their fresh interpretation of life but
  also for a powerful employment of metaphor, image, and analogy.
  In his <i>Essai sur les donnes imm&eacute;diates de la
  conscience</i> (1889) [<i>Time and Free Will</i>], Bergson
  offered an interpretation of consciousness as existing on two
  levels, the first to be reached by deep introspection, the second
  an external projection of the first. The deeper self is the seat
  of creative becoming and of free will. The method of intuitive
  introspection, first employed in this work, is developed further
  in his <i>Introduction &agrave; la m&eacute;taphysique</i> (1903
  [<i>An Introduction to Metaphysics</i>]. In <i>Mati&egrave;re et
  m&eacute;moire</i> (1896) [<i>Matter and Memory</i>], Bergson once
  again took up the study of consciousness, turning his attention
  to the relation of mind to body. He argued that this distinction
  is one of degree, not of kind. The limiting concept of matter is
  interpreted as a momentary mind, completely deprived of a memory
  that helps make possible freedom of choice. In L'&Eacute;volution
  cr&eacute;atice (1907) [<i>Creative Evolution</i>], Bergson
  developed the theory of time introduced in his other works and
  applied it to the study of living things, while in <i>Les Deux
  Sources de la morale et de la religion</i> (1932) [<i>The Two
  Sources of Morality and Religion</i>], he explored the moral
  implications of his theory of freedom. In <i>Le Rire</i> (1900)
  [<i>Laughter</i>], of greatest interest to the literary critic,
  Bergson provided a theory of comedy and established its place in
  a survey of aesthetics and the philosophy of art. Many of
  Bergson's essays and reviews have been collected in <i>L'Energie
  spirituelle</i> (1919) [<i>Mind-Energy</i>] and <i>La Pens&eacute;e
  et le mouvant</i> (1934) <i>[Thought and Motion</i>]. Bergson's
  works were published in seven volumes in 1945-46.</p>
