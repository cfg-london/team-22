  <h1>Harry Martinson - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="martinson.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Harry Martinson</b> was born at
  J&auml;msh&ouml;g in 1904. He was left an orphan at an early age,
  and after a chequered childhood, in which the children's homes
  and institutions were as numerous as the escapes, he went to sea
  at the age of sixteen, spending six years of his life on board
  various ships and as a workman in foreign countries.<br>
  <br>
  It was from these travels and years of work in environments of
  all kinds that he later drew material and inspiration for his
  literary efforts - a couple of books of prose with glimpses,
  views and memories of the world of coal-heated ships during the
  1920s.<br>
  <br>
  These accounts were followed a few years later by one or two
  books with an autobiographical strain and fictional recollections
  of a boarded-out child's existence, especially the child's own
  way of perceiving and trying to understand life and the people in
  it.<br>
  <br>
  Side by side with this psychological cognition of the childhood
  land of memory, there appeared some collections of poetry which
  were continued by degrees in a series of nature studies in prose,
  in which words and observation are combined in what the author
  has called "thinking out in the meadow".<br>
  <br>
  In a later work, the novel <i>V&auml;gen till Klockrike</i>, the
  description of the human side is devoted entirely to the
  relationship between the settled and the itinerant man within
  ourselves. A world of journeying in a still wider sense emerges
  in <i>Aniara</i>, an epic work about an imagined space flight
  with a perspective in depth towards our own time. In it, jostling
  for room in our consciousness, are our fears and our questions as
  to where we are heading, together with the planet that our
  generation is treating as it does.</p>

  <p>Harry Martinson died in 1978.</p>
