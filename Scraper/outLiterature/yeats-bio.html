  <h1>William Butler Yeats - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="yeats.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>William Butler Yeats</b> (1865-1939) was
  born in Dublin. His father was a lawyer and a well-known portrait
  painter. Yeats was educated in London and in Dublin, but he spent
  his summers in the west of Ireland in the family's summer house
  at Connaught. The young Yeats was very much part of the <i>fin de
  si&egrave;cle</i> in London; at the same time he was active in
  societies that attempted an Irish literary revival. His first
  volume of verse appeared in 1887, but in his earlier period his
  dramatic production outweighed his poetry both in bulk and in
  import. Together with Lady Gregory he founded the Irish Theatre,
  which was to become the Abbey Theatre, and served as its chief
  playwright until the movement was joined by John Synge. His plays
  usually treat Irish legends; they also reflect his fascination
  with mysticism and spiritualism. <i>The Countess Cathleen</i>
  (1892), <i>The Land of Heart's Desire</i> (1894), <i>Cathleen ni
  Houlihan</i> (1902), <i>The King's Threshold</i> (1904), and
  <i>Deirdre</i> (1907) are among the best known.</p>
  
  <p>After 1910, Yeats's dramatic art took a sharp turn toward a
  highly poetical, static, and esoteric style. His later plays were
  written for small audiences; they experiment with masks, dance,
  and music, and were profoundly influenced by the Japanese Noh
  plays. Although a convinced patriot, Yeats deplored the hatred
  and the bigotry of the Nationalist movement, and his poetry is
  full of moving protests against it. He was appointed to the Irish
  Senate in 1922. Yeats is one of the few writers whose greatest
  works were written after the award of the Nobel Prize. Whereas he
  received the Prize chiefly for his dramatic works, his
  significance today rests on his lyric achievement. His poetry,
  especially the volumes <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i> (1919),
  <i>Michael Robartes and the Dancer</i> (1921), <i>The Tower</i>
  (1928), <i>The Winding Stair and Other Poems</i> (1933), and
  <i>Last Poems and Plays</i> (1940), made him one of the
  outstanding and most influential twentieth-century poets writing
  in English. His recurrent themes are the contrast of art and
  life, masks, cyclical theories of life (the symbol of the winding
  stairs), and the ideal of beauty and ceremony contrasting with
  the hubbub of modern life.</p>
