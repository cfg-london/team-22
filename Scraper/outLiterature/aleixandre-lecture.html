  <p>At a moment like this, so important in the
  life of a man of letters, I should like to express in the most
  eloquent words at my command the emotion that a human being feels
  and the gratitude he experiences in the face of an event such as
  that which is taking place today. I was born in a middle-class
  family, but I had the benefit of its eminently open and liberal
  outlook. My restless spirit led me to practise contradictory
  professions. I was a teacher of mercantile law, an employee in a
  railway company, a financial journalist. From early youth this
  restlessness of which I have spoken lifted me to one particular
  delight: reading and, in time, writing. At the age of 18 the
  prentice poet began to write his first verses, sketched out in
  secret amid the turmoil of a life which, because it had not yet
  found its true axis, I might call adventurous. The destiny of my
  life, its direction, was determined by a bodily weakness. I
  became seriously ill of a chronic complaint. I had to abandon all
  my other concerns, those which I might call corporal, and to
  retreat to the countryside far from my former activities. The
  vacuum thus created was soon invaded by another activity which
  did not call for physical exertion and could easily be combined
  with the rest that the doctors had ordered me to take. This
  unforgettable, all-conquering invasion was the practice of
  letters; poetry occupied to the full the gap in activity. I began
  to write with complete dedication and it was then, only then,
  that I became possessed by the passion which was never to leave
  me.<br>
  <br>
  Hours of solitude, hours of creation, hours of meditation.
  Solitude and meditation gave me an awareness, a perspective which
  I have never lost: that of solidarity with the rest of mankind.
  Since that time I have always proclaimed that poetry is
  communication, in the exact sense of that word.<br>
  <br>
  Poetry is a succession of questions which the poet constantly
  poses. Each poem, each book is a demand, a solicitation, an
  interrogation, and the answer is tacit, implicit, but also
  continuous, and the reader gives it to himself through his
  reading. It is an exquisite dialogue in which the poet questions
  and the reader silently gives his full answer.<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could find fitting words to describe what a Nobel Prize
  means to the poet. It cannot be done; I can only assure you that
  I am with you body and soul, and that the Nobel Prize is as it
  were the response, not gradual, not tacit, but collected and
  simultaneous, sudden, of a general voice which generously and
  miraculously becomes one and itself answers the unceasing
  question which it has come to address to mankind. Hence my
  gratitude for this symbol of the collected and simultaneous voice
  to which the Swedish Academy has enabled me to listen with the
  senses of the soul for which I here publicly render my devoted
  thanks.<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, I consider that a prize such as I have
  received today is, in all circumstances, and I believe without
  exception, a prize directed to the literary tradition in which
  the author concerned - in this case myself - has been formed. For
  there can be no doubt that poetry, art, are always and above all
  tradition, and in that tradition each individual author
  represents at most a modest link in the chain leading to a new
  kind of aesthetic expression; his fundamental mission is, to use
  a different metaphor, to pass on a living torch to the younger
  generation which has to continue the arduous struggle. We can
  conceive of a poet who has been born with the highest talents to
  accomplish a destiny. He will be able to do little or nothing
  unless he has the good fortune to find himself placed in an
  artistic current of sufficient strength and validity. Conversely,
  I think that a less gifted poet may perhaps play a more
  successful role if he is lucky enough to be able to develop
  himself within a literary movement which is truly creative and
  alive. In this respect I was born under the protection of benign
  stars inasmuch as, during a sufficiently long period before my
  birth, Spanish culture had undergone an extremely important
  process of swift renewal, a development which I think is no
  secret to anyone. Novelists such as Gald&oacute;s; poets like
  Machado, Unamuno, <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1956/index.html">Juan Ram&oacute;n
  Jim&eacute;nez</a> and, earlier, Becquer; philosophers like Ortega
  y Gasset; prose writers such as Azor&iacute;n and Baroja;
  dramatists such as Valle-Incl&aacute;n; painters like Picasso and
  Mir&oacute;; composers such as de Falla: such figures do not just
  conjure themselves up, nor are they the products of chance. My
  generation saw itself aided and enriched by this warm
  environment, by this source, by this enormously fertile cultural
  soil, without which perhaps none of us would have become
  anything.<br>
  <br>
  From the tribune in which I now address you I should like
  therefore to associate my words with this generous nursery ground
  of my compatriots who from another era and in the most diverse
  ways formed us and enabled us, myself and my friends of the same
  generation, to reach a place from which we could speak with a
  voice which perhaps was genuine or was peculiar to
  ourselves.<br>
  <br>
  And I do not refer only to these figures which constitute the
  immediate tradition, which is always the one most visible and
  determinative. I allude also to the other tradition, the one of
  the day before yesterday, which though more distant in time was
  yet capable of establishing close ties with ourselves; the
  tradition formed by our classics from the Golden Age, Garcilaso,
  Fray Luis de Le&oacute;n, San Juan de la Cruz, Gongora, Quevedo,
  Lope de Vega, to which we have also felt linked and from which we
  have received no little stimulation. Spain was able to revive and
  renew herself thanks to the fact that, through the generation of
  Gald&oacute;s, and later through the generation of 1898, she as it
  were opened herself, made herself available, and as a result of
  this the whole of the nourishing sap from the distant past came
  flowing towards us in overwhelming abundance. The generation of
  1927 did not wish to spurn anything of the great deal that
  remained alive in this splendid world of the past which suddenly
  lay revealed to our eyes in a lightning flash of uninterrupted
  beauty. We rejected nothing, except what was mediocre; our
  generation tended towards affirmation and enthusiasm, not to
  scepticism or taciturn restraint.<br>
  <br>
  Everything that was of value was of interest to us, no matter
  whence it came. And if we were revolutionaries, if we were able
  to be that, it was because we had once loved and absorbed even
  those values against which we now reacted. We supported ourselves
  firmly on them in order to brace ourselves for the perilous leap
  forward to meet our destiny. Thus it should not surprise you that
  a poet who began as a surrealist today presents a defence of
  tradition. Tradition and revolution - here are two words which
  are identical.<br>
  <br>
  And then there was the tradition, not vertical but horizontal,
  which came to help us in the form of a stimulating and fraternal
  competition from our flanks, from the side of the road we were
  pursuing. I refer to that other group of young people (when I too
  was young) who ran with us in the same race. How fortunate I was
  to be able to live and perform, to mould myself in the company of
  poets so admirable as those I came to know and devote myself to
  with the right of a contemporary! I loved them dearly, every one.
  I loved them precisely because I was seeking something different,
  something which it was only possible to find through differences
  and contrast in relation to these poets, my comrades. Our nature
  achieves its true individuality only in community with others,
  face to face with our neighbours. The higher the quality of the
  human environment in which our personality is formed, the better
  it is for us. I can say that here, too, I have had the good
  fortune to be able to realize my destiny through communion with
  one of the best companies of men of which it is possible to
  conceive. The time has come to name this company in all its
  multiplicity: Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca, Rafael Alberti, Jorge
  Guill&eacute;n, Pedro Salinas, Manuel Altolaguirre, Emilio Prados,
  D&aacute;maso Alonso, Gerardo Diego, Luis Cernuda.<br>
  <br>
  I speak then of solidarity, of communion, as well as of contrast.
  If I do so, it is because such has been the feeling that has been
  most deeply implanted on my soul, and it is its hearbeat that, in
  one way or another, can be heard most clearly behind the greater
  part of my verse. It is therefore natural that the very way in
  which I look upon humanity and poetry has much to do with this
  feeling. The poet, the truly determinative poet, is always a
  revealer; he is, essentially, a seer, a prophet. But his
  "prophecy" is of course not a prophecy about the future; for it
  may have to do with the past: it is a prophecy without time.
  Illuminator, aimer of light, chastiser of mankind, the poet is
  the possessor of a Sesame which in a mysterious way is, so to
  speak, the word of his destiny.<br>
  <br>
  To sum up, then, the poet is a man who was able to be more than a
  man: for he is in addition a poet. The poet is full of "wisdom";
  but this he cannot pride himself on, for perhaps it is not his
  own. A power which cannot be explained, a spirit, speaks through
  his mouth: the spirit of his race, of his peculiar tradition. He
  stands with his feet firmly planted on the ground, but beneath
  the soles of his feet a mighty current gathers and is
  intensified, flowing through his body and finding its way out
  through his tongue. Then it is the earth itself, the deep earth,
  that flames from his glowing body. But at other times the poet
  has grown, and now towards the heights, and with his brow
  reaching into the heavens, he speaks with a starry voice, with
  cosmic resonance, while he feels the very wind from the stars
  fanning his breast. All is then brotherhood and communion. The
  tiny ant, the soft blade of grass against which his cheek
  sometimes rests, these are not distinct from himself. And he can
  understand them and spy out their secret sound, whose delicate
  note can be heard amidst the rolling of the thunder.<br>
  <br>
  I do not think that the poet is primarily determined by his
  goldsmith's work. Perfection in his work is something which he
  hopes gradually to achieve, and his message will be worth nothing
  if he offers mankind a coarse and inadequate surface. But
  emptiness cannot be covered up by the efforts of a polisher,
  however untiring he may be.<br>
  <br>
  Some poets - this is another problem and one which does not
  concern expression but the point of departure - are poets of
  "minorities". They are artist (how great they are does not
  matter) who owe their individuality to devoting themselves to
  exquisite and limited subjects, to refined details (how delicate
  and profound were the poems that Mallarm&eacute; devoted to fans!),
  to the minutely savoured essences in individuals expressive of
  our detail-burdened civilization.<br>
  <br>
  Other poets (here, too, their stature is of no importance) turn
  to what is enduring in man. Not to that which subtly
  distinguishes but to that which essentially unites. And even
  though they see man in the midst of the civilization of his own
  times, they sense all his pure nakedness radiating immutably from
  beneath his tired vestments. Love, sorrow, hate or death are
  unchanging. These poets are radical poets and they speak to the
  primary, the elemental in man. They cannot feel themselves to be
  the poets of "minorities". Among them I count myself.<br>
  <br>
  And therefore a poet of my kind has what I would call a
  communicative vocation. He wants to make himself heard from
  within each human breast, since his voice is in a way the voice
  of the collective, the collective to which the poet for a moment
  lends his passionate voice. Hence the necessity of being
  understood in languages other than his own. Poetry can only in
  part be translated. But from this zone of authentic
  interpretation the poet has the truly extraordinary experience of
  speaking in another way to other people and being understood by
  them. And then something unexpected occurs: the reader is
  installed, as through a miracle, in a culture which in large
  measure is not his own but in which he can nevertheless feel
  without difficulty the beating of his own heart, which in this
  way communicates and lives in two dimensions of reality: its own
  and that conferred on it by the new home in which it has been
  received. What has been said remains equally true if we turn it
  round and apply it not to the reader but to the poet who has been
  translated into another language. The poet, too, feels himself to
  be like one of those figures encountered in dreams, which
  exhibit, perfectly identified, two distinct personalities. Thus
  it is with the translated author, who feels within himself two
  personae: the one conferred on him by the new verbal attire which
  now covers him and his own genuine personae which, beneath the
  other, still exists and asserts itself.<br>
  <br>
  Thus I conclude by claiming for the poet a role of symbolic
  representation, enshrining as he does in his own person that
  longing for solidarity with humankind for which precisely the
  Nobel Prize was founded.</p>
