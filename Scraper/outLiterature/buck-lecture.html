  <h2>The Chinese Novel</h2>

  <p>Members of the Swedish Academy, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>
When I came to consider what I should say
  today it seemed that it would be wrong not to speak of China. And
  this is none the less true because I am an American by birth and
  by ancestry and though I live now in my own country and shall
  live there, since there I belong. But it is the Chinese and not
  the American novel which has shaped my own efforts in writing. My
  earliest knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories,
  came to me in China. It would be ingratitude on my part not to
  recognize this today. And yet it would be presumptuous to speak
  before you on the subject of the Chinese novel for a reason
  wholly personal. There is another reason why I feel that I may
  properly do so. It is that I believe the Chinese novel has an
  illumination for the Western novel and for the Western
  novelist.<br>
  <br>
  When I say Chinese novel, I mean the indigenous Chinese novel,
  and not that hybrid product, the novels of modern Chinese writers
  who have been too strongly under foreign influence while they
  were yet ignorant of the riches of their own country.<br>
  <br>
  The novel in China was never an art and was never so considered,
  nor did any Chinese novelist think of himself as an artist. The
  Chinese novel its history, its scope, its place in the life of
  the people, so vital a place, must be viewed in the strong light
  of this one fact. It is a fact no doubt strange to you, a company
  of modern Western scholars who today so generously recognize the
  novel.<br>
  <br>
  But in China art and the novel have always been widely separated.
  There, literature as an art was the exclusive property of the
  scholars, an art they made and made for each other according to
  their own rules, and they found no place in it for the novel. And
  they held a powerful place, those Chinese scholars. Philosophy
  and religion and letters and literature, by arbitrary classical
  rules, they possessed them all, for they alone possessed the
  means of learning, since they alone knew how to read and write.
  They were powerful enough to be feared even by emperors, so that
  emperors devised a way of keeping them enslaved by their own
  learning, and made the official examinations the only means to
  political advancement, those incredibly difficult examinations
  which ate up a man's whole life and thought in preparing for
  them, and kept him too busy with memorizing and copying the dead
  and classical past to see the present and its wrongs. In that
  past the scholars found their rules of art. But the novel was not
  there, and they did not see it being created before their eyes,
  for the people created the novel, and what living people were
  doing did not interest those who thought of literature as an art.
  If scholars ignored the people, however, the people, in turn,
  laughed at the scholars. They made innumerable jokes about them,
  of which this is a fair sample: One day a company of wild beasts
  met on a hillside for a hunt. They bargained with each other to
  go out and hunt all day and meet again at the end of the day to
  share what they had killed. At the end of the day, only the tiger
  returned with nothing. When he was asked how this happened he
  replied very disconsolately, &laquo;At dawn I met a schoolboy, but
  he was, I feared, too callow for your tastes. I met no more until
  noon, when I found a priest. But I let him go, knowing him to be
  full of nothing but wind. The day went on and I grew desperate,
  for I passed no one. Then as dark came on I found a scholar. But
  I knew there was no use in bringing him back since he would be so
  dry and hard that he would break our teeth if we tried them on
  him.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  The scholar as a class has long been a figure of fun for the
  Chinese people. He is frequently to be found in their novels, and
  always he is the same, as indeed he is in life, for a long study
  of the same dead classics and their formal composition has really
  made all Chinese scholars look alike, as well as think alike. We
  have no class to parallel him in the West - individuals, perhaps,
  only. But in China he was a class. Here he is, composite, as the
  people see him: a small shrunken figure with a bulging forehead,
  a pursed mouth, a nose at once snub and pointed, small
  inconspicuous eyes behind spectacles, a high pedantic voice,
  always announcing rules that do not matter to anyone but himself,
  a boundless self-conceit, a complete scorn not only of the common
  people but of all other scholars, a figure in long shabby robes,
  moving with a swaying haughty walk, when he moved at all. He was
  not to be seen except at literary gatherings, for most of the
  time he spent reading dead literature and trying to write more
  like it. He hated anything fresh or original, for he could not
  catalogue it into any of the styles he knew. If he could not
  catalogue it, he was sure it was not great, and he was confident
  that only he was right. If he said, &laquo;Here is art&raquo;, he
  was convinced it was not to be found anywhere else, for what he
  did not recognize did not exist. And as he could never catalogue
  the novel into what he called literature, so for him it did not
  exist as literature.<br>
  <br>
  Yao Hai, one of the greatest of Chinese literary critics, in 1776
  enumerated the kinds of writing which comprise the whole of
  literature. They are essays, government commentaries,
  biographies, epitaphs, epigrams, poetry, funeral eulogies, and
  histories. No novels, you perceive, although by that date the
  Chinese novel had already reached its glorious height, after
  centuries of development among the common Chinese people. Nor
  does that vast compilation of Chinese literature, <i>Ssu Ku Chuen
  Shu</i>, made in 1772 by the order of the great Emperor Ch'ien
  Lung, contain the novel in the encyclopedia of its literature
  proper.<br>
  <br>
  No, happily for the Chinese novel, it was not considered by the
  scholars as literature. Happily, too, for the novelist! Man and
  book, they were free from the criticisms of those scholars and
  their requirements of art, their techniques of expression and
  their talk of literary significances and all that discussion of
  what is and is not art, as if art were an absolute and not the
  changing thing it is, fluctuating even within decades! The
  Chinese novel was free. It grew as it liked out of its own soil,
  the common people, nurtured by that heartiest of sunshine,
  popular approval, and untouched by the cold and frosty winds of
  the scholar's art. Emily Dickinson, an American poet, once wrote,
  &laquo;Nature is a haunted house, but art is a house that tries to
  be haunted&raquo;. &laquo;Nature&raquo;, she said,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Is what we see,<br>
    Nature is what we know<br>
    But have no art to say -<br>
    So impatient our wisdom is,<br>
    To her simplicity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>No, if the Chinese scholars ever knew of
  the growth of the novel, it was only to ignore it the more
  ostentatiously. Sometimes, unfortunately, they found themselves
  driven to take notice, because youthful emperors found novels
  pleasant to read. Then these poor scholars were hard put to it.
  But they discovered the phrase &laquo;social significance&raquo;,
  and they wrote long literary treatises to prove that a novel was
  not a novel but a document of social significance. Social
  significance is a term recently discovered by the most modern of
  literary young men and women in the United States, but the old
  scholars of China knew it a thousand years ago, when they, too,
  demanded that the novel should have social significance, if it
  were to be recognized as an art.<br>
  <br>
  But for the most part the old Chinese scholar reasoned thus about
  the novel:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Literature is art.<br>
    All art has social significance.<br>
    This book has no social significance.<br>
    Therefore it is not literature.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And so the novel in China was not
  literature.<br>
  <br>
  In such a school was I trained. I grew up believing that the
  novel has nothing to do with pure literature. So I was taught by
  scholars. The art of literature, so I was taught, is something
  devised by men of learning. Out of the brains of scholars came
  rules to control the rush of genius, that wild fountain which has
  its source in deepest life. Genius, great or less, is the spring,
  and art is the sculptured shape, classical or modern, into which
  the waters must be forced, if scholars and critics were to be
  served. But the people of China did not so serve. The waters of
  the genius of story gushed out as they would, however the natural
  rocks allowed and the trees persuaded, and only common people
  came and drank and found rest and pleasure.<br>
  <br>
  For the novel in China was the peculiar product of the common
  people. And it was solely their property. The very language of
  the novel was their own language, and not the classical Wen-li,
  which was the language of literature and the scholars. Wen-li
  bore somewhat the same resemblance to the language of the people
  as the ancient English of Chaucer does to the English of today,
  although ironically enough, at one time Wen-li, too, was a
  vernacular. But the scholars never kept pace with the living,
  changing speech of the people. They clung to an old vernacular
  until they had made it classic, while the running language of the
  people went on and left them far behind. Chinese novels, then,
  are in the &laquo;Pei Hua&raquo;, or simple talk, of the people,
  and this in itself was offensive to the old scholars because it
  resulted in a style so full of easy flow and readability that it
  had no technique of expression in it, the scholars said.<br>
  <br>
  I should pause to make an exception of certain scholars who came
  to China from India, bearing as their gift a new religion,
  Buddhism. In the West, Puritanism was for a long time the enemy
  of the novel. But in the Orient the Buddhists were wiser. When
  they came into China, they found literature already remote from
  the people and dying under the formalism of that period known in
  history as the Six Dynasties. The professional men of literature
  were even then absorbed not so much in what they had to say as in
  pairing into couplets the characters of their essays and their
  poems, and already they scorned all writing which did not conform
  to their own rules. Into this confined literary atmosphere came
  the Buddhist translators with their great treasures of the freed
  spirit. Some of them were Indian, but some were Chinese. They
  said frankly that their aim was not to conform to the ideas of
  style of the literary men, but to make clear and simple to common
  people what they had to teach. They put their religious teachings
  into the common language, the language which the novel used, and
  because the people loved story, they took story and made it a
  means of teaching. The preface of Fah Shu Ching, one of the most
  famous of Buddhist books, says, &laquo;When giving the words of
  gods, these words should be given forth simply.&raquo; This might
  be taken as the sole literary creed of the Chinese novelist, to
  whom, indeed, gods were men and men were gods.<br>
  <br>
  For the Chinese novel was written primarily to amuse the common
  people. And when I say amuse I do not mean only to make them
  laugh, though laughter is also one of the aims of the Chinese
  novel. I mean amusement in the sense of absorbing and occupying
  the whole attention of the mind. I mean enlightening that mind by
  pictures of life and what that life means. I mean encouraging the
  spirit not by rule-of-thumb talk about art, but by stories about
  the people in every age, and thus presenting to people simply
  themselves. Even the Buddhists who came to tell about gods found
  that people understood gods better if they saw them working
  through ordinary folk like themselves.<br>
  <br>
  But the real reason why the Chinese novel was written in the
  vernacular was because the common people could not read and write
  and the novel had to be written so that when it was read aloud it
  could be understood by persons who could communicate only through
  spoken words. In a village of two hundred souls perhaps only one
  man could read. And on holidays or in the evening when the work
  was done he read aloud to the people from some story. The rise of
  the Chinese novel began in just this simple fashion. After a
  while people took up a collection of pennies in somebody's cap or
  in a farm wife's bowl because the reader needed tea to wet his
  throat, or perhaps to pay him for time he would otherwise have
  spent at his silk loom or his rush weaving. If the collections
  grew big enough he gave up some of his regular work and became a
  professional storyteller. And the stories he read were the
  beginnings of novels. There were not many such stories written
  down, not nearly enough to last year in and year out for people
  who had by nature, as the Chinese have, a strong love for
  dramatic story. So the storyteller began to increase his stock.
  He searched the dry annals of the history which the scholars had
  written, and with his fertile imagination, enriched by long
  acquaintance with common people, he clothed long-dead figures
  with new flesh and made them live again; he found stories of
  court life and intrigue and names of imperial favorites who had
  brought dynasties to ruin; he found, as he traveled from village
  to village, strange tales from his own times which he wrote down
  when he heard them. People told him of experiences they had had
  and he wrote these down, too, for other people. And he
  embellished them, but not with literary turns and phrases, for
  the people cared nothing for these. No, he kept his audiences
  always in mind and he found that the style which they loved best
  was one which flowed easily along, clearly and simply, in the
  short words which they themselves used every day, with no other
  technique than occasional bits of description, only enough to
  give vividness to a place or a person, and never enough to delay
  the story. Nothing must delay the story. Story was what they
  wanted.<br>
  <br>
  And when I say story, I do not mean mere pointless activity, not
  crude action alone. The Chinese are too mature for that. They
  have always demanded of their novel character above all else.
  <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i> they have considered one of their three
  greatest novels, not primarily because it is full of the flash
  and fire of action, but because it portrays so distinctly one
  hundred and eight characters that each is to be seen separate
  from the others. Often I have heard it said of that novel in
  tones of delight, &laquo;When anyone of the hundred and eight
  begins to speak, we do not need to be told his name. By the way
  the words come from his mouth we know who he is.&raquo; Vividness
  of character portrayal, then, is the first quality which the
  Chinese people have demanded of their novels, and after it, that
  such portrayal shall be by the character's own action and words
  rather than by the author's explanation.<br>
  <br>
  Curiously enough, while the novel was beginning thus humbly in
  teahouses, in villages and lowly city streets out of stories told
  to the common people by a common and unlearned man among them, in
  imperial palaces it was beginning, too, and in much the same
  unlearned fashion. It was an old custom of emperors, particularly
  if the dynasty were a foreign one, to employ persons called
  &laquo;imperial ears&raquo;, whose only duty was to come and go
  among the people in the streets of cities and villages and to sit
  among them in teahouses, disguised in common clothes and listen
  to what was talked about there. The original purpose of this was,
  of course, to hear of any discontent among the emperor's
  subjects, and more especially to find out if discontents were
  rising to the shape of those rebellions which preceded the fall
  of every dynasty.<br>
  <br>
  But emperors were very human and they were not often learned
  scholars. More often, indeed, they were only spoiled and willful
  men. The &laquo;imperial ears. had opportunity to hear all sorts
  of strange and interesting stories, and they found that their
  royal masters were more frequently interested in these stories
  than they were in politics. So when they came back to make their
  reports, they flattered the emperor and sought to gain favor by
  telling him what he liked to hear, shut up as he was in the
  Forbidden City, away from life. They told him the strange and
  interesting things which common people did, who were free, and
  after a while they took to writing down what they heard in order
  to save memory. And I do not doubt that if messengers between the
  emperor and the people carried stories in one direction, they
  carried them in the other, too, and to the people they told
  stories about the emperor and what he said and did, and how he
  quarrelled with the empress who bore him no sons, and how she
  intrigued with the chief eunuch to poison the favorite concubine,
  all of which delighted the Chinese because it proved to them, the
  most democratic of peoples, that their emperor was after all only
  a common fellow like themselves and that he, too, had his
  troubles, though he was the Son of Heaven. Thus there began
  another important source for the novel that was to develop with
  such form and force, though still always denied its right to
  exist by the professional man of letters.<br>
  <br>
  From such humble and scattered beginnings, then, came the Chinese
  novel, written always in the vernacular, and dealing with all
  which interested the people, with legend and with myth, with love
  and intrigue, with brigands and wars, with everything, indeed,
  which went to make up the life of the people, high and low.<br>
  <br>
  Nor was the novel in China shaped, as it was in the West, by a
  few great persons. In China the novel has always been more
  important than the novelist. There has been no Chinese Defoe, no
  Chinese Fielding or Smollett, no Austin or Bront&euml; or Dickens
  or Thackeray, or Meredith or Hardy, any more than Balzac or
  Flaubert. But there were and are novels as great as the novels in
  any other country in the world, as great as any could have
  written, had he been born in China. Who then wrote these novels
  of China?<br>
  <br>
  That is what the modern literary men of China now, centuries too
  late, are trying to discover. Within the last twenty-five years
  literary critics, trained in the universities of the West, have
  begun to discover their own neglected novels. But the novelists
  who wrote them they cannot discover. Did one man write <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i>, or did it grow to its present shape, added to,
  rearranged, deepened and developed by many minds and many a hand,
  in different centuries? Who can now tell? They are dead. They
  lived in their day and wrote what in their day they saw and
  heard, but of themselves they have told nothing. The author of
  <i>The Dream of the Red Chamber</i> in a far later century says
  in the preface to his book, &laquo;It is not necessary to know the
  times of Han and T'ang - it is necessary to tell only of my own
  times.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  They told of their own times and they lived in a blessed
  obscurity. They read no reviews of their novels, no treatises as
  to whether or not what they did was well done according to the
  rules of scholarship. It did not occur to them that they must
  reach the high thin air which scholars breathed nor - did they
  consider the stuff of which greatness is made, according to the
  scholars. They wrote as it pleased them to write and as they were
  able. Sometimes they wrote unwittingly well and sometimes
  unwittingly they wrote not so well. They died in the same happy
  obscurity and now they are lost in it and not all the scholars of
  China, gathered too late to do them honor, can raise them up
  again. They are long past the possibility of literary
  post-mortems. But what they did remains after them because it is
  the common people of China who keep alive the great novels,
  illiterate people who have passed the novel, not so often from
  hand to hand as from mouth to mouth.<br>
  <br>
  In the preface to one of the later editions of <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i>, Shih Nai An, an author who had much to do with the
  making of that novel, writes, &laquo;What I speak of I wish people
  to understand easily. Whether the reader is good or evil, learned
  or unlearned, anyone can read this book. Whether or not the book
  is well done is not important enough to cause anyone to worry.
  Alas, I am born to die. How can I know what those who come after
  me who read my book will think of it? I cannot even know what I
  myself, born into another incarnation, will think of it. I do not
  know if I myself then can even read. Why therefore should I
  care?&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  Strangely enough, there were certain scholars who envied the
  freedom of obscurity, and who, burdened with certain private
  sorrows which they dared not tell anyone, or who perhaps wanting
  only a holiday from the weariness of the sort of art they had
  themselves created, wrote novels, too under assumed and humble
  names. And when they did so they put aside pedantry and wrote as
  simply and naturally as any common novelist.<br>
  <br>
  For the novelist believed that he should not be conscious of
  techniques. He should write as his material demanded. If a
  novelist became known for a particular style or technique, to
  that extent he ceased to be a good novelist and became a literary
  technician.<br>
  <br>
  A good novelist, or so I have been taught in China, should be
  above all else <i>tse ran</i>, that is, natural, unaffected, and
  so flexible and variable as to be wholly at the command of the
  material that flows through him. His whole duty is only to sort
  life as it flows through him, and in the vast fragmentariness of
  time and space and event to discover essential and inherent order
  and rhythm and shape. We should never be able, merely by reading
  pages, to know who wrote them, for when the style of a novelist
  becomes fixed, that style becomes his prison. The Chinese
  novelists varied their writing to accompany like music their
  chosen themes.<br>
  <br>
  These Chinese novels are not perfect according to Western
  standards. They are not always planned from beginning to end, nor
  are they compact, any more than life is planned or compact. They
  are often too long, too full of incident, too crowded with
  character, a medley of fact and fiction as to material, and a
  medley of romance and realism as to method, so that an impossible
  event of magic or dream may be described with such exact
  semblance of detail that one is compelled to belief against all
  reason. The earliest novels are full of folklore, for the people
  of those times thought and dreamed in the ways of folklore. But
  no one can understand the mind of China today who has not read
  these novels, for the novels have shaped the present mind, too,
  and the folklore persists in spite of all that Chinese diplomats
  and Western-trained scholars would have us believe to the
  contrary. The essential mind of China is still that mind of which
  George Russell wrote when he said of the Irish mind, so strangely
  akin to the Chinese,&laquo; that mind which in its folk
  imagination believes anything. It creates ships of gold with
  masts of silver and white cities by the sea and rewards and
  faeries, and when that vast folk mind turns to politics it is
  ready to believe anything.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  Out of this folk mind, turned into stories and crowded with
  thousands of years of life, grew, literally, the Chinese novel.
  For these novels changed as they grew. If, as I have said, there
  are no single names attached beyond question to the great novels
  of China, it is because no one hand wrote them. From beginning as
  a mere tale, a story grew through succeeding versions, into a
  structure built by many hands. I might mention as an example the
  well-known story, <i>The White Snake</i>, or <i>Pei She
  Chuan</i>, first written in the T'ang dynasty by an unknown
  author. It was then a tale of the simple supernatural whose hero
  was a great white snake. In the next version in the following
  century, the snake has become a vampire woman who is an evil
  force. But the third version contains a more gentle and human
  touch. The vampire becomes a faithful wife who aids her husband
  and gives him a son. The story thus adds not only new character
  but new quality, and ends not as the supernatural tale it began
  but as a novel of human beings.<br>
  <br>
  So in early periods of Chinese history, many books must be called
  not so much novels as source books for novels, the sort of books
  into which Shakespeare, had they been open to him, might have
  dipped with both hands to bring up pebbles to make into jewels.
  Many of these books have been lost, since they were not
  considered valuable. But not all - early stories of Han, written
  so vigorously that to this day it is said they run like galloping
  horses, and tales of the troubled dynasties following - not all
  were lost. Some have persisted. In the Ming dynasty, in one way
  or another, many of them were represented in the great collection
  known as <i>T'ai P'ing Kuan Shi</i>, wherein are tales of
  superstition and religion, of mercy and goodness and reward for
  evil and well doing, tales of dreams and miracles, of dragons and
  gods and goddesses and priests, of tigers and foxes and
  transmigration and resurrection from the dead. Most of these
  early stories had to do with supernatural events, of gods born of
  virgins, of men walking as gods, as the Buddhist influence grew
  strong. There are miracles and allegories, such as the pens of
  poor scholars bursting into flower, dreams leading men and women
  into strange and fantastic lands of Gulliver, or the magic wand
  that floated an altar made of iron. But stories mirrored each
  age. The stories of Han were vigorous and dealt often with the
  affairs of the nation, and centered on some great man or hero.
  Humor was strong in this golden age, a racy, earthy, lusty humor,
  such as was to be found, for instance, in a book of tales
  entitled <i>Siao Ling</i>, presumed to have been collected, if
  not partly written, by Han Tang Suan. And then the scenes
  changed, as that golden age faded, though it was never to be
  forgotten, so that to this day the Chinese like to call
  themselves sons of Han. With the succeeding weak and corrupt
  centuries, the very way the stories were written became honeyed
  and weak, and their subjects slight, or as the Chinese say,
  &laquo;In the days of the Six Dynasties, they wrote of small
  things, of a woman, a waterfall, or a bird.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  If the Han dynasty was golden, then the T'ang dynasty was silver,
  and silver were the love stories for which it was famous. It was
  an age of love, when a thousand stories clustered about the
  beautiful Yang Kuei Fei and her scarcely less beautiful
  predecessor in the emperor's favor, Mei Fei. These love stories
  of T'ang come very near sometimes to fulfilling in their unity
  and complexity the standards of the Western novel. There are
  rising action and crisis and d&eacute;nouement, implicit if not
  expressed. The Chinese say, &laquo;We must read the stories of
  T'ang, because though they deal with small matters, yet they are
  written in so moving a manner that the tears come.<br>
  <br>
  It is not surprising that most of these love stories deal not
  with love that ends in marriage or is contained in marriage, but
  with love outside the marriage relationship. Indeed, it is
  significant that when marriage is the theme the story nearly
  always ends in tragedy. Two famous stories, <i>Pei Li Shi</i> and
  <i>Chiao Fang Chi</i>, deal entirely with extramarital love, and
  are written apparently to show the superiority of the courtesans,
  who could read and write and sing and were clever and beautiful
  besides, beyond the ordinary wife who was, as the Chinese say
  even today, &laquo;a yellow-faced woman&nbsp;&raquo;, and usually
  illiterate.<br>
  <br>
  So strong did this tendency become that officialdom grew alarmed
  at the popularity of such stories among the common people, and
  they were denounced as revolutionary and dangerous because it was
  thought they attacked that foundation of Chinese civilization,
  the family system. A reactionary tendency was not lacking, such
  as is to be seen in <i>Hui Chen Chi</i>, one of the earlier forms
  of a famous later work, the story of the young scholar who loved
  the beautiful Ying Ying and who renounced her, saying prudently
  as he went away, &laquo;All extraordinary women are dangerous.
  They destroy themselves and others. They have ruined even
  emperors. I am not an emperor and I had better give her up&nbsp;&raquo;
  - which he did, to the admiration of all wise men. And to him the
  modest Ying Ying replied, &laquo;If you possess me and leave me,
  it is your right. I do not reproach you.&raquo; But five hundred
  years later the sentimentality of the Chinese popular heart comes
  forth and sets the thwarted romance right again. In this last
  version of the story the author makes Chang and Ying Ying husband
  and wife and says in closing, &laquo;This is in the hope that all
  the lovers of the world may be united in happy marriage.&raquo;
  And as time goes in China, five hundred years is not long to wait
  for a happy ending.<br>
  <br>
  This story, by the way, is one of China's most famous. It was
  repeated in the Sung dynasty in a poetic form by Chao Teh Liang,
  under the title <i>The Reluctant Butterfly</i>, and again in the
  Yuan dynasty by Tung Chai-yuen as a drama to be sung, entitled
  <i>Suh Hsi Hsiang</i>. In the Ming dynasty, with two versions
  intervening, it appears as Li Reh Hua's <i>Nan Hsi Hsiang
  Chi</i>, written in the southern metrical form called
  &laquo;ts'e&raquo;, and so to the last and most famous <i>Hsi
  Hsiang Chi</i>. Even children in China know the name of Chang
  Sen.<br>
  <br>
  If I seem to emphasize the romances of the T'ang period, it is
  because romance between man and woman is the chief gift of T'ang
  to the novel, and not because there were no other stories. There
  were many novels of a humorous and satirical nature and one
  curious type of story which concerned itself with cockfighting,
  an important pastime of that age and particularly in favor at
  court. One of the best of these tales is <i>Tung Chen Lao Fu
  Chuan</i>, by Ch'en Hung, which tells how Chia Chang, a famous
  cockfighter, became so famous that he was loved by emperor and
  people alike.<br>
  <br>
  But time and the stream pass on. The novel form really begins to
  be clear in the Sung dynasty, and in the Yuan dynasty it flowers
  into that height which was never again surpassed and only
  equalled, indeed, by the single novel <i>Hung Lou Meng</i>, or
  <i>The Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, in the Ts'ing dynasty. It is
  as though for centuries the novel had been developing unnoticed
  and from deep roots among the people, spreading into trunk and
  branch and twig and leaf to burst into this flowering in the Yuan
  dynasty, when the young Mongols brought into the old country they
  had conquered their vigorous, hungry, untutored minds and
  demanded to be fed. Such minds could not be fed with the husks of
  the old classical literature, and they turned therefore the more
  eagerly to the drama and the novel, and in this new life, in the
  sunshine of imperial favor, though still not with literary favor,
  there came two of China's three great novels, <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i> and <i>San Kuo-Hung Lou Meng</i> being the third.<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could convey to you what these three novels mean and
  have meant to the Chinese people. But I can think of nothing
  comparable to them in Western literature. We have not in the
  history of our novel so clear a moment to which we can point and
  say, &laquo;There the novel is at its height.&raquo; These three
  are the vindication of that literature of the common people, the
  Chinese novel. They stand as completed monuments of that popular
  literature, if not of letters. They, too, were ignored by men of
  letters and banned by censors and damned in succeeding dynasties
  as dangerous, revolutionary, decadent. But they lived on, because
  people read them and told them as stories and sang them as songs
  and ballads and acted them as dramas, until at last grudgingly
  even the scholars were compelled to notice them and to begin to
  say they were not novels at all but allegories, and if they were
  allegories perhaps then they could be looked upon as literature
  after all, though the people paid no heed to such theories and
  never read the long treatises which scholars wrote to prove them.
  They rejoiced in the novels they had made as novels and for no
  purpose except for joy in story and in story through which they
  could express themselves.<br>
  <br>
  And indeed the people had made them. <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i>, though
  the modern versions carry the name of Shi Nai An as author, was
  written by no one man. Out of a handful of tales centering in the
  Sung dynasty about a band of robbers there grew this great,
  structured novel. Its beginnings were in history. The original
  lair which the robbers held still exists in Shantung, or did
  until very recent times. Those times of the thirteenth century of
  our Western era were, in China, sadly distorted. The dynasty
  under the emperor Huei Chung was falling into decadence and
  disorder. The rich grew richer and the poor poorer and when none
  other came forth to set this right, these righteous robbers came
  forth.<br>
  <br>
  I cannot here tell you fully of the long growth of this novel,
  nor of its changes at many hands. Shih Nai An, it is said, found
  it in rude form in an old book shop and took it home and rewrote
  it. After him the story was still told and re-told. Five or six
  versions of it today have importance, one with a hundred chapters
  entitled <i>Chung I Shui Hu</i>, one of a hundred and
  twenty-seven chapters, and one of a hundred chapters. The
  original version attributed to Shih Nai An, had a hundred and
  twenty chapters, but the one most used today has only seventy.
  This is the version arranged in the Ming dynasty by the famous
  Ching Shen T'an, who said that it was idle to forbid his son to
  read the book and therefore presented the lad with a copy revised
  by himself, knowing that no boy could ever refrain from reading
  it. There is also a version written under official command, when
  officials found that nothing could keep the people from reading
  <i>Shui Hu</i>. This official version is entitled <i>Tung K'ou
  Chi</i>, or, <i>Laying Waste the Robbers</i>, and it tells of the
  final defeat of the robbers by the state army and their
  destruction. But the common people of China are nothing if not
  independent. They have never adopted the official version, and
  their own form of the novel still stands. It is a struggle they
  know all too well, the struggle of everyday people against a
  corrupt officialdom.<br>
  <br>
  I might add that <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i> is in partial translation
  in French under the title <i>Les Chevaliers Chinois</i>, and the
  seventy-chapter version is in complete English translation by
  myself under the title <i>All Men Are Brothers</i>. The original
  title, <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i>, in English is meaningless, denoting
  merely the watery margins of the famous marshy lake which was the
  robbers' lair. To Chinese the words invoke instant century-old
  memory, but not to us.<br>
  <br>
  This novel has survived everything and in this new day in China
  has taken on an added significance. The Chinese Communists have
  printed their own edition of it with a preface by a famous
  Communist and have issued it anew as the first Communist
  literature of China. The proof of the novel's greatness is in
  this timelessness. It is as true today as it was dynasties ago.
  The people of China still march across its pages, priests and
  courtesans, merchants and scholars, women good and bad, old and
  young, and even naughty little boys. The only figure lacking is
  that of the modern scholar trained in the West, holding his Ph.D.
  diploma in his hand. But be sure that if he had been alive in
  China when the final hand laid down the brush upon the pages of
  that book, he, too, would have been there in all the pathos and
  humor of his new learning, so often useless and inadequate and
  laid like a patch too small upon an old robe.<br>
  <br>
  The Chinese say &laquo;The young should not read <i>Shui Hu</i>
  and the old should not read <i>San Kuo</i>.&raquo; This is because
  the young might be charmed into being robbers and the old might
  be led into deeds too vigorous for their years. For if <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i> is the great social document of Chinese life, <i>Sa
  Kuo</i> is the document of wars and statesmanship, and in its
  turn <i>Hung Lou Meng</i> is the document of family life and
  human love.<br>
  <br>
  The history of the <i>San Kuo</i> or <i>Three Kingdoms</i> shows
  the same architectural structure and the same doubtful authorship
  as <i>Shui Hu</i>. The story begins with three friends swearing
  eternal brotherhood in the Han dynasty and ends ninety-seven
  years later in the succeeding period of the Six Dynasties. It is
  a novel rewritten in its final form by a man named Lo Kuan Chung,
  thought to be a pupil of Shih Nai An, and one who perhaps even
  shared with Shih Nai An in the writing, too, of <i>Shui Hu
  Chuan</i>. But this is a Chinese Baconand-Shakespeare controversy
  which has no end.<br>
  <br>
  Lo Kuan Chung was born in the late Yuan dynasty and lived on into
  the Ming. He wrote many dramas, but he is more famous for his
  novels, of which <i>San Kuo</i> is easily the best. The version
  of this novel now most commonly used in China is the one revised
  in the time of K'ang Hsi by Mao Chen Kan, who revised as well as
  criticised the book. He changed, added and omitted material, as
  for example when he added the story of Suan Fu Ren, the wife of
  one of the chief characters. He altered even the style. If
  <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i> has importance today as a novel of the
  people in their struggle for liberty, <i>San Kuo</i> has
  importance because it gives in such detail the science and art of
  war as the Chinese conceive it, so differently, too, from our
  own. The guerillas, who are today China's most effective fighting
  units against Japan, are peasants who know San Kuo by heart, if
  not from their own reading, at least from hours spent in the
  idleness of winter days or long summer evenings when they sat
  listening to the storytellers describe how the warriors of the
  Three Kingdoms fought their battles. It is these ancient tactics
  of war which the guerillas trust today. What a warrior must be
  and how he must attack and retreat, how retreat when the enemy
  advances, how advance when the enemy retreats - all this had its
  source in this novel, so well known to every common man and boy
  of China.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Hung Lou Meng</i>, or <i>The Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, the
  latest and most modern of these three greatest of Chinese novels,
  was written originally as an autobiographical novel by Ts'ao
  Hs&uuml;eh Ching, an official highly in favor during the Manchu
  regime and indeed considered by the Manchus as one of themselves.
  There were then eight military groups among the Manchus, and
  Tstao Hs&uuml;eh Ching belonged to them all. He never finished
  his novel, and the last forty chapters were added by another man,
  probably named Kao O. The thesis that Ts'ao Hs&uuml;eh Ching was
  telling the story of his own life has been in modern times
  elaborated by Hu Shih, and in earlier times by Yuan Mei. Be this
  as it may, the original title of the book was <i>Shih T'ou
  Chi</i>, and it came out of Peking about 1765 of the Western era,
  and in five or six years, an incredibly short time in China, it
  was famous everywhere. Printing was still expensive when it
  appeared, and the book became known by the method that is called
  in China,
  &laquo;You-lend-me-a-book-and-I-lend-you-a-book&raquo;.<br>
  <br>
  The story is simple in its theme but complex in implication, in
  character study and in its portrayal of human emotions. It is
  almost a pathological study, this story of a great house, once
  wealthy and high in imperial favor, so that indeed one of its
  members was an imperial concubine. But the great days are over
  when the book begins. The family is already declining. Its wealth
  is being dissipated and the last and only son, Chia Pao Y&uuml;,
  is being corrupted by the decadent influences within his own
  home, although the fact that he was a youth of exceptional
  quality at birth is established by the symbolism of a piece of
  jade found in his mouth. The preface begins, &laquo;Heaven was
  once broken and when it was mended, a bit was left unused, and
  this became the famous jade of Chia Pao Y&uuml;.&raquo; Thus does
  the interest in the supernatural persist in the Chinese people;
  it persists even today as a part of Chinese life.<br>
  <br>
  This novel seized hold of the people primarily because it
  portrayed the problems of their own family system, the absolute
  power of women in the home, the too great power of the
  matriarchy, the grandmother, the mother, and even the bondmaids,
  so often young and beautiful and fatally dependent, who became
  too frequently the playthings of the sons of the house and ruined
  them and were ruined by them. Women reigned supreme in the
  Chinese house, and because they were wholly confined in its walls
  and often illiterate, they ruled to the hurt of all. They kept
  men children, and protected them from hardship and effort when
  they should not have been so protected. Such a one was Chia Pao
  Y&uuml;, and we follow him to his tragic end in <i>Hung Lou
  Meng</i>.<br>
  <br>
  I cannot tell you to what lengths of allegory scholars went to
  explain away this novel when they found that again even the
  emperor was reading it and that its influence was so great
  everywhere among the people. I do not doubt that they were
  probably reading it themselves in secret. A great many popular
  jokes in China have to do with scholars reading novels privately
  and publicly pretending never to have heard of them. At any rate,
  scholars wrote treatises to prove that <i>Hung Lou Meng</i> was
  not a novel but a political allegory depicting the decline of
  China under the foreign rule of the Manchus, the word Red in the
  title signifying Manchu, and Ling Tai Y&uuml;, the young girl who
  dies, although she was the one destined to marry Pao Y&uuml;,
  signifying China, and Pao Ts'ai, her successful rival, who
  secures the jade in her place, standing for the foreigner, and so
  forth. The very name Chia signified, they said, falseness. But
  this was a farfetched explanation of what was written as a novel
  and stands as a novel and as such a powerful delineation, in the
  characteristic Chinese mixture of realism and romance, of a proud
  and powerful family in decline. Crowded with men and women of the
  several generations accustomed to living under one roof in China,
  it stands alone as an intimate description of that life.<br>
  <br>
  In so emphasizing these three novels, I have merely done what the
  Chinese themselves do. When you say &laquo;novel&raquo;, the
  average Chinese replies, &laquo; Shui Hu, San Kuo, Hung Lou
  Meng.&raquo; Yet this is not to say that there are not hundreds of
  other novels, for there are. I must mention <i>Hsi Y&uuml;
  Chi</i>, or <i>Record of Travels in the West</i>, almost as
  popular as these three. I might mention <i>Feng Shen Chuan</i>,
  the story of a deified warrior, the author unknown but said to be
  a writer in the time of Ming. I must mention <i>Ru Ling Wai
  Shi</i>, a satire upon the evils of the Tsing dynasty,
  particularly of the scholars, full of a double-edged though not
  malicious dialogue, rich with incident, pathetic and humorous.
  The fun here is made of the scholars who can do nothing
  practical, who are lost in the world of useful everyday things,
  who are so bound by convention that nothing original can come
  from them. The book, though long, has no central character. Each
  figure is linked to the next by the thread of incident, person
  and incident passing on together until, as Lu Hs&uuml;n, the
  famous modern Chinese writer, has said, &laquo;they are like
  scraps of brilliant silk and satin sewed together.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  And there is <i>Yea Shou Pei Yin</i>, or <i>An Old Hermit Talks
  in the Sun</i>, written by a famous man disappointed in official
  preferment, Shia of Kiang-yin, and there is that strangest of
  books, <i>Ching Hua Yuen</i>, a fantasy of women, whose ruler was
  an empress, whose scholars were all women. It is designed to show
  that the wisdom of women is equal to that of men, although I must
  acknowledge that the book ends with a war between men and women
  in which the men are triumphant and the empress is supplanted by
  an emperor.<br>
  <br>
  But I can mention only a small fraction of the hundreds of novels
  which delight the common people of China. And if those people
  knew of what I was speaking to you today, they would after all
  say &laquo;tell of the great three, and let us stand or fall by
  <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i> and <i>San Kuo</i> and <i>Hung Lou
  Meng</i>.&raquo; In these three novels are the lives which the
  Chinese people lead and have long led, here are the songs they
  sing and the things at which they laugh and the things which they
  love to do. Into these novels they have put the generations of
  their being and to refresh that being they return to these novels
  again and again, and out of them they have made new songs and
  plays and other novels. Some of them have come to be almost as
  famous as the great originals, as for example <i>Ching P'ing
  Mei</i>, that classic of romantic physical love, taken from a
  single incident in <i>Shui Hu Chuan</i>.<br>
  <br>
  But the important thing for me today is not the listing of
  novels. The aspect which I wish to stress is that all this
  profound and indeed sublime development of the imagination of a
  great democratic people was never in its own time and country
  called literature. The very name for story was &laquo;hsiao shuo
 &nbsp;&raquo;, denoting something slight and valueless, and even a novel
  was only a &laquo;ts'ang p'ien hsiao shuo&nbsp;&raquo;, or a longer
  something which was still slight and useless. No, the people of
  China forged their own literature apart from letters. And today
  this is what lives, to be part of what is to come, and all the
  formal literature, which was called art, is dead. The plots of
  these novels are often incomplete, the love interest is often not
  brought to solution, heroines are often not beautiful and heroes
  often are not brave. Nor has the story always an end; sometimes
  it merely stops, in the way life does, in the middle of it when
  death is not expected.<br>
  <br>
  In this tradition of the novel have I been born and reared as a
  writer. My ambition, therefore, has not been trained toward the
  beauty of letters or the grace of art. It is, I believe, a sound
  teaching and, as I have said, illuminating for the novels of the
  West.<br>
  <br>
  For here is the essence of the attitude of Chinese novelists -
  perhaps the result of the contempt in which they were held by
  those who considered themselves the priests of art. I put it thus
  in my own words, for none of them has done so.<br>
  <br>
  The instinct which creates <i>the arts</i> is not the same as
  that which produces art. The creative instinct is, in its final
  analysis and in its simplest terms, an enormous extra vitality, a
  super-energy, born inexplicably in an individual, a vitality
  great beyond all the needs of his own living - an energy which no
  single life can consume. This energy consumes itself then in
  creating more life, in the form of music, painting, writing, or
  whatever is its most natural medium of expression. Nor can the
  individual keep himself from this process, because only by its
  full function is he relieved of the burden of this extra and
  peculiar energy - an energy at once physical and mental, so that
  all his senses are more alert and more profound than another
  man's, and all his brain more sensitive and quickened to that
  which his senses reveal to him in such abundance that actuality
  overflows into imagination. It is a process proceeding from
  within. It is the heightened activity of every cell of his being,
  which sweeps not only himself, but all human life about him, or
  in him, in his dreams, into the circle of its activity.<br>
  <br>
  From the product of this activity, art is deducted - but not by
  him. The process which creates is not the process which deduces
  the shapes of art. The defining of art, therefore, is a secondary
  and not a primary process. And when one born for the primary
  process of creation, as the novelist is, concerns himself with
  the secondary process, his activity becomes meaningless. When he
  begins to make shapes and styles and techniques and new schools,
  then he is like a ship stranded upon a reef whose propeller,
  whirl wildly as it will, cannot drive the ship onward. Not until
  the ship is in its element again can it regain its course.<br>
  <br>
  And for the novelist the only element is human life as he finds
  it in himself or outside himself. The sole test of his work is
  whether or not his energy is producing more of that life. Are his
  creatures alive? That is the only question. And who can tell him?
  Who but those living human beings, the people? Those people are
  not absorbed in what art is or how it is made-are not, indeed,
  absorbed in anything very lofty, however good it is. No, they are
  absorbed only in themselves, in their own hungers and despairs
  and joys and above all, perhaps, in their own dreams. These are
  the ones who can really judge the work of the novelist, for they
  judge by that single test of reality. And the standard of the
  test is not to be made by the device of art, but by the simple
  comparison of the reality of what they read, to their own
  reality.<br>
  <br>
  I have been taught, therefore, that though the novelist may see
  art as cool and perfect shapes, he may only admire them as he
  admires marble statues standing aloof in a quiet and remote
  gallery; for his place is not with them. His place is in the
  street. He is happiest there. The street is noisy and the men and
  women are not perfect in the technique of their expression as the
  statues are. They are ugly and imperfect, incomplete even as
  human beings, and where they come from and where they go cannot
  be known. But they are people and therefore infinitely to be
  preferred to those who stand upon the pedestals of art.<br>
  <br>
  And like the Chinese novelist, I have been taught to want to
  write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by
  the million, then I want my stories there rather than in
  magazines read only by a few. For story belongs to the people.
  They are sounder judges of it than anyone else, for their senses
  are unspoiled and their emotions are free. No, a novelist must
  not think of pure literature as his goal. He must not even know
  this field too well, because people, who are his material, are
  not there. He is a storyteller in a village tent, and by his
  stories he entices people into his tent. He need not raise his
  voice when a scholar passes. But he must beat all his drums when
  a band of poor pilgrims pass on their way up the mountain in
  search of gods. To them he must cry, &laquo;I, too, tell of
  gods!&raquo; And to farmers he must talk of their land, and to old
  men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of
  their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each
  other. He must be satisfied if the common people hear him gladly.
  At least, so I have been taught in China.</p>
