  <h1>Ivan Bunin - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="bunin.jpg" class="bio-img">I come from an old and noble house that has
  given to Russia a good many illustrious persons in politics as
  well as in the arts, among whom two poets of the early nineteenth
  century stand out in particular: Anna B&uacute;nina and Vas&iacute;ly
  Zhuk&oacute;vsky, one of the great names in Russian literature, the
  son of Athanase Bunin and the Turk Salma.<br>
  <br>
  All my ancestors had close ties with the soil and the people:
  they were country gentlemen. My parents were no exception. They
  owned estates in Central Russia, in those fertile steppes in
  which the ancient Muscovite czars had settled colonists from all
  over the country for their protection against Tartar invasions
  from the South. That is why in that region there developed the
  richest of all Russian dialects, and almost all of our great
  writers from Turgenev to Leo Tolstoy have come from there.<br>
  <br>
  I was born in Vor&oacute;nezh in 1870; my childhood and youth were
  spent almost entirely in the country on my father's estates.
  During my adolescence the death of my little sister caused a
  violent religious crisis, but it left no permanent scars on my
  soul. I had a passion for painting, which, I think, shows in my
  writings. I wrote both poetry and prose fairly early and my works
  were also published from an early date.<br>
  <br>
  Ever since I began to publish, my books have been both in prose
  and poetry, original writings as well as translations (from the
  English). If one divides my work by genre, one would find volumes
  of original poetry, two volumes of translations, and ten volumes
  of prose.<br>
  <br>
  My works were soon recognized by the critics. They were
  subsequently honoured on several occasions, receiving in
  particular the Pushkin Prize, the highest prize awarded by the
  Russian Academy of
  Sciences. In 1909 that Academy elected me one of its twelve
  honorary members, a position that corresponds to the immortals of
  the French Academy. Among their number was Leo Tolstoy.<br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, there were several reasons why I was not widely
  known for a considerable time. I kept aloof from politics and in
  my writings did not touch upon questions concerning it. I did not
  belong to any literary school; I was neither decadent, nor
  symbolist, romantic, or naturalist. Moreover, I frequented few
  literary circles. I lived chiefly in the country; I travelled
  much in Russia as well as abroad; I visited Italy, Sicily,
  Turkey, the Balkans, Greece, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Algeria,
  Tunisia, and the tropics. According o the words of Saadi I tried
  to &laquo;look at the world and leave upon it the imprint of my
  soul&raquo;. I was interested in problems of philosophy, religion,
  morals, and history.<br>
  <br>
  In 1910 I published my novel <i>Der&eacute;vnya</i> [<i>The
  Village</i>]. It was the first of a series of works to give
  picture of the Russian without make-up: his character and his
  soul, his original complexity, his foundations at once luminous
  and obscure, but almost always essentially tragic. These
  &laquo;ruthless&raquo; works caused passionate discussions among
  our Russian critics and intellectuals who, owing to numerous
  circumstances peculiar to Russian society and - in these latter
  days - to sheer ignorance or political advantage, have constantly
  idealized the people. In short, these works made me notorious;
  this success has been confirmed by more recent works.<br>
  <br>
  I left Moscow because of the Bolshevik regime in May, 1918; until
  February, 1920, when I finally emigrated abroad, I lived in the
  south of Russia. Since then I have lived in France, dividing my
  time between Paris and the maritime Alps.</p>
