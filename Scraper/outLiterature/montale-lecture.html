  <h2><br>Is Poetry Still Possible?</h2>

  <p>The Nobel Prize has been awarded this year
  for the seventy-fifth time, if I am not misinformed. And if there
  are many scientists and writers who have earned this prestigious
  recognition, the number of those who are living and still working
  is much smaller. Some of them are present here and I extend my
  greetings and best wishes to them. According to widespread
  opinion, the work of soothsayers who are not always reliable,
  this year or in the years which can be considered imminent, the
  entire world (or at least that part of the world which can be
  said to be civilized) will experience a historical turning of
  colossal proportions. It is obviously not a question of an
  eschatological turning, of the end of man himself, but of the
  advent of a new social harmony of which there are presentiments
  only in the vast domains of Utopia. At the date of the event the
  Nobel Prize will be one hundred years old and only then will it
  be possible to make a complete balance sheet of what the Nobel
  Foundation and the connected prize have contributed to the
  formation of a new system of community life, be it that of
  universal well-being or malaise, but of such an extent as to put
  an end, at least for many centuries, to the centuries-long
  diatribe on the meaning of life. I refer to human life and not to
  the appearance of the amino-acids which dates back several
  thousand million years, substances which made possible the
  apparition of man and perhaps already contained the project of
  him. In this case how long the step of the <i>deus
  absconditus</i> is! But I do not intend to stray from my subject
  and I wonder if the conviction on which the statute of the Nobel
  Prize is based is justified: and that is that sciences, not all
  on the same level, and literary works have contributed to the
  spread and defence of new values in a broad "humanistic" sense.
  The response is certainly affirmative. The register of the names
  of those who, having given something to humanity, have received
  the coveted recognition of the Nobel Prize would be long. But
  infinitely more numerous and practically impossible to identify
  would be the legion, the army of those who work for humanity in
  infinite ways even without realizing it and who never aspire to
  any possible prize because they have not written works, acts or
  academic treatises and have never thought of "making the presses
  groan", as the Italian expression says. There certainly exists an
  army of pure, immaculate souls, and they are an obstacle
  (certainly insufficient) to the spread of that utilitarian spirit
  which in various degrees is pushed to the point of corruption,
  crime and every form of violence and intolerance. The
  academicians of Stockholm have often said no to intolerance,
  cruel fanaticism and that persecuting spirit which turns the
  strong against the weak, oppressors against the oppressed. This
  is true particularly in their choice of literary works, works
  which can sometimes be murderous, but never like that atomic bomb
  which is the most mature fruit of the eternal tree of evil.<br>
  <br>
  I will not insist on this point because I am neither a
  philosopher, sociologist nor moralist.<br>
  <br>
  I have written poems and for this I have been awarded a prize.
  But I have also been a librarian, translator, literary and
  musical critic and even unemployed because of recognized
  insufficiency of loyalty to a regime which I could not love. A
  few days ago a foreign journalist came to visit me and she asked
  me, "How did you distribute so many different activities? So many
  hours for poetry, so many hours for translation, so many for
  clerical activity and so many for life?" I tried to explain to
  her that it is to plan a lifetime as one plans an industrial
  project. In the world there is a large space for the useless, and
  indeed one of the dangers of our time is that mechandizing of the
  useless to which the very young are particularly sensitive.<br>
  <br>
  At any rate I am here because I have written poems. A completely
  useless product, but hardly ever harmful and this is one of its
  characteristics of nobility. But it is not the only one, since
  poetry is a creation or a sickness which is absolutely endemic
  and incurable.<br>
  <br>
  I am here because I have written poems: six volumes, in addition
  to innumerable translations and critical essays. They have said
  that it is a small production, perhaps supposing that the poet is
  a producer of merchandise; the machines must be utilized to the
  full extent. Fortunately, poetry is not merchandise. It is a
  phenomenon of which we know very little, so much so that two
  philosophers as different as Croce, a historicist and idealist,
  and Gilson, a Catholic, are in agreement in considering it
  impossible to write a history of poetry. For my part, if I
  consider poetry as an object, I maintain that it is born of the
  necessity of adding a vocal sound (speech) to the hammering of
  the first tribal music. Only much later could speech and music be
  written in some way and differentiated. Written poetry appears,
  but the relationship in common with music makes itself felt.
  Poetry tends to open in architectonic forms, there arise the
  meters, the strophes, the so-called fixed forms. Already in the
  <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and then in Romance epic cycles, the true
  material of poetry is sound. But a poem which also addresses
  itself to the eye will not be long in appearing with the
  Provencal poets. Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints
  images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.
  Naturally the formal structures made up a large part of poetic
  visibility. After the invention of printing, poetry becomes
  vertical, does not fill the white space completely, it is rich in
  new paragraphs and repetitions. Even certain empty spaces have a
  value. Prose, which occupies all the space and does not give
  indications of its pronounceability, is very different. And at
  this point the metrical structures can be an ideal instrument for
  the art of narration, that is for the novel. This is the case for
  that narrative instrument which is the eight-line stanza, a form
  which was already a fossile in the early Nineteenth Century in
  spite of the success of Byron's <i>Don Juan</i> (a poem which
  remained half-finished).<br>
  <br>
  But towards the end of the Nineteenth Century, the fixed forms of
  poetry no longer satisfied the eye or the ear. An analogous
  observation can be made for English blank verse and for the
  corresponding verse form, <i>endecasillabo sciolto.</i> And in
  the meantime painting was making great strides towards the
  dissolution of naturalism, and the repercussion was immediate in
  pictorial art. Thus with a long process, which would require too
  much time to describe here, one arrived at the conclusion that it
  was impossible to reproduce reality, real objects, thus creating
  useless duplicates: but there are displayed <i>in vitro</i> or
  even life-size the objects or figures of which Caravaggio or
  Rembrandt would have presented a facsimile, a masterpiece. At the
  great exhibition in Venice years ago the portrait of a mongoloid
  was displayed: the subject was tr&egrave;s d&eacute;utant, but why
  not? Art can justify everything. Expect that upon approaching it,
  one discovered that it was not a portrait but the unfortunate
  himself, in flesh and blood. The experiment was then interrupted
  <i>manu militari</i>, but in a strictly theoretical context it
  was completely justified. For many years critics with university
  chairs had preached the absolute necessity of the death of art,
  waiting for who knows what palingenesis or resurrection, of which
  the signs could not be glimpsed.<br>
  <br>
  What conclusion can be drawn from such facts? Evidently the arts,
  all the visual arts, are becoming more democratic in the worst
  sense of the word. Art is the production of objects for
  consumption, to be used and discarded while waiting for a new
  world in which man will have succeeded in freeing himself of
  everything, even of his own consciousness. The example I cite
  could be extended to the exclusively noisy and undifferentiated
  music listened to in those places where millions of young people
  gather to exorcize the horror of their solitude. But why more
  than ever has civilized man reached the point of having horror of
  himself?<br>
  <br>
  Obviously I foresee the objections. We must not bring in the
  illnesses of society, which have perhaps always existed, but were
  little known because the former means of communication did not
  permit us to know and diagnose the illness. It alarms me that a
  sort of general Doomsday atmosphere accompanies an ever more
  wide-spread comfort, that well-being (there where it exists, that
  is in limited areas of the world) has the livid features of
  desperation. Against the dark background of this contemporary
  civilization of well-being, even the arts tend to mingle, to lose
  their identity. Mass communication, radio, and especially
  television, have attempted, not without success, to annihilate
  every possibility of solitude and reflection. Time becomes more
  rapid, works of a few years ago seem "dated" and the need the
  artist has to be listened to sooner or later becomes a spasmodic
  need of the topical, of the immediate. Whence the new art of our
  time which is the spectacle, a not necessarily theatrical
  exhibition in which the rudiments of every art are present and
  which effects a kind of psychic massage on the spectator or
  listener or reader as the case may be. The <i>deus ex machina</i>
  of this new heap is the director. His purpose is not only to
  co-ordinate scenic arrangements, but to give intentions to works
  which have none or have had other ones. There is a great
  sterility in all this, an immense lack of confidence in life. In
  such a landscape of hysterical exhibitionism what can be place of
  poetry, the most discrete of arts, be? So-called lyrical poetry
  is work, the fruit of solitude and accumulated impressions. This
  is still true today but in rather limited cases. We have however
  more numerous cases in which the self-proclaimed poet falls into
  step with new times. Poetry then becomes acoustic and visual. The
  words splash in all directions, like the explosion of a grenade,
  there is no true meaning, but a verbal earthquake with many
  epicenters. Decipherment is not necessary, in many cases the aid
  of the psychoanalyst may help. Since the visual aspect prevails,
  the poem becomes translatable, and this is a new phenomenon in
  the history of esthetics. This does not mean that the new poets
  are schizoid. Some of them can write classically traditional
  verse and pseudo-verses devoid of any sense. There is also poetry
  written to be shouted in a square in front of an enthusiastic
  crowd. This occurs especially in countries where authoritarian
  regimes are in power. And such athletes of poetic vocalism are
  not always devoid of talent. I will cite such a case and I beg
  your pardon if it is also a case which concerns me personally.
  But the fact, if it is true, demonstrates that by now there exist
  two types of poetry in cohabitation, one of which is for
  immediate consumption and dies as soon as it is expressed, while
  the other can sleep quietly. One day it will awaken, if it has
  the strength to do so.<br>
  <br>
  True poetry is similar to certain pictures whose owner is unknown
  and which only a few initiated people know. However, poetry does
  not live solely in books or in school anthologies. The poet does
  not know and often will never know his true receiver. I will give
  you a personal example. In the archives of Italian newspapers
  there are the obituary articles for men who are still alive and
  active. These articles are called "crocodiles". A few years ago
  at the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> I discovered my "crocodile",
  signed by Taulero Zulberti, critic, translator and polyglot. He
  states that the great poet Majakovsky, having read one or more of
  my poems translated into Russian, said: "Here is a poet I like. I
  would like to be able to read him in Italian." The episode is not
  improbable. My first verses began to circulate in 1925 and
  Majakovsky (who travelled in the United States and elsewhere as
  well) committed suicide in 1930.<br>
  <br>
  Majakovsky was a poet with a pantograph, with a megaphone. If he
  said such words I can say that my poems had found, by crooked and
  unforeseeable paths, their receiver.<br>
  <br>
  Do not believe, however, that I have a solipsistic idea of
  poetry. The idea of writing for the so-called happy few was never
  mine. In reality art is always for everyone and for no one. But
  what remains unforeseeable is its true begetter, its receiver.
  Spectacle-art, mass art, art which wants to produce a sort of
  physical-psychical message on a hypothetical user, has infinite
  roads in front of it because the population of the world is in
  continuous growth. But its limit is absolute void. It is possible
  to frame and exhibit a pair of slippers (I myself have seen mine
  in that condition), but a landscape, a lake or any great natural
  spectacle cannot be displayed under glass.<br>
  <br>
  Lyrical poetry has certainly broken its barriers. There is poetry
  even in prose, in all the great prose which is not merely
  utilitarian or didactic: there exist poets who write in prose or
  at least in more or less apparent prose; millions of poets write
  verses which have no connection with poetry. But this signifies
  little or nothing. The world is growing, no one can say what its
  future will be. But it is not credible that mass culture, with
  its ephemeral and brittle character, will not produce, through
  necessary repercussions, a culture which is both defense and
  reflection. We can all collaborate in this future. But man's life
  is short and the life of the world can be almost infinitely
  long.<br>
  <br>
  I had thought of giving this title to my short speech: "Will
  poetry be able to survive in the universe of mass communication?"
  That is what many people wonder, but upon thinking closely, the
  answer can only be affirmative. If by poetry one means
  belletristic poetry it is clear that the world production will
  continue to grow excessively. If instead we limit ourselves to
  that poetry which refuses with horror the description of
  production, that which arises almost through a miracle and seems
  to embalm an entire epoch and a whole linguistic and cultural
  situation, then it is necessary to say that there is no death
  possible for poetry.<br>
  <br>
  It has often been observed that the repercussion of poetic
  language on prose language can be considered a decisive cut of a
  whip. Strangely, Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> did not produce a
  prose of that creative height or it did so after centuries. But
  if you study French prose before and after the school of Ronsard,
  the Pl&eacute;iade, you will observe that French prose has lost
  that softness for which it was judged to be so inferior to the
  classical languages and has taken a veritable leap towards
  maturity. The effect has been curious. The Pl&eacute;iade does not
  produce collections of homogeneous poems like those of the
  Italian <i>dolce stil nuovo</i> (which is certainly one of its
  sources), but it gives us from time to time true "antique pieces"
  which could be put in a possible imaginary museum of poetry. It
  is a question of a taste which could be defined as Neo-Greek and
  which centuries later the Parnasse will attempt in vain to equal.
  This proves that great lyric poetry can die, be reborn, die
  again, but will always remain one of the most outstanding
  creations of the human soul. Let us reread together a poem by
  Joachim Du Bellay. This poet, born in 1522 and who died at the
  age of thirty-three, was the nephew of a Cardinal with whom he
  lived in Rome for several years, bringing back a profound disgust
  for the corruption of the papal court. Du Bellay wrote a great
  deal, imitating with greater or lesser success the poets of the
  Petrarchan tradition. But the poem (perhaps written in Rome),
  inspired by Latin verses by Navagero, which confirms his fame, is
  the fruit of a painful nostalgia for the country-side of the
  sweet Loire which he had abandoned. From Sainte-Beuve up to
  Walter Pater, who dedicated Joachim a memorable profile, the sort
  <i>Odelette</i> read it if this is possible, because it is a
  question of a poem in which the eye <i>des vanneurs de
  bl&eacute;</i> has entered the repertory of world poetry. Let us
  try to reread it if this is possible, because it is a question of
  a poem in which the eye has its role.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A vous troppe legere,<br>
    qui d'aele passagere<br>
    par le monde volez<br>
    et d'un sifflant murmure<br>
    l'ombrageuse verdure<br>
    doulcement esbranlez,<br>
    <br>
    j'offre ces violettes,<br>
    ces lis et ces fleurettes,<br>
    et ces roses icy,<br>
    ces vermeillettes roses,<br>
    tout freschement &eacute;closes ,<br>
    et ces oeilletz aussi.<br>
    <br>
    De vostre doulce halaine<br>
    eventez ceste plaine,<br>
    eventez ce sejour,<br>
    ce pendant que j'ahanne<br>
    a mon bl&eacute;, que je vanne<br>
    a la chaleur du jour.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I do not if this <i>Odelette</i> was
  written in Rome as an interlude in the dispatch of boring office
  matters. It owes its current survival to Pater. At a distance of
  centuries a poem can find its interpreter.<br>
  <br>
  But now in order to conclude, I should reply to the question
  which gave a title to this brief speech. In the current
  consumistic civilization which sees new nations and new languages
  appear in history, in the civilization of robotman, what can the
  destiny of poetry be? There could be many answers. Poetry is the
  art which is technically within the grasp of everyone: a piece of
  paper and a pencil and one is ready. Only at a second moment do
  the problems of publishing and distribution arise. The fire of
  the library of Alexandria destroyed three fourths of Greek
  literature.<br>
  <br>
  Today not even a universal fire could make the torrential poetic
  production of our time disappear. But it is exactly a question of
  production, that is, of hand-made products which are subject to
  the laws of taste and fashion. That the garden of the Muses can
  be devastated by great tempests is, more than probable, certain.
  But it seems to me just as certain that a great deal of printed
  paper and many books of poetry must resist time.<br>
  <br>
  The question is different if one refers to the spiritual revival
  of an old poetic text, its contemporary restoration, its opening
  to new interpretations. And finally it always remains doubtful
  within which limits one moves when speaking of poetry. Much of
  today's poetry is expressed in prose. Many of today's verses are
  prose and bad prose. Narrative art, the novel, from Murasaki to
  Proust, has produced great works of poetry. And the theater? Many
  literary histories do not even discuss it, taking up instead
  several geniuses who are treated separately. In addition how can
  one explain the fact that ancient Chinese poetry survives all
  translations while European poetry is chained to its original
  language? Perhaps the phenomenon can be explained by the fact
  that we believe we are reading Po Ch&uuml;-i and instead we are
  reading the wonderful counterfeiter Arthur Waly? One could
  multiply the questions with the sole result that not only poetry,
  but all the world of artistic expression or that which proclaims
  itself to be such, has entered into a crisis which is strictly
  tied to the human condition, to our existence as human beings, to
  our certainty or illusion of believing ourselves to be privileged
  beings, the only ones who believe they are the masters of their
  destiny and the depositaries of a destiny which no other creature
  can lay claim to. It is useless then to wonder what the destiny
  of the arts will be. It is like asking oneself if the man of
  tomorrow, perhaps of a very distant tomorrow, will be able to
  resolve the tragic contradictions in which he has been
  floundering since the first day of Creation (and if it is still
  possible to speak of such a day, which can be an endless
