  <h1>Sinclair Lewis - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lewis.jpg" class="bio-img">To recount my life for the Nobel
  Foundation, I would like to present it as possessing some
  romantic quality, some unique character, like <a href=
  "../1907/index.html">Kipling</a>'s early adventures in India, or
  <a href="../1925/index.html">Bernard Shaw</a>'s leadership in the
  criticism of British arts and economics. But my life, aside from
  such youthful pranks as sailing on cattleships from America to
  England during university vacations, trying to find work in
  Panama during the building of the Canal, and serving for two
  months as janitor of Upton Sinclair's abortive co-operative
  colony, Helicon Hall, has been a rather humdrum chronicle of much
  reading, constant writing, undistinguished travel &agrave; la
  tripper, and several years of comfortable servitude as an
  editor.<br>
  <br>
  I was born in a prairie village in that most Scandinavian part of
  America, Minnesota, the son of a country doctor, in 1885. Until I
  went East to Yale
  University I attended the ordinary public school, along with
  many Madsens, Olesons, Nelsons, Hedins, Larsons. Doubtless it was
  because of this that I made the hero of my second book, <i>The
  Trail of the Hawk</i>, a Norwegian, and Gustaf Sondelius, of
  <i>Arrowsmith</i>, a Swede - and to me, Dr. Sondelius is the
  favorite among all my characters.<br>
  <br>
  Of Carl Ericson of <i>The Trail of the Hawk</i>, I wrote -back in
  1914, when I was working all day as editor for the George H.
  Doran Publishing Company, and all evening trying to write novels
  - as follows:<br>
  <br>
  &laquo;His carpenter father had come from Norway, by way of
  steerage and a farm in Wisconsin, changing his name (to
  Americanize it) from Ericsen... Carl was second-generation
  Norwegian; American-born, American in speech, American in
  appearance, save for his flaxen hair and china-blue eyes... When
  he was born the &#8249;typical Americans&#8250; of earlier stocks
  had moved to city palaces or were marooned on run-down farms. It
  was Carl Ericson, not a Trowbridge or a Stuyvesant or a Lee or a
  Grant, who was the &#8249;typical American&#8250; of his period.
  It was for him to carry on the American destiny of extending the
  Western horizon; his to restore the wintry Pilgrim virtues and
  the exuberant October, partridge-drumming days of Daniel Boone;
  then to add, in his own or another generation, new American
  aspirations for beauty.&raquo;<br>
  <br>
  My university days at Yale were undistinguished save for
  contributions to the Yale Literary Magazine. It may be
  interesting to say that these contributions were most of them
  reeking with a banal romanticism; that an author who was later to
  try to present ordinary pavements trod by real boots should
  through university days have written nearly always of Guinevere
  and Lancelot - of weary bitterns among sad Irish reeds - of
  story-book castles with troubadours vastly indulging in wine, a
  commodity of which the author was singularly ignorant. What the
  moral is, I do not know. Whether imaginary castles at nineteen
  lead always to the sidewalks of Main Street at thirty-five, and
  whether the process might be reversed, and whether either of them
  is desirable, I leave to psychologists.<br>
  <br>
  I drifted for two years after college as a journalist, as a
  newspaper reporter in Iowa and in San Francisco, as - incredibly
  - a junior editor on a magazine for teachers of the deaf, in
  Washington, D.C. The magazine was supported by Alexander Graham
  Bell, inventor of the telephone. What I did not know about
  teaching the deaf would have included the entire subject, but
  that did not vastly matter, as my position was so insignificant
  that it included typing hundreds of letters every week begging
  for funds for the magazine and, on days when the Negro janitress
  did not appear, sweeping out the office.<br>
  <br>
  Doubtless this shows the advantages of a university education,
  and it was further shown when at the age of twenty-five I managed
  to get a position in a New York publishing house at all of
  fifteen dollars a week. This was my authentic value on the labor
  market, and I have always uncomfortably suspected that it would
  never have been much higher had I not, accidentally, possessed
  the gift of writing books which so acutely annoyed American
  smugness that some thousands of my fellow citizens felt they must
  read these scandalous documents, whether they liked them or
  not.<br>
  <br>
  From that New York position till the time five years later when I
  was selling enough short stories to the magazines to be able to
  live by free-lancing, I had a series of typical white-collar,
  unromantic, office literary jobs with two publishing houses, a
  magazine (<i>Adventure</i>), and a newspaper syndicate, reading
  manuscripts, writing book advertising, writing catalogues,
  writing uninspired book reviews - all the carpentry and plumbing
  of the city of letters. Nor did my first five novels rouse the
  slightest whispers: <i>Our Mr. Wrenn</i>, <i>The Trail of the
  Hawk</i>, <i>The Job</i>, <i>The Innocents</i>, and <i>Free
  Air</i> they were called, published between 1914 and 1919, and
  all of them dead before the ink was dry. I lacked sense enough to
  see that, after five failures, I was foolish to continue
  writing.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Main Street</i>, published late in 1920, was my first novel to
  rouse the embattled peasantry and, as I have already hinted, it
  had really a success of scandal. One of the most treasured
  American myths had been that all American villages were
  peculiarly noble and happy, and here an American attacked that
  myth. Scandalous. Some hundreds of thousands read the book with
  the same masochistic pleasure that one has in sucking an aching
  tooth.<br>
  <br>
  Since <i>Main Street</i>, the novels have been <i>Babbitt</i>
  (1922); <i>Arrowsmith</i> (1925); <i>Mantrap</i> (1926); <i>Elmer
  Gantry</i> (1927); <i>The Man Who Knew Coolidge</i> (1928); and
  <i>Dodsworth</i> (1929). The next novel, yet unnamed, will
  concern idealism in America through three generations, from 1818
  till 1930-an idealism which the outlanders who call Americans
  &laquo;dollar-chasers&raquo; do not understand. It will presumably
  be published in the autumn of 1932, and the author's chief
  difficulty in composing it is that, after having received the
  Nobel Prize, he longs to write better than he can.<br>
  <br>
  I was married, in England, in 1928, to Dorothy Thompson, an
  American who had been the Central European correspondent and
  <i>chef de bureau</i> of the New York Evening Post. My first
  marriage, to Grace Hegger, in New York, in 1914, had been
  dissolved.<br>
  <br>
  During these years of novelwriting since 1915, I have lived a
  quite unromantic and unstirring life. I have travelled much; on
  the surface it would seem that one who during these fifteen years
  had been in forty states of the United States, in Canada, Mexico,
  England, Scotland, France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Austria,
  Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, the West
  Indies, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Poland, and Russia must have
  been adventurous. That, however, would be a typical error of
  biography. The fact is that my foreign travelling has been a
  quite uninspired recreation, a flight from reality. My real
  travelling has been sitting in Pullman smoking cars, in a
  Minnesota village, on a Vermont farm, in a hotel in Kansas City
  or Savannah, listening to the normal daily drone of what are to
  me the most fascinating and exotic people in the world - the
  Average Citizens of the United States, with their friendliness to
  strangers and their rough teasing, their passion for material
  advancement and their shy idealism, their interest in all the
  world and their boastful provincialism - the intricate
  complexities which an American novelist is privileged to
  portray.<br>
  <br>
  And nowadays, at forty-six, with my first authentic home - a farm
  in the pastoral state of Vermont - and a baby born in June 1930,
  I am settled down to what I hope to be the beginning of a
  novelist's career. I hope the awkward apprenticeship with all its
  errors is nearly done.</p>
