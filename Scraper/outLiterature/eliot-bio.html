  <h1>T.S. Eliot - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="eliot.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Thomas Stearns Eliot</b> (1888-1965) was
  born in St. Louis, Missouri, of an old New England family. He was
  educated at Harvard and did graduate work in philosophy at the
  Sorbonne, Harvard, and Merton College, Oxford. He settled in
  England, where he was for a time a schoolmaster and a bank clerk,
  and eventually literary editor for the publishing house Faber
  &amp; Faber, of which he later became a director. He founded and,
  during the seventeen years of its publication (1922-1939), edited
  the exclusive and influential literary journal Criterion. In
  1927, Eliot became a British citizen and about the same time
  entered the Anglican Church.<br>

  Eliot has been one of the most daring innovators of
  twentieth-century poetry. Never compromising either with the
  public or indeed with language itself, he has followed his belief
  that poetry should aim at a representation of the complexities of
  modern civilization in language and that such representation
  necessarily leads to difficult poetry. Despite this difficulty
  his influence on modern poetic diction has been immense. Eliot's
  poetry from <i>Prufrock</i> (1917) to the <i>Four Quartets</i>
  (1943) reflects the development of a Christian writer: the early
  work, especially <i>The Waste Land</i> (1922), is essentially
  negative, the expression of that horror from which the search for
  a higher world arises. In <i>Ash Wednesday</i> (1930) and the
  <i>Four Quartets</i> this higher world becomes more visible;
  nonetheless Eliot has always taken care not to become a
  &laquo;religious poet&raquo;. and often belittled the power of
  poetry as a religious force. However, his dramas <i>Murder in the
  Cathedral</i> (1935) and <i>The Family Reunion</i> (1939) are
  more openly Christian apologies. In his essays, especially the
  later ones, Eliot advocates a traditionalism in religion,
  society, and literature that seems at odds with his pioneer
  activity as a poet. But although the Eliot of <i>Notes towards
  the Definition of Culture</i> (1948) is an older man than the
  poet of <i>The Waste Land</i>, it should not be forgotten that
  for Eliot tradition is a living organism comprising past and
  present in constant mutual interaction. Eliot's plays <i>Murder
  in the Cathedral</i> (1935), <i>The Family Reunion</i> (1939),
  <i>The Cocktail Party</i> (1949), <i>The Confidential Clerk</i>
  (1954), and <i>TheElderStatesman</i>(1959) were published in one
  volume in 1962; <i>Collected Poems 1909-62</i> appeared in
  1963.</p>
