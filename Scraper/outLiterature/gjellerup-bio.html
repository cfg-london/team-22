  <h1>Karl Gjellerup - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="gjellerup.jpg" class="bio-img">I was born on June 2, 1857, in the Roholte
  vicarage at Praest&ouml;. My father was Pastor Carl Adolph
  Gjellerup, my mother, Anna Fibiger. After my father's death in
  1860, in Landet vicarage on Lolland (from which I still have a
  number of memories), I went in November of the same year to the
  home of my mother's cousin, Pastor Johannes Fibiger, parish
  minister of the garrison church in Copenhagen, and author of
  <i>Johannes den D&oslash;ber</i> (1857) [John the Baptist],
  <i>Nogle sagn</i> (1865) [Some Stories], <i>Kors og
  kaerlighed</i> (1858) [Cross and Love], <i>Den evige strid</i>
  (1878) [The Eternal Strife], and <i>Mit liv og levned</i> (1898)
  [My Life]. I was graduated summa cum laude from Haerslevs Grammar
  School in 1874. Before this I had made several attempts at
  writing; immediately after graduation I wrote a tragedy,
  <i>Scipio Africanus</i>, and a drama, <i>Arminius</i>, both of
  which were shown to my uncle, Professor Edvard Holm, who
  encouraged me and showed the latter to Christian Molbech.
  Nevertheless, I studied theology and lived much in the country
  (in Vallensved on South Sjaelland, where Fibiger was the
  minister, and after 1881 in &Oslash;nslev on Falster), a country
  life which made an indelible impression on my mind and has left
  its mark in all of my novels. I earned my B.D. (summa cum laude)
  in June of 1878. I immediately began writing <i>En idealist</i>
  (1878) [An Idealist], which was published in November on the same
  day as <i>Den evige strid</i>, both under a pseudonym. Because
  both books created something of a sensation, I then came into
  contact with H&oslash;ffding, Drachmann, Schandorph, Borchsenius,
  the brothers Brandes, J. P. Jacobsen, and many artists. Ceaseless
  production followed, temporarily taking a scientific direction in
  <i>Arvelighed og moral</i> (1881) [Heredity and Morals], a book
  with an evolutionary viewpoint, which was awarded the University
  Gold Medal. The novel <i>Germanernes laerling</i> (1882) [The
  Apprentice of the Teutons] (in its very title a program for
  existence), a collection of poems entitled
  <i>R&oslash;dtj&oslash;rn</i> (1881) [Hawthome], end <i>Aander og
  tider</i> (1882) [Spirits and Times], a requiem on Darwin, are
  the most noteworthy works from this time. A small inheritance
  made it possible for me to undertake a longer trip abroad in
  1883. During a three-month stay in Rome, I pursued studies in
  water colour with Kronberg; later I studied pastel and oil
  painting. My return trip went through Switzerland, Greece, and
  Russia, and via Stockholm I arrived home at Christmastime. In the
  meantime two short stories, &laquo;Romulus&raquo; (1883) and
  &laquo;G-Dur&raquo; (1883) [G-Major], had come out. The travel
  impressions, <i>En klassisk maaned</i> (1884) [A Classical Month]
  and <i>Vandreaaret</i> (1885) [Wander Year], followed. In the
  latter of these two I broke off from the followers of Georg
  Brandes. Then appeared the first work of mine which was received
  with excitement, the lyrical tragedy <i>Brynhild</i> (1884),
  which had already been sketched during my student years, and
  which was dedicated to Eugenia. From the summer of 1885 to the
  fall of 1887 I lived in Dresden, where I wrote the scenes from
  the revolution, <i>Saint Just</i> (1885) (reworked for the stage
  in German in 1913 and still not published), and the
  dramatic-lyrical poem &laquo;Thamyris&raquo; (1887). The latter
  along with <i>Brynhild</i> was responsible for my receiving a
  state pension for life. In October of 1887 I married Eugenia
  Bendix, n&eacute;e Heusinger, and settled in Hellerup. The lyrical
  tragedy <i>Hagbard og Signe</i> (1888) [Hagbard and Signe], the
  novel <i>Minna</i> (1889), the poetry collection <i>Min
  kaerligheds bog</i> (1889) [The Book of my Love], and the plays
  <i>Herman Vandel</i> (1891) and <i>Wuthhorn</i> (1893) (performed
  at the Dagmar Theatre over 100 times) were written in Hellerup. I
  also wrote an essay about Wagner's Nibelungenring and translated
  the songs of the gods in the <i>Edda</i>.</p>
  
  <p>In March of 1892 I settled in Dresden. The tragedy <i>Kong
  Hjarne</i> (1893) [King Hjarne] and the verse comedy <i>Gift og
  modgift</i>(1898) [Toxin and Antitoxin] were performed at the
  Dagmar Theatre. After <i>Fabler</i> [Fables], <i>Fra vaar til
  h&oslash;st</i> [From Spring to Autumn], and <i>To fragmenter</i>
  [Two Fragments] I bade farewell to Danish poetry. The novels
  M&oslash;llen (1896) [The Mill], <i>Ved graensen</i> (1897) [At the
  Border], <i>Tankelaeserinden</i> (1901) [The Soothsayer], and
  <i>Rudolf Stens Landpraxis</i> or <i>Reif f&uuml;r das Leben</i>
  ( I9I3) [Ripe for Life] were written in German, and this
  language, in which I had made my debut with <i>Pastor Mors</i>
  (1894), now became my true artistic medium. The dramas <i>Die
  Opferfeuer</i> (1903) [The Sacrificial Fires] (produced at the
  court theatres in Dresden and Dessau) and <i>Das Weib des
  Vollendeten</i> ( 1907) [The Wife of the Perfect One] (produced
  at the court theatre in Stuttgart) and the poetic novels <i>Der
  Pilger Kamanita</i> (1906)[<i>The Pilgrim Kamanita</i>], <i>Die
  Weltwanderer</i> (1910) [The World Travellers], <i>Der goldene
  Zweig</i> (1917) [The Golden Bough], and <i>Die Gottesfreunde</i>
  (1916) [The Friends of God] belong chiefly to German literature
  and - like <i>Reif f&uuml;r das Leben</i> - have found their true
  understanding and appreciation almost exclusively in Germany.
  When my first book appeared forty years earlier, it had been
  influenced by German idealism. Just three years later (in the
  thesis awarded the gold medal) I was a follower of English
  naturalism, after which I returned to a position under those
  elevated signs of the zodiac which constitute my rightful
  habitat, only this time the guiding star was not Hegel as in
  <i>En idealist</i>, but Kant and Schopenhauer.</p>
