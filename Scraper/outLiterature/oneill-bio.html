  <h1>Eugene O&#39;Neill - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="oneill.jpg" class="bio-img">Born October 16th, 1888, in New York City. Son of James 
              O'Neill, the popular romantic actor. First seven years of my life 
              spent mostly in hotels and railroad trains, my mother accompanying 
              my father on his tours of the United States, although she never 
              was an actress, disliked the theatre, and held aloof from its people.<br>
  <br>
  From the age of seven to thirteen attended Catholic schools. Then
  four years at a non-sectarian preparatory school, followed by one
  year (1906-1907) at Princeton University.<br>
  <br>
  After expulsion from Princeton I led a restless, wandering life
  for several years, working at various occupations. Was secretary
  of a small mail order house in New York for a while, then went on
  a gold prospecting expedition in the wilds of Spanish Honduras.
  Found no gold but contracted malarial fever. Returned to the
  United States and worked for a time as assistant manager of a
  theatrical company on tour. After this, a period in which I went
  to sea, and also worked in Buenos Aires for the Westinghouse
  Electrical Co., Swift Packing Co., and Singer Sewing Machine Co.
  Never held a job long. Was either fired quickly or left quickly.
  Finished my experience as a sailor as able-bodied seaman on the
  American Line of transatlantic liners. After this, was an actor
  in vaudeville for a short time, and reporter on a small town
  newspaper. At the end of 1912 my health broke down and I spent
  six months in a tuberculosis sanatorium.<br>
  <br>
  Began to write plays in the Fall of 1913. Wrote the one-act
  <i>Bound East for Cardiff</i> in the Spring of 1914. This is the
  only one of the plays written in this period which has any
  merit.<br>
  <br>
  In the Fall of 1914, I entered Harvard University to attend the course in
  dramatic technique given by Professor George Baker. I left after
  one year and did not complete the course.<br>
  <br>
  The Fall of 1916 marked the first production of a play of mine in
  New York - <i>Bound East for Cardiff</i> - which was on the
  opening bill of the Provincetown Players. In the next few years
  this theatre put on nearly all of my short plays, but it was not
  until 1920 that a long play <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> was
  produced in New York. It was given on Broadway by a commercial
  managemeet - but, at first, only as a special matinee attraction
  with four afternoon performances a week. However, some of the
  critics praised the play and it was soon given a theatre for a
  regular run, and later on in the year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. I
  received this prize again in 1922 for <i>Anna Christie</i> and
  for the third time in 1928 for <i>Strange Interlude</i>.<br>
  <br>
  The following is a list of all my published and produced plays
  which are worth mentioning, with the year in which they were
  written:<br>
  <br>
  <i>Bound East for Cardiff</i> (1914), <i>Before Breakfast</i>
  (1916), <i>The Long Voyage Home</i> (1917), <i>In the Zone</i>
  (1917), <i>The Moon of the Carabbees</i> (1917), <i>Ile</i>
  (1917), <i>The Rope</i> (1918), <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> (1918),

  <p><b>Biographical note on Eugene
  O'Neill</b></p>

  <p>After an active career of writing and
  supervising the New York productions of his own works, O'Neill
  (1888-1953) published only two new plays between 1934 and the
  time of his death. In <i>The Iceman Cometh</i> (1946), he exposed
  a &laquo;prophet's&raquo; battle against the last pipedreams of a
  group of derelicts as another pipedream and managed to infuse
  into the &laquo;Lower Depths&raquo; atmosphere a sense of the
  tragic. <i>A Moon for the Misbegotten</i> (1952) contains a
  strong autobiographical content, which it shares with <i>Long
  Day's Journey into Night</i> (posth. 1956), one of O'Neill's most
  important works. The latter play, written, according to O'Neill,
  &laquo;in tears and blood... with deep pity and understanding and
  forgiveness for <i>all</i> the four haunted Tyrones&raquo;, had
  its premiere at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. Sweden grew
  into an O'Neill centre with the first productions of the one-act
  play <i>Hughie</i> (posth. 1959) as well as <i>A Touch of the
  Poet</i> (posth. 1958) and an adapted version of <i>More Stately
  Mansions</i> (posth. 1962 ) - both plays being parts of an
  unfinished cycle in which O'Neill returned to his earlier
  attempts at making psychological analysis dramatically
  effective.</p>
