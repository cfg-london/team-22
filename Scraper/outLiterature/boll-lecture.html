 <h2>An Essay on the Reason of Poetry</h2>

 

  <p>It is said by those who ought to know - and
  by others, who also ought to know, it is disputed - that in
  matters which to all appearances are rational, calculable and
  achieved by the combined efforts of architects, draughtsmen,
  engineers, workers - accomplishments such as a bridge - there
  remain a few millimetres or centimetres of incalculability. This
  incalculability (tiny with regard to the masses being treated and
  shaped) may stem from the difficulty of calculating with the
  nicest precision a mass of complicated interlocking chemical and
  technical details and materials in all their possible reactions,
  including the effects of the four classical elements (air, water,
  fire and earth). The problem here seems not merely to be the
  design, the repeatedly recalculated and checked
  technical/chemical/statistical composition, but - let me call it
  this - their incarnation, which can also be called their
  realisation. This remainder of incalculability, be it only
  fractions of millimetres, which correspond to unforeseen tiny
  differences in extension - what shall we call them? What lies
  hidden in this gap? Is it what we usually call irony, is it
  poetry, God, resistance, or (to use a popular phrase nowadays)
  fiction? Someone who ought to know, a painter who had previously
  been a baker, once told me that even baking breakfast rolls,
  which is done early in the morning, almost in the night, was
  extremely dicey business; you had to stick your nose and your
  backside out into the grey dawn in order more or less
  instinctively to find the right mixture of ingredients,
  temperature and baking time, since each and every day demanded
  its own freshly-baked rolls, an important, even holy element of
  the first morning meal for all those who shoulder the burden of
  the new day. Should we also call this almost incalculable element
  irony, poetry, God, resistance or fiction? How can we cope
  without it? Not to mention love. No one will ever know how many
  novels, poems, analyses, confessions, sufferings and joys have
  been piled up on this continent called Love, without it ever
  having turned out to be totally investigated.<br>
  <br>
  When I am asked how or why I wrote this or that, I always find
  myself quite embarassed. I would gladly furnish not merely the
  questioner, but myself as well, with an exhaustive answer, but
  can never do so. I cannot recreate the context in its entirety,
  yet I wish that I could, so that at least the literature I myself
  make might be made slightly less of a mysterious process than
  bridge-building and bread-baking.<br>
  <br>
  And because literature in its incarnation as a whole, in its
  message and shape, can clearly have a liberating effect, it would
  after all be quite useful to tell people about the genesis of
  this incarnation, so that more people can share in this process.
  What is it that I myself, although I demonstrably produce it,
  cannot even approximately explain? - this something which from
  the first to the last line I myself set down on paper, vary
  repeatedly, rework, somewhat shift the emphasis of, yet which as
  it recedes in time grows alien to me, like something that is gone
  or past, retreating further and further from me, even as it is
  perhaps becoming important for others as a shaped message?
  Theoretically, the total reconstruction of the process would have
  to be possible, a form of parallel protocol created as the work
  progresses, and which, if done in detail, would probably be many
  times larger than the work itself. Not merely the intellectual
  and mental, but also the sensory and material dimensions would
  have to be satisfied, mental and physical nourishment and
  metabolism, the mood and flashes of wit <i>enlighteningly</i>
  provided, the function of one's environment not only in its
  incarnation as such, but also as backdrop. For example, I often
  watch sports shows with my mind almost completely blank, in order
  to practise contemplation with a blank mind, admittedly a rather
  mystical exercise - yet all these programmes would have to be
  included in their entirety in the protocol, since after all a
  kick or a leap might happen to spark some reaction or other in my
  thoughtless contemplation, or perhaps the movement of a hand, a
  smile, a commentator's word, a commercial. Every telephone call,
  the weather, letters, each individual cigarette would have to be
  included, a passing car, a pneumatic drill, the cackling of a hen
  that disturbs a context.<br>
  <br>
  The table upon which I am writing this is 76.5 cm high, its top
  is 69.5 by 111 cm. It has turned legs, a drawer, seems to be
  seventy to eighty years old, was a possession of a great-aunt of
  my mother's, who, after her husband had died in a madhouse and
  she herself had moved into a smaller flat, sold it to her
  brother, my wife's grandfather. And so, after my wife's
  grandfather had died, it came into our possession, a despised and
  rather despicable piece of furniture of no value, knocking around
  somewhere, no one knows exactly where, until it surfaced during a
  move and proved to have been damaged by a bomb: somewhere, at
  some time or other, a piece of shrapnel had bored a hole through
  its top during the Second World War - already it would seem to be
  not merely of sentimental value, but an entry into a dimension of
  political and social history worth relating, using the table as
  an entrance vehicle, in which connection the deadly contempt of
  the furniture porters who nearly refused to bring it along would
  be more important than its present use, which is more of an
  accident than the stubbornness with which - and not for reasons
  of sentiment or memory, but rather for reasons of principle - we
  kept it from reaching the refuse dump, and as by now I have
  written a few things on this table, I might be permitted a
  passing attachment to it, with the emphasis on 'passing'. Not to
  mention the objects lying on this table; they are incidental and
  exchangeable, also accidental, with the possible exception of the
  Remington typewriter, model "Travel Writer de Luxe", produced in
  1957, to which I am also attached, this means of production that
  has long since lost all interest for the tax authorities,
  although it has played a major part in their acquisition of such
  income, and still does so. On this instrument that any specialist
  would regard or touch only with disdain, I have written at a
  guess four novels and several hundred items, and even so I am
  attached to it not only for that reason, but again because of
  principles, as it still works and proves how small the writer's
  opportunities and ambitions for investment are. I mention the
  table and the typewriter in order to demonstrate to myself that
  not even these two necessary utensils are completely
  understandable to me, and were I to attempt to elucidate their
  origins with the necessary exact correctness, their precise
  material, industrial, social process of production and their
  origins, it would give rise to an almost endless compilation of
  British and West German industrial and social history. Not to
  mention the house, the space in which this table stands, the soil
  on which this house was built, especially not to mention the
  people who - probably for several centuries - lived in it, the
  living and the dead, not to mention those who bring the coal,
  wash the silverware, deliver the letters and newspapers - and
  especially not to mention those who are close, closer, closest to
  us. And yet mustn't <i>everything</i>, from the table to the
  pencils, that lie there in their history in its entirety, be
  brought in, including those close, closer, closest to us? Will
  there not be enough remainders, gaps, resistances, poetry, God,
  fiction left - even more than in building bridges and baking
  rolls?<br>
  <br>
  It's true and it's easily said that language is material, and
  something does materialise as one writes. Yet how might one
  explain that - as is occasionally demonstrated - something like
  life appears, people, fates, actions; that this incarnation
  occurs on something so deathly pale as paper, where the
  imagination of the author is linked to that of the reader in a
  hitherto unexplained manner, a process that cannot be
  reconstructed in its entirety, where even the wisest, most
  sensitive interpretation remains only a more or less successful
  approximation; and how indeed might it be possible to describe,
  to register the transition from the conscious to the unconscious
  - in the person writing and the person reading, respectively -
  with the necessary total exactitude, and furthermore break it
  down into its national, continental, international, religious or
  ideological details, not neglecting the continually changing
  proportions of the two, in these two - the person writing and the
  person reading - and the sudden reversal where the one becomes
  the other; and that in this abrupt shift the one is no longer to
  be distinguished from the other? There will always be a
  remainder, whether you call it the inexplicable ('secret' would
  also be fine), there remains and will remain an area, however
  tiny, into which the reason of our origins will not penetrate,
  because it runs into the hitherto unexplained reason of poetry
  and of the art of the imagination, whose incarnation remains as
  elusive as the body of a woman, a man or even merely of an
  animal. Writing is - at least for me - movement forward, the
  conquest of a body that I do not know at all, away from something
  to something that I do not yet know; I never know what will
  happen - and here 'happen' is not intended as plot resolution, in
  the sense of classical dramaturgy, but in the sense of a
  complicated and complex experiment that with given imaginary,
  spiritual, intellectual and sensual materials in interaction
  strives - on paper to boot! - towards incarnation. In this respect
  there can be no successful literature, nor would there be any
  successful music or painting, because no one can already have
  seen the object it is striving to become, and in this respect
  everything that is superficially called modern, but which is
  better named living art, is experiment and discovery - and
  transient, can be estimated and measured only in its historical
  relativity, and it appears to me irrelevant to speak of eternal
  values, or to seek them. How will we survive without this gap,
  this remainder, which can be called irony, be called poetry, be
  called God, fiction, or resistance?<br>
  <br>
  Countries, too, are always only approaching what they claim to
  be, and there can be no state which does not leave this gap
  between the verbal expression of its constitution and its
  realisation, a space that remains, where poetry and resistance
  grow - and hopefully flourish. And there exists no form of
  literature which can succeed without this gap. Even the most
  precise account do without the atmosphere, without the
  imagination of the reader, even if the person writing it refuses
  to use it; and even the most precise account must omit - why, it
  must omit the exact and detailed description of circumstances
  that actually are required for the incarnation of the conditions
  of life ... it must compose, transpose elements, and even its
  interpretation and its working protocol are not communicable, if
  only because the material called language cannot be reduced to a
  reliable and generally comprehensible communicative currency: so
  much history and invented history, national and social history,
  and historical relativity - which would have to be included -
  weighs down every word, as I have tried to suggest via the
  example of my work desk. And determining the range of the message
  is not only a problem of translation from one language to
  another, it is a much more weighty problem within languages,
  where definitions can entail world views, and world views can
  entail wars - I would merely remind you of the wars after the
  Reformation, which <i>although</i> explicable in terms of power
  politics and hegemony, <i>also</i> are wars about religious
  definitions. It is therefore, by the way, trivial to claim that
  after all, we do speak the same language, if we do not also
  demonstrate the load that each word can bear at the level of
  regional, and frequently even local history. For me, at least,
  much of the German I see and hear sounds stranger than Swedish, a
  language of which I unfortunately understand very little.<br>
  <br>
  Politicians, ideologists, theologians and philosophers try time
  and again to provide solutions with nothing remaining, prefab
  solved problems. That is their duty - and it is ours, the
  writers' - since we know that we are not able to solve anything
  without remainders or resistance - to penetrate into the gaps.
  There are too many unexplained and inexplicable remainders,
  entire provinces of waste. Builders of bridges, bakers of rolls
  and writers of novels normally finish their jobs, and their
  remainders are not the most problematic areas. While we struggle
  over <i>litt&eacute;rature</i> <i>pure</i> and <i>litt&eacute;rature
  engag&eacute;e</i> - one of the false dichotomies to which I shall
  return in a while - we are still not aware of - or are unawares
  diverted from - thoughts about <i>l'argent pur</i> and
  <i>l'argent engag&eacute;.</i> If one really observes and listens
  to politicians and economists talking about something as
  supposedly rational as money, then the mystical, or perhaps
  merely mysterious area within these three occupations already
  mentioned becomes less and less interesting and astonishingly
  harmless. Let us take, merely as an example, the amazingly bold
  recent attack on the dollar (which was modestly called a dollar
  crisis). Naive layman that I am, something occurred to me that no
  one called by name: two countries were deeply affected, and most
  emphatically found it necessary - if we assume that the word
  'freedom' is not merely a fiction - to do something so remarkable
  as to support the dollar, i.e., were asked to open their coffers;
  and these two countries had something historic in common, namely
  their defeat in the Second World War, and they are both spoken of
  as having something else in common: their industriousness and
  diligence. As for the person it concerns - the one who jingles
  his pocket money or flashes his tiny bankroll - can't it be made
  clear to him why, although he is by no means working less for his
  money, it fetches less bread, milk, coffee, miles in a taxi? How
  many gaps does the mysticism of money offer, and in which
  strongrooms is its poetry hidden away? Idealistic parents and
  educators have always tried to convince us that money is filthy.
  I have never understood that, because I only received money when
  I had worked (always excepting the large sum that I have been
  awarded by the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1972/boll-lecture.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
  Academy</a>), and for anyone who has no choice other than to
  work, even the dirtiest job is clear. They provide a living for
  the those close to him, and for him, too. Money is the
  incarnation of his work, and that is clean. Between work and what
  it brings in there admittedly is an unexplained remainder, which
  vague formulas such as to earn well or to earn poorly are far
  less successful at filling than the gap left by the
  interpretation of a novel or poem.<br>
  <br>
  Compared to the unexplained gaps of money mysticism, the
  unexplained remainders of literature are strikingly harmless, and
  even so there are still people who with criminal frivolity let
  the word 'freedom' roll off their tongue, where submission to a
  myth and its claims to power is unequivocally demanded and
  obtained. They then call for political insight, precisely when
  insight and perception about the problem are blocked. On the
  bottom line of my cheque I see four different groups of numbers,
  32 characters in all, two of which resemble hieroglyphs. Five of
  these thirty-two characters are meaningful to me: three for my
  account number, two for the branch of the bank - what do the
  other twenty-seven represent, including quite a few zeroes? I am
  certain that all of these characters have a rational, meaningful,
  or as that lovely phrase would have it, an enlightening
  explanation. It's just that in my brain and my consciousness
  there is no room for this enlightening explanation, and what
  remains is the cipher mysticism of a secret science which I have
  more trouble penetrating, whose poetry and symbolism remains more
  alien to me than Marcel Proust's <i>Remembrance of Things
  Past</i> or the "Wessobrunn Prayer". What these 32 digits demand
  of me is trusting belief in the fact that everything is quite
  correct, that there remains no unclarity and, if I only were to
  make a slight effort, it all would be clear to me too; and yet
  for me something mysterious remains - or perhaps fear, much more
  fear than any realisation of poetry could produce in me. However,
  no successful currency policy is clear to those whose money is
  involved.<br>
  <br>
  Thirteen digits on my telephone bill, too, and a few on each of
  my various insurance policies, not to mention my tax, car and
  telephone numbers - I won't take the trouble to count all these
  numbers that I ought to have in my head or at least written down,
  in order to be able to note my exact place in society at any
  time. If we quite happily multiply these 32 digits and the
  numbers on my cheque by six, or let's give a discount and
  multiply them by four, add in the numbers of one's birthday, a
  few contractions for religious affiliation, civil status - have we
  then at last grasped the Occident in the addition and the
  integration of its reason? Is this reason, as we perceive and
  accept it - and it is not only made enlightening for us, but
  actually enlightens us - perhaps merely an occidental arrogance
  that we have exported to the entire world, via colonialism or
  missions, or in a mixture of them both as an instrument of
  subjugation? And for those affected, aren't or wouldn't the
  differences between Christian, socialist, communist, capitalistic
  outlooks be small, - and even if the poetry of this reason does
  at times enlighten them, yet doesn't the reason of their poetry
  remain the victor? What did the greatest crime of the Indians
  consist of, when they were confronted with European reason
  exported to America? They didn't know the value of gold - of
  money! And they fought against something, against that which we
  even now are fighting as the most recent product of our reason,
  against the destruction of their world and environment, against
  the total subjugation of their earth by profit, which was more
  alien to them than their gods and spirits are to us. And what
  indeed could have revealed to them the Christian message - the
  new and joyous tidings - in this insane, hypocritical smugness
  with which on Sunday people served God, praising him as the
  Saviour, and on Monday once again opened the banks right on time,
  the places where they administered the only idea they truly
  believed in, that of money, possession and profit? For the poetry
  of water and wind, of buffalo and grass, in which their life
  found its form, there was only scorn - and now we civilised
  Westerners in our cities, the end product of our total
  rationality - for in all fairness it must be said: we have not
  spared ourselves - we are beginning to sense just how real the
  poetry of water and wind actually is, and what is incarnated
  therein. Did, or does, the tragedy of our churches perhaps indeed
  consist, not of what the Enlightenment might have designated as
  unreasonable matters, but in the despairing and desperately
  failed attempt to pursue or even overtake a reason that has never
  been and never can be merged with something so irrational as the
  incarnated God? Regulations, law texts, approval of experts, a
  figure-laden forest of numbered regulations, and the production
  of prejudices that have been hammered into us and set out along
  the tracks of history teaching, in order to make people ever more
  estranged from one another. Even in the extreme western reaches
  of Europe our rationality is in opposition to another, which we
  simply label irrational. The horrifying problem of Northern
  Ireland nevertheless consists of the fact that here two kinds of
  reason have been entangled and hopelessly attacked one another
  for centuries.<br>
  <br>
  How many provinces of disparagement and disdain has history
  bequeathed to us? Continents are hidden under the victorious sign
  of our rationality. Entire populations remained strangers to one
  another, supposedly speaking the same language. Where marriage in
  the Western manner was prescribed as creating order, people
  ignored the fact that it was a privilege: unattainable,
  inachievable for those who worked the land, the people called
  farmhands and milkmaids, who simply didn't have the money even to
  buy a pair of sheets, and if they had saved up or stolen the
  money, wouldn't have had the bed to put the sheets on. And so
  they were left untouched in their illegitimacy; they produced
  kids anyway! From above and from the outside, everything seemed
  completely settled. Clear answers, clear questions, clear
  regulations, catechism as delusion. But please, no wonders, and
  poetry only as the sign of the supernatural, never the natural.
  And then people are surprised, even long for the old ways of
  life, when the disparaged and hidden provinces show signs of
  revolt, and then of course either the one party or the other must
  gain material and political profit from this revolt. Attempts
  have been made to bring order into the still unexplored continent
  called sexual love by means of regulations similar to those
  provided budding philatelists when they start their first album.
  Permitted and nonpermitted caresses are defined down to the most
  meticulous details, when suddenly, to their mutual horror, theo-
  and ideology confirm that on this continent which was regarded as
  determined, cooled and ordered, there yet remain a few
  unextinguished volcanoes - and volcanoes are simply not to be
  extinguished with tried and tested firefighting equipment. And
  just think of everything passed off, foisted off on God, this
  much-abused and pitiable authority: everything, yes, everything
  that was a problem: all the guides for inescapable misery in
  social, economic or sexual form pointed to him, everything
  despicable, contemptible, was palmed off on God, all the leftover
  &amp;"remainders", and yet at the same time he was being preached
  about as the Incarnate, without considering that one cannot place
  the burden of man on God, nor the burden of God on man, if he is
  to be considered incarnate. And who then can be surprised if he
  has survived where godlessness was prescribed and where the
  misery of the world and one's own society was put off to an
  unfulfilled catechism of equally dogmatic form and a future that
  was ever further away, and ever further delayed, until it turned
  out to be a dismal present? And once again we can also only be
  reacting to it with insufferable arrogance if we here presume to
  denounce this course of events as reactionary; and similarly, it
  is arrogance of the same kind if the official custodians of God
  claim as their own this God who appears to have survived in the
  Soviet Union, without clearing away the refuse dump under which
  he is hidden here, and if they cite the appearance of God
  <i>there</i> as justification for a societal system <i>here.</i>
  Again and again, whether boasting of our convictions as
  Christians or atheists, we wish to capitalise on one pigheadedly
  represented system of ideas or another. This madness of ours,
  this arrogance "in itself" again and again buries both: the
  incarnate Deity, who is called God become Man, and the vision set
  in its place, that of the future of the entirety of mankind. We
  who so easily humiliate others, we are lacking in something:
  humility - which is not to be confused with subordination or
  obedience, let alone submission. This is what we have done to the
  colonised peoples: transformed their humility, the poetry of this
  humility transformed into their humiliation. We are always eager
  to subjugate and conquer, hardly a surprise in a civilisation
  whose first text in a foreign language has long been Julius
  Caesar's <i>De Bello Gallico,</i> and whose first exercise in
  self-satisfaction - unequivocal and clear answers and questions -
  was the catechism, one catechism or the other, a primer in
  infallibility and in complete, pre-fab, pre-explained
  problems.<br>
  <br>
  I have got a bit away from the building of bridges, baking of
  rolls and writing of novels, and hinted at gaps, ironies, fictive
  areas, remnants, divinities, mystifications and resistance of
  other regions - they appeared to me worse, in greater need of
  illumination than the slight, unilluminated corners in which not
  our traditional reason, but the reason of poetry - as in for
  example a novel - lies hidden. The roughly two hundred figures,
  group by group (including a few codes), that I ought to have in
  exact sequences, in my head, or at least on a piece of paper, as
  a proof of my existence, without exactly knowing what they mean,
  incorporate little more than a pair of abstract claims and proofs
  of existence within a bureaucracy that not only claims to be, but
  actually is reasonable. People refer me to it and teach me to
  trust it blindly. May I not dare expect that people do not merely
  trust in, but strengthen the reason of poetry, not by leaving it
  in peace, but by absorbing a bit of its calmness and the pride of
  its humbleness, which can only be a humbleness towards those
  below, and never a humbleness towards those above. Regard for
  others, politeness and justice reside therein, and the wish to
  recognise and be recognised.<br>
  <br>
  I do not wish to provide new missionary starting-points and
  vehicles, but I do believe that in the sense of poetic
  humbleness, politeness and justice I must say that I see
  considerable similarity, I see possibilities for rapprochement
  between the stranger &agrave; la <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1957/index.html">Camus</a>, the strangeness of the
  Kafkaesque official and the incarnated God, who after all remains
  a stranger and - if one neglects a few outbursts of temper - is
  polite and literal in a remarkable way. Why else has the Catholic
  church long - I don't know exactly how long - blocked direct
  access to the literal nature of the texts they declare holy, or
  else kept it hidden in Latin and Greek, available only to the
  initiated? I imagine it is in order to keep out the dangers they
  sensed in the poetry of the incarnated word, and to protect the
  reason of their power from the dangerous reason of poetry. And
  after all it is not accidental that the most important
  consequence of the Reformation was the discovery of languages and
  their corporeality. And what empire ever could do without
  language imperialism, i.e., the diffusion of their own language
  and suppression of the languages of those ruled? In this - but in
  no other - connexion I regard the for once not imperialistic, but
  supposedly anti-imperialistic attempts to denounce poetry, the
  sensuality of language, its incarnation and the power of the
  imagination (for language and the power of the imagination are
  one and the same), and to introduce the false dichotomy of
  information or poetry, as a new version of "divide et impera". It
  is the brand-new, but once again almost international arrogance
  of a New Reason, which may possibly permit the poetry of the
  Indians as an anti-ruling class force, but withholds its own
  poetry from the classes to be liberated in its own land. Poetry
  is not a class privilege, it has never been one. Again and again
  well-established feudal and bourgeois literatures have renewed
  themselves out of what they condescendingly called popular
  language, or, to use more modern phrases, jargon or slang. This
  process may readily be labeled linguistic exploitation, but
  nothing about this exploitation is changed by spreading
  propaganda about the false alternatives: information or
  poetry/literature. The nostalgia-flavoured disapproval perhaps to
  be found in the expressions' popular language, slang, jargon does
  not warrant sending poetry, as well, into the exile of the
  rubbish heap, nor all the forms and expressions of art. Much
  about this is papal: withholding incarnation and sensuality from
  others while developing new catechisms which speak of the only
  correct and the truly false possibilities of expression. One
  cannot separate the power of the message from the power of the
  expression in which the message occurs; this paves the way for
  something that reminds me of the controversies about the
  communion in both forms, controversies that are theologically
  rather boring, but important as examples of rejected
  incarnations, and which in the Catholic part of the world became
  reduced to the pallor of the Host, which could not even be called
  a real piece of bread - not to mention the millions of
  hectolitres of wind withheld! Therein lay an arrogant
  misunderstanding, not merely of the substances involved, but even
  more of that which this substance was intended to
  incarnate.<br>
  <br>
  No class can be liberated by first withholding something from
  them, and whether this new school of Manichaeism claims to be a-
  or antireligious, it thereby takes over the model of the Church
  as a ruling class, the model which could end with Hus being
  burned at the stake and Luther excommunicated. One may readily
  quarrel about the concept of beauty, develop new aesthetics -
  they are indeed overdue - but they must not begin by withholding
  matters, and they must not exclude one thing; the possibility of
  transferral that literature offers: it transfers us to South or
  North America, to Sweden, India, Africa. It can also transfer us
  to another class, another time, another religion and another
  race. It has - even in its bourgeois form - never been its goal
  to create strangeness, but to remove it. And although one may
  regard the class from which it is largely derived as overdue for
  replacement, yet as a product of this class it was in most cases
  also a hiding-place for resistance to that class. And the
  internationality of resistance must be preserved, that which
  keeps or makes one writer - <a href=
  "../1970/index.html">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> - a believer, and
  another - Arrabal - an embittered and bitter enemy of religion
  and the Church. Nor is this resistance to be comprehended as a
  mere mechanism or reflex which calls forth belief in God here,
  lack of belief in God there, but rather as the incarnation of the
  relationships of intellectual history as they are played out
  between various rubbish heaps and provinces of rebellion and
  apostasy ... and also as recognition of their interconnections
  without arrogance and without claims of infallibility. To a
  political prisoner or perhaps only isolated dissidents in, e.g.,
  the Soviet Union it may seem wrong or even insane when people in
  the Western world protest against the Vietnam War -
  psychologically, one can understand his situation in his cell or
  his social isolation - and yet he would have to realise that the
  guilt of the one cannot be ticked off against that of the other,
  and that when people demonstrate for Vietnam, they also
  demonstrate for him! I know that this sounds utopian, and yet
  this appears to me to be the only possibility of a new
  internationality, not neutrality. No author can take over alleged
  or specious divisions and judgements, and to me it appears almost
  suicidal that we are even and still discussing the division into
  committed literature and other kinds. Not only do we, precisely
  when we think that it is the one, have to intervene for the other
  with all our might; no, it is precisely through this falsified
  alternative that we accept a bourgeois principle of divisions,
  one which turns us into strangers. It is not only the division of
  our potential strength, but also of our potential - and I'll risk
  this without even blushing - incarnated beauty, since it too can
  liberate, just as the communicated thought can: it can be
  liberating in itself, or as the provocation that it may create.
  The strength of undivided literature is not the neutralisation of
  directions, but the internationality of resistance, and to this
  resistance belong poetry, incarnation, sensuality, imaginative
  power and beauty. The new Manichaean iconoclasticism which wants
  to take them away from us, which wants to take all art away from
  us, would rob not only us, but also those for whom it does what
  it believes it must do. No curse, no bitterness, not even the
  information about the desperate situation of a class is possible
  without poetry, and even to condemn it requires that it first
  must be recognised. Go and read Rosa Luxemburg carefully and note
  which statues Lenin ordered erected first: the first for Count
  Tolstoy, of whom he said that until this count began to write,
  Russian literature contained no peasants; the second for the
  "reactionary" Dostoevsky. If one wishes to choose an ascetic road
  to change, one might personally renounce art and literature, but
  one cannot do so for others until one has brought them to the
  knowledge or recognition of what they are to renounce. This
  renunciation must be voluntary, or else it becomes a papal
  decree, like a new catechism, and once again an entire continent,
  such as the continent of Love, would be doomed to a parched
  sterility. It is not merely for frivolity nor only to shock that
  art and literature have again and again transformed their forms,
  discovering new ones by experiment. In these forms they have also
  incarnated something, and that something was almost never the
  confirmation of what existed and was already available; and if it
  is extirpated, one gives up a further possibility: artifice. Art
  is always a good hiding-place, not for dynamite, but for
  intellectual explosives and social time bombs. Why would there
  otherwise have been the various Indices? And precisely in their
  despised and often even despicable beauty and lack of
  transparency lies the best hiding-place for the barb that brings
  about the sudden jerk or the sudden recognition.<br>

  Before concluding, I must state a necessary limitation. The
  weakness of my intimations and explanations unavoidably stems
  from the fact that although I question the tradition of reason in
  which - hopefully not completely successfully - I was brought up,
  I am nevertheless using the means of that very same reason, and
  it would be more than unfair to denounce this reason in all its
  dimensions. This reason has obviously succeeded in spreading
  doubt about its allencompassing claim, about what I have called
  its arrogance, and in retaining experience in and memory of what
  I have called the reason of poetry, which I do not regard as a
  privileged, nor a bourgeois institution. It can be communicated,
  and precisely because its literalness and incarnation often
  appear strange, it can prevent or remove strangeness or
  alienation. After all, <i>befremdet zu sein</i> 'being strange'
  can also involve being astounded, surprised, or merely moved. As
  for what I have said about humbleness - naturally only by way of
  suggestion - I say it is not thanks to my religious upbringing or
  memory, which always meant humiliating when it said humility, but
  from reading Dostoevsky early and late in life. And it is
  precisely because I consider as the most important literary shift
  the international movement for a classless, or no longer
  class-determined literature, the discovery of entire provinces of
  humbled people destined to be human waste, that I warn you about
  the destruction of poetry, about the arid sterility of
  Manichaeism, about the iconoclasticism of what appears to me to
  be a blind zeal which won't even tap up the bath water before it
  throws out the baby. It appears meaningless to me to denounce or
  to glorify the young or the old. It appears meaningless to me to
  dream of old ways of life that only can be reconstructed in
  museums; it appears meaningless to me to create dichotomies such
  as conservative/progressive. The new wave of nostalgia that
  clings to furniture, clothes, forms of expression and scales of
  feeling only serves to demonstrate that the new world grows ever
  stranger to us. That the reason upon which we have built and
  relied has not made the world more reliable or familiar; that the
  rational/irrational dichotomy also was a false one. Here I have
  had to avoid or abandon a great deal, because one thought always
  leads to another and we would get carried away if we were to
  survey every detail of these continents exhaustively. I have had
  to abandon humour, which also is not the privilege of any class,
  and yet is ignored in its poetry and as a hiding-place for
  resistance.</p>
