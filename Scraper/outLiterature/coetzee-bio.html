  <h1>J. M. Coetzee - Biographical</h1>
<p><img src="coetzee.jpg" class="bio-img">John 
              Maxwell Coetzee was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 9 February
              1940, the elder of two children. His mother was a primary school 
              teacher. His father was trained as an attorney, but practiced as such only intermittently;
              during the years 1941&#8211;45 he served with the South African 
              forces in North Africa and Italy. Though Coetzee's parents were not of British 
              descent, the language spoken at home was English.</p>
            <p> Coetzee received his primary schooling in Cape 
              Town and in the nearby town of Worcester. For his secondary education he attended a school 
              in Cape Town run by a Catholic order, the Marist Brothers. He matriculated in 1956.</p>
            <p>Coetzee entered the University of Cape Town 
              in 1957, and in 1960 and 1961 graduated successively with honours degrees in English and 
              mathematics. He spent the years 1962&#8211;65 in England, working as a computer 
              programmer while doing research for a thesis on the English novelist Ford Madox
              Ford.</p>
            <p>In 1963 he married Philippa Jubber (1939&#8211;1991). 
              They had two children, Nicolas (1966&#8211;1989) and Gisela (b. 
              1968).</p>
            <p>In 1965 Coetzee entered the graduate school 
              of the University of Texas at
              Austin, and in 1968 graduated with a PhD in English, linguistics, 
              and Germanic languages. His doctoral dissertation was on the early fiction of 
              <a href="/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1969/index.html">Samuel Beckett</a>.</p>
            <p>For three years (1968&#8211;71) Coetzee was 
              assistant professor of English at the
              State University of New York in Buffalo. After an application for 
              permanent residence in the United States was denied, he returned to South 
              Africa. From 1972 until 2000 he held a series of positions at the University 
              of Cape Town, the last of them as Distinguished Professor of Literature.</p>
            <p>Between 1984 and 2003 he also taught frequently 
              in the United States: at the State University of New York, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard 
              University, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago, where for six 
              years he was a member of the Committee on Social Thought.</p>
            <p>Coetzee began writing fiction in 1969. His first 
              book, <i>Dusklands</i>, was published in South Africa in 1974. <i>In 
              the Heart of the Country</i> (1977) won South Africa's then 
              principal literary award, the CNA Prize, and was published in Britain 
              and the USA. <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i> (1980) received international 
              notice. His reputation was confirmed by <i>Life &amp; Times of Michael 
              K</i> (1983), which won Britain's Booker Prize. It was followed 
              by <i>Foe</i> (1986), <i>Age of Iron</i> (1990), <i>The Master of 
              Petersburg</i> (1994), and <i>Disgrace</i> (1999), which again won 
              the Booker Prize.</p>
            <p> Coetzee also wrote two fictionalized memoirs, 
              <i>Boyhood</i> (1997) and <i>Youth</i> (2002). <i>The Lives of Animals</i> 
              (1999) is a fictionalized lecture, later absorbed into <i>Elizabeth 
              Costello</i> (2003). <i>White Writing</i> (1988) is a set of essays 
              on South African literature and culture. <i>Doubling the Point</i> 
              (1992) consists of essays and interviews with David Attwell. <i>Giving 
              Offense</i> (1996) is a study of literary censorship. <i>Stranger 
              Shores</i> (2001) collects his later literary essays.</p>
            <p>Coetzee has also been active as a translator 
              of Dutch and Afrikaans literature.</p>
            <p>In 2002 Coetzee emigrated to Australia. He lives 
              with his partner Dorothy Driver in Adelaide, South Australia, where he holds an honorary 
              position at the University of Adelaide.</p>
