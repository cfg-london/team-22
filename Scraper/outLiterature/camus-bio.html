  <h1>Albert Camus - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="camus.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Albert Camus</b> (1913-1960) was a
  representative of non-metropolitan French literature. His origin
  in Algeria and his experiences there in the thirties were
  dominating influences in his thought and work. Of
  semi-proletarian parents, early attached to intellectual circles
  of strongly revolutionary tendencies, with a deep interest in
  philosophy (only chance prevented him from pursuing a university
  career in that field), he came to France at the age of
  twenty-five. The man and the times met: Camus joined the
  resistance movement during the occupation and after the
  liberation was a columnist for the newspaper <i>Combat.</i> But
  his journalistic activities had been chiefly a response to the
  demands of the time; in 1947 Camus retired from political
  journalism and, besides writing his fiction and essays, was very
  active in the theatre as producer and playwright (<i>e.g.,
  Caligula</i>, 1944). He also adapted plays by Calderon, Lope de
  Vega, Dino Buzzati, and <a href=
  "../1949/index.html">Faulkner's</a> <i>Requiem for a Nun.</i> His
  love for the theatre may be traced back to his membership in
  L'Equipe, an Algerian theatre group, whose "collective creation"
  <i>R&eacute;volte dans les Asturies</i> (1934) was banned for
  political reasons.<br>

  The essay <i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe</i> (The Myth of Sisyphus),
  1942, expounds Camus's notion of the absurd and of its acceptance
  with "the total absence of hope, which has nothing to do with
  despair, a continual refusal, which must not be confused with
  renouncement - and a conscious dissatisfaction". Meursault,
  central character of <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i> (The Stranger), 1942,
  illustrates much of this essay: man as the nauseated victim of
  the absurd orthodoxy of habit, later - when the young killer
  faces execution - tempted by despair, hope, and salvation. Dr.
  Rieux of <i>La Peste</i> (The Plague), 1947, who tirelessly
  attends the plague-stricken citizens of Oran, enacts the revolt
  against a world of the absurd and of injustice, and confirms
  Camus's words: "We refuse to despair of mankind. Without having
  the unreasonable ambition to save men, we still want to serve
  them". Other well-known works of Camus are <i>La Chute</i> (The
  Fall), 1956, and <i>L'Exil et le royaume</i> (Exile and the
  Kingdom), 1957. His austere search for moral order found its
  aesthetic correlative in the classicism of his art. He was a
  stylist of great purity and intense concentration and
  rationality.</p>
