  <h1>Winston Churchill - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="churchill.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>The Right Honourable Sir Winston Leonard
  Spencer Churchill</b> (1874-1965), the son of Lord Randolph
  Churchill and his American wife Jennie Jerome, was educated at Harrow and
  Sandhurst. After a brief but eventful career in the
  army, he became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 1900. He
  held many high posts in Liberal and Conservative governments
  during the first three decades of the century. At the outbreak of
  the Second World War, he was appointed First Lord of the
  Admiralty - a post which he had earlier held from 1911 to 1915.
  In May, 1940, he became Prime Minister and Minister of Defence
  and remained in office until 1945. He took over the premiership
  again in the Conservative victory of 1951 and resigned in 1955.
  However, he remained a Member of Parliament until the general
  election of 1964, when he did not seek re-election. Queen
  Elizabeth II conferred on Churchill the dignity of Knighthood and
  invested him with the insignia of the Order of the Garter in
  1953. Among the other countless honours and decorations he
  received, special mention should be made of the honorary
  citizenship of the United States which President Kennedy
  conferred on him in 1963.<br>

  Churchill's literary career began with campaign reports: <i>The
  Story of the Malakand Field Force</i> (1898) and <i>The River
  War</i> (1899), an account of the campaign in the Sudan and the
  Battle of Omdurman. In 1900, he published his only novel,
  <i>Savrola</i>, and, six years later, his first major work, the
  biography of his father, <i>Lord Randolph Churchill</i>. His
  other famous biography, the life of his great ancestor, the Duke
  of Marlborough, was published in four volumes between 1933 and
  1938. Churchill's history of the First World War appeared in four
  volumes under the title of <i>The World Crisis</i> (1923-29); his
  memoirs of the Second World War ran to six volumes
  (1948-1953/54). After his retirement from office, Churchill wrote
  a <i>History of the English-speaking Peoples</i> (4 vols.,
  1956-58). His magnificent oratory survives in a dozen volumes of
  speeches, among them <i>The Unrelenting Struggle</i> (1942),
  <i>The Dawn of Liberation</i> (1945), and Victory (1946).<br>

  Churchill, a gifted amateur painter, wrote <i>Painting as a
  Pastime</i> (1948). An autobiographical account of his youth,
  <i>My Early Life</i>, appeared in 1930.</p>
