  <h1>Toni Morrison - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="morrison.jpg" class="bio-img">Born <b>Chloe Anthony Wofford</b>, in 1931
  in Lorain (Ohio), the second of four children in a black
  working-class family. Displayed an early interest in literature.
  Studied humanities at Howard and Cornell Universities, followed by an academic career
  at Texas Southern
  University, Howard University, Yale, and since 1989, a chair at Princeton
  University. She has also worked as an editor for Random
  House, a critic, and given numerous public lectures, specializing
  in African-American literature. She made her debut as a novelist
  in 1970, soon gaining the attention of both critics and a wider
  audience for her epic power, unerring ear for dialogue, and her
  poetically-charged and richly-expressive depictions of Black
  America. A member since 1981 of the American Academy of Arts and
  Letters, she has been awarded a number of literary distinctions,
  among them the Pulitzer Prize in 1988.</p>
