  <h1>Alexandr Solzhenitsyn - Biographical</h1>
  
<p><img src="solzhenitsyn.jpg" class="bio-img">
  I was born at Kislovodsk on 11th December,
  1918. My father had studied philological subjects at Moscow
  University, but did not complete his studies, as he enlisted as a
  volunteer when war broke out in 1914. He became an artillery
  officer on the German front, fought throughout the war and died
  in the summer of 1918, six months before I was born. I was
  brought up by my mother, who worked as a shorthand-typist, in the
  town of Rostov on the Don, where I spent the whole of my
  childhood and youth, leaving the grammar school there in 1936.
  Even as a child, without any prompting from others, I wanted to
  be a writer and, indeed, I turned out a good deal of the usual
  juvenilia. In the 1930s, I tried to get my writings published but
  I could not find anyone willing to accept my manuscripts. I
  wanted to acquire a literary education, but in Rostov such an
  education that would suit my wishes was not to be obtained. To
  move to Moscow was not possible, partly because my mother was
  alone and in poor health, and partly because of our modest
  circumstances. I therefore began to study at the Department of
  Mathematics at Rostov University, where it proved that I had
  considerable aptitude for mathematics. But although I found it
  easy to learn this subject, I did not feel that I wished to
  devote my whole life to it. Nevertheless, it was to play a
  beneficial role in my destiny later on, and on at least two
  occasions, it rescued me from death. For I would probably not
  have survived the eight years in camps if I had not, as a
  mathematician, been transferred to a so-called <i>sharashia</i>,
  where I spent four years; and later, during my exile, I was
  allowed to teach mathematics and physics, which helped to ease my
  existence and made it possible for me to write. If I had had a
  literary education it is quite likely that I should not have
  survived these ordeals but would instead have been subjected to
  even greater pressures. Later on, it is true, I began to get some
  literary education as well; this was from 1939 to 1941, during
  which time, along with university studies in physics and
  mathematics, I also studied by correspondence at the Institute of
  History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow.<br>
  <br>
  In 1941, a few days before the outbreak of the war, I graduated
  from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rostov
  University. At the beginning of the war, owing to weak health, I
  was detailed to serve as a driver of horsedrawn vehicles during
  the winter of 1941-1942. Later, because of my mathematical
  knowledge, I was transferred to an artillery school, from which,
  after a crash course, I passed out in November 1942. Immediately
  after this I was put in command of an artillery-position-finding
  company, and in this capacity, served, without a break, right in
  the front line until I was arrested in February 1945. This
  happened in East Prussia, a region which is linked with my
  destiny in a remarkable way. As early as 1937, as a first-year
  student, I chose to write a descriptive essay on "The Samsonov
  Disaster" of 1914 in East Prussia and studied material on this;
  and in 1945 I myself went to this area (at the time of writing,
  autumn 1970, the book <i>August 1914</i> has just been
  completed).<br>
  <br>
  I was arrested on the grounds of what the censorship had found
  during the years 1944-45 in my correspondence with a school
  friend, mainly because of certain disrespectful remarks about
  Stalin, although we referred to him in disguised terms. As a
  further basis for the "charge", there were used the drafts of
  stories and reflections which had been found in my map case.
  These, however, were not sufficient for a "prosecution", and in
  July 1945 I was "sentenced" in my absence, in accordance with a
  procedure then frequently applied, after a resolution by the OSO
  (the Special Committee of the NKVD), to eight years in a
  detention camp (at that time this was considered a mild
  sentence).<br>
  <br>
  I served the first part of my sentence in several correctional
  work camps of mixed types (this kind of camp is described in the
  play, <i>The Tenderfoot and the Tramp</i>). In 1946, as a
  mathematician, I was transferred to the group of scientific
  research institutes of the MVD-MOB (Ministry of Internal Affairs,
  Ministry of State Security). I spent the middle period of my
  sentence in such "SPECIAL PRISONS" (<i>The First
  Circle</i>). In 1950 I was sent to the newly established "Special
  Camps" which were intended only for political prisoners. In such
  a camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan (<i>One Day in the
  Life of Ivan Denisovich</i>), I worked as a miner, a bricklayer,
  and a foundryman. There I contracted a tumour which was operated
  on, but the condition was not cured (its character was not
  established until later on).<br>
  <br>
  One month after I had served the full term of my eight-year
  sentence, there came, without any new judgement and even without
  a "resolution from the OSO", an administrative decision to the
  effect that I was not to be released but EXILED FOR LIFE to
  Kok-Terek (southern Kazakhstan). This measure was not directed
  specially against me, but was a very usual procedure at that
  time. I served this exile from March 1953 (on March 5th, when
  Stalin's death was made public, I was allowed for the first time
  to go out without an escort) until June 1956. Here my cancer had
  developed rapidly, and at the end of 1953, I was very near death.
  I was unable to eat, I could not sleep and was severely affected
  by the poisons from the tumour. However, I was able to go to a
  cancer clinic at Tashkent, where, during 1954, I was cured
  (<i>The Cancer Ward, Right Hand</i>). During all the years of
  exile, I taught mathematics and physics in a primary school and
  during my hard and lonely existence I wrote prose in secret (in
  the camp I could only write down poetry from memory). I managed,
  however, to keep what I had written, and to take it with me to
  the European part of the country, where, in the same way, I
  continued, as far as the outer world was concerned, to occupy
  myself with teaching and, in secret, to devote myself to writing,
  at first in the Vladimir district (<i>Matryona's Farm</i>) and
  afterwards in Ryazan.<br>
  <br>
  During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I
  should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime,
  but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances
  to read anything I had written because I feared that this would
  become known. Finally, at the age of 42, this secret authorship
  began to wear me down. The most difficult thing of all to bear
  was that I could not get my works judged by people with literary
  training. In 1961, after the 22nd Congress of the U.S.S.R.
  Communist Party and Tvardovsky's speech at this, I decided to
  emerge and to offer <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan
  Denisovich</i>.<br>
  <br>
  Such an emergence seemed, then, to me, and not without reason, to
  be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my
  manuscripts, and to my own destruction. But, on that occasion,
  things turned out successfully, and after protracted efforts,
  A.T. Tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later. The
  printing of my work was, however, stopped almost immediately and
  the authorities stopped both my plays and (in 1964) the novel,
  <i>The First Circle</i>, which, in 1965, was seized together with
  my papers from the past years. During these months it seemed to
  me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my
  work prematurely and that because of this I should not be able to
  carry it to a conclusion.<br>
  <br>
  It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events
  which you have already experienced, and to understand their
  meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more
  unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future
  events.</p>
