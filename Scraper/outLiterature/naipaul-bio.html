  <h1>V. S. Naipaul - Biographical</h1>
          

  <h3>Naipaul is Truly a Nobel Man in a Free State</h3>
            <p class="smalltext">by David Pryce-Jones</p>
            <p><img src="naipaul.jpg" class="bio-img">The Nobel Prize for literature has gone to someone 
              who deserves it. Like the great masters of the past, V.S. Naipaul 
              tells stories which show us ourselves and the reality we live in. 
              His use of language is as precise as it is beautiful. Simple, strong 
              words, with which to express the humanity of all of us.</p>
            <p>Born in Trinidad in 1932, the descendant of 
              indentured labourers shipped from India, this dispossessed child 
              of the Raj has come on a long and marvellous journey. His upbringing 
              familiarised him with every sort of deprivation, material and cultural. 
              A scholarship to Oxford brought him to this country. Nothing sustained 
              him afterwards except the determination, often close to despair, 
              to become a writer. Against all likelihood, a spirit of pure comedy 
              flows through his early books. It is a saving grace.</p>
            <p>Footloose, he began to travel for long periods 
              in India and Africa. It was at a time of decolonisation, when so 
              many people the whole world over had to reassess their identity. 
              Naipaul saw for himself the resulting turmoil of emotions, that 
              collision of self-serving myth and guilt which make up today's bewildered 
              world and prevents people from coming to terms with who they really 
              are, and to know how to treat one another. On these travels he was 
              exploring nothing less than the meaning of culture and history.</p>
            <p>Victimhood might have been his central theme, 
              granted his background. Not at all. That same determination to be 
              a writer also liberated him from self-pity. Each one of us, his 
              books declare, can choose to be a free individual. It is a matter 
              of will and choice, and above all intellect. Critics have sometimes 
              argued that people - in the Third World especially - are trapped 
              in their culture and history without possibility of choice, and 
              can only be free if others make them so. To them, V.S. Naipaul's 
              vision that they have to take responsibility for themselves can 
              seem like some sort of First World privilege, and a conservative 
              philosophy at that.</p>
            <p>Quite the contrary: the absolute rejection of 
              victimhood is necessary if we are to meet as we must on an equal 
              footing, and it is no exaggeration to say that he has shifted public 
              opinion towards this understanding as no other writer has done. 
              Courage and persistence were required to hold a belief quite so 
              unfashionable in recent years, but it is this belief that has made 
              Naipaul the universal writer and humanist that he is.</p>
            <p>The comic spirit is still present, though submerged 
              in his later books beneath a darkening sense of tragedy. Naipaul 
              has written about slavery, revolution, guerrillas, corrupt politicians, 
              the poor and the oppressed, interpreting the rages so deeply rooted 
              in our societies. Long before others, he began to report on the 
              irrational frenzy loosed these past two decades by religion in the 
              Islamic world from Iran to Indonesia and Pakistan. This phenomenon 
              too was a retreat from history into self-serving myth. Self-pity 
              possesses Islamic fundamentalists so absolutely that they are able 
              to close out everything else. Yet Naipaul also observed with profound 
              insight that even the most fanaticised among them know that the 
              West will always be there setting the objective standards, and that 
              they can do nothing about that. They are to be pitied for rage so 
              helpless.</p>
            <p>In himself, Naipaul is a private man, who lives 
              in the country in order to have the solitude for thinking and writing. 
              Everything that has ever happened to him is pigeonholed with exactitude 
              in his memory. Formidably well-read, he can quote books he read 
              years ago, and all the conversations he has had. Melancholy grips 
              him at the spectacle of &quot;the steady grinding down of the old 
              world&quot; as he put it, and he might complain to an interviewer 
              that he is living in a &quot;plebeian culture that celebrates itself.&quot;</p>
            <p>Other writers born abroad have settled here 
              and enriched our literature, but there has never been one like Naipaul. 
              His personal story is moving; his achievement extraordinary. There 
              is a great moral to his life's work, that the human comedy will 
              come out all right because, when all is said and done, intellect 
              is more powerful than vicissitude and wickedness.</p>
