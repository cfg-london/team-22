<h2><br>In Search of the Present</h2>

<p>I begin with two words that all men have uttered since 
the dawn of humanity: thank you. The word gratitude has equivalents 
in every language and in each tongue the range of meanings is abundant. 
In the Romance languages this breadth spans the spiritual and the 
physical, from the divine grace conceded to men to save them from 
error and death, to the bodily grace of the dancing girl or the 
feline leaping through the undergrowth. Grace means pardon, forgiveness, 
favour, benefice, inspiration; it is a form of address, a pleasing 
style of speaking or painting, a gesture expressing politeness, 
and, in short, an act that reveals spiritual goodness. Grace is 
gratuitous; it is a gift. The person who receives it, the favoured 
one, is grateful for it; if he is not base, he expresses gratitude. 
That is what I am doing at this very moment with these weightless 
words. I hope my emotion compensates their weightlessness. If each 
of my words were a drop of water, you would see through them and 
glimpse what I feel: gratitude, acknowledgement. And also an indefinable 
mixture of fear, respect and surprise at finding myself here before 
you, in this place which is the home of both Swedish learning and 
world literature.<br>
<br>
Languages are vast realities that transcend those political and 
historical entities we call nations. The European languages we speak 
in the Americas illustrate this. The special position of our literatures 
when compared to those of England, Spain, Portugal and France depends 
precisely on this fundamental fact: they are literatures written 
in transplanted tongues. Languages are born and grow from the native 
soil, nourished by a common history. The European languages were 
rooted out from their native soil and their own tradition, and then 
planted in an unknown and unnamed world: they took root in the new 
lands and, as they grew within the societies of America, they were 
transformed. They are the same plant yet also a different plant. 
Our literatures did not passively accept the changing fortunes of 
the transplanted languages: they participated in the process and 
even accelerated it. They very soon ceased to be mere transatlantic 
reflections: at times they have been the negation of the literatures 
of Europe; more often, they have been a reply.<br>
<br>
In spite of these oscillations the link has never been broken. My 
classics are those of my language and I consider myself to be a 
descendant of Lope and Quevedo, as any Spanish writer would ... 
yet I am not a Spaniard. I think that most writers of Spanish America, 
as well as those from the United States, Brazil and Canada, would 
say the same as regards the English, Portuguese and French traditions. 
To understand more clearly the special position of writers in the 
Americas, we should think of the dialogue maintained by Japanese, 
Chinese or Arabic writers with the different literatures of Europe. 
It is a dialogue that cuts across multiple languages and civilizations. 
Our dialogue, on the other hand, takes place within the same language. 
We are Europeans yet we are not Europeans. What are we then? It 
is difficult to define what we are, but our works speak for us.<br>
<br>
In the field of literature, the great novelty of the present century 
has been the appearance of the American literatures. The first to 
appear was that of the English-speaking part and then, in the second 
half of the 20th Century, that of Latin America in its two great 
branches: Spanish America and Brazil. Although they are very different, 
these three literatures have one common feature: the conflict, which 
is more ideological than literary, between the cosmopolitan and 
nativist tendencies, between Europeanism and Americanism. What is 
the legacy of this dispute? The polemics have disappeared; what 
remain are the works. Apart from this general resemblance, the differences 
between the three literatures are multiple and profound. One of 
them belongs more to history than to literature: the development 
of Anglo-American literature coincides with the rise of the United 
States as a world power whereas the rise of our literature coincides 
with the political and social misfortunes and upheavals of our nations. 
This proves once more the limitations of social and historical determinism: 
the decline of empires and social disturbances sometimes coincide 
with moments of artistic and literary splendour. Li-Po and Tu Fu 
witnessed the fall of the Tang dynasty; Vel&aacute;zquez painted 
for Felipe IV; Seneca and Lucan were contemporaries and also victims 
of Nero. Other differences are of a literary nature and apply more 
to particular works than to the character of each literature. But 
can we say that literatures have a <i>character?</i> Do they possess 
a set of shared features that distinguish them from other literatures? 
I doubt it. A literature is not defined by some fanciful, intangible 
character; it is a society of unique works united by relations of 
opposition and affinity.<br>
<br>
The first basic difference between Latin-American and Anglo-American 
literature lies in the diversity of their origins. Both begin as 
projections of Europe. The projection of an island in the case of 
North America; that of a peninsula in our case. Two regions that 
are geographically, historically and culturally eccentric. The origins 
of North America are in England and the Reformation; ours are in 
Spain, Portugal and the Counter-Reformation. For the case of Spanish 
America I should briefly mention what distinguishes Spain from other 
European countries, giving it a particularly original historical 
identity. Spain is no less eccentric than England but its eccentricity 
is of a different kind. The eccentricity of the English is insular 
and is characterized by isolation: an eccentricity that excludes. 
Hispanic eccentricity is peninsular and consists of the coexistence 
of different civilizations and different pasts: an inclusive eccentricity. 
In what would later be Catholic Spain, the Visigoths professed the 
heresy of Arianism, and we could also speak about the centuries 
of domination by Arabic civilization, the influence of Jewish thought, 
the Reconquest, and other characteristic features.<br>
<br>
Hispanic eccentricity is reproduced and multiplied in America, especially 
in those countries such as Mexico and Peru, where ancient and splendid 
civilizations had existed. In Mexico, the Spaniards encountered 
history as well as geography. That history is still alive: it is 
a present rather than a past. The temples and gods of pre-Columbian 
Mexico are a pile of ruins, but the spirit that breathed life into 
that world has not disappeared; it speaks to us in the hermetic 
language of myth, legend, forms of social coexistence, popular art, 
customs. Being a Mexican writer means listening to the voice of 
that present, that presence. Listening to it, speaking with it, 
deciphering it: expressing it ... After this brief digression we 
may be able to perceive the peculiar relation that simultaneously 
binds us to and separates us from the European tradition.<br>
<br>
This consciousness of being separate is a constant feature of our 
spiritual history. Separation is sometimes experienced as a wound 
that marks an internal division, an anguished awareness that invites 
self-examination; at other times it appears as a challenge, a spur 
that incites us to action, to go forth and encounter others and 
the outside world. It is true that the feeling of separation is 
universal and not peculiar to Spanish Americans. It is born at the 
very moment of our birth: as we are wrenched from the Whole we fall 
into an alien land. This experience becomes a wound that never heals. 
It is the unfathomable depth of every man; all our ventures and 
exploits, all our acts and dreams, are bridges designed to overcome 
the separation and reunite us with the world and our fellow-beings. 
Each man's life and the collective history of mankind can thus be 
seen as attempts to reconstruct the original situation. An unfinished 
and endless cure for our divided condition. But it is not my intention 
to provide yet another description of this feeling. I am simply 
stressing the fact that for us this existential condition expresses 
itself in historical terms. It thus becomes an awareness of our 
history. How and when does this feeling appear and how is it transformed 
into consciousness? The reply to this double-edged question can 
be given in the form of a theory or a personal testimony. I prefer 
the latter: there are many theories and none is entirely convincing.<br>
<br>
The feeling of separation is bound up with the oldest and vaguest 
of my memories: the first cry, the first scare. Like every child 
I built emotional bridges in the imagination to link me to the world 
and to other people. I lived in a town on the outskirts of Mexico 
City, in an old dilapidated house that had a jungle-like garden 
and a great room full of books. First games and first lessons. The 
garden soon became the centre of my world; the library, an enchanted 
cave. I used to read and play with my cousins and schoolmates. There 
was a fig tree, temple of vegetation, four pine trees, three ash 
trees, a nightshade, a pomegranate tree, wild grass and prickly 
plants that produced purple grazes. Adobe walls. Time was elastic; 
space was a spinning wheel. All time, past or future, real or imaginary, 
was pure presence. Space transformed itself ceaselessly. The beyond 
was here, all was here: a valley, a mountain, a distant country, 
the neighbours' patio. Books with pictures, especially history books, 
eagerly leafed through, supplied images of deserts and jungles, 
palaces and hovels, warriors and princesses, beggars and kings. 
We were shipwrecked with Sinbad and with Robinson, we fought with 
d'Artagnan, we took Valencia with the Cid. How I would have liked 
to stay forever on the Isle of Calypso! In summer the green branches 
of the fig tree would sway like the sails of a caravel or a pirate 
ship. High up on the mast, swept by the wind, I could make out islands 
and continents, lands that vanished as soon as they became tangible. 
The world was limitless yet it was always within reach; time was 
a pliable substance that weaved an unbroken present.<br>
<br>
When was the spell broken? Gradually rather than suddenly. It is 
hard to accept being betrayed by a friend, deceived by the woman 
we love, or that the idea of freedom is the mask of a tyrant. What 
we call "finding out" is a slow and tricky process because we ourselves 
are the accomplices of our errors and deceptions. Nevertheless, 
I can remember fairly clearly an incident that was the first sign, 
although it was quickly forgotten. I must have been about six when 
one of my cousins who was a little older showed me a North American 
magazine with a photograph of soldiers marching along a huge avenue, 
probably in New York. "They've returned from the war" she said. 
This handful of words disturbed me, as if they foreshadowed the 
end of the world or the Second Coming of Christ. I vaguely knew 
that somewhere far away a war had ended a few years earlier and 
that the soldiers were marching to celebrate their victory. For 
me, that war had taken place in another time, not here and now. 
The photo refuted me. I felt literally dislodged from the present.<br>
<br>
From that moment time began to fracture more and more. And there 
was a plurality of spaces. The experience repeated itself more and 
more frequently. Any piece of news, a harmless phrase, the headline 
in a newspaper: everything proved the outside world's existence 
and my own unreality. I felt that the world was splitting and that 
I did not inhabit the present. My present was disintegrating: real 
time was somewhere else. My time, the time of the garden, the fig 
tree, the games with friends, the drowsiness among the plants at 
three in the afternoon under the sun, a fig torn open (black and 
red like a live coal but one that is sweet and fresh): this was 
a fictitious time. In spite of what my senses told me, the time 
from over there, belonging to the others, was the real one, the 
time of the real present. I accepted the inevitable: I became an 
adult. That was how my expulsion from the present began.<br>
<br>
It may seem paradoxical to say that we have been expelled from the 
present, but it is a feeling we have all had at some moment. Some 
of us experienced it first as a condemnation, later transformed 
into consciousness and action. The search for the present is neither 
the pursuit of an earthly paradise nor that of a timeless eternity: 
it is the search for a real reality. For us, as Spanish Americans, 
the real present was not in our own countries: it was the time lived 
by others, by the English, the French and the Germans. It was the 
time of New York, Paris, London. We had to go and look for it and 
bring it back home. These years were also the years of my discovery 
of literature. I began writing poems. I did not know what made me 
write them: I was moved by an inner need that is difficult to define. 
Only now have I understood that there was a secret relationship 
between what I have called my expulsion from the present and the 
writing of poetry. Poetry is in love with the instant and seeks 
to relive it in the poem, thus separating it from sequential time 
and turning it into a fixed present. But at that time I wrote without 
wondering why I was doing it. I was searching for the gateway to 
the present: I wanted to belong to my time and to my century. A 
little later this obsession became a fixed idea: I wanted to be 
a modern poet. My search for modernity had begun.<br>
<br>
What is modernity? First of all it is an ambiguous term: there are 
as many types of modernity as there are societies. Each has its 
own. The word's meaning is uncertain and arbitrary, like the name 
of the period that precedes it, the Middle Ages. If we are modern 
when compared to medieval times, are we perhaps the Middle Ages 
of a future modernity? Is a name that changes with time a real name? 
Modernity is a word in search of its meaning. Is it an idea, a mirage 
or a moment of history? Are we the children of modernity or its 
creators? Nobody knows for sure. It doesn't matter much: we follow 
it, we pursue it. For me at that time modernity was fused with the 
present or rather produced it: the present was its last supreme 
flower. My case is neither unique nor exceptional: from the Symbolist 
period, all modern poets have chased after that magnetic and elusive 
figure that fascinates them. Baudelaire was the first. He was also 
the first to touch her and discover that she is nothing but time 
that crumbles in one's hands. I am not going to relate my adventures 
in pursuit of modernity: they are not very different from those 
of other 20th-Century poets. Modernity has been a universal passion. 
Since 1850 she has been our goddess and our demoness. In recent 
years, there has been an attempt to exorcise her and there has been 
much talk of "postmodernism". But what is postmodernism if not an 
even more modern modernity?<br>
<br>
For us, as Latin Americans, the search for poetic modernity runs 
historically parallel to the repeated attempts to modernize our 
countries. This tendency begins at the end of the 18th Century and 
includes Spain herself. The United States was born into modernity 
and by 1830 was already, as de Tocqueville observed, the womb of 
the future; we were born at a moment when Spain and Portugal were 
moving away from modernity. This is why there was frequent talk 
of "Europeanizing" our countries: the modern was outside and had 
to be imported. In Mexican history this process begins just before 
the War of Independence. Later it became a great ideological and 
political debate that passionately divided Mexican society during 
the 19th Century. One event was to call into question not the legitimacy 
of the reform movement but the way in which it had been implemented: 
the Mexican Revolution. Unlike its 20th-Century counterparts, the 
Mexican Revolution was not really the expression of a vaguely utopian 
ideology but rather the explosion of a reality that had been historically 
and psychologically repressed. It was not the work of a group of 
ideologists intent on introducing principles derived from a political 
theory; it was a popular uprising that unmasked what was hidden. 
For this very reason it was more of a revelation than a revolution. 
Mexico was searching for the present outside only to find it within, 
buried but alive. The search for modernity led us to discover our 
antiquity, the hidden face of the nation. I am not sure whether 
this unexpected historical lesson has been learnt by all: between 
tradition and modernity there is a bridge. When they are mutually 
isolated, tradition stagnates and modernity vaporizes; when in conjunction, 
modernity breathes life into tradition, while the latter replies 
with depth and gravity.<br>
<br>
The search for poetic modernity was a Quest, in the allegorical 
and chivalric sense this word had in the 12th Century. I did not 
find any Grail although I did cross several <i>waste lands</i> visiting 
castles of mirrors and camping among ghostly tribes. But I did discover 
the modern tradition. For modernity is not a poetic school but a 
lineage, a family dispersed over several continents and which for 
two centuries has survived many sudden changes and misfortunes: 
public indifference, isolation, and tribunals in the name of religious, 
political, academic and sexual orthodoxy. Because it is a tradition 
and not a doctrine, it has been able to persist and to change at 
the same time. This is also why it is so diverse: each poetic adventure 
is distinct and each poet has sown a different plant in the miraculous 
forest of speaking trees. Yet if the works are diverse and each 
route is distinct, what is it that unites all these poets? Not an 
aesthetic but a search. My search was not fanciful, even though 
the idea of modernity is a mirage, a bundle of reflections. One 
day I discovered I was going back to the starting point instead 
of advancing: the search for modernity was a descent to the origins. 
Modernity led me to the source of my beginning, to my antiquity. 
Separation had now become reconciliation. I thus found out that 
the poet is a pulse in the rhythmic flow of generations.</p>
            <p align="center">*</p>
            
  <p>The idea of modernity is a by-product of our conception of
  history as a unique and linear process of succession. Although
  its origins are in Judaeo-Christianity, it breaks with Christian
  doctrine. In Christianity, the cyclical time of pagan cultures is
  supplanted by unrepeatable history, something that has a
  beginning and will have an end. Sequential time was the profane
  time of history, an arena for the actions of fallen men, yet
  still governed by a sacred time which had neither beginning nor
  end. After Judgement Day there will be no future either in heaven
  or in hell. In the realm of eternity there is no succession
  because everything is. Being triumphs over becoming. The now
  time, our concept of time, is linear like that of Christianity
  but open to infinity with no reference to Eternity. Ours is the
  time of profane history, an irreversible and perpetually
  unfinished time that marches towards the future and not towards
  its end. History's sun is the future and Progress is the name of
  this movement towards the future.<br>
  <br>
  Christians see the world, or what used to be called the
  <i>si&egrave;cle</i> or worldly life, as a place of trial: souls
  can be either lost or saved in this world. In the new conception
  the historical subject is not the individual soul but the human
  race, sometimes viewed as a whole and sometimes through a chosen
  group that represents it: the developed nations of the West, the
  proletariat, the white race, or some other entity. The pagan and
  Christian philosophical tradition had exalted Being as changeless
  perfection overflowing with plenitude; we adore Change, the motor
  of progress and the model for our societies. Change articulates
  itself in two privileged ways: as evolution and as revolution.
  The trot and the leap. Modernity is the spearhead of historical
  movement, the incarnation of evolution or revolution, the two
  faces of progress. Finally, progress takes place thanks to the
  dual action of science and technology, applied to the realm of
  nature and to the use of her immense resources.<br>
  <br>
  Modern man has defined himself as a historical being. Other
  societies chose to define themselves in terms of values and ideas
  different from change: the Greeks venerated the <i>polis</i> and
  the circle yet were unaware of progress; like all the Stoics,
  Seneca was much concerned about the eternal return; Saint
  Augustine believed that the end of the world was imminent; Saint
  Thomas constructed a scale of the degrees of being, linking the
  smallest creature to the Creator, and so on. One after the other
  these ideas and beliefs were abandoned. It seems to me that the
  same decline is beginning to affect our idea of Progress and, as
  a result, our vision of time, of history and of ourselves. We are
  witnessing the twilight of the future. The decline of the idea of
  modernity and the popularity of a notion as dubious as that of
  "postmodernism" are phenomena that affect not only literature and
  the arts: we are experiencing the crisis of the essential ideas
  and beliefs that have guided mankind for over two centuries. I
  have dealt with this matter at length elsewhere. Here I can only
  offer a brief summary.<br>
  <br>
  In the first place, the concept of a process open to infinity and
  synonymous with endless progress has been called into question. I
  need hardly mention what everybody knows: natural resources are
  finite and will run out one day. In addition, we have inflicted
  what may be irreparable damage on the natural environment and our
  own species is endangered. Finally, science and technology, the
  instruments of progress, have shown with alarming clarity that
  they can easily become destructive forces. The existence of
  nuclear weapons is a refutation of the idea that progress is
  inherent in history. This refutation, I add, can only be called
  devastating.<br>
  <br>
  In the second place, we have the fate of the historical subject,
  mankind, in the 20th Century. Seldom have nations or individuals
  suffered so much: two world wars, tyrannies spread over five
  continents, the atomic bomb and the proliferation of one of the
  cruellest and most lethal institutions known by man: the
  concentration camp. Modern technology has provided countless
  benefits, but it is impossible to close our eyes when confronted
  by slaughter, torture, humiliation, degradation, and other wrongs
  inflicted on millions of innocent people in our century.<br>
  <br>
  In the third place, the belief in the necessity of progress has
  been shaken. For our grandparents and our parents, the ruins of
  history (corpses, desolate battlefields, devastated cities) did
  not invalidate the underlying goodness of the historical process.
  The scaffolds and tyrannies, the conflicts and savage civil wars
  were the price to be paid for progress, the blood money to be
  offered to the god of history. A god? Yes, reason itself deified
  and prodigal in cruel acts of cunning, according to Hegel. The
  alleged rationality of history has vanished. In the very domain
  of order, regularity and coherence (in pure sciences like
  physics) the old notions of accident and catastrophe have
  reappeared. This disturbing resurrection reminds me of the
  terrors that marked the advent of the millennium, and the anguish
  of the Aztecs at the end of each cosmic cycle.<br>
  <br>
  The last element in this hasty enumeration is the collapse of all
  the philosophical and historical hypotheses that claimed to
  reveal the laws governing the course of history. The believers,
  confident that they held the keys to history, erected powerful
  states over pyramids of corpses. These arrogant constructions,
  destined in theory to liberate men, were very quickly transformed
  into gigantic prisons. Today we have seen them fall, overthrown
  not by their ideological enemies but by the impatience and the
  desire for freedom of the new generations. Is this the end of all
  Utopias? It is rather the end of the idea of history as a
  phenomenon, the outcome of which can be known in advance.
  Historical determinism has been a costly and bloodstained
  fantasy. History is unpredictable because its agent, mankind, is
  the personification of indeterminism.<br>
  <br>
  This short review shows that we are very probably at the end of a
  historical period and at the beginning of another. The end of the
  Modern Age or just a mutation? It is difficult to tell. In any
  case, the collapse of Utopian schemes has left a great void, not
  in the countries where this ideology has proved to have failed
  but in those where many embraced it with enthusiasm and hope. For
  the first time in history mankind lives in a sort of spiritual
  wilderness and not, as before, in the shadow of those religious
  and political systems that consoled us at the same time as they
  oppressed us. Although all societies are historical, each one has
  lived under the guidance and inspiration of a set of
  metahistorical beliefs and ideas. Ours is the first age that is
  ready to live without a metahistorical doctrine; whether they be
  religious or philosophical, moral or aesthetic, our absolutes are
  not collective but private. It is a dangerous experience. It is
  also impossible to know whether the tensions and conflicts
  unleashed in this privatization of ideas, practices and beliefs
  that belonged traditionally to the public domain will not end up
  by destroying the social fabric. Men could then become possessed
  once more by ancient religious fury or by fanatical nationalism.
  It would be terrible if the fall of the abstract idol of ideology
  were to foreshadow the resurrection of the buried passions of
  tribes, sects and churches. The signs, unfortunately, are
  disturbing.<br>
  <br>
  The decline of the ideologies I have called metahistorical, by
  which I mean those that assign to history a goal and a direction,
  implies first the tacit abandonment of global solutions. With
  good sense, we tend more and more towards limited remedies to
  solve concrete problems. It is prudent to abstain from
  legislating about the future. Yet the present requires much more
  than attention to its immediate needs: it demands a more rigorous
  global reflection. For a long time I have firmly believed that
  the twilight of the future heralds the advent of the now. To
  think about the now implies first of all to recover the critical
  vision. For example, the triumph of the market economy (a triumph
  due to the adversary's default) cannot be simply a cause for joy.
  As a mechanism the market is efficient, but like all mechanisms
  it lacks both conscience and compassion. We must find a way of
  integrating it into society so that it expresses the social
  contract and becomes an instrument of justice and fairness. The
  advanced democratic societies have reached an enviable level of
  prosperity; at the same time they are islands of abundance in the
  ocean of universal misery. The topic of the market is intricately
  related to the deterioration of the environment. Pollution
  affects not only the air, the rivers and the forests but also our
  souls. A society possessed by the frantic need to produce more in
  order to consume more tends to reduce ideas, feelings, art, love,
  friendship and people themselves to consumer products. Everything
  becomes a thing to be bought, used and then thrown in the rubbish
  dump. No other society has produced so much waste as ours has.
  Material and moral waste.<br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the now does not imply relinquishing the future or
  forgetting the past: the present is the meeting place for the
  three directions of time. Neither can it be confused with facile
  hedonism. The tree of pleasure does not grow in the past or in
  the future but at this very moment. Yet death is also a fruit of
  the present. It cannot be rejected, for it is part of life.
  Living well implies dying well. We have to learn how to look
  death in the face. The present is alternatively luminous and
  sombre, like a sphere that unites the two halves of action and
  contemplation. Thus, just as we have had philosophies of the past
  and of the future, of eternity and of the void, tomorrow we shall
  have a philosophy of the present. The poetic experience could be
  one of its foundations. What do we know about the present?
  Nothing or almost nothing. Yet the poets do know one thing: the
  present is the source of presences.<br>
  <br>
In this pilgrimage in search of modernity I lost my way at many 
points only to find myself again. I returned to the source and discovered 
that modernity is not outside but within us. It is today and the 
most ancient antiquity; it is tomorrow and the beginning of the 
world; it is a thousand years old and yet newborn. It speaks in 
Nahuatl, draws Chinese ideograms from the 9th century, and appears 
on the television screen. This intact present, recently unearthed, 
shakes off the dust of centuries, smiles and suddenly starts to 
fly, disappearing through the window. A simultaneous plurality of 
time and presence: modernity breaks with the immediate past only 
to recover an age-old past and transform a tiny fertility figure 
from the neolithic into our contemporary. We pursue modernity in 
her incessant metamorphoses yet we never manage to trap her. She 
always escapes: each encounter ends in flight. We embrace her and 
she disappears immediately: it was just a little air. It is the 
instant, that bird that is everywhere and nowhere. We want to trap 
it alive but it flaps its wings and vanishes in the form of a handful 
of syllables. We are left empty-handed. Then the doors of perception 
open slightly and the other time appears, the real one we were searching 
for without knowing it: the present, the presence.</p>
