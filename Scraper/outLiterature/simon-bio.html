  <h1>Claude Simon - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="simon.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Claude Simon</b> was born in 1913 at
  Tananarive (Madagascar). His parents were French, his father
  being a career officer who was killed in the first World War. He
  grew up with his mother and her family in Perpignan in the middle
  of the wine district of Roussillon. Among his ancestors was a
  general from the time of the French Revolution.</p>

  <p>After secondary school at Coll&egrave;ge
  Stanislas in Paris and brief sojourns at Oxford and Cambridge he
  took courses in painting at the Andr&eacute; Lhote Academy. He then
  travelled extensively through Spain, Germany, the Soviet Union,
  Italy and Greece. This experience as well as those from the
  Second World War show up in his literary work. At the beginning
  of the war Claude Simon took part in the battle of the Meuse
  (1940) and was taken prisoner. He managed to escape and joined
  the resistance movement. At the same time he completed his first
  novel, Le Tricheur ("The Cheat", published in 1946), which he had
  started to write before the war.</p>

  <p>He lives in Paris and spends part of the
  year at Salses in the Pyrenees.</p>

  <p>In 1961 Claude Simon received the prize of
  l'Express for "La Route des Flandres" and in 1967 the
  M&eacute;dicis prize for "Histoire". The University of East Anglia
  made him honorary doctor in 1973.</p>
