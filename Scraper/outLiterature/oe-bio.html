  <h1>Kenzaburo Oe - Biographical</h1>
 
  
<p><img src="oe.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Kenzaburo Oe</b> was born in 1935, in a
  village hemmed in by the forests of Shikoku, one of the four main
  islands of Japan. His family had lived in the village tradition
  for several hundred years, and no one in the Oe clan had ever
  left the village in the valley. Even after Japan embarked on
  modernization soon after the Meiji Restoration, and it became
  customary for young people in the provinces to leave their native
  place for Tokyo or the other large cities, the Oes remained in
  Ose-mura. Maps no longer show the small hamlet by name because it
  was annexed by a neighbouring town. The women of the Oe clan had
  long assumed the role of storytellers and had related the
  historical events of the region, including the two uprisings that
  occurred there before and after the Meiji Restoration. They also
  told of events closer in nature to legend than to history. These
  stories, of a unique cosmology and of the human condition
  therein, which Oe heard told since his infancy, left him with an
  indelible mark.<br>
  <br>
  The Second World War broke out when Oe was six. Militaristic
  education extended to every nook and cranny of the country, the
  Emperor as both monarch and deity reigning over its politics and
  its culture. Young Oe, therefore, experienced the nation's myth
  and history as well as those of the village tradition, and these
  dual experiences were often in conflict. Oe's grandmother was a
  critical storyteller who defended the culture of the village,
  narrating to him humourously, but ever defiantly, anti-national
  stories. After his father's death during the war, his mother took
  over his father's role as educator. The books she bought him -
  <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>The Strange
  Adventures of Nils Holgersson</i> - have left him with an
  impression he says 'he will carry to the grave'.</p>
  
    
 <br>
  <p>Japan's defeat in the war in 1945 brought enormous change, even
  to the remote forest village. In schools, children were taught
  democratic principles, replacing those of the absolutist Emperor
  system, and this education was all the more thorough, for the
  nation was then under the administration of American and other
  forces. Young Oe took democracy straight to his heart. So strong
  was his desire for democracy that he decided to leave for Tokyo;
  leave the village of his forefathers, the life they had lived and
  preserved, out of sheer belief that the city offered him an
  opportunity to knock on the door of democracy, the door that
  would lead him to a future of freedom on paths that stretched out
  to the world. Had it not been for the drastic change the nation
  underwent at this time, Oe, whose love of trees is one of his
  innate qualities, would have remained in his village as his
  forefathers had done, and tended to the forest as one of its
  guardians.<br>
  <br>
  At the age of eighteen, Oe made his first long train trip to
  Tokyo, and in the following year enrolled in the Department of
  French Literature at Tokyo University where he received
  instruction under the tutelage of Professor Kazuo Watanabe, a
  specialist on Francois Rabelais. Rabelais' image system of
  grotesque realism, to use Mikhail Bakhtin's terminology, provided
  him with a methodology to positively and thoroughly reassess the
  myths and history of his native village in the valley.<br>
  <br>
  Watanabe's thoughts on humanism, which he arrived at from his
  study of the French Renaissance, helped shape Oe's fundamental
  view of society and the human condition. An avid reader of
  contemporary French and American literature, Oe viewed the social
  condition of the metropolis in light of the works he read. Yet,
  he also endeavored to reorganize, under the light of Rabelais and
  humanism, his thoughts on what the women of the village had
  handed down to him, those stories that constituted his
  background. In this sense, he was again living another
  duality.<br>
  <br>
  Oe started writing in 1957, while still a French literature
  student at the university. His works from 1957 through 1958 -
  from the short story, <i>The Catch</i>, which won him the
  Akutagawa Award, to his first novel, <i>Bud-Nipping</i>, <i>Lamb
  Shooting*</i> (1958) - depict the tragedy of war tearing asunder
  the idyllic life of a rural youth. In <i>Lavish are the Dead</i>
  (1957), a short story, and in <i>The Youth Who Came Late*</i>
  (1961), a novel, Oe portrayed student life in Tokyo, a city where
  the dark shadows of the U.S. occupation still remained. Apparent
  in these works are strong influences of Jean-Paul Sartre and
  other modern French writers.<br>
  <br>
  Crisis struck Oe's life and literature with the birth of his
  first son, Hikari. Hikari was born with a cranial deformity
  resulting in his becoming a mentally- handicapped person.
  Traumatic as the experience was for Oe, the crisis granted him a
  new lease on both his life and his literature. Overcoming the
  agony and determined to coexist with the child, Oe wrote <i>A
  Personal Matter</i> (1964), his penning of his pain in accepting
  the brain-damaged child into his life, and of how he arrived at
  his resolve to live with him. Through the catalytic medium of
  humanism, he conjoined his own fate of having to accept a
  handicapped child into the family with that of the stance one
  ought to take in contemporary society, and wrote <i>Hiroshima
  Notes</i> (1965), a long essay which describes the realities and
  thoughts of the A-bomb victims.<br>
  <br>
  Following this, Oe deepened his interest in Okinawa, the
  southernmost group of islands in Japan. Before the Meiji
  Restoration, Okinawa was an independent country with its own
  culture. During World War II, the islands became the site of the
  only battle Japan fought on its own soil. After the war, the
  people of Okinawa were left to suffer a long U.S. military
  occupation. Oe's interest in Okinawa was oriented, politically,
  toward the lives of the Okinawans living on what became a U.S.
  military base, and, culturally, to what Okinawa meant to him in
  terms of its traditions. The latter opened out to a broadened
  interest in the culture of South Koreans, enabling him to further
  appreciate the importance of Japan's peripheral cultures, which
  differed from Tokyo-centered culture. This pursuit provided
  realistic substance to his study of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory
  regarding a people's culture which led him to write <i>The Silent
  Cry</i> (1967), a work that ties in the myths and history of the
  forest village with the contemporary age.<br>
  <br>
  After <i>The Silent Cry</i>, two streams of thought, which at
  times flow as one, are apparent and consistent in Oe's literary
  world. Starting with <i>A Personal Matter</i> is one group of
  works that depicts his life of coexistence with his
  mentally-handicapped son, Hikari. <i>Teach Us to Outgrow our
  Madness</i> (1969), a two-volume work, painfully portrays both
  the agony-laden trials and errors he experiences in his life with
  his yet unspeaking infant child, and his pursuit of his father he
  lost during the war. <i>My Deluged Soul*</i> (1973) depicts a
  father who relates to his infant child who, through the medium of
  the songs of the wild birds, has started to communicate with the
  family, and who empathizes with youths that belong to a
  belligerent and radical political party. <i>Rouse Up, O, Young
  Men of the New Age!*</i> (1983), a work in which Oe draws upon
  images from William Blake's Prophecies, depicts his son Hikari's
  development from a child to a young man, and thus crowns the
  works he wrote about his handicapped child.<br>
  <br>
  The second group are stories in which Oe relates characters who
  he establishes in the theater of the myths and history of his
  native forest village, but who interact closely with life in
  today's cities. This world of Oe's fiction, starting with <i>Bud-
  Nipping, Lamb-Shooting</i> and followed by <i>The Silent Cry</i>,
  came to shape the core of his entire literature. Making full use
  of new ideas of cultural anthropology, these works represent the
  totality of Oe's world of fiction, as evidenced in <i>Letters to
  My Sweet Bygone Years</i> (1987), a work about a young man who,
  banking on his cosmology and world-view of Dante, strives but
  fails to establish a politico- cultural base in the forest.
  <i>Contemporary Games</i> is a story that alternates between myth
  and history, which Oe supports with the matriarch and trickster
  principles he draws from cultural anthropology. He rewrote this
  work in narrative form as <i>M/T and the Wonders of the
  Forest*</i> (1986). With the aid of <a href=
  "../1923/index.html">W.B. Yeat's</a> poetic metaphors, Oe
  embarked on writing <i>The Flaming Green Tree*</i>, a trilogy
  comprised of <i>Until the 'Savior' Gets Socked*</i> (1993),
  <i>Vacillating*</i> (1994), and <i>On The Great Day*</i> (1995).
  Oe has announced that with the completion of this trilogy, he
  will enter into his life's final stage of study, in which he will
  attempt a new form of literature. The implication of this project
  is that Oe deems his effort at presenting his cosmology, history
  and folk legend as having been brought to full circle, and that
  he has succeeded in creating, through his portrayal of that place
  in the valley and its people, a model for this contemporary age.
  It also implies that he considers Hikari's becoming a composer,
  in actuality, surpasses the importance of his own literature
  about him.<br>
  <br>
  Oe's winning the Nobel Prize for 1994 has thus encouraged him to
  embark on his pursuit of a new form of literature and a new life
  for himself.</p>
