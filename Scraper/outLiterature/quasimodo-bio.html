  <h1>Salvatore Quasimodo - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="quasimodo.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Salvatore Quasimodo</b> (1901-1968) was
  born of Sicilian parents in Modica, near Syracuse. Desiring to become an
  engineer, he attended technical schools in Palermo and later
  enrolled at the Politecnico in Rome. In addition, he studied
  Latin and Greek at the University there. However, for economic
  reasons he was unable to complete his studies. He obtained a
  position with the Italian government's civil engineering corps
  and was sent to various parts of Italy. In 1930 he had three
  poems published in the avant-garde review, Solaria, and later
  that same year appeared his first book of verse, <i>Acque e
  terre</i> (Waters and Lands). Two years later he published
  <i>&Ograve;boe sommerso</i> (Sunken Oboe), in which he proves a
  more mature poet. The "poetica della parole", the poetics of the
  word, which is, for Quasimodo, the fundamental and virtually
  limitless connotative unit, pervades his first book. While this
  concept still serves as the basis for <i>&Ograve;boe sommerso,</i>
  the main interest of this collection lies in the rhythmical
  arrangement of words around a lyrical nucleus. In both these and
  his later works Sicily is the constant, ever-present
  factor.<br>
  <br>
  Between 1930 and 1938, the year he left his government position,
  he made the acquaintance of many prominent Italian authors and
  painters. In 1938 he became editor of the weekly magazine,
  <i>Tempo</i>, and three years later was appointed to the chair of
  Italian Literature at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in
  Milan.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1930's Quasimodo was a leader of the "Hermetic" school
  of poetry; however, with the appearance of his translations
  <i>Lirici Greci</i> (Greek Lyrics), 1940, it was obvious that his
  direction was no longer entirely along the lines of that group.
  In <i>Nuove Poesie</i> (New Poems), 1942, Quasimodo reveals both
  the influence of classical stylistics and a greater understanding
  of life in general. His subsequent translations, which range from
  the Greek and Latin poets (Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Ovid,
  Vergil, etc.) to Shakespeare and Moli&egrave;re and
  twentieth-century writers (<a href=
  "../1971/index.html">Neruda</a>, e.e. cummings, Aiken, etc.),
  reflect his full appreciation of the original works as well as
  his modern taste and sensibility.<br>
  <br>
  During the Second World War Quasimodo experienced the need of the
  poet to feel one with the people and to declare himself as such
  in his poems. To him the role of the poet in society is a
  neccessarily active one; he should commit himself and his talents
  to contemporary struggles. Such views were first expressed in
  <i>Giorno dopogiorno</i> (Day after Day), 1946, and <i>La vita
  non &egrave; sogno</i> (Life Is Not a Dream), 1949.<br>
  <br>
  Quasimodo's later works show this change from individualism
  toward sociality, and moreover affirm the positive
  characteristics of life even in a world where death is an
  omnipresent fear. In <i>La terra impareggiabile</i> (The
  Incomparable Earth), 1958, Quasimodo has eloquently attempted to
  fuse life andliterature; he has developed a new language which
  coincides with man's new activities and ever-expanding
  investigations. Some of his poetry and two of his critical essays
  have appeared in English translation in <i>The SelectedWritings
  of Salvatore Quasimodo</i> (1960); his <i>Selected Poems</i> were
  published in 1965.<br>
  <br>
  The recipient of many literary prizes - in 1953, for instance,
  together with Dylan Thomas, he was awarded the Etna-Taormina
  International Prize in Poetry -, Quasimodo died in Naples on June
  I4, 1968.</p>
