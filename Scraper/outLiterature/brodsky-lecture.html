  <p><b>I</b><br>
  <br>
  For someone rather private, for someone who all his life has
  preferred his private condition to any role of social
  significance, and who went in this preference rather far - far
  from his motherland to say the least, for it is better to be a
  total failure in democracy than a martyr or the cr&egrave;me de la
  cr&egrave;me in tyranny - for such a person to find himself all of
  a sudden on this rostrum is a somewhat uncomfortable and trying
  experience.<br>
  <br>
  This sensation is aggravated not so much by the thought of those
  who stood here before me as by the memory of those who have been
  bypassed by this honor, who were not given this chance to address
  'urbi et orbi', as they say, from this rostrum and whose
  cumulative silence is sort of searching, to no avail, for release
  through this speaker.<br>
  <br>
  The only thing that can reconcile one to this sort of situation
  is the simple realization that - for stylistic reasons, in the
  first place - one writer cannot speak for another writer, one
  poet for another poet especially; that had Osip Mandelstam, or
  Marina Tsvetaeva, or Robert Frost, or Anna Akhmatova, or Wystan
  Auden stood here, they couldn't have helped but speak precisely
  for themselves, and that they, too, might have felt somewhat
  uncomfortable.<br>
  <br>
  These shades disturb me constantly; they are disturbing me today
  as well. In any case, they do not spur one to eloquence. In my
  better moments, I deem myself their sum total, though invariably
  inferior to any one of them individually. For it is not possible
  to better them on the page; nor is it possible to better them in
  actual life. And it is precisely their lives, no matter how
  tragic or bitter they were, that often move me - more often
  perhaps than the case should be - to regret the passage of time.
  If the next life exists - and I can no more deny them the
  possibility of eternal life than I can forget their existence in
  this one - if the next world does exist, they will, I hope,
  forgive me and the quality of what I am about to utter: after
  all, it is not one's conduct on the podium which dignity in our
  profession is measured by.<br>
  <br>
  I have mentioned only five of them, those whose deeds and whose
  lot matter so much to me, if only because if it were not for
  them, I, both as a man and a writer, would amount to much less;
  in any case, I wouldn't be standing here today. There were more
  of them, those shades - better still, sources of light: lamps?
  stars? - more, of course, than just five. And each one of them is
  capable of rendering me absolutely mute. The number of those is
  substantial in the life of any conscious man of letters; in my
  case, it doubles, thanks to the two cultures to which fate has
  willed me to belong. Matters are not made easier by thoughts
  about contemporaries and fellow writers in both cultures, poets,
  and fiction writers whose gifts I rank above my own, and who, had
  they found themselves on this rostrum, would have come to the
  point long ago, for surely they have more to tell the world than
  I do.<br>
  <br>
  I will allow myself, therefore, to make a number of remarks here
  - disjointed, perhaps stumbling, and perhaps even perplexing in
  their randomness. However, the amount of time allotted to me to
  collect my thoughts, as well as my very occupation, will, or may,
  I hope, shield me, at least partially, against charges of being
  chaotic. A man of my occupation seldom claims a systematic mode
  of thinking; at worst, he claims to have a system - but even
  that, in his case, is borrowing from a milieu, from a social
  order, or from the pursuit of philosophy at a tender age. Nothing
  convinces an artist more of the arbitrariness of the means to
  which he resorts to attain a goal - however permanent it may be -
  than the creative process itself, the process of composition.
  Verse really does, in Akhmatova's words, grow from rubbish; the
  roots of prose are no more honorable.<br>
  <br>
  <b>II</b><br>
  If art teaches anything (to the artist, in the first place), it
  is the privateness of the human condition. Being the most ancient
  as well as the most literal form of private enterprise, it
  fosters in a man, knowingly or unwittingly, a sense of his
  uniqueness, of individuality, of separateness - thus turning him
  from a social animal into an autonomous "I". Lots of things can
  be shared: a bed, a piece of bread, convictions, a mistress, but
  not a poem by, say, Rainer Maria Rilke. A work of art, of
  literature especially, and a poem in particular, addresses a man
  tete-a-tete, entering with him into direct - free of any
  go-betweens - relations.<br>
  <br>
  It is for this reason that art in general, literature especially,
  and poetry in particular, is not exactly favored by the champions
  of the common good, masters of the masses, heralds of historical
  necessity. For there, where art has stepped, where a poem has
  been read, they discover, in place of the anticipated consent and
  unanimity, indifference and polyphony; in place of the resolve to
  act, inattention and fastidiousness. In other words, into the
  little zeros with which the champions of the common good and the
  rulers of the masses tend to operate, art introduces a "period,
  period, comma, and a minus", transforming each zero into a tiny
  human, albeit not always pretty, face.<br>
  <br>
  The great Baratynsky, speaking of his Muse, characterized her as
  possessing an "uncommon visage". It's in acquiring this "uncommon
  visage" that the meaning of human existence seems to lie, since
  for this uncommonness we are, as it were, prepared genetically.
  Regardless of whether one is a writer or a reader, one's task
  consists first of all in mastering a life that is one's own, not
  imposed or prescribed from without, no matter how noble its
  appearance may be. For each of us is issued but one life, and we
  know full well how it all ends. It would be regrettable to
  squander this one chance on someone else's appearance, someone
  else's experience, on a tautology - regrettable all the more
  because the heralds of historical necessity, at whose urging a
  man may be prepared to agree to this tautology, will not go to
  the grave with him or give him so much as a thank-you.<br>
  <br>
  Language and, presumably, literature are things that are more
  ancient and inevitable, more durable than any form of social
  organization. The revulsion, irony, or indifference often
  expressed by literature towards the state is essentially a
  reaction of the permanent - better yet, the infinite - against
  the temporary, against the finite. To say the least, as long as
  the state permits itself to interfere with the affairs of
  literature, literature has the right to interfere with the
  affairs of the state. A political system, a form of social
  organization, as any system in general, is by definition a form
  of the past tense that aspires to impose itself upon the present
  (and often on the future as well); and a man whose profession is
  language is the last one who can afford to forget this. The real
  danger for a writer is not so much the possibility (and often the
  certainty) of persecution on the part of the state, as it is the
  possibility of finding oneself mesmerized by the state's
  features, which, whether monstrous or undergoing changes for the
  better, are always temporary.<br>
  <br>
  The philosophy of the state, its ethics - not to mention its
  aesthetics - are always "yesterday". Language and literature are
  always "today", and often - particularly in the case where a
  political system is orthodox - they may even constitute
  "tomorrow". One of literature's merits is precisely that it helps
  a person to make the time of his existence more specific, to
  distinguish himself from the crowd of his predecessors as well as
  his like numbers, to avoid tautology - that is, the fate
  otherwise known by the honorific term, "victim of history". What
  makes art in general, and literature in particular, remarkable,
  what distinguishes them from life, is precisely that they abhor
  repetition. In everyday life you can tell the same joke thrice
  and, thrice getting a laugh, become the life of the party. In
  art, though, this sort of conduct is called "clich&eacute;".<br>
  <br>
  Art is a recoilless weapon, and its development is determined not
  by the individuality of the artist, but by the dynamics and the
  logic of the material itself, by the previous fate of the means
  that each time demand (or suggest) a qualitatively new aesthetic
  solution. Possessing its own genealogy, dynamics, logic, and
  future, art is not synonymous with, but at best parallel to
  history; and the manner by which it exists is by continually
  creating a new aesthetic reality. That is why it is often found
  "ahead of progress", ahead of history, whose main instrument is -
  should we not, once more, improve upon Marx - precisely the
  clich&eacute;.<br>
  <br>
  Nowadays, there exists a rather widely held view, postulating
  that in his work a writer, in particular a poet, should make use
  of the language of the street, the language of the crowd. For all
  its democratic appearance, and its palpable advantages for a
  writer, this assertion is quite absurd and represents an attempt
  to subordinate art, in this case, literature, to history. It is
  only if we have resolved that it is time for Homo sapiens to come
  to a halt in his development that literature should speak the
  language of the people. Otherwise, it is the people who should
  speak the language of literature.<br>
  <br>
  On the whole, every new aesthetic reality makes man's ethical
  reality more precise. For aesthetics is the mother of ethics; The
  categories of "good" and "bad" are, first and foremost, aesthetic
  ones, at least etymologically preceding the categories of "good"
  and "evil". If in ethics not "all is permitted", it is precisely
  because not "all is permitted" in aesthetics, because the number
  of colors in the spectrum is limited. The tender babe who cries
  and rejects the stranger or who, on the contrary, reaches out to
  him, does so instinctively, making an aesthetic choice, not a
  moral one.<br>
  <br>
  Aesthetic choice is a highly individual matter, and aesthetic
  experience is always a private one. Every new aesthetic reality
  makes one's experience even more private; and this kind of
  privacy, assuming at times the guise of literary (or some other)
  taste, can in itself turn out to be, if not as guarantee, then a
  form of defense against enslavement. For a man with taste,
  particularly literary taste, is less susceptible to the refrains
  and the rhythmical incantations peculiar to any version of
  political demagogy. The point is not so much that virtue does not
  constitute a guarantee for producing a masterpiece, as that evil,
  especially political evil, is always a bad stylist. The more
  substantial an individual's aesthetic experience is, the sounder
  his taste, the sharper his moral focus, the freer - though not
  necessarily the happier - he is.<br>
  <br>
  It is precisely in this applied, rather than Platonic, sense that
  we should understand Dostoevsky's remark that beauty will save
  the world, or Matthew Arnold's belief that we shall be saved by
  poetry. It is probably too late for the world, but for the
  individual man there always remains a chance. An aesthetic
  instinct develops in man rather rapidly, for, even without fully
  realizing who he is and what he actually requires, a person
  instinctively knows what he doesn't like and what doesn't suit
  him. In an anthropological respect, let me reiterate, a human
  being is an aesthetic creature before he is an ethical one.
  Therefore, it is not that art, particularly literature, is a
  by-product of our species' development, but just the reverse. If
  what distinguishes us from other members of the animal kingdom is
  speech, then literature - and poetry in particular, being the
  highest form of locution - is, to put it bluntly, the goal of our
  species.<br>
  <br>
  I am far from suggesting the idea of compulsory training in verse
  composition; nevertheless, the subdivision of society into
  intelligentsia and "all the rest" seems to me unacceptable. In
  moral terms, this situation is comparable to the subdivision of
  society into the poor and the rich; but if it is still possible
  to find some purely physical or material grounds for the
  existence of social inequality, for intellectual inequality these
  are inconceivable. Equality in this respect, unlike in anything
  else, has been guaranteed to us by nature. I am speaking not of
  education, but of the education in speech, the slightest
  imprecision in which may trigger the intrusion of false choice
  into one's life. The existence of literature prefigures existence
  on literature's plane of regard - and not only in the moral
  sense, but lexically as well. If a piece of music still allows a
  person the possibility of choosing between the passive role of
  listener and the active one of performer, a work of literature -
  of the art which is, to use Montale's phrase, hopelessly semantic
  - dooms him to the role of performer only.<br>
  <br>
  In this role, it would seem to me, a person should appear more
  often than in any other. Moreover, it seems to me that, as a
  result of the population explosion and the attendant,
  ever-increasing atomization of society (i.e., the ever-increasing
  isolation of the individual), this role becomes more and more
  inevitable for a person. I don't suppose that I know more about
  life than anyone of my age, but it seems to me that, in the
  capacity of an interlocutor, a book is more reliable than a
  friend or a beloved. A novel or a poem is not a monologue, but
  the conversation of a writer with a reader, a conversation, I
  repeat, that is very private, excluding all others - if you will,
  mutually misanthropic. And in the moment of this conversation a
  writer is equal to a reader, as well as the other way around,
  regardless of whether the writer is a great one or not. This
  equality is the equality of consciousness. It remains with a
  person for the rest of his life in the form of memory, foggy or
  distinct; and, sooner or later, appropriately or not, it
  conditions a person's conduct. It's precisely this that I have in
  mind in speaking of the role of the performer, all the more
  natural for one because a novel or a poem is the product of
  mutual loneliness - of a writer or a reader.<br>
  <br>
  In the history of our species, in the history of Homo sapiens,
  the book is anthropological development, similar essentially to
  the invention of the wheel. Having emerged in order to give us
  some idea not so much of our origins as of what that sapiens is
  capable of, a book constitutes a means of transportation through
  the space of experience, at the speed of a turning page. This
  movement, like every movement, becomes a flight from the common
  denominator, from an attempt to elevate this denominator's line,
  previously never reaching higher than the groin, to our heart, to
  our consciousness, to our imagination. This flight is the flight
  in the direction of "uncommon visage", in the direction of the
  numerator, in the direction of autonomy, in the direction of
  privacy. Regardless of whose image we are created in, there are
  already five billion of us, and for a human being there is no
  other future save that outlined by art. Otherwise, what lies
  ahead is the past - the political one, first of all, with all its
  mass police entertainments.<br>
  <br>
  In any event, the condition of society in which art in general,
  and literature in particular, are the property or prerogative of
  a minority appears to me unhealthy and dangerous. I am not
  appealing for the replacement of the state with a library,
  although this thought has visited me frequently; but there is no
  doubt in my mind that, had we been choosing our leaders on the
  basis of their reading experience and not their political
  programs, there would be much less grief on earth. It seems to me
  that a potential master of our fates should be asked, first of
  all, not about how he imagines the course of his foreign policy,
  but about his attitude toward Stendhal, Dickens, Dostoevsky. If
  only because the lock and stock of literature is indeed human
  diversity and perversity, it turns out to be a reliable antidote
  for any attempt - whether familiar or yet to be invented - toward
  a total mass solution to the problems of human existence. As a
  form of moral insurance, at least, literature is much more
  dependable than a system of beliefs or a philosophical
  doctrine.<br>
  <br>
  Since there are no laws that can protect us from ourselves, no
  criminal code is capable of preventing a true crime against
  literature; though we can condemn the material suppression of
  literature - the persecution of writers, acts of censorship, the
  burning of books - we are powerless when it comes to its worst
  violation: that of not reading the books. For that crime, a
  person pays with his whole life; if the offender is a nation, it
  pays with its history. Living in the country I live in, I would
  be the first prepared to believe that there is a set dependency
  between a person's material well-being and his literary
  ignorance. What keeps me from doing so is the history of that
  country in which I was born and grew up. For, reduced to a
  cause-and-effect minimum, to a crude formula, the Russian tragedy
  is precisely the tragedy of a society in which literature turned
  out to be the prerogative of the minority: of the celebrated
  Russian intelligentsia.<br>
  <br>
  I have no wish to enlarge upon the subject, no wish to darken
  this evening with thoughts of the tens of millions of human lives
  destroyed by other millions, since what occurred in Russia in the
  first half of the Twentieth Century occurred before the
  introduction of automatic weapons - in the name of the triumph of
  a political doctrine whose unsoundness is already manifested in
  the fact that it requires human sacrifice for its realization.
  I'll just say that I believe - not empirically, alas, but only
  theoretically - that, for someone who has read a lot of Dickens,
  to shoot his like in the name of some idea is more problematic
  than for someone who has read no Dickens. And I am speaking
  precisely about reading Dickens, Sterne, Stendhal, Dostoevsky,
  Flaubert, Balzac, Melville, Proust, Musil, and so forth; that is,
  about literature, not literacy or education. A literate, educated
  person, to be sure, is fully capable, after reading this or that
  political treatise or tract, of killing his like, and even of
  experiencing, in so doing, a rapture of conviction. Lenin was
  literate, Stalin was literate, so was Hitler; as for Mao Zedong,
  he even wrote verse. What all these men had in common, though,
  was that their hit list was longer than their reading list.<br>
  <br>
  However, before I move on to poetry, I would like to add that it
  would make sense to regard the Russian experience as a warning,
  if for no other reason than that the social structure of the West
  up to now is, on the whole, analogous to what existed in Russia
  prior to 1917. (This, by the way, is what explains the popularity
  in the West of the Nineteenth-Century Russian psychological
  novel, and the relative lack of success of contemporary Russian
  prose. The social relations that emerged in Russia in the
  Twentieth Century presumably seem no less exotic to the reader
  than do the names of the characters, which prevent him from
  identifying with them.) For example, the number of political
  parties, on the eve of the October coup in 1917, was no fewer
  than what we find today in the United States or Britain. In other
  words, a dispassionate observer might remark that in a certain
  sense the Nineteenth Century is still going on in the West, while
  in Russia it came to an end; and if I say it ended in tragedy,
  this is, in the first place, because of the size of the human
  toll taken in course of that social - or chronological - change.
  For in a real tragedy, it is not the hero who perishes; it is the
  chorus.<br>
  <br>
  IlI<br>
  Although for a man whose mother tongue is Russian to speak about
  political evil is as natural as digestion, I would here like to
  change the subject. What's wrong with discourses about the
  obvious is that they corrupt consciousness with their easiness,
  with the quickness with which they provide one with moral
  comfort, with the sensation of being right. Herein lies their
  temptation, similar in its nature to the temptation of a social
  reformer who begets this evil. The realization, or rather the
  comprehension, of this temptation, and rejection of it, are
  perhaps responsible to a certain extent for the destinies of many
  of my contemporaries, responsible for the literature that emerged
  from under their pens. It, that literature, was neither a flight
  from history nor a muffling of memory, as it may seem from the
  outside. "How can one write music after Auschwitz?" inquired
  Adorno; and one familiar with Russian history can repeat the same
  question by merely changing the name of the camp - and repeat it
  perhaps with even greater justification, since the number of
  people who perished in Stalin's camps far surpasses the number of
  German prisoncamp victims. "And how can you eat lunch?" the
  American poet Mark Strand once retorted. In any case, the
  generation to which I belong has proven capable of writing that
  music.<br>
  <br>
  That generation - the generation born precisely at the time when
  the Auschwitz crematoria were working full blast, when Stalin was
  at the zenith of his Godlike, absolute power, which seemed
  sponsored by Mother Nature herself - that generation came into
  the world, it appears, in order to continue what, theoretically,
  was supposed to be interrupted in those crematoria and in the
  anonymous common graves of Stalin's archipelago. The fact that
  not everything got interrupted, at least not in Russia, can be
  credited in no small degree to my generation, and I am no less
  proud of belonging to it than I am of standing here today. And
  the fact that I am standing here is a recognition of the services
  that generation has rendered to culture; recalling a phrase from
  Mandelstam, I would add, to world culture. Looking back, I can
  say again that we were beginning in an empty - indeed, a
  terrifyingly wasted - place, and that, intuitively rather than
  consciously, we aspired precisely to the recreation of the effect
  of culture's continuity, to the reconstruction of its forms and
  tropes, toward filling its few surviving, and often totally
  compromised, forms, with our own new, or appearing to us as new,
  contemporary content.<br>
  <br>
  There existed, presumably, another path: the path of further
  deformation, the poetics of ruins and debris, of minimalism, of
  choked breath. If we rejected it, it was not at all because we
  thought that it was the path of self-dramatization, or because we
  were extremely animated by the idea of preserving the hereditary
  nobility of the forms of culture we knew, the forms that were
  equivalent, in our consciousness, to forms of human dignity. We
  rejected it because in reality the choice wasn't ours, but, in
  fact, culture's own - and this choice, again, was aesthetic
  rather than moral.<br>
  <br>
  To be sure, it is natural for a person to perceive himself not as
  an instrument of culture, but, on the contrary, as its creator
  and custodian. But if today I assert the opposite, it's not
  because toward the close of the Twentieth Century there is a
  certain charm in paraphrasing Plotinus, Lord Shaftesbury,
  Schelling, or Novalis, but because, unlike anyone else, a poet
  always knows that what in the vernacular is called the voice of
  the Muse is, in reality, the dictate of the language; that it's
  not that the language happens to be his instrument, but that he
  is language's means toward the continuation of its existence.
  Language, however, even if one imagines it as a certain animate
  creature (which would only be just), is not capable of ethical
  choice.<br>
  <br>
  A person sets out to write a poem for a variety of reasons: to
  win the heart of his beloved; to express his attitude toward the
  reality surrounding him, be it a landscape or a state; to capture
  his state of mind at a given instant; to leave - as he thinks at
  that moment - a trace on the earth. He resorts to this form - the
  poem - most likely for unconsciously mimetic reasons: the black
  vertical clot of words on the white sheet of paper presumably
  reminds him of his own situation in the world, of the balance
  between space and his body. But regardless of the reasons for
  which he takes up the pen, and regardless of the effect produced
  by what emerges from beneath that pen on his audience - however
  great or small it may be - the immediate consequence of this
  enterprise is the sensation of coming into direct contact with
  language or, more precisely, the sensation of immediately falling
  into dependence on it, on everything that has already been
  uttered, written, and accomplished in it.<br>
  <br>
  This dependence is absolute, despotic; but it unshackles as well.
  For, while always older than the writer, language still possesses
  the colossal centrifugal energy imparted to it by its temporal
  potential - that is, by all time Iying ahead. And this potential
  is determined not so much by the quantitative body of the nation
  that speaks it (though it is determined by that, too), as by the
  quality of the poem written in it. It will suffice to recall the
  authors of Greek or Roman antiquity; it will suffice to recall
  Dante. And that which is being created today in Russian or
  English, for example, secures the existence of these languages
  over the course of the next millennium also. The poet, I wish to
  repeat, is language's means for existence - or, as my beloved
  Auden said, he is the one by whom it lives. I who write these
  lines will cease to be; so will you who read them. But the
  language in which they are written and in which you read them
  will remain not merely because language is more lasting than man,
  but because it is more capable of mutation.<br>
  <br>
  One who writes a poem, however, writes it not because he courts
  fame with posterity, although often he hopes that a poem will
  outlive him, at least briefly. One who writes a poem writes it
  because the language prompts, or simply dictates, the next line.
  Beginning a poem, the poet as a rule doesn't know the way it's
  going to come out, and at times he is very surprised by the way
  it turns out, since often it turns out better than he expected,
  often his thought carries further than he reckoned. And that is
  the moment when the future of language invades its present.<br>
  <br>
  There are, as we know, three modes of cognition: analytical,
  intuitive, and the mode that was known to the Biblical prophets,
  revelation. What distinguishes poetry from other forms of
  literature is that it uses all three of them at once (gravitating
  primarily toward the second and the third). For all three of them
  are given in the language; and there are times when, by means of
  a single word, a single rhyme, the writer of a poem manages to
  find himself where no one has ever been before him, further,
  perhaps, than he himself would have wished for. The one who
  writes a poem writes it above all because verse writing is an
  extraordinary accelerator of conscience, of thinking, of
  comprehending the universe. Having experienced this acceleration
  once, one is no longer capable of abandoning the chance to repeat
  this experience; one falls into dependency on this process, the
  way others fall into dependency on drugs or on alcohol. One who
  finds himself in this sort of dependency on language is, I guess,
  what they call a poet.</p>
