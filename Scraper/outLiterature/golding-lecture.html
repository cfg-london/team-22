  <p><br>Those of you who have some knowledge of
  your present speaker as revealed by the loftier-minded section of
  the British Press will be resigning yourselves to a half hour of
  unrelieved gloom. Indeed, your first view of me, white bearded
  and ancient, may have turned that gloom into profound dark; dark,
  dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon, irrecoverably dark, total
  eclipse. But the case is not as hard as that. I am among the
  older of the Nobel Laureates and therefore might well be excused
  a touch of - let me whisper the word - frivolity. Pray do not
  misunderstand me. I have no dancing girls, alas. I shall not sing
  to you or juggle or clown - or shall I juggle? I wonder! How can
  a man who has been defined as a pessimist indulge in anything as
  frivolous as juggling?<br>
  <br>
  You see it is hard enough at any age to address so learned a
  gathering as this. The very thought induces a certain solemnity.
  Then again, what about the dignity of age? There is, they say, no
  fool like an old fool.<br>
  <br>
  Well, there is no fool like a middle-aged fool either.
  Twenty-five years ago I accepted the label 'pessimist'
  thoughtlessly without realising that it was going to be tied to
  my tail, as it were, in something the way that, to take an
  example from another art, Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C
  sharp minor was tied to him. No audience would allow him off the
  concert platform until he played it. Similarly critics have dug
  into my books until they could come up with something that looked
  hopeless. I can't think why. I don't feel hopeless myself. Indeed
  I tried to reverse the process by explaining myself. Under some
  critical interrogation I named myself a universal pessimist but a
  cosmic optimist. I should have thought that anyone with an ear
  for language would understand that I was allowing more
  connotation than denotation to the word 'cosmic' though in
  derivation universal and cosmic mean the same thing. I meant, of
  course, that when I consider a universe which the scientist
  constructs by a set of rules which stipulate that this construct
  must be repeatable and identical, then I am a pessimist and bow
  down before the great god Entropy. I am optimistic when I
  consider the spiritual dimension which the scientist's discipline
  forces him to ignore. So worldwide is the fame of the Nobel Prize
  that people have taken to quoting from my works and I do not see
  why I should not join in this fashionable pastime. Twenty years
  ago I tried to put the difference between the two kinds of
  experience in the mind of one of my characters, and made a mess
  of it. He was in prison.<br>
  <br>
  "All day long the trains run on rails. Eclipses are predictable.
  Penicillin cures pneumonia and the atom splits to order. All day
  long year in year out the daylight explanation drives back the
  mystery and reveals a reality usable, understandable and
  detached. The scalpel and the microscope fail. The oscilloscope
  moves closer to behaviour.<br>
  <br>
  "But then, all day long action is weighed in the balance and
  found not opportune nor fortunate nor ill-advised but good or
  evil. For this mode which we call the spirit breathes through the
  universe and does not touch it: touches only the dark things held
  prisoner, incommunicado, touches, judges, sentences and passes
  on. Both worlds are real. There is no bridge."<br>
  <br>
  What amuses me is the thought that of course there is a bridge
  and that if anything it has been thrust out from the side which
  least expected it, and thrust out since those words were written.
  For we know now, that the universe had a beginning. (Indeed, as
  an aside I might say we always did know. I offer you a simple
  proof and forbid you to examine it. If there was no beginning
  then infinite time has already passed and we could never have got
  to the moment where we are.) We also know or it is at least
  scientifically respectable to postulate that at the centre of a
  black hole the laws of nature no longer apply. Since most
  scientists are just a bit religious and most religious are seldom
  wholly unscientific we find humanity in a comical position. His
  scientific intellect believes in the possibility of miracles
  inside a black hole while his religious intellect believes in
  them outside it. Both, in fact, now believe in miracles, credimus
  quia absurdum est. Glory be to God in the highest. You will get
  no reductive pessimism from me.<br>
  <br>
  A greater danger facing you is that an ancient schoolmaster may
  be carried away and forget he is not addressing a class of
  pupils. A man in his seventies may be tempted to think he has
  seen it all and knows it all. He may think that mere length of
  years is a guarantee of wisdom and a permit for the issuing of
  admonition and advice. Poor young Shakespeare and Beethoven, he
  thinks, dead in their youth at a mere fifty-two or three! What
  could young fellows such as that know about anything? But at
  midnight perhaps, when the clock strikes and another year has
  passed he may occasionally brood on the disadvantages of age
  rather than the advantages. He may regard more thoughtfully a
  sentence which has been called the poetry of the fact, a sentence
  that one of those young fellows stumbled across accidentally, as
  it were, since he was never old enough to have worked the thing
  out through living. "Men," he wrote, "must endure their going
  hence, even as their coming hither." Such a consideration may
  modify the essential jollity of an old man's nature. Is the old
  man right to be happy? Is there not something unbecoming in his
  cheerful view of his own end? The words of another English poet
  seem to rebuke him.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quotelarge">King David and King Solomon<br>
    Led merry, merry lives,<br>
    With many, many lady friends<br>
    And many, many wives;<br>
    But when old age crept over them,<br>
    With many, many qualms,<br>
    King Solomon wrote the Proverbs<br>
    And King David wrote the Psalms.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Powerful stuff that, there's no doubt about
  it. But there are two views of the matter; and since I have
  quoted to you some of my prose which are generally regarded as
  poetic I will not quote to you some of my Goon or McGonagall
  poetry which may well be regarded as prosaic.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quotelarge">Sophocles the eminent Athenian<br>
    Gave as his final opinion<br>
    That death of love in the breast<br>
    Was like escape from a wild beast.<br>
    What better word could you get?<br>
    He was eighty when he said that.<br>
    But Ninon de L'Enclos<br>
    When asked the same question said, no<br>
    She was uncommonly matey<br>
    At eighty.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Evidently age need not wither us nor custom
  stale our infinite variety. Let us be, for a while, not serious
  but considerate. I myself face another danger. I do not speak in
  a small tribal language as it might be one of the six hundred
  languages of Nigeria. Of course the value of any language is
  incalculable. Your Laureate of 1979, the Greek poet <a href=
  "../1979/index.html">Elytis</a>, made quite clear that the
  relative value of works of literature is not to be decided by
  counting heads. It is, I think, the greatest tribute one can pay
  your committees that they have consistently sought for value in a
  work without heeding how many people can or cannot read it. The
  young John Keats spoke of Greek poets who "died content on
  pleasant sward, leaving great verse unto a little clan". Indeed
  and indeed, small can be beautiful. To quote yet another poet -
  prose writer though I am you will have begun to realise where my
  heart is - Ben Jonson said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quotelarge">"It is not growing like a tree<br>
    In bulk, doth make man better be,<br>
    Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,<br>
    To fall a log at last, dry, bald and sere:<br>
    A lily of a day,<br>
    Is fairer far in May,<br>
    Although it fall and die that night;<br>
    It was the plant and flower of light.<br>
    In small proportions we just beauties see,<br>
    And in short measures, life may perfect be."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>My own language, English, I believe to have
  a store of poets, of writers that need not fear comparison with
  those of any other language, ancient or modern. But today that
  language may suffer from too wide a use rather than too narrow a
  one - may be an oak rather than a lily. It spreads right round
  the world as the medium of advertisement, navigation, science,
  negotiation, conference. A hundred political parties have it
  daily in their mouths. Perhaps a language subjected to such
  strains as that may become, here and there, just a little thin.
  In English a man may think he is addressing a small,
  distinguished audience, or his family or his friends, perhaps; he
  is brooding aloud or talking in his sleep. Later he finds that
  without meaning to he has been addressing a large segment of the
  world. That is a daunting thought. It is true that this year,
  surrounded and outnumbered as I am by American laureates, I take
  a quiet pleasure in the consideration that though variants of my
  mother tongue may be spoken by a greater number of people than
  are to be found in an island off the West coast of Europe
  nevertheless they are speaking dialects of what is still
  centrally English. Personally I cannot tell whether those many
  dialects are being rendered mutually incomprehensible by distance
  faster than they are being unified by television and satellites;
  but at the moment the English writer faces immediate
  comprehension or partial comprehension by a good part of a
  billion people. His critics are limited in number only by the
  number of the people who can read his work. Nor can he escape
  from knowing the worst. No matter how obscure the publication
  that has disembowelled him, some kind correspondent - let us call
  him "X" - will send the article along together with an indignant
  assurance that he, "X", does not agree with a word of it. I think
  apprehensively of the mark I present, once A Moving Target but
  now, surely a fixed one, before the serried ranks of those who
  can shoot at me if they choose. Even my most famous and
  distinguished fellow laureate and fellow countryman, <a href=
  "../1953/index.html">Winston Churchill</a>, did not escape. A
  critic remarked with acid wit of his getting the award, "Was it
  for his poetry or his prose?" Indeed it was considerations such
  as these which have given me, I suppose, more difficulty in
  conceiving, let alone writing this lecture than any piece of
  comparable length since those distant days when I wrote set
  essays on set subjects at school. The only difference I can find
  is that today I write at a larger desk and the marks I shall get
  for my performance will be more widely reported.<br>
  <br>
  Now when, you may say, is the man going to say something about
  the subject which is alleged to be his own? He should be talking
  about the novel! Well, I will for a while, but only for a while,
  and as it were, tangentially. The truth is that though each of
  the subjects for which the prizes are awarded has its own and
  unique importance, none can exist wholly to itself. Even the
  novel, if it climbs into an ivory tower, will find no audience
  except those with ivory towers of their own. I used to think that
  the outlook for the novel was poor. Let me quote myself again. I
  speak of boys growing up - not exceptional boy, but average
  boy.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quotelarge">"Boys do not evaluate a book. They divide
    books into categories. There are sexy books, war books,
    westerns, travel books, science fiction. A boy will accept
    anything from a section he knows rather than risk another sort.
    He has to have the label on the bottle to know it is the
    mixture as before. You must put his detective story in a green
    paperback or he may suffer the hardship of reading a book in
    which nobody is murdered at all; - I am thinking of the
    plodders, the amiable majority of us, not particularly
    intelligent or gifted; well-disposed, but left high and dry
    among a mass of undigested facts with their scraps of saleable
    technology. What chance has literature of competing with the
    defined categories of entertainment which are laid on for them
    at every hour of the day? I do not see how literature is to be
    for them anything but simple, repetitive and a stop-gap for
    when there are no westerns on the telly. They will have a far
    less brutish life than their Nineteenth-Century ancestors, no
    doubt. They will believe less and fear less. But just as bad
    money drives out good, so inferior culture drives out superior.
    With any capacity to make value judgements vitiated or
    undeveloped, what mass future is there, then, for poetry, for
    belles-lettres, for real fearlessness in the theatre, for the
    novel which tries to look at life anew - in a word, for
    intransigence?"</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I wrote that some twenty years ago I
  believe and the process as far as the novel is concerned has
  developed but not improved. The categories are more and more
  defined. Competition from other media is fiercer still. Well,
  after all the novel has no build - it claims on
  immortality.<br>
  <br>
  "Story" of course is a different matter. We like to hear of
  succession of events and as an inspection of our press will
  demonstrate have only a marginal interest in whether the
  succession of events is minutely true or not. Like the late Mr.
  Sam Goldwyn who wanted a story which began with an earthquake and
  worked up to a climax, we like a good lead in but have most
  pleasure in a succession of events with a satisfactory end-point.
  Most simply and directly - when children holler and yell because
  of some infant tragedy or tedium, at once when we take them on
  our knee and begin shouting if necessary - "once upon a time"
  they fall silent and attentive. Story will always be with us. But
  story in a physical book, in a sentence what the West means by "a
  novel" - what of that? Certainly, if the form fails let it go. We
  have enough complications in life, in art, in literature without
  preserving dead forms fossilised, without cluttering ourselves
  with Byzantine sterilities. Yes, in that case, let the novel go.
  But what goes with it? Surely something of profound importance to
  the human spirit! A novel ensures that we can look before and
  after, take action at whatever pace we choose, read again and
  again, skip and go back. The story in a book is humble and
  serviceable, available, friendly, is not switched on and off but
  taken up and put down, lasts a lifetime.<br>
  <br>
  Put simply the novel stands between us and the hardening concept
  of statistical man. There is no other medium in which we can live
  for so long and so intimately with a character. That is the
  service a novel renders. It performs no less an act than the
  rescue and the preservation of the individuality and dignity of
  the single being, be it man, woman or child. No other art, I
  claim, can so thread in and out of a single mind and body, so
  live another life. It does ensure that at the very least a human
  being shall be seen to be more than just one billionth of one
  billion.<br>
  <br>
  I spoke of the ivory tower and the unique importance of each of
  our studies. Now I must add, having said my bit about the novel -
  that those studies converge, literature with the rest. Put
  bluntly, we face two problems - either we blow ourselves off the
  face of the earth or we degrade the fertility of the earth bit by
  bit until we have ruined it. Does it take a writer of fiction to
  bring you the cold comfort of pointing out that the problems are
  mutually exclusive? The one problem, the instant catastrophe, is
  not to be dealt with here. It would be irresponsible of me to
  turn this platform into a stage for acting out some antiatomic
  harangue and equally irresponsible at this juncture in history
  for me to ignore our perils. You know them as well as I do. As so
  often, when the unspeakable is to be spoken, the unthinkable
  thought, it is Shakespeare we must turn to; and I can only quote
  Hamlet with the skull:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="quotelarge">"Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite
    chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her, let
    her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her
    laugh at that."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I am being rather unfair to the lady,
  perhaps, for there will be skulls of all shapes and sizes and
  sexes. I speak tangentially. No other quotation gives the dirt of
  it all, another kind of poetry of the fact. I must say something
  of this danger and I have said it for I could do no less. Now as
  far as this matter is concerned, I have done.<br>
  <br>
  The other danger is more difficult to combat. To quote another
  laureate, our race may end not with a bang but a whimper. It must
  be nearer seventy years ago than sixty that I first discovered
  and engaged myself to a magic place. This was on the west coast
  of our country. It was on the seashore among rocks. I early
  became acquainted with the wonderful interplay of earth and moon
  and sun, enjoying them at the same time as I was assured that
  scientifically you could not have action influenced at a
  distance. There was a particular phase of the moon at which the
  tide sank more than usually far down and revealed to me a small
  recess which I remember as a cavern. There was plenty of life of
  one sort or another round all the rocks and in the pools among
  them. But this pool, farthest down and revealed, it seemed, by an
  influence from the sky only once or twice during the times when I
  had the holiday privilege of living near it - this last recess
  before the even more mysterious deep sea had strange inhabitants
  which I had found nowhere else. I can now remember and even feel
  but alas not describe the peculiar engagement, excitement and,
  no, not sympathy or empathy, but passionate recognition of a
  living thing in all its secrecy and strangeness. It was or rather
  they were real as I was. It was as if the centre of our universe
  was there for my eyes to reach at like hands, to seize on by
  sight. Only a hand's breadth away in the last few inches of still
  water they flowered, grey, green and purple, palpably alive, a
  discovery, a meeting, more than an interest or pleasure. They
  were life, we together were delight itself; until the first
  ripples of returning water blurred and hid them. When the summer
  holidays were over and I went back again about as far from the
  sea as you can get in England I carried with me like a private
  treasure the memory of that cave - no, in some strange way I took
  the cave with me and its creatures that flowered so strangely. In
  nights of sleeplessness and fear of the supernatural I would work
  out the phase of the moon, returning in thought to the slither
  and clamber among the weeds of the rocks. There were times when,
  though I was far away, I found myself before the cavern watching
  the moon-dazzle as the water sank and was comforted somehow by
  the magical beauty of our common world.<br>
  <br>
  I have been back, since. The recess - for now it seems no more
  than that - is still there, and at low water springs if you can
  bend down far enough you can still look inside. Nothing lives
  there any more. It is all very clean now, ironically so, clean
  sand, clean water, clean rock. Where the living creatures once
  clung they have worn two holes like the orbits of eyes, so that
  you might well sentimentalize yourself into the fancy that you
  are looking at a skull. No life.<br>
  <br>
  Was it a natural process? Was it fuel oil? Was it sewage or
  chemicals more deadly that killed my childhood's bit of magic and
  mystery? I cannot tell and it does not matter. What matters is
  that this is only one tiny example among millions of how we are
  impoverishing the only planet we have to live on.<br>
  <br>
  Well now, what has literature to say to that? We have computers
  and satellites, we have ingenuities of craft that can land a
  complex machine on a distant planet and get reports back. And so
  on. You know it all as well and better than I. Literature has
  words only, surely a tool as primitive as the flint axe or even
  the soft copper chisel with which man first carved his own
  likeness in stone. That tool makes a poor showing one would think
  among the products of the silicon chip. But remember Churchill.
  For despite the cynical critic, he got the Nobel Prize neither
  for poetry nor prose. He got it for about a single page of simple
  sentences which are neither poetry nor prose but for what, I
  repeat, has been called finely the poetry of the fact. He got it
  for those passionate utterances which were the very stuff of
  human courage and defiance. Those of us who lived through those
  times know that Churchill's poetry of the fact changed
  history.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps then the soft copper chisel is not so poor a tool after
  all. Words may, through the devotion, the skill, the passion, and
  the luck of writers prove to be the most powerful thing in the
  world. They may move men to speak to each other because some of
  those words somewhere express not just what the writer is
  thinking but what a huge segment of the world is thinking. They
  may allow man to speak to man, the man in the street to speak to
  his fellow until a ripple becomes a tide running through every
  nation - of commonsense, of simple healthy caution, a tide that
  rulers and negotiators cannot ignore so that nation does truly
  speak unto nation. Then there is hope that we may learn to be
  temperate, provident, taking no more from nature's treasury than
  is our due. It may be by books, stories, poetry, lectures we who
  have the ear of mankind can move man a little nearer the perilous
  safety of a warless and provident world. It cannot be done by the
  mechanical constructs of overt propaganda. I cannot do it myself,
  cannot now create stories which would help to make man aware of
  what he is doing; but there are others who can, many others.
  There always have been. We need more humanity, more care, more
  love. There are those who expect a political system to produce
  that; and others who expect the love to produce the system. My
  own faith is that the truth of the future lies between the two
  and we shall behave humanly and a bit humanely, stumbling along,
  haphazardly generous and gallant, foolishly and meanly wise until
  the rape of our planet is seen to be the preposterous folly that
  it is.<br>
  <br>
  For we are a marvel of creation. I think in particular of one of
  the most extraordinary women, dead now these five hundred years,
  Juliana of Norwich. She was caught up in the spirit and shown a
  thing that might lie in the palm of her hand and in the bigness
  of a nut. She was told it was the world. She was told of the
  strange and wonderful and awful things that would happen there.
  At the last, a voice told her that all things should be well and
  all manner of things should be well and all things should be very
  well.<br>
  <br>
  Now we, if not in the spirit, have been caught up to see our
  earth, our mother, Gaia Mater, set like a jewel in space. We have
  no excuse now for supposing her riches inexhaustible nor the area
  we have to live on limitless because unbounded. We are the
  children of that great blue white jewel. Through our mother we
  are part of the solar system and part through that of the whole
  universe. In the blazing poetry of the fact we are children of
  the stars.<br>
  <br>
  I had better come down, I think. Churchill, Juliana of Norwich,
  let alone Ben Jonson and Shakespeare - Lord, what company we
  keep! Reputations grow and dwindle and the brightest of laurels
  fade. That very practical man, Julius Caesar - whom I always
  think of for a reason you may guess at, as Field Marshal Lord
  Caesar - Julius Caesar is said to have worn a laurel wreath to
  conceal his baldness. While it may be proper to praise the idea
  of a laureate the man himself may very well remember what his
  laurels will hide and that not only baldness. In a sentence he
  must remember not to take himself with unbecoming seriousness.
  Fortunately some spirit or other - I do not presume to put a name
  to it - ensured that I should remember my smallness in the scheme
  of things. The very day after I learned that I was the laureate
  for literature for 1983 I drove into a country town and parked my
  car where I should not. I only left the car for a few minutes but
  when I came back there was a ticket taped to the window. A
  traffic warden, a lady of a minatory aspect, stood by the car.
  She pointed to a notice on the wall. "Can't you read?" she said.
  Sheepishly I got into my car and drove very slowly round the
  corner. There on the pavement I saw two county policemen.<br>
  <br>
  I stopped opposite them and took my parking ticket out of its
  plastic envelope. They crossed to me. I asked if, as I had
  pressing business, I could go straight to the Town Hall and pay
  my fine on the spot. "No, sir," said the senior policeman, "I'm
  afraid you can't do that." He smiled the fond smile that such
  policemen reserve for those people who are clearly harmless if a
  bit silly. He indicated a rectangle on the ticket that had the
  words 'name and address of sender' printed above it. "You should
  write your name and address in that place," he said. "You make
  out a cheque for ten pounds, making it payable to the Clerk to
  the Justices at <i>this</i> address written here. Then you write
  the same address on the outside of the envelope, stick a sixteen
  penny stamp in the top right hand corner of the envelope, then
  post it. And may we congratulate you on winning the Nobel Prize
  for Literature."</p>
