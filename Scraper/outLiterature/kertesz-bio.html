  <h1>Imre Kert&eacute;sz - Biographical</h1>
  

<p><img src="kertesz.jpg" class="bio-img">Imre Kert&eacute;sz
  was born in Budapest on November 9, 1929. Of Jewish descent, in
  1944 he was deported to Auschwitz and from there to Buchenwald,
  where he was liberated in 1945. On his return to Hungary he
  worked for a Budapest newspaper, <i>Vil&aacute;goss&aacute;g</i>, but
  was dismissed in 1951 when it adopted the Communist party line.
  After two years of military service he began supporting himself
  as an independent writer and translator of German-language
  authors such as Nietzsche, Hofmannsthal, Schnitzler, Freud, Roth,
  Wittgenstein, and <a href=
  "/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1981/index.html">Canetti</a>, who have all
  had a significant influence on his own writing.</p>

  <p>Kert&eacute;sz's first novel,
  <i>Sorstalans&aacute;g</i> (Eng. <i>Fateless</i>, 1992; see
  <i>WLT</i> 67:4, p. 863), a work based on his experiences in
  Auschwitz and Buchenwald, was published in 1975. "When I am
  thinking about a new novel, I always think of Auschwitz," he has
  said. This does not mean, however, that <i>Sorstalans&aacute;g</i>
  is autobiographical in any simple sense: Kert&eacute;sz says
  himself that he has used the form of the autobiographical novel
  but that it is not autobiography. Sorstalans&aacute;g was initially
  rejected for publication. When published eventually in 1975, it
  was received with compact silence. Kert&eacute;sz has written about
  this experience in <i>A kudarc</i> (1988; <i>Fiasco</i>). This
  novel is normally regarded as the second volume in a trilogy that
  begins with <i>Sorstalans&aacute;g</i> and concludes with <i>Kaddis
  a meg nem sz&uuml;letett gyermek&eacute;rt</i> (1990; Eng.
  <i>Kaddish for a Child Not Born</i>, 1997; see <i>WLT</i> 74:1,
  p. 205), in a title that refers to the Jewish prayer for the
  dead. In <i>Kaddis a meg nem sz&uuml;letett gyermek&eacute;rt</i>,
  the protagonist of <i>Sorstalans&aacute;g</i> and <i>A kudarc</i>,
  Gy&ouml;rgy K&ouml;ves, reappears. His Kaddish is said for the
  child he refuses to beget in a world that permitted the existence
  of Auschwitz. Other prose works are <i>A nyomkereső</i> (1977;
  <i>The pathfinder</i>) and <i>Az angol lobog&oacute;</i> (1991;
  <i>The English flag</i>; see <i>WLT</i> 67:2, p. 412).</p>

  <p><i>G&aacute;lyanapl&oacute;</i> (<i>Galley
  diary</i>; see WLT 67:2, p. 412), a diary in fictional form that
  covers the years 1961-91, was published in 1992. <i>Valaki
  m&aacute;s: A v&aacute;ltoz&aacute;s kr&oacute;nik&aacute;ja</i> (1997;
  <i>I - another: Chronicle of a metamorphosis</i>), continues this
  inner monologue in the form of notes made during the years
  1991-95. After the political upheavals of 1989, Kert&eacute;sz was
  able to make more public appearances. His lectures and essays
  have been collected in <i>A holocaust mint kult&uacute;ra</i>
  (1993; <i>The holocaust as culture</i>), <i>A gondolatnyi csend,
  am&iacute;g kivegzőoztag &uacute;jrat&ouml;lt</i> (1998; <i>Moments
  of silence while the execution squad reloads</i>), and <i>A
  sz&aacute;műz&ouml;tt nyelv</i> (2001; <i>The exiled
  language</i>).</p>

  <p>Imre Kert&eacute;sz was awarded the
  Brandenburger Literaturpreis in 1995, the Leipziger Buchpreis zur
  Europ&auml;ischen Verst&auml;ndigung in 1997, the Herder- Preis
  and the WELT-Literaturpreis in 2000, the Ehrenpreis der
  Robert-Bosch-Stiftung in 2001, and the Hans Sahl-Preis in 2002.
  His works have been translated into numerous languages, including
  German, Spanish, French, English, Czech, Russian, Swedish, and
  Hebrew.</p>
