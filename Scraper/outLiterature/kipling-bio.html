  <h1>Rudyard Kipling - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="kipling.jpg" class="bio-img"> <b>Rudyard Kipling</b> (1865-1936) was
  born in Bombay, but educated in England at the United Services
  College, Westward Ho, Bideford. In 1882 he returned to India,
  where he worked for Anglo-Indian newspapers. His literary career
  began with <i>Departmental Ditties</i> (1886), but subsequently
  he became chiefly known as a writer of short stories. A prolific
  writer, he achieved fame quickly. Kipling was the poet of the
  British Empire and its yeoman, the common soldier, whom he
  glorified in many of his works, in particular <i>Plain Tales from
  the Hills</i> (1888) and <i>Soldiers Three</i> (1888),
  collections of short stories with roughly and affectionately
  drawn soldier portraits. His <i>Barrack Room Ballads</i> (1892)
  were written for, as much as about, the common soldier. In 1894
  appeared his <i>Jungle Book</i>, which became a children's
  classic all over the world. <i>Kim</i> (1901), the story of
  Kimball O'Hara and his adventures in the Himalayas, is perhaps
  his most felicitous work. Other works include <i>The Second
  Jungle Book</i> (1895), <i>The Seven Seas</i> (1896), <i>Captains
  Courageous</i> (1897), <i>The Day's Work</i> (1898), <i>Stalky
  and Co.</i> (1899), <i>Just So Stories</i> (1902), <i>Trafficks
  and Discoveries</i> (1904), <i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i> (1906),
  A<i>ctions and Reactions</i> (1909), <i>Debits and Credits</i>
  (1926), <i>Thy Servant a Dog</i> (1930), and <i>Limits and
  Renewals</i> (1932). During the First World War Kipling wrote
  some propaganda books. His collected poems appeared in
  1933.<br>

  Kipling was the recipient of many honorary degrees and other
  awards. In 1926 he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Society
  of Literature, which only Scott, Meredith, and Hardy had been
  awarded before him.</p>
