  <h1>P&auml;r Lagerkvist - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="lagerkvist.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>P&auml;r Lagerkvist</b> (1891-1974), son
  of station master Anders Johan Lagerkvist and Johanna Blad, was
  born in the south of Sweden. He decided early that he was going
  to be a writer and, after a year at the University of
  Uppsala, he left for Paris (1913), where he came under the
  influence of expressionism, especially in painting. His
  impressions resulted in the programmatic <i>Ordkonst och
  bildkonst</i> (1913) [Verbal Art and Pictorial Art]. Until 1930
  Lagerkvist lived chiefly in France and Italy, and even after his
  permanent return to Sweden he frequently travelled on the
  Continent and in the Mediterranean.<br>
  <br>
  Lagerkvist has given an account of his early years in the
  autobiographical volumes <i>G&auml;st hos verkligheten</i> (1925)
  [<i>Guest of Reality</i>] and <i>Det besegrade livet</i> (1927)
  [The Conquered Life]. His poetry moves from the anxiety and
  despair of the war years, as in <i>&Aring;ngest</i> (1916)
  [<i>Anguish</i>], to the celebration of love as a &laquo;universal
  conciliatory power&raquo;, as in <i>Hj&auml;rtats s&aring;nger</i>
  (1926) [Songs from the Heart].<br>
  <br>
  As a playwright, Lagerkvist has been extremely versatile. While
  <i>Den sv&aring;ra stunden</i> (1918) [<i>The Difficult Hour I,
  II, III</i>] shows the influence of the later Strindberg, plays like <i>Himlens Hemlighet</i>
  (1919) [<i>The Secret of Heaven</i>] echo Tagore and the mystery
  play; <i>Han som fick leva om sitt liv</i> (1928) [He Who Lived
  His Life Over Again], on the other hand, is realistic. His work
  during the thirties was determined by his violent opposition to
  totalitarianism: <i>B&ouml;deln</i> (1933) [<i>The Hangman</i>],
  <i>Mannen utan sj&auml;l</i> (1936) [The Man without a Soul], and
  <i>Seger i m&ouml;rker</i> (1939) [Victory in the
  Darkness].<br>
  <br>
  Lagerkvist increasingly has dealt with the problem of man's
  relation to God, particularly in his three important novels,
  Dv&auml;rgen (1944) [<i>The Dwarf</i>], <i>Barabbas</i> (1950),
  and <i>Sibyllan</i> (1956) [<i>The Sibyl</i>]. Barabbas, the
  story of a &laquo;believer without faith&raquo;, was his first
  truly international success.<br>
  <br>
  In 1940, Lagerkvist was elected to the <a href="/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1951/lagerkvist-bio.html&object=svenskaakademien&to=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/web/en.aspx" target="_blank">Swedish
