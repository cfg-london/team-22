  <h1>Ivo Andric - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="andric.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Ivo Andric</b> was born in the village
  of Dolac, near Travnik, in 1892. After spending his youth in his
  native Bosnia, which was at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian
  Empire, he studied philosophy at the Universities of Zagreb, Vienna, and Cracow.
  His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World
  War, at the beginning of which he was jailed for his
  anti-Austrian activities. After receiving a doctorate in letters
  from the University of Graz in 1923, he entered the Yugoslav
  diplomatic service. The last diplomatic post he held was that of
  Yugoslav minister in Berlin. When Germany invaded Yugoslavia in
  1941, Andric returned to Belgrade and lived there in seclusion
  throughout the Second World War. He has continued to reside in
  the Yugoslav capital.<br>
  <br>
  Andric started his literary career as a poet. In 1914 he was one
  of the contributors to <i>Hrvatska mlada lirika</i> (Young
  Croatian Lyrics). At the end of the war he published two books of
  lyrical prose - one of them entitled <i>Nemiri</i> (Anxieties),
  1919 - which, written in the form of a diary, reflect Andric's
  experiences of the war and his imprisonment. There followed a
  long period in which Andric concentrated on the writing of short
  stories. His first novella, <i>Put Alije Djerzeleza</i> (The Trip
  of Alija Djerzelez), published in 1920, early manifests a
  dominant trait of his creative process. Andric takes his material
  from the life of Bosnia, but through this local material he
  presents universal human problems. In the period between the two
  world wars Andric published three books of short stories under
  the same title, <i>Pripovetke</i> (Stories), 1924, 1931,
  1936.<br>
  <br>
  During the Second World War, in the leisure imposed on him by the
  circumstances, Andric wrote his three large works, all of which
  were published in 1945: <i>Na Drini cuprija</i> (The Bridge on
  the Drina), <i>Travnicka hronika</i> (Bosnian Story), and
  <i>Gospodjica</i> (The Woman from Sarajevo).<br>
  <br>
  The first two of these works - both of them chronicles rather
  than novels in the strict sense - deal, like most of Andric's
  work, with Bosnia and her history. The author describes the life
  of this region in which East and West have for centuries clashed
  with their interests and influences, a region whose population is
  composed of different nationalities and religions. Andric is at
  his best when he limits himself to his native Bosnia and her
  people.<br>
  <br>
  In <i>Gospodjica</i> and <i>Nove pripovetke</i> (New Stories),
  1948, Andric presented present-day people and problems. He dealt
  with the psychology of the wealthy, with the war and postwar
  periods, and with the formation of a new society. But in Prokleta
  avilija (Devil's Yard), 1954, Andric returned to his favorite
  milieu and described the experiences of a Bosnian Franciscan, Fra
  Peter, who is put in an Istanbul jail, being wrongly accused of
  plotting against Ottoman rule. In 1960 Andric published another
  collection of stories, <i>Lica</i> (Faces). He has also written
  several essays, prominent among which is <i>Zapisi o Goji,</i>
  (Notes on Goya), 1961.</p>
