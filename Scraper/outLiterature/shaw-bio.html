  <h1>George Bernard Shaw - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="shaw.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>George Bernard Shaw</b> (1856-1950) was
  born in Dublin, the son of a civil servant. His education was
  irregular, due to his dislike of any organized training. After
  working in an estate agent's office for a while he moved to
  London as a young man (1876), where he established himself as a
  leading music and theatre critic in the eighties and nineties and
  became a prominent member of the Fabian Society, for which he
  composed many pamphlets. He began his literary career as a
  novelist; as a fervent advocate of the new theatre of Ibsen
  (<i>The Quintessence of Ibsenism</i>, 1891) he decided to write
  plays in order to illustrate his criticism of the English stage.
  His earliest dramas were called appropriately <i>Plays Pleasant
  and Unpleasant</i> (1898). Among these, <i>Widower's Houses</i>
  and <i>Mrs. Warren's Profession</i> savagely attack social
  hypocrisy, while in plays such as <i>Arms and the Man</i> and
  <i>The Man of Destiny</i> the criticism is less fierce. Shaw's
  radical rationalism, his utter disregard of conventions, his keen
  dialectic interest and verbal wit often turn the stage into a
  forum of ideas, and nowhere more openly than in the famous
  discourses on the Life Force, &laquo;Don Juan in Hell&raquo;, the
  third act of the dramatization of woman's love chase of man,
  <i>Man and Superman</i> (1903).</p>
  
  <p>In the plays of his later period discussion sometimes drowns the
  drama, in <i>Back to Methuselah</i> (1921), although in the same
  period he worked on his masterpiece <i>Saint Joan</i> (1923), in
  which he rewrites the well-known story of the French maiden and
  extends it from the Middle Ages to the present.</p>
  
  <p>Other important plays by Shaw are <i>Caesar and Cleopatra</i>
  (1901), a historical play filled with allusions to modern times,
  and <i>Androcles and the Lion</i> (1912), in which he exercised a
  kind of retrospective history and from modern movements drew
  deductions for the Christian era. In <i>Major Barbara</i> (1905),
  one of Shaw's most successful &laquo;discussion&raquo; plays, the
  audience's attention is held by the power of the witty
  argumentation that man can achieve aesthetic salvation only
  through political activity, not as an individual. <i>The Doctor's
  Dilemma</i> (1906), facetiously classified as a tragedy by Shaw,
  is really a comedy the humour of which is directed at the medical
  profession. <i>Candida</i> (1898), with social attitudes toward
  sex relations as objects of his satire, and <i>Pygmalion</i>
  (1912), a witty study of phonetics as well as a clever treatment
  of middle-class morality and class distinction, proved some of
  Shaw's greatest successes on the stage. It is a combination of
  the dramatic, the comic, and the social corrective that gives
  Shaw's comedies their special flavour.</p>
  
  <p>Shaw's complete works appeared in thirty-six volumes between 1930
  and 1950, the year of his death.</p>
