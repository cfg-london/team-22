  <h1>Halld&oacute;r Laxness - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="laxness.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Halld&oacute;r Kiljan Laxness</b> was born
  in 1902 in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, but spent his youth
  in the country. From the age of seventeen on, he travelled and
  lived abroad, chiefly on the European continent. He was
  influenced by expressionism and other modern currents in Germany
  and France. In the mid-twenties he was converted to Catholicism;
  his spiritual experiences are reflected in several books of an
  autobiographical nature, chiefly <i>Undir Helgahn&uacute;k</i>
  (Under the Holy Mountain), 1924. In 1927, he published his first
  important novel, <em>Vefarinn mikli fr&aacute; Kasm&iacute;r</em> (The Great
  Weaver from Kashmir). Laxness's religious period did not last
  long; during a visit to America he became attracted to socialism. <em>Al&thorn;ydub&oacute;kin</em> (The Book of the People), 1929, is
  evidence of a change toward a socialist outlook. In 1930, Laxness
  settled in Iceland.<br>

  Laxness's main achievement consists of three novel cycles written
  during the thirties, dealing with the people of Iceland. <i><em>&THORN;&uacute; v&iacute;nvi&eth;ur hreini</em>,</i> 1931, and <i>Fuglinn &iacute;
    fj&ouml;runni,</i> 1932, (both translated as Salka Valka), tell
  the story of a poor fisher girl; <em>Sj&aacute;lfst&aelig;tt f&oacute;lk</em> (Independent People), 1934-35, treats the fortunes of small
  farmers, whereas the tetralogy <i>Lj&oacute;s heimsins</i> (The
  Light of the World), 1937-40, has as its hero an Icelandic folk
  poet. Laxness's later works are frequently historical and
  influenced by the saga tradition: <em>&Iacute;slandsklukkan</em> (The Bell
  of Iceland), 1943-46, <i>Gerpla</i> (The Happy Warriors), 1952,
  and <i>Parad&iacute;sarheimt</i> (Paradise Reclaimed), 1960.
  Laxness is also the author of the topical and sharply polemical <i>At&oacute;mst&ouml;<em>&eth;</em>in</i> (The Atom Station), 1948.</p>
