  <h1>Henryk Sienkiewicz - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="sienkiewicz.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Henryk Sienkiewicz</b>
  (1846-1916), the most outstanding and prolific Polish writer of
  the second half of the nineteenth century, was born in Wola
  Okrzejska, in the Russian part of Poland. His father's family was
  actively engaged in the revolutionary struggles for Polish
  independence, which accounts for the strong patriotic element in
  Sienkiewicz' work. Historical scholarship on the other hand ran
  in his mother's family.</p>

  <p>Sienkiewicz studied in Warsaw, but without any visible results.
  His talent as a writer was soon discovered. His early works are
  satirical sketches, betraying a strong social conscience. He made
  a trip to America in 1876 and travelled as far as California. His
  impressions were published in Polish newspapers and received very
  favourably. His travels provided him with material for several
  works, among them the brilliant short story <i>Latarnik</i>
  (1882) [<i>The Lighthouse Keeper</i>].</p>
  
  <p>After his return to Poland, Sienkiewicz devoted himself to
  historical studies, the result of which was his great trilogy
  about Poland in the midseventeenth century. <i>Ogniem i
  mieczem</i> [<i>With Fire and Sword</i>], <i>Potop</i> [<i>The
  Deluge</i>] and <i>Pan Wolodyjowski</i> [<i>Pan Michael</i>] were
  published in 1884, 1886, and 1888 respectively. The historical
  novels were followed by works on contemporary subjects: <i>Bez
  dogmatu</i> (1891) [<i>Without Dogma</i>], a psychological study
  of a sophisticated decadent man, and <i>Rodzina Polanieckich</i>
  (1894) [<i>Children of the Soil</i>], a peasant novel. In 1895
  Sienkiewicz published his greatest success, <i>Quo Vadis</i>, a
  novel of Christian persecutions at the time of Nero.</p>

  <p>In his later novels he returned again to historical subjects.
  <i>Krzyzacy</i> (1900) deals with a period of medieval history,
  the victory of the Poles over the Teutonic Knights; <i>Na polu
  chwaly</i> ( 1906) [<i>On the Field of Glory</i>] is a sequel to
  his seventeenth-century trilogy. His last works <i>Wiry</i>
  (1910) [<i>Whirlpools</i>] and <i>W pustyni i w puszczy</i>
  (1912) [<i>In Desert and Wilderness</i>] again deal with
  contemporary subjects.</p>
  
  <p>Sienkiewicz was immensely popular. In 1900, a national
  subscription raised enough funds to buy for him the castle in
  which his ancestors had lived. The complete edition of his works,
  published 1948-55, runs to sixty volumes.</p>
