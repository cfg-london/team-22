  <h1>Derek Walcott - Biographical</h1>

<p><img src="walcott.jpg" class="bio-img"><b>Derek Walcott</b> was born in 1930 in
  the town of Castries in Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands
  in the Lesser Antilles. The experience of growing up on the
  isolated volcanic island, an ex-British colony, has had a strong
  influence on Walcott's life and work. Both his grandmothers were
  said to have been the descendants of slaves. His father, a
  Bohemian watercolourist, died when Derek and his twin brother,
  Roderick, were only a few years old. His mother ran the town's
  Methodist school. After studying at St. Mary's College in his
  native island and at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica,
  Walcott moved in 1953 to Trinidad, where he has worked as theatre
  and art critic. At the age of 18, he made his debut with <i>25
  Poems</i>, but his breakthrough came with the collection of
  poems, <i>In a Green Night</i> (1962). In 1959, he founded the
  Trinidad Theatre Workshop which produced many of his early
  plays.</p>

  <p>Walcott has been an assiduous traveller to
  other countries but has always, not least in his efforts to
  create an indigenous drama, felt himself deeply-rooted in
  Caribbean society with its cultural fusion of African, Asiatic
  and European elements. For many years, he has divided his time
  between Trinidad, where he has his home as a writer, and Boston University, where
  he teaches literature and creative writing.</p>
