## Question and Answers
### Q: Would you like the solution to broaden the demographic or focus on the current demographic?
A: That age range is what we get from the sites statistics. A lot of young people doing research on projects. Trying to broaden the age group a little more. Make it more global. 

### Q: Any plans to make it multilingual
A: No. We have **international events**, thus we have a local website (in that language) to cater to that demographic. Somethings will be in Swedish or norweigen. Lit prize may be in a different language.

### Q: What is a typical user interaction with the webiste?
A: Majority go **directly to a laureate**, then leave. Very high bounce rate. Bounce rate is a bit too high (> 70%). We want people to explore more. Very text heavy so it is difficult to see the cool stuff. Games make people stay more. "We need to find other ways aside from the games."

### Q: Is there a regular newsletter?
A: We do. But not very high prioritized. Raising it as a priority is not a major focus. 

### Q: What data do you get?
A: A bunch of stuff. Cheeck the website for details.

### Q: Do we get any other data?
A: Link data. 

### Q: How do you keep data format updatability?
A: I dunno. Ask the other dude that codes and stuff. 

### Q: What kind of games?
A: Educational games - 'Blood typing game'. A lot of other sites drag a lot of traffic to those games (used in school).

### Q: How much text-based and other multimedia data do you have?
A: A stuff ton of videos. Podcasts (maybe in videos). Each laureate has a nobel lecture. Biographies. Outside articles. They have people write and explain the discoveries. Most videos are transcribed.

### Q: What don't you want?
A: Make an app that answers the question: "Ask the question which laureate are you?". That sucks. Don't do that. **We don't just want a geography based solution**. Nationality can be affiliated with a specific university or a citizen in another country. How do we link them?

### Q: Are you looking for an extension to previous site? Or a new thing altogether?
A: Either works. Incorporate some sort of behaviour for a user that helps them that lets them access the site. Maybe a new list or new search type thing. LMAO.

### Q: How important is social interaction to the challenge?
A: Lovely if it is included. But not super important. **Interaction** is more important. 

### Q: Can we edit the video or content?
A: No.

### Q: How do people find the website?
A: Google, and other stuff (Bing?). Social is not a major factor. It would be awesome if we could improve the SE ranking. 

### Q: Are you more interested in bringing outside people? Retaining people?
A: "Do I have to choose?". We'd like to improve the experience of those existing searchers. **REDUCE BOUNCE RATE**. Improve the usability of current users. 

### Q: Why does your search engine suck?
A: We don't have stats. It just doesn't seem to be inviting. 50% of users use internal search.

### Q: What other analytical data are you looking for?
A: Measuring engagement on the site. We have numbers, but no conversion rates and stuff. How do we define "engangement"? But "engagement rate" is something that we really want to improve on. Poll and quizes are pretty popular. Announcements are a big peak in user-rate (October).

### Q: Do you want the new site to have better stats?
A: Yeah sure, have the rates outlined above. So yeah no stuff. 

### Q: Tell us about your new site.
A: We're in wireframing. So... no new information. Oh stuff, we're at an article level. That's all we're at. LMAO. Looking at goals and target groups. We want: long scroll, modular components, more flexible in moving content, section for events, and new brand design. A lot of focus is on the archive (trending), everything else not so much traffic. WE WANT MOAR PHOTOS AND STUFF! 

### Q: ????
A: Certain laureates have a lot more traffic then others. Thus focusing some content on them. Women laureates is a good point. A lot of focus there.

### Q: Are there any interactive designs that keep them longer during peak periods?
A: No. Plan for no announcements.

## SECRET STUFF
